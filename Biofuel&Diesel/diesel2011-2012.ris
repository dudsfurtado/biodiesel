AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative and renewable fuel made from plant and animal fat or cooked oil through a transesterification process to produce a short chain ester (generally methyl ester). Biodiesel fuels have been worldwide studied in Diesel engines and they were found to be compatible in blends with Diesel fuel to well operate in modern Common Rail engines. Also throughout the world the diffusion of biofuels is being promoted in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the environmental impact of transport, and to increase security of supply. To meet the current exhaust emission regulations, after-treatment devices are necessary; in particular Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs) are essential to reduce particulate emissions of Diesel engines. A critical requirement for the implementation of DPF on a modern Biodiesel powered engine is the determination of Break-even Temperature (BET) which is defined as the temperature at which particulate deposition on the filter is balanced by particulate oxidation on the filter. To fit within the exhaust temperature range of the exhaust line and to require a minimum of active regeneration during the engine running, the BET needs to occur at sufficiently low temperatures. In this paper, the results of an experimental campaign on a modern, electronic controlled fuel injection Diesel engine are shown. The engine was fuelled either with petroleum ultralow sulphur fuel or with Biodiesel: BET was evaluated for both fuels. Results show that on average, the BET is lower for biodiesel than for diesel fuel. The final goal was to characterize the regeneration process of the DPF device depending on the adopted fuel, taking into account the different combustion process and the different nature of the particulate matter. Overall the results suggest significant benefits for the use of biodiesel in engines equipped with DPFs. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Titanosilicates with 3D-wormhole-like mesoporosity were used as support for hydroprocessing catalysts to increase the triglyceride (jatropha oil) deoxygenation and cracking activity of sulfided Ni-Mo and Co-Mo catalysts. Mesoporous titanosilicate supported Co-Mo catalyst showed improved performance in terms of higher yield of kerosene (jet-fuel) range hydrocarbons, 5-times more isomerized product and slightly improved activity than the traditional alumina supported catalyst. Higher acidity, better metal dispersion and favorable metal-support interactions could be attributed to the improved performance of the former. Among the mesoporous titanosilicate supported catalysts, sulfided Ni-Mo was more active than the Co-Mo catalyst (at lower temperature, 300 °C, 4-8 h-1) but with high selectivity for oligomeric products. But at higher temperatures the Co-Mo catalytic system showed comparable activities with increased yield of cracked products and the heavy range fraction. Response surface plots indicated that there was a combined effect of space velocity and temperature on the conversion at lower temperatures (300 °C), which was less prominent at higher temperatures (&gt;330 °C). Kinetic model fitting results at lower temperatures (300-320 °C) indicated direct conversion of triglycerides to deoxygenated products along with oligomeric and cracked products formation with no internal conversions between the products indicated. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - High-speed gas sampling experiments to measure the intermediate products formed during fuel decomposition remain challenging yet important experimental objectives. This article presents new speciation data on two important fuel reference compounds, n-heptane and n-butanol, at practical thermodynamic conditions of 700 K and 9 atm, for stoichiometric fuel-to-oxygen ratios and a dilution of 5.64 (molar ratio of inert gases to O2), and at two blend ratios, 80%-20% and 50%-50% by mole of n-heptane and n-butanol, respectively. When compared against 100% n-heptane ignition results, the experimental data show that n-butanol slows the reactivity of n-heptane. In addition, speciation results of n-butanol concentrations show that n-heptane causes n-butanol to react at temperatures where n-butanol in isolation would not be considered reactive. The chemical kinetic mechanism developed for this work accurately predicts the trends observed for species such as carbon monoxide, methane, propane, 1-butene, and others. However, the mechanism predicts a higher amount of n-heptane consumed at the first stage of ignition compared to the experimental data. Consequently, many of the species concentration predictions show a sharp rise at the first stage of ignition, a trend that is not observed experimentally. An important discovery is that the presence of n-butanol reduces the measured concentrations of the large linear alkenes, including heptenes, hexenes, and pentenes, showing that the addition of n-butanol affects the fundamental chemical pathways of n-heptane during ignition. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Pure sunflower oil was hydrotreated (T = 633 K, P = 5 MPa) aiming the production of a biofuel in the diesel range using β-Mo2C/Al 2O3 as catalyst. The catalyst was synthesized in situ using the temperature-programmed carburization (TPC) methodology with a 20% (v/v) CH4/H2 gas mixture and 923 K/2 h as synthesis temperature. The catalytic evaluation results indicate that for the employed conditions n-C18 was the major product. The association of the results of the experiments without (blank) and with catalyst suggests that the overall triglyceride transformation into linear alkanes proceeds in two steps: (i) thermal cracking of the triglyceride forming free fatty acids and (ii) hydrogenation of the double bonds and of the carboxylic group of the free fatty acid forming n-alkanes. No CO and/or CO2 formation were detected implying that decarbonylation and/or decarboxylation routes do not play an important role when molybdenum carbide is used, contrarily to what is commonly observed when supported Co-Mo or Ni-Mo sulfides are employed as catalysts. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Direct addition of bioethanol to diesel reduces the quality of commercial blends. An alternative way to introduce bioethanol into diesel is as linear ether such as ethyl octyl ether (EOE). EOE synthesis by 1-octanol (OcOH) reaction with ethanol (EtOH) or diethyl carbonate (DEC) over acidic ion-exchange resins has been studied in a 100-mL batch reactor (130-150 °C, 25 bar). The main drawback for ethylating OcOH in both reaction systems is the loss of ethyl groups by diethyl ether formation. In OcOH excess, selectivity to EOE with respect to EtOH and to DEC was found to be similar (58-59%) when the ethylating agent was entirely consumed. However, the initial reaction rate of EOE formation from DEC is lower, due to the formation of ethyl octyl carbonate as reaction intermediate. Accordingly, EtOH showed to be more interesting ethylating agent to produce a synthetic biofuel such as EOE over acidic ion-exchange resins. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Azadirachta indica A.Juss (neem) is a tropical tree, popular for its multiple possible uses. The oil extracted from neem kernels is used in cosmetics, as medicines, as insecticides and for energy needs (biofuel). The oldest oil extraction method is cold pressing. However, the optimal parameters of extraction and the quality of extracted oil are poorly known. The purpose of this research was to identify the optimal extracting parameters of neem oil by cold pressing and to characterize the extracted oil. The results showed that at 25 °C, the optimum yield by pressing of whole kernels was obtained with a pressure of 30.4 MPa ± 4.1 and a maximum degree of filling of the pressing cage. We showed that maintaining this pressure for 6 min could lead to an extraction rate of 40.1% ± 1.1. The oil yield increased with the speed of kernel compression. Reducing the particle size had a positive effect on oil yield when the cage load did not exceed half of the cage capacity. The best oil yield of 40.3% ± 0.0 for ground kernels was obtained with a pressure of 33.7 MPa ± 2.9 and a cage filled in the quarter of its capacity. The content levels of water, iron, copper and phosphorus in the oil extracted by pressing were respectively 0.14%; 11.8; 0.1 and 17 ppm. These characteristics indicate, inter alia, that neem oil obtained by cold pressing is of appropriate quality for use in biodiesel production.

AB  - Crude glycerol, the main by-product of the biodiesel industry, is a material containing compounds considered recalcitrant to microorganisms. The aims of this study were to determine the anaerobic biodegradability and the methane production potential (MPP) of different crude glycerols generated from the transesterification of oils from several kinds of seeds and/or beans, and the anaerobic toxicity of crude glycerol obtained from a mixture of soybean and cottonseed oils. All tests were based on specific methanogenic activity assays (SMA). The biodegradability tests and the MPP assays lasted 30 days. Toxicity was evaluated through the statistical technique of factorial design and a response surface was generated in which the concentrations of crude glycerol and glucose were the independent variables and SMA was the dependent variable. The results showed that the type of seed or bean, as well as the transesterification process, affected the anaerobic biodegradability. Biodegradability ranged between 65.9 and 85.6% and MPP, between 0.220 and 0.322 m3 CH 4/kg crude glycerol. The toxicity test showed that crude glycerol was not toxic to anaerobic sludge. © IWA Publishing 2012.

AB  - Due to the concern on the accessibility of recoverable fossil fuel reserves and their environmental problem creates a considerable attention has been given to biodiesel production as an alternative to petro diesel. The two most common types of biofuels are ethanol and biodiesel. However, as the biodiesel is obtained from vegetable oils and animal fats, which is a major concern, that biodiesel feedstock may compete with food supply in the perennial-term. Hence, the current objective is to find oil bearing plants that produce non-edible oils as the feedstock for biodiesel production. In this project, plant species, CITRONELLA is discussed as newer sources of oil for biodiesel production. Citronella oil is obtained from the leaves and stems of different species of Cymbopogon. Citronella oil is extracted from Cymbopogonnardus (also known as Andropogonnardus) and is of the Graminae (Poaceae) family. It is also known as Sri Lanka or Lenabatu citronella. This study focused on the Citronella oil based bio diesel which is important renewable and alternative fuel in future. Citronella oil is used as an input for biodiesel production via transesterification. Diesel fuel is much employed moreover than any other gasoline fuels. Due to diesel engines have many adaptable domestic uses like small irrigation water plumbing systems, light weight four/two seated auto cab & car engine small electricity generators etc. Citronella biodiesel fuel properties are observed and the experimental tests been carried out with standard procedure. Then an experimental set up is construct to study the performance of a small Kirloskar Diesel in the internal combustion engine by using different blends of Citronella Oil based biodiesel under different Operation Conditions. The primitive objective is to determine the optimum performance of this citronella biodiesel. NOx emission from the test engine can be measured by chemical luminescent detector type NOx analyzer. © IDOSI Publications, 2012.

AB  - This study investigated production of biodiesel from oil seeds of Jatropha curcas, obtained in Nigeria, with a view to encouraging the cultivation of Jatropha plant in Nigeria and to providing a motivation for the development of biodiesel production from this feedstock. Also effect of oil-to-alcohol molar ratio on the biodiesel production from Nigerian Jatropha curcas seeds oil was investigated with a view to confirming established base case. A maximum yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) of 87% was obtained at 333 Kelvin, oil-to-alcohol molar ratio of 1:6 and at 1wt% NaOH catalyst concentration. The physical properties of the BD obtained from Nigerian Jatropha oil met the ASTM standard of D-6751. Consequently, this study reveals that Jatropha curcas, an economically invaluable plant in Nigeria, could be a good feedstock for biodiesel production in Nigeria.

AB  - This work composed with performance and emission studies of three stationary diesel engines operated with 20% cardanol biofuel volumetric blends. A single cylinder diesel engine and VCR engines were used to evaluate theperformance and emission characteristics of cardanol biofuel. An extended experimental study was conducted on a double cylinder CI engine, to evaluate the performance and emission characteristics. The cardanol biofuel volumetric blends between 0-25% and base fuel (Petro diesel) were tested at various loads between 0-full load. From the results, brake thermal efficiency, increased with increase in load. The brake specific energy consumption decreased by 30 to 40% with increase in brake power. The HC emissions were nominal up to B20, and more at B25. The NOx emissions (ppm) increased with increased proportion of blends. The carbon monoxide emissions increased with higher blends and decreased slightly at higher loads. From this investigation, it is observed that up to 20% blends of cardanol biofuels may be used in CI engines without any modifications.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable alternative fuel that produces lower exhaust emissions with the exception of nitrogen oxides (NOx) when compared to conventional diesel fuel. Fuel blend information is useful during engine operation for optimizing emissions and performance. Therefore, online estimation of biofuel content is a critical step in allowing diesel engines to maintain performance while simultaneously meeting emission requirements when operating on biodiesel blends. Presented in this paper is a model-based biodiesel blend estimation strategies using crankshaft torsionals. A sensitivity analysis investigation is conducted for the method to quantify robustness of the proposed fuel blend estimation methods. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.

AB  - Biofuels are wide range of fuels which are derived from biomass. Biofuels are gaining increases public and scientific attention. Marine algae also known as seaweed are the multicellular plants having potential role in biodiesel production. In this study, Chaetomorpha antennina and Gracilaria corticata were collected from Covelong (East coast of Tamil Nadu) and their diesel content was estimated using different solvent system. Among these species, Chaetomorpha antennina with chloroform-ethanol system produced more diesel content (2.4ml/10gm) than Chaetomorpha antennina with chloroform-methanol solvent system (2.1ml/10gm). Similarly Gracilaria corticata with hexane-ether solvent system produced more biodiesel (2ml/10gm) than Gracilaria corticata with benzene solvent (1.8ml/10gm). The formation of fatty acids of methyl and ethyl esters were also analyzed by GC-MS. GC-MS analysis revealed that the formation of methyl esters was more than the formation of ethyl ester.

AB  - Ethanol is increasingly popular as fuel. It is renewable, cleaner than gasoline, and during the 2008 oil price peak, its costs of production without subsidies actually rivalled those of gasoline. The fuel grade ethanol producers are large consumers of stainless steel, in particular for cookers, fermentation tanks, and distillation columns as well as storage tanks for the finished product. The main reason is that cleanliness is important for the enzymes. However, contaminants play an important role in production as well as storage and distribution. Contaminants are causing a phenomenon called stress corrosion cracking. Biodiesel fuel is a mixture of fatty acid alcohol esters. Modern diesel engines are very sensitive to fuel quality and purity. Biodiesel is unstable, just like butter, which is going rancid in a matter of weeks. Biodiesel degradation is an oxidation process, which among others is speeded up by tiny amounts of metal ions leaching from production and storage vessels. Biodiesel vessels need to be designed in non-degradable materials of construction, as stainless steel. In addition, pretreatment of low cost feedstock and methyl recycling operations use strong acids, which also necessitate stainless steels. Biomass is gaining importance as a source for renewable fuels and hydrogen in addition to heat and electricity. Corrosion issues are numerous and include high temperature corrosion under ash and alkali salt deposits and metal dusting at gasification. Fuel grade ethanol, biodiesel and biomass represent three different corrosion issues, which can be solved using the correct stainless steel. © 2010 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

AB  - Algal feedstock is the foundation of the emerging algal biofuel industry. However, few algae found in nature have demonstrated the combination of high biomass accumulation rate, robust oil yield and tolerance to environmental stresses, all complex traits that a large-scale, economically competitive production scheme demands. Therefore, untangling the intricate sub-cellular networks underlying these complex traits, in one or a series of carefully selected algal research models, has become an urgent research mission, which can take advantage of the emerging model oleaginous microalgae that have already demonstrated small, simple and tackleable genomes and the potential for large-scale open-pond cultivation. The revolutions in whole-genome-based technologies, coupled with systems biology, metabolic engineering and synthetic biology approaches, would enable the rational design and engineering of algal feedstock and help to fill the gaps between the technical and economical reality and the enormous potential of algal biofuels. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.

AB  - Hydrolytic enzymes were evaluated on the lipid accumulation via an oleaginous fungal species, Mortierella isabellina, cultivated on sugars released from soybean hulls. The weight loss of soybean hull, fungal growth, and lipid production were tested under different loads of hydrolytic enzymes. M. isabellina could not directly utilize cellulose and adding cellulase and β-glucosidase significantly increased the cell growth and oil accumulation of M. isabellina on soybean hulls. The highest weight loss of soybean hulls was 47.80 % and the lipid production reached 0.14 g from 1 g of soybean hull when 12 U cellulase, 27.2 U β-glucosidase, 2,278.56 U pectinase, and 15 U hemicellulase were added. Fatty acids (76.82 %) accumulated in M. isabellina were C16 and C18, which are suitable for biodiesel production. These results provide a new application for soybean hulls to be applied as the raw material for the production of biodiesel fuel, besides its traditional role as animal feed supplements. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Depletion of petroleum based fuel turns the world's focus in to finding a new alternative in which biodiesel took major attention. Biodiesel is produced from various sources like waste vegetable oil, animal fat, grease etc. In this, macro algae Cladophora vagabunda was studied with different solvent systems such as isopropanol and chloroform-methanol for better yield of biodiesel. Among these solvent system, chloform-methanol solvent system produced more biodiesel(3.3ml/10gm) than isopropanol solvent system (2.6ml/10gm). Since Cladophora vagabunda with chloform-methanol solvent system produced more biodiesel its esters of fatty acid content was analyzed by using Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometer. The results showed that the presence of ethyl palmitate as the dominant ester with percentage composition of 9.36% than methyl palmitate 9.18%. But the overall percentage of methyl ester compound was found to be more (21.66%) than ethyl ester (14.97%). The major fatty acid compounds were also analyzed. These include myristic acid (1.93%), linolenic acid (0.60%) and palmitic acid (9.18%).

AB  - This article outlines issues to be tackled when considering increases in biofuel usage in the European Union (EU) and examines a potential scheme to increase the use of biofuels in the road transport sector; the development of biofuels corridors. An EU biofuels corridor is defined as a long-distance and cross-border route on the Trans-European Transport (TEN-T) Network roads on which blends with a high biofuel content (referred to as high blends) are offered at regular intervals along the entire route. The article first defines the current framework of EU biofuels development. A case study on the feasibility of one possible EU biofuels corridor, from Rotterdam, Netherlands, to Constanta, Romania, is analyzed along four potential biofuels corridor designs (under different future scenarios). The case study includes interviews with key stakeholders, transport flows analysis, refueling infrastructure, and biofuels policy in the relevant member states. The results are extrapolated to the complete EU level in order to assess the potential effect of the biofuels corridor approach as a measure of stimulating the use of biofuels. It is concluded that EU biofuels corridors can increase the use of biofuels. However, if applied as a stand-alone measure a maximum contribution is limited. The effectiveness of biofuels corridors is not larger mainly due to the fact that the transport flows on the TEN-T Network roads are not representative of actual fuel sales at stations on this network (i.e., motorway stations). In addition, various recommendations are made for further research. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - One of the most important renewable resources of energy nowadays is biofuel. Biofuels can be defined as solid, liquid, or gas fuel derived from recently dead biological material which differ it from fossil fuels. They are categorised into two types: biofuels that are produced from agriculture products including crops, plants and current forests. Agriculture sources produce two main products: ethanol and biodiesel, but we study only biodiesel. The aim of this work is production of biodiesel extracted from natural vegetables oil: soybean and sunflower oils, by the process of transesterification, under laboratory conditions. Biodiesel is a diesel-type fuel made by separating glycerin from vegetable oil to create methyl esters. In this process, the alkoxy group of an ester compound is exchanged with another alcohol. These reactions are often catalysed by the addition of an acid or base. In this study we used methyl alcohol and potassium hydroxide. Biodiesel is produced in pure form (100% biodiesel or B100), and is blended with petrodiesel, 6% (B6) and 10% (B10). These analyses are made at the Organic Chemistry and Technology Laboratory, and we will continue for further analyses with different vegetable oils.

AB  - This paper presents the work on detailed characterization of effervescent spray of Jatropha and Pongamia pure plant oils. The spray characteristics of these biofuels are compared with those of diesel. Both macroscopic and microscopic spray characteristics at different injection pressures and gas-to-liquid ratio (GLR) have been studied. The particle/droplet imaging analysis (PDIA) technique along with direct imaging methods are used for the purpose of spray characterization. Due to their higher viscosity, pure plant oils showed poor atomization compared to diesel and a blend of diesel and pure plant oil at a given GLR. Pure plant oil sprays showed a lower spray cone angle when compared to diesel and blends at lower GLRs. However, the difference is not significant at higher GLRs. Droplet size measurements at 100 mm downstream of the exit orifice showed reduction in Sauter mean diameter (SMD) diameter with increase in GLR. A radial variation in the SMD is observed for the blend and pure plant oils. Pure oils showed a larger variation when compared to the blend. Spray unsteadiness has been characterized based on the image-to-image variation in the mean droplet diameter and fluctuations in the spray cone angle. Results showed that pure plant oil sprays are more unsteady at lower GLRs when compared to diesel and blend. A critical GLR is identified at which the spray becomes steady. The three regimes of spray operation, namely "steady spray," "pulsating spray," and "spray and unbroken liquid jet" are identified in the injection pressure-GLR parameter space for these pure plant oils. Two-phase flow imaging inside the exit orifice shows that for the pure plant oils, the flow is highly transient at low GLRs and the bubbly, slug, and annular two-phase flow regimes are all observed. However, at higher GLRs where the spray is steady, only the annular flow regime is observed. © 2012 by Begell House, Inc.

AB  - This study updates the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for soybean biodiesel with revised system boundaries and the inclusion of indirect land use change using the most current set of agricultural data. The updated results showed that life cycle GHG emission from biodiesel use was reduced by 81.2% compared to 2005 baseline diesel. When the impacts of lime application and soil N2O emissions were excluded for more direct comparison with prior results published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the reduction was 85.4%. This is a significant improvement over the 78.5% GHG reduction reported in the NREL study. Agricultural lime accounted for 50.6% of GHG from all agricultural inputs. Soil N2O accounted for 18.0% of total agricultural emissions. The improvement in overall GHG reduction was primarily due to lower agricultural energy usage and improved soybean crushing facilities. This study found that soybean meal and oil price data from the past ten years had a significant positive correlation (R2 = 0.73); hence, it is argued that soybean meal and oil are both responsible for indirect land use change from increased soybean demand. It is concluded that when there is a strong price correlation among co-products, system boundary expansion without a proper co-product allocation for indirect land use change produces erroneous results. When the emissions associated with predicted indirect land use change were allocated and incorporated using U.S. EPA model data, the GHG reduction for biodiesel was 76.4% lower than 2005 baseline diesel. © 2012 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the optimum amplitude and frequency of operation for the rotary shaker drum of an experimental canopy shaker used for harvesting Jatropha curcas L. A constrained optimization technique that required the removal of yellow and brown fruits to be as high as possible and the removal of green fruits to be as low as possible was used to determine the optimum operating parameters. The optimum operating condition that retained 90% of the green fruits on the plant was found to be an amplitude of 7.2 cm (2.9 in.) and a frequency of 2.4 Hz. The removal efficiencies for yellow and brown fruits were found to be 75.8% and 80.2%, respectively, for this operating condition. When the objective function of the optimization procedure was changed to limit the amount of green fruits harvested to be no more than 10% of the total fruits harvested to ensure oil quality, the optimum operating parameters were found to be an amplitude of 8.0 cm (3.2 in.) and a frequency of 3.2 Hz for the shaker drum. The removal efficiencies for the yellow and brown fruits for this operating condition were 83% and 89%, respectively. An evaluation of plant damage revealed that no serious damage occurred to Jatropha curcas L. plants when the vibratory shaker drum was operated even under aggressive harvesting conditions that involved an amplitude of 7.6 cm and a frequency of 5.0 Hz. © 2012 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Adding bio-fuels to pure diesel may reduce the environmental harming but on other hand, the performance of the combustion would influence. The aim of this study is to present an investigation results on the effects of sunflower oil blend to pure diesel on the performance of single cylinder compression ignition engine. Three mixtures included sunflower oil/diesel ratios of 5:95, 8:92 and 11:89 in addition to pure diesels as a base, were tested. The experimental tests were carried out by using four stroke engine with a single-cylinder and 21:1 compression ratio. The engine performance was measured at various operating conditions. The results indicated that when sunflower-diesel fuel mixture used, the brake power of the engine slightly decreased while, the brake thermal efficiency showed decrease compared with diesel fuel. At the same time, it was found that break specific fuel consumption also increased compared with the pure diesel fuel. The exhaust gas temperature was decreased compared with the case of using pure diesel fuel. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

AB  - The search for alternative energy production and supply, allow a new perspective on the biofuels industry as bioethanol, the focus of this work, as an alternative energy that enables to overcome the disadvantages generated by the traditional methods of production and consumption, by generating competitive advantages over other primary energy sources. The evaluation of the bioethanol industry from a global analysis such as that posed by the Marketing Mix, and exposed how attractive or competitive can become your industry today. It is certainly of great importance to note the challenge facing today's society while trying to maintain a high standard of living without this represents a danger to the environment or to human welfare. The main challenge lies in finding alternatives that allow eco-logical and economic energy needs through the efficient use of alternative sources, and in turn, reduce extreme dependence and vulnerability to fossil fuels.

AB  - Ethanol and biodiesel are considered as two kinds of promising candidate for fossil fuels. Some pretty good combustion characteristics were found in a recent study about the mixture droplet of ethanol, diesel and biodiesel. However, the theoretical studies are still rather limited for this kind of three component droplet with quite different volatile characteristics. The vaporization model is developed to describe the multicomponent droplet vaporization process, with detailed sub-model of gas phase, liquid phase and phase change. With the model, the vaporization of ethanol, diesel and biodiesel is simulated and analyzed, the temperature and concentration of each piece in the droplet during the vaporization are also obtained.

AB  - To meet the increasing demand for energy, development of alternative and renewable energy sources, such as bioenergy, has accelerated during the last decade. In this context, biofuels are one potential replacement for fossil fuels, although their impact on the environment has not been widely studied. Only a few studies are available on toxicity of biofuels and biofuel combustion. Furthermore, for a complete understanding of the environmental impact, the entire life cycle of a biofuel has to be analyzed. This study is an exemplary ecotoxicological investigation of a biomass-to-biofuel production process with respect to the generation of environmentally relevant contaminants either by means of biomass pretreatment or microbial activity. Our aim is the demonstration of the suitability of ecotoxicological biotests as part of a comprehensive hazard assessment of biofuels and related samples or processes. Five ecotoxicological endpoints were assayed to determine the impact of four different biomass pretreatments on process substrates and effluent toxicities. Four different test organisms (bacterium, yeast, fish cell line, and fish embryo) from different trophic levels as well as a combination of acute and mechanism-specific biotests were applied to strengthen the ecotoxicological relevance of this investigation. Biotest results revealed cytotoxic, acute embryotoxic and mutagenic effectiveness, and weak estrogenic activity, with biomass toxicity depending on the mechanism of substrate pretreatment. Open microbial communities (reactor microbiomes) involved in the production process decreased the toxicity considerably to levels of the product n-butyric acid due to degradation of inhibiting by-products, verifying their simultaneous biomass conversion and detoxification potential. Our results demonstrate that ecotoxicological biotests are useful tools for the biofuel industries to gain environmental friendliness as a selling point. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

AB  - In this study, we first develop an integrated strategy for the catalytic conversion of lignocellulose into liquid fuels based on the production of levulinic acid (LA) followed by its hydrogenation to γ-valerolactone (GVL). Our integrated strategy involves a novel catalytic conversion process employing alkylphenol-based separation to extract LA from the sulfuric acid containing aqueous solution following the sulfuric acid catalyzed deconstruction of cellulose. To minimize utility consumption, we perform heat integration, while the remaining heating requirement is satisfied by the combustion of residual biomass. Hot combustion gases are also used to generate electricity, which meets the electricity requirement of the process, while the excess electricity is sold to the grid. We perform a technoeconomic analysis for the alkylphenol-based strategy and compare its economics with a previously reported strategy, in which butyl acetate was used as an extractive solvent to separate GVL from sulfuric acid following the LA hydrogenation step. With some improvements in the process configuration, the alkylphenol strategy leads to a minimum selling price (MSP) of $4.40 per gallon of gasoline equivalent (GGE) for compatible biofuel components, whereas the butyl acetate strategy leads to a MSP of $4.68 per GGE. We show that the alkylphenol strategy becomes a significantly better choice when the catalyst lifetime for the hydrogenation of LA becomes less than 6 months. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

AB  - Biodiesel production by enzymatic catalysis has been the subject of much research for developing processes that can potentially compete with other types of catalysis. The objective of this paper was to study the variables that affect the transesterification of coconut oil in biodiesel production using immobilized enzymes as catalysts and ethanol. The transesterification reactions were carried out in closed glass reactors kept under agitation at 200 rpm and catalyzed by the commercial immobilized lipase Novozym 435. An experimental design with the variables: temperature (40-60 °C), enzyme concentration (3-7%) and oil:ethanol ratio (1:6-1:10) was carried out. The best result - 80.5% conversion - was achieved with the highest temperature, molar ratio and enzyme concentration. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is the fatty acid alkyl esters produced by the transesterification of vegetable, animal or microbial lipids. After ethanol, it accounts for the largest proportion of global biofuel production. Yet, due to the level of polyunsaturation, biodiesel is also oxidatively unstable. When biodiesel oxidises the viscosity increases, which leads to reduced fuel performance and in extreme cases can lead to engine failure. To aid in understanding the process of this degradation a specialist NMR tube rig was designed to assess the oxidation of biodiesel. The NMR tube rig allowed the in situ 1H NMR measurement of the sample while air was bubbled through at fixed intervals. The methyl esters of linolenic acid (18:3), linoleic acid (18:2) and oleic acid (18:1) were oxidised at 110 °C over a 24 h period. The decomposition of biodiesel is complex, and there is more than one mechanism involved in the degradation. Using this rig the onset of oxidation for 18:3 and 18:2 was found to be almost instantaneous. The rate of oxidation was found to be slightly less for 18:2 than 18:3 while the maximum rate was observed for 18:3 from the beginning of the oxidation, this was only observed after 280 min for 18:2. The oxidation of 18:1 started at approximately 500 min and, slowly degraded during the remaining reaction time. The formation of a number of secondary oxidation products such as aldehydes, ketones, alcohols and formates were also quantified. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Acetone was electrocatalytically reduced to isopropanol in a proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) reactor on an unsupported platinum cathode. Protons needed for the reduction were produced on the unsupported Pt-Ru anode from either hydrogen gas or electrolysis of water. The current efficiency (the ratio of current contributing to the desired chemical reaction to the overall current) and reaction rate for acetone conversion increased with increasing temperature or applied voltage for the electrocatalytic acetone/water system. The reaction rate and current efficiency went through a maximum with respect to acetone concentration. The reaction rate for acetone conversion increased with increasing temperature for the electrocatalytic acetone/hydrogen system. Increasing the applied voltage for the electrocatalytic acetone/hydrogen system decreased the current efficiency due to production of hydrogen gas. Results from this study demonstrate the commercial feasibility of using PEM reactors to electrocatalytically reduce biomass-derived oxygenates into renewable fuels and chemicals. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Biodiesel (FAME) was produced from Pongamia seeds (commonly known as Karanja) by reactive-extraction. Reactiveextraction involves contacting ground seeds directly with alcohol and catalyst i.e. without intervening extraction of the vegetable oil. This process has the potential to reduce cost by removing the need for capital and running cost-intensive steps such as oil extraction of seeds. Reaction parameters such as seed size (>2 mm to <1 mm), seed/solvent ratio (wt/wt) (1:2-1:4), temperature (30-60°C) and rate of mixing (250-550 rpm) were studied. The maximum 98.5% conversion to biodiesel was achieved at: seed size (<1 mm), seed/solvent ratio (wt/wt) (1:4), rate of mixing (550 rpm) at 60 °C for 1 hr with 0.1 M catalyst (KOH) concentration, meeting International (ASTM) as well as National (BIS) specifications.

AB  - The acute Microtox toxicity of the water accommodated fraction (WAF) of six commercial soybean biodiesel/petrodiesel blends was investigated at different oil loads. We analyzed five fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), C10-C24 n-alkanes, four aromatics, methanol, and total organic carbon (TOC) content. At high oil loads, the WAFs' toxicity was significantly higher for blends containing biodiesel. At the lowest load, the WAFs' toxicity decreased almost linearly with decreasing biodiesel in the blend. At intermediate loads, the WAFs of all the blends appeared to have a similar toxicity. Analysis of WAFs confirmed the presence of autoxidation byproducts of FAMEs at high oil loads. Pure unsaturated FAMEs and n-alkanes were nontoxic when present in water at their reported solubility limits. However, 24-h equilibrated WAFs of pure FAMEs were highly toxic for C18:1 and C18:3, but not for C18:2. The authors concluded that at high oil loads, the acute toxicity of the WAFs was caused by FAMEs' autoxidation byproducts, whereas at low oil loads, the toxicity appeared to be caused primarily by the aromatic compounds present in petrodiesel. The addition of a synthetic antioxidant in biodiesel did not appear to affect the concentration of autoxidation byproducts in the WAF but resulted in a slight decrease in its toxicity. The major autoxidation byproducts identified in the WAF of commercial biodiesel were present neither in the WAFs of pure unsaturated FAMEs nor in the WAF of a different soybean biodiesel that was transesterified in our laboratory, which was nontoxic. We concluded that the process of transesterification of biodiesel might be a more critical factor in determining the aquatic toxicity of the fuel than the source of feedstock itself. © 2012 SETAC.

AB  - The need to mitigate climate change makes production of liquid biofuels a high priority. Substituting fossil fuels by biodiesel produced from Jatropha curcas has gained widespread attention as Jatropha cultivation is claimed to offer green house gas emission reductions. Farmers respond worldwide to this increasing demand by converting forests into Jatropha, but whether Jatropha-based biodiesel offers carbon savings depends on the carbon emissions that occur when land use is changed to Jatropha. This paper provides an impact assessment of a small-scale Jatropha project in Cabo Delgado, Mozambique. The paper outlines the estimated impacts on above and below-ground carbon stocks when land use is changed to increase Jatropha production. The results show that expansion of Jatropha production will most likely lead to the conversion of miombo forest areas to Jatropha, which implies a reduction in above and below-ground carbon stocks. The carbon debts created by the land use change can be repaid by replacing fossil fuels with Jatropha-based biodiesel. A repayment time of almost two centuries is found with optimistic estimates of the carbon debt, while the use of pessimistic values results in a repayment time that approaches the millennium. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Water consumption is emerging as an important issue potentially influencing the composition of future urban transportation networks, especially as projected urban populations are expected to outpace water availability and as alternative fuels and vehicles are being implemented in such regions. National and State policies aimed at reducing dependence on imported fuels and energy can increase local production of fuels and energy, impacting demand on local water resources. This article details the development of a model-based assessment on water consumption and withdrawal pertaining to the use-phase of conventional and alternative transportation modes based on regional energy and fuel production. An extensive literature review details water consumption from fuel extraction, processing, and distribution as well as power plant operations. Using Model-Based Systems Engineering principles and the Systems Modeling Language, a multi-level, multi-modal framework was developed and applied to the Metro Atlanta transportation system consisting of conventional and alternative vehicles across varying conditions. According to the analysis, vehicles powered by locally produced biofuels and electricity (assuming average local grid mix for charging) consume more water than locally refined gasoline and CNG-powered vehicles. Improvements in power plant technologies, electricity generation (e.g., use of solar and wind versus hydro power) and vehicle efficiencies can reduce such water consumption significantly. Total water withdrawal for each vehicle and fuel is significantly greater than water consumption. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - China promulgated the Medium and Long-Term Development Plan for Renewable Energy in 2007, which included sub-targets of 2010 and 2020 for various renewable energy technologies. Almost all the 2010 sub-targets have been met and even surpassed except non-grain fuel ethanol. There is debate surrounding the questions of whether and how the country will be able to meet the 2020 biofuels target. This paper provides the assessment of potential technology pathways to achieve the 2020 target regarding their respective resource potential and supply cost. Barriers and policy options are identified based on broad literatures review. And an overview of biofuels projections is presented to provide insight into the comparison of various policy scenarios. The study shows that China can potentially satisfy non-grain fuel ethanol target by 2020 from technology perspective. But she will probably fall far short of this target if current situations continue. Additional policy efforts are needed. Meanwhile, the target of biodiesel production has high probability to be achieved. However, if given support policies, it will develop better. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The work focuses on the impact of fuel on soot reactivity and nanostructure. A 2.5. L, 4-cylinder, turbocharged, common rail, direct injection light-duty diesel engine was used in generating soot samples. Three test fuels were used: an ultra low sulfur diesel fuel (BP15), a pure soybean methyl-ester (B100), and a synthetic Fischer-Tropsch fuel (FT) produced in a gas-to-liquid process. A test condition of 2400. rpm and 64. N. m (low load), with single and split injection strategies, was chosen for studying the impacts of fuel formulation on the characteristics of diesel soot. The start of injection (SOI) and fuel rail pressures were adjusted such that the three test fuels have similar combustion phasing, thereby facilitating comparisons between soots from the different fuels. The collected soot samples were characterized using thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). According to TGA, B100 soot exhibits the fastest oxidation on a mass basis followed by BP15 and FT derived soots in order of apparent rate constant. XPS analysis indicates no relation between the surface oxygen content and the soot reactivity. The basal plane diameter obtained from XRD is inversely related to the apparent rate constants for soot oxidation. Quantitative analysis of HRTEM images also suggests soot nanostructure disorder correlates with a faster oxidation rate. XRD and HRTEM analysis results are compared, and they both show excellent correlation of soot nanostructure and reactivity. © 2012 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - Microalgae are discussed as an alternative source for the production of biofuels. The lipid content compared to cultivation time of used species is the main reason for any choice of a special strain. This paper reviews more analytical data of 38 screened microalgae strains. After the cultivation period, total content of lipids was analysed. The extracted fatty acids were quantified as fatty acid methyl esters by GC analysis. The amino acids were analysed by HPLC. Chlorella sp., Chlorella saccharophila, Chlorella minutissima and Chlorella vulgaris were identified as species with the highest productivity of fatty acids relevant to transesterification reactions. The components were mainly linoleic acid, palmitic acid and oleic acid. To increase productivity of highly saturated fatty acids, cultivation parameters light intensity and temperature were varied. In this manner, the ideal conditions for biodiesel production were defined in this publication. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - The catalytic pyrolysis of the oily seeds of Styrax officinalis L., which was carried out using two catalysts in a fixed-bed reactor. As a catalyst, expanded perlite was firstly used according to the best current knowledge. Pyrolysis experiments were performed under at 450°C temperature and 25°C/min heating rate. The results showed that both catalyst materials had approximately the same effect on the bio-oil yields. By using the natural zeolite and expanded perlite at a ratio of 30 wt %, the maximum bio-oil yields were achieved as 38.07 wt % and 37.49 wt %, respectively. The oxygen content is important to bio-oil and upgrading oil. High oxygen content causes poor heating value and instability. The use of a catalyst greatly reduced the oxygen content of the bio-oil, such that the 30 wt % of oxygen content for noncatalytic oil decreased to 16.34 wt % and 18.35 wt % with use of natural zeolite and expanded perlite, respectively. Higher heating values (34.84 and 33.48 MJ/kg) and H/C atomic ratios (1.47 and 1.51) for the catalyzed bio-oils were very close to those of petroleum, which are 40 MJ/kg and 1.5:1.9, respectively. In addition, the oxygenated species decreased and also the quantities of alkyl and alkenyl substituted aromatic compounds and paraffinic alkanes in the catalyzed bio-oils were notably higher than those of noncatalyzed bio-oils when using a catalyst. The use of catalysts in the pyrolysis not only increased the yield of bio-oil, but also produced higher quality oil with higher calorific value, lower oxygen content, higher carbon, and hydrogen contents etc. Copyright © 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).

AB  - Considering the current rate of extraction, Malaysia's crude oil reserves are expected to diminish after 20 years. The anticipated diminution of fossil fuel reserves are the main reason for the exploration of alternatives to petroleum diesel. Malaysia introduced its biofuel policy in the year 2005 with an objective to reduce the country's fuel import bill, further promoting the demand for palm oil, which is expected to be the primary commodity for biofuel production in Malaysia as well as to shore up the price of palm oil. The present review article discussed the progress of biodiesel in Malaysia with a special emphasis on the development, benefits, and policies. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study evaluates an integrated process for the production of platform chemicals and diesel miscible biofuels. An energy crop (Miscanthus) was treated hydrothermally to produce levulinic acid (LA). Temperatures ranging between 150 and 200 °C, sulfuric acid concentrations 1-5 wt.% and treatment times 1-12 h were applied to give different combined severity factors. Temperatures of 175 and 200 °C and acid concentration of 5 wt.% were found to be necessary to achieve good yield (17 wt.%) and selectivities of LA while treatment time did not have an effect. The acid hydrolysis residues were characterized for their elemental, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin contents, and then tested in a small-scale pyrolyzer using silica sand and a commercial ZSM-5 catalyst. Milder pretreatment yielded more oil (43 wt.%) and oil O 2 (37%) while harsher pretreatment and catalysis led to more coke production (up to 58 wt.%), less oil (12 wt.%) and less oil O 2 (18 wt.%).

AB  - India has developed a national biofuel policy to increase energy security, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and stimulate rural development. In this policy, the government has set blending targets for mixing ethanol and biodiesel with gasoline and diesel, respectively. In India, ethanol is produced from irrigated sugar-cane while biodiesel is produced from jatropha, which is said to require no irrigation. This paper analyzes the possible impacts of an increase in sugar-cane and jatropha production on water management and use. It finds that India's biofuel policy is likely to place additional pressure on scarce water resources. Although the development of biofuels may be necessary, care must be taken to anticipate its likely impacts on water resources. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Novel heterogeneous catalysts from calcium oxide (CaO)/calcined calcium carbonate (CaCO3) loaded onto different palm oil mill boiler ashes were synthesised and used in the transesterification of crude palm oil (CPO) with methanol to yield biodiesel. Catalyst preparation parameters including the type of ash support, the weight percentage of CaO and calcined CaCO3 loadings, as well as the calcination temperature of CaCO3 were optimised. The catalyst prepared by loading of 15wt% calcined CaCO3 at a fixed temperature of 800°C on fly ash exhibited a maximum oil conversion of 94.48%. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the CaCO3 was transformed into CaO at 770°C and interacted well with the ash support, whereas rich CaO, Al2O3 and SiO2 were identified in the composition using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The fine morphology size (&lt;5μm) and high surface area (1.719m2/g) of the fly ash-based catalyst rendered it the highest catalytic activity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Basic properties are reported for a previously undocumented biofuel mixture of refined, bleached and deodorized soybean oilbutanol and its pure components according to ASTM standards. Kays mixing rule was used to predict relative density and higher heating values based on mixture composition while the GrunbergNissan approach was used to predict the viscositycomposition relationship. Absolute average deviation values of &lt;5.1%, &lt;0.028% and &lt;0.012% were obtained for viscosity, higher heating value and relative density, respectively. Temperature dependency was found to be linear for relative density and surface tension yielding R 2 values of &gt;.994 and &gt;.97 from linear regression. Viscosity exhibited an exponential relationship with temperature. The Andrade equation was shown to be the appropriate representation with absolute average deviation values &lt;1.25%. Cloud point, pour point and cold filter plugging point were measured. Increasing the concentration of butanol decreased the cloud point, pour point, and cold filter plugging point. Cloud point and cold filter plugging point experienced the most significant change at butanol concentrations &lt;25%. Values stayed almost constant for concentrations beyond that. The pour point continued to decrease with increasing butanol concentrations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soot particles derived from canola methyl ester (CME), soybean methyl ester (SME), a 50% mixture composed of soybean methyl ester (SME) and animal fats (AF), and diesel fuel have been studied using a wick-generated open-air laminar diffusion flame operating at atmospheric pressure. The particles were collected directly from inside the flame volume at different axial locations using the thermophoretic sampling technique and were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HR-TEM). Interestingly, the results show that carbon particulates produced from several tested biodiesels have diameters significantly smaller than those produced in diesel fuel under the same experimental conditions. Within the tested biofuels, the soot from SME had the largest primary particle diameter followed by B50 SME/B50 AF, with CME having the smallest primary particle diameter. Further studies of the soot particle nanostructure were also conducted using a HR-TEM imaging technique. It was found that the soot derived from biodiesel has a highly graphitic shell-core arrangement compared to diesel soot which exhibits far less graphitic structure as it consists of short, disconnected and not concentrically oriented graphene segments. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The influence on the chemical composition of the particle matter (PM) produced in an automotive diesel engine operated with palm biodiesel (PB) and its blends with diesel fuel were studied. The opacity index showed a decrease on the PM emitted by the engine when palm biodiesel amount increased in the fuel, a result that also agrees with the amount of PM collected in filters. Similarly, the PB concentration did not affect the average size of PM emitted compared to diesel. But, it seems to be that biodiesel and its blends tend to produce PM with a higher number of small particles. The chemical composition of PM obtained from PB blends and pure PB were similar to those reported before; however no correlation with biodiesel concentration was found, except for the evident reduction on sulfur content in particle matter, a fact that can be associated with a fuel dilution effect. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, a comparative Life Cycle Assessment has been performed with the aim of finding out how the environmental impact derived from biodiesel production (using raw sunflower oil or waste cooking oils) could be affected by the degree of decentralization of the production (number of production plants in a given territory). The decentralized production of biodiesel has been proposed for several reasons, such as the possibility of small scale production, the fact that there is no need to use high technology or make large investments, and because small plants do not need highly specialized technical staff. Thus, hypothetical territories (considering scenarios in which the production and area were theoretically modified), as well as real territories, have been analyzed to determine which environmental indicators were most affected. Results showed that the optimum degree of centralization was different for each analyzed case. In general, in small territories centralized production was more suitable for the environment, decentralization being more advisable as the territory increased in area. For each of the cases analyzed, an optimum number of plants, which minimized the environmental impacts, was found. This work illustrates the importance of considering the number of industrial plants in the production design, not only from an economic aspect but also from an environmental point of view. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With increasing demand for biofuels, jatropha is considered as one of the biofuel crops, which is suitable for growth under adverse conditions including drought and salinity which mainly occur in arid and semi-arid environment. We report here to what extent salt stress affected water loss, canopy water vapor conductance, leaf growth and Na and K concentrations of leaves of 3-year old and young plants. Adult (on peat substrate) and young (in hydroponic system) plants were exposed to seven (0-300 mmol NaCl L -1) and five salt levels (0-200 mmol NaCl L -1), during 20 and 6 days, respectively. In both experiments, plants responded rapidly to salt stress by reducing water loss. The threshold value of responses was between 0 and 5 dS m -1. Leaf area increment of young jatropha had a threshold value of 5 dS m -1 implying that jatropha responds sensitive to external salt application in term of canopy development, conductance and CO 2 assimilation rate. The rapid decrease of canopy conductance indicates that jatropha is effectively protecting leaves from massive Na import into leaves over short time periods. Our data indicate that use of wastewater in (semi-)arid areas should be carefully considered if high productivity is the key of plantation management. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel derived from waste cooking oil (WCO) is gaining increased attention as an alternative fuel due to lower particulate emissions and other beneficial factors such as low cost and utilization of waste oil. However, very little information is available on toxicity of airborne particulate matter (PM) emitted from biodiesel combustion. In this study, PM emitted from WCO-derived biodiesel (B100) was analyzed for its toxic potential together with ultra low sulphur diesel (ULSD) as a reference fuel and their blend (B50). Human lung epithelial carcinoma cells (A549) were used for this comparative toxicity study. Results indicate that cytotoxicity and oxidative stress were higher for B100 relative to ULSD. Furthermore, caspase 3/7 activity indicates that cell death induced by B100 was due to either caspase independent apoptotic process or other programmed cell death pathways. The toxicity was also evaluated for different engine load conditions. It was observed that at lower loads there was no significant difference in the toxicological response of B100 and ULSD. However, with increase in the engine load, B100 and B50 showed significantly higher toxicity and oxidative stress compared to ULSD. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass pellets are undergoing fast deployment widely in the world, including China. To this stage, there were limited studies on the emissions of various organic pollutants from the burning of those pellets. In addition to parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, oxygenated PAHs (oPAHs) have been received increased concerns. In this study, emission factors of oPAHs (EF oPAHs) were measured for two types of pellets made from corn straw and pine wood, respectively. Two combustion modes with (mode II) and without (mode I) secondary side air supply in a modern pellet burner were investigated. For the purpose of comparison, EF oPAHs for raw fuels combusted in a traditional cooking stove were also measured. EF oPAHs were 348 ± 305 and 396 ± 387 μg kg -1 in the combustion mode II for pine wood and corn straw pellets, respectively. In mode I, measured EF oPAHs were 77.7 ± 49.4 and 189 ± 118 μg kg -1, respectively. EFs in mode II were higher (2-5 times) than those in mode I mainly due to the decreased combustion temperature under more excess air. Compared to EF oPAHs for raw corn straw and pine wood burned in a traditional cooking stove, total EF oPAHs for the pellets in mode I were significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05), likely due to increased combustion efficiencies and change in fuel properties. However, the difference between raw biomass fuels and the pellets burned in mode II was not statistically significant. Taking both the increased thermal efficiencies and decreased EFs into consideration, substantial reduction in oPAH emission can be expected if the biomass pellets can be extensively used by rural residents. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of exhaust emissions were studied in four direct-injection turbocharged four-cylinder diesel engines, with power ratings of 90-136 kW. The engines were operated on biodiesel (B-100), a blend of 30% biodiesel in diesel fuel (B-30), and heated rapeseed oil (RO) in two independent laboratories. Diesel particle filters (DPF) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems were used with B-30 and B-100. Concentrations of individual PAHs sampled in different substrates (quartz, borosilicate fiber and fluorocarbon membrane filters, polyurethane foam) were analyzed using different methods. Benzo[a]pyrene toxic equivalents (BaP TEQ) were calculated using different sets of toxic equivalency factors (TEF). Operation on B-100 without aftertreatment devices, compared to diesel fuel, yielded a mean reduction in PAHs of 73%, consistent across engines and among TEF used. A lower PAH reduction was obtained using B-30. The BaP TEQ reductions on DPF were 91-99% using B-100, for one non-catalyzed DPF, and over 99% in all other cases. The BaP TEQ for heated RO were higher than those for B-100 and one half lower to over twice as high as that of diesel fuel. B-100 and RO samples featured, compared to diesel fuel, a relatively high share of higher molecular weight PAH and a relatively low share of lighter PAHs. Using different sets of TEF or different detection methods did not consistently affect the observed effect of fuels on BaP TEQ. The compilation of multiple tests was helpful for discerning emerging patterns. The collection of milligrams of particulate matter per sample was generally needed for quantification of all individual PAHs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article investigates the effects of injection timing, injection pressure and compression ratio on performance characteristic (brake thermal efficiency) and emission characteristics (smoke, HC, CO and NO x) of a single-cylinder direct injection diesel engine when fueled with Honge oil methyl ester (HOME). The experiments were planned as per full factorial design (FFD). The relationships between the process parameters and the various characteristics have been established by developing second order mathematical models using response surface methodology (RSM). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to check the adequacy of the proposed models. The RSM based parametric analysis reveals that retarding the injection timing improved the performance of diesel engine fueled with HOME in terms of increased brake thermal efficiency and reduced emissions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Turkey's economy is mainly dependent on agriculture and the country provides almost all petroleum demand through imports, the evaluation of vegetable alternative engine fuels is of great importance. In this study, usability of methyl ester of rapeseed oil and hazelnut produced abundant in Turkey was examined. Experiments were carried out in a four-cylinder, four-stroke, 46 kW, direct injection diesel engine. A comparison of diesel fuel, the rapeseed oil methyl ester and the hazelnut oil methyl ester blends was made from the engine performance and emissions point of view. Engine performance and emission tests were carried out with 4 different fuel that 100% diesel (SD), 50% rapeseed oil methyl ester and 50% diesel (B1), 50% hazelnut oil methyl ester and %50 diesel (B2), 25% rapeseed oil methyl ester, 25% rapeseed oil methyl ester and 50% diesel (B3). Highest engine performance and lowest specific fuel consumption were obtained with SD fuel. But the use of biodiesel led to reduction in CO and smoke emissions accompanying with the imperceptible torque loss. As the rapeseed methyl ester rate increased in the blend, smoke and CO emissions decreased, NO x and CO 2 emissions increased. With the use of B1 fuel, NO x emissions increased up to 7.2%. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Triacylglycerols (TAGs) from algae are considered to be a potentially viable source of biodiesel and thereby renewable energy, but at the moment very little is known about the biosynthetic pathway in these organisms. Here we compare what is currently known in eukaryotic algal species, in particular the characteristics of algal diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), the last enzyme of de novo TAG biosynthesis. Several studies in plants and mammals have shown that there are two DGAT isoforms, DGAT1 and DGAT2, which catalyse the same reaction but have no clear sequence similarities. Instead, they have differences in functionality and spatial and temporal expression patterns. Bioinformatic searches of sequenced algal genomes reveal that most algae have multiple copies of putative DGAT2s, whereas other eukaryotes have single genes. Investigating whether these putative isoforms are indeed functional and whether they confer significantly different phenotypes to algal cells will be vital for future efforts to genetically modify algae for biofuel production. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A novel method has been developed for the direct conversion of fructose into 5-(ethoxymethyl)furfural (EMF) catalyzed by an organic-inorganic hybrid solid catalyst [MIMBS]3PW12O40. First, etherification of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) by ethanol was studied over a series of catalysts, and [MIMBS]3PW12O40 showed the best catalytic activity with an EMF yield of 90.7% at 70 °C. Then the one-pot dehydrative etherification of fructose into EMF was studied. It indicated that a low temperature (70 °C) was not favored for the dehydrative etherification process, and a high temperature (110 °C) was favored to promote side reactions. A high EMF yield of 90.5% was obtained from fructose at 90 °C with 5 mol % catalyst for 24 h. The recycling test demonstrated that [MIMBS]3PW12O40 could be reused several times without losing catalytic activity, with an average EMF yield of approximate 90%. This work provides a meaningful method for the conversion of carbohydrates into fine chemicals and biofuel additives. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Fossil fuels are the chief contributors to urban air pollution and major source of green house gases and are considered to be the prime cause behind the global climate change. Biofuels are renewable, can supplement fossil fuels, reduce green house gases, and mitigate their adverse effects on the climate resulting from global warming. In the present study, biodiesel produced from karanja oil is evaluated as alternative fuel in a diesel engine. The experiments are conducted on a single-cylinder, four-stroke, direct-injection CI engine and the experimental parameters include the percentage of karanja biodiesel in the blend, engine load, injection pressure, and compression ratio. Comparative measures of brake thermal efficiency, brake-specific fuel consumption, smoke opacity, and HC, CO, and NOX emissions are presented and discussed. Results show that the performance of the engine fuelled with karanja biodiesel and its blends with diesel fuel is generally comparable to that when the engine is fuelled with pure diesel. At higher compression ratios, the engine gives lesser emission and better performance. Genetic algorithm optimization technique was used to optimize the parameters. With respect to maximum efficiency and minimum emissions, the optimum values of load, compression ratio, injection pressure, and blend were 6 kg, 18, 247 bar, and B95, respectively.

AB  - This article describes the possible utilization of three emulsions obtained from karanja methyl ester (KME) and wood pyrolysis oil (WPO) as fuels in a direct injection diesel engine. For this study, the three emulsions, namely, WPO5, WPO10, and WPO15 were prepared by taking WPO at 5%, 10%, and 15% with KME at 95%, 90%, and 85%, respectively, using a suitable surfactant for preparing water-in-oil emulsion. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the combustion, performance, and emission parameters of a single cylinder, four-stroke, air-cooled, direct injection, diesel engine running with the three emulsions. The results of the experiments were compared with diesel operation. The test results indicate that lower ignition delay and high peak cylinder pressures are observed with KME-WPO emulsions. The KME and KME-WPO emulsions exhibit lower specific energy consumption and higher exhaust gas temperatures. Results also indicate that nitric oxide emissions for KME and WPO5, WPO10, and WPO15 emulsions are higher by about 16%, 10.8%, 2.2%, and 0.5% compared with that of diesel fuel at full load. The hydrocarbon emissions for KME, WPO5, WPO10, and WPO15 are found to be lower by about 7.1%, 50%, 42.8%, and 28.5%, respectively, compared with that of diesel at full load. The percentage reduction in the smoke density by 25%, 21.4%, 16%, and 10% is achieved with KME, WPO5, WPO10, and WPO15, respectively, at full load when compared with diesel fuel.

AB  - Sustainable production of renewable energy is being hotly debated globally since it is increasingly understood that first generation biofuels, primarily produced from food crops and mostly oil seeds are limited in their ability to achieve targets for biofuel production, climate change mitigation and economic growth. These concerns have increased the interest in developing second generation biofuels produced from non-food feedstocks such as nonedible oils which potentially offer greatest opportunities in the longer term. A large variety of plants that produce non-edible oils can be considered for biodiesel production such as Madhuca Indica (Mahua),Jatropha curcas(Ratan Jyot), Pongamia pinnata (Karanja), Soapnut (Sapindus mukorossi) and Melia azadirachta (Neem) etc., are easily available in developing countries and are very economical comparable to edible oils. This review paper assesses and integrates about the different tree borne oilseeds, extraction of oil, biodiesel processing and effect of different parameters on production of biodiesel. If the developed process is scaled up to commercial levels then excellent business opportunity will be offered by the biodiesel and it could be a major step towards the creation of an eco-friendly transportation fuel that is relatively clean on combustion.

AB  - Concern with fossil fuel depletion and environmental degradation promotes the use of renewable energy sources in particular bio-fuel for automotive and power generation. Palm oil in its refined form as cooking oil can be used as fuel in diesel engines. Present study evaluates macroscopic spray characteristics, such as tip penetration, cone angle and spray area using direct injection diesel injector in a constant volume combustion chamber. Palm oil blend with diesel at 20, 40, 60, and 80 % as well as pure palm oil (100 %) and diesel were tested separately using direct visualization technique. Spray developments were investigated at elevated injection pressure starting from 20 MPa (original setting) to 30 and 34 MPa (maximum pressure). Experimental results for palm oil blends show that, spray development process is highly affected with increasing palm oil in the blend. Spray tip penetration and cone angle of blends were found to decrease by about 50 and 30 % respectively compared to diesel fuel. At elevated injection pressures, spray characteristics of the blends show significant improvement. Tip penetration and spray area for P20 at 34 MPa were comparable to diesel at its original injection pressure setting. Moreover, blends average cone angles were found larger at 30 MPa, by about 14.93, 11.47, 7.34 and 1.84 % for P20, P40, P60 and P80 respectively. For P20, 34 MPa injection pressure is sufficient to display spray characteristics similar to diesel, but require higher than 34 MPa injection pressure for other blends.

AB  - Amid grave concerns over global climate change and with increasingly strained access to fossil fuels, the synthetic biology community has stepped up to the challenge of developing microbial platforms for the production of advanced biofuels. The adoption of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel alternatives derived from microbial sources has the potential to significantly limit net greenhouse gas emissions. In this effort, great strides have been made in recent years toward the engineering of microorganisms to produce transportation fuels derived from alcohol, fatty acid, and isoprenoid biosynthesis. We provide an overview of the biosynthetic pathways devised in the strain development of biofuel-producing microorganisms. We also highlight many of the commonly used and newly devised engineering strategies that have been employed to identify and overcome pathway bottlenecks and problems of toxicity to maximize production titers. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel is an attractive biofuel because it can be used directly with the traditional petro diesel engines, either as a substitute or as a blending component. There are several alternatives that can be used to produce biodiesel. In this work, we developed a superstructure optimization model to synthesize the optimum biodiesel production plant, i.e., the one that gives the minimum net present sink. To reduce the computational cost of solving the resulting disjunctive programming, the surrogate models utilizing artificial neural networks (ANNs), have been developed to replace the unit operation, thermodynamics and mixing models. The optimum solution with the alkali-catalyzed reactor (obtained in five CPU seconds) has a total net present sink of about $41 million, which differs less than one percent from the result obtained by modeling the solution in a process simulator. However, this level of accuracy required a large amount of data to train the ANNs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The potential of replacing petroleum fuels with renewable biofuels has drawn significant public interest. Many states have imposed biodiesel mandates or incentives to use commercial biodiesel blends. We present an inquiry-driven experiment where students are given the tasks to gather samples, develop analytical methods using various instrumental methods, such as HPLC, 1H-NMR, and ATR-FTIR, make measurements, and analyze the results to determine the volume percent of biodiesel in commercial diesel blends. The project develops students appreciation of the usefulness of chemistry by working with "real" samples from their daily lives, and skills to critically compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of various instrumental techniques for quantitative analysis. © 2012 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.

AB  - This work presents resources of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina available for bioethanol and motor fuels (gasoline and diesel fuel) from sustainable resources: corn-stalks, straw, sweet sorghum, pork fat. The physicochemical basis for novel processes for motor fuel production is coupling microwave pyrolysis of oil shale and catalytic cracking of purified pyrolysis oil, hydrothermal liquefaction of algae and swine manure. The effects of the degree of purification of crude pyrolysis oil and oil shale on the degree of their conversion to gasoline and diesel fuel, as well as the product distribution are investigated. The effects of the duration and temperature of hydrothermal liquefaction of microalga, Botryoccocus braunii, and swine manure on their degrees of conversion into biooil and its thermal properties are investigated. The development of novel strategy of biofuel in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina is presented.

AB  - Nearly one hundred years ago, the fermentative production of acetone by Clostridium acetobutylicum provided a crucial alternative source of this solvent for manufacture of the explosive cordite. Today there is a resurgence of interest in solventogenic Clostridium species to produce n-butanol and ethanol for use as renewable alternative transportation fuels. Acetone, a product of acetone-n-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation, harbours a nucleophilic α-carbon, which is amenable to C-C bond formation with the electrophilic alcohols produced in ABE fermentation. This functionality can be used to form higher-molecular-mass hydrocarbons similar to those found in current jet and diesel fuels. Here we describe the integration of biological and chemocatalytic routes to convert ABE fermentation products efficiently into ketones by a palladium-catalysed alkylation. Tuning of the reaction conditions permits the production of either petrol or jet and diesel precursors. Glyceryl tributyrate was used for the in situ selective extraction of both acetone and alcohols to enable the simple integration of ABE fermentation and chemical catalysis, while reducing the energy demand of the overall process. This process provides a means to selectively produce petrol, jet and diesel blend stocks from lignocellulosic and cane sugars at yields near their theoretical maxima. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - PCR-based molecular markers, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) and Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) used for genetic characterization in Jatropha revealed 100, 98.68 and 97.47 per cent polymorphism, respectively.The highest genetic correlation according to combined RAPD, ISSR, and SSR data was between genotypes PKVJ-DHW-1 and P.J.-03004 (83.7%), while the lowest similarity was found between genotypes TNMC-2 andTNMC-4.The dendrogram of combined RAPD, ISSR and SSR data grouped genotypes into nine major clusters. Each marker grouped TNMC-2 into unique cluster. Cophenetic correlation (r) for RAPD, ISSR, SSR and their combination were 0.9873, 0.9840, 0.7769 and 0.9886, respectively, indicating very good fit of the cluster analysis and showed significant correlation between similarity matrix and cluster analysis. The PCoA for RAPD, ISSR, SSR and combined markers also resulted in similar relationship between the score plots and the pattern of genetic diversity estimated by the UPGMA cluster analysis. Results clearly indicated that the combination of ISSR vs. SSR (r = 0.4835) would be more effective for genetic diversity analysis than other combinations.Thus, bulk analyses of RAPD, ISSR and SSR-PCR markers provides a quick, reliable and highly informative system for DNA fingerprinting in Jatropha and also permit to establish genetic relationships which agree with, by other means, known origin of the Jatropha cultivars.

AB  - In the scope of the cluster of excellence "Tailor-Made Fuels from Biomass" new biofuels are developed within an interdisciplinary research approach at RWTH Aachen University. The most promising fuel candidates so far tend to have a low viscosity and a low lubricity compared to diesel fuel. This puts new tribological challenges to the fuel-lubricated contacts found in fuel injection equipment. This paper presents an elastohydrodynamic simulation model of the most critical tribological contacts in fuel injection pumps. The simulation results so far indicate that, besides adapting the tribological interfaces inside the pump, the lubricity of the potential new biofuels needs to be investigated and optimized in order to secure functioning in the regime of boundary lubrication.

AB  - The effect of compression ratio on combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of a direct injection single cylinder four stroke variable compression ratio multi fuel engine when fueled with corn oil methyl ester (COME) and palm oil methyl ester (POME) is investigated and compared with petroleum based diesel fuel (PBDF). The suitability of COME and POME as biofuels has been studied in this research. Biodiesels produced from corn oil and palm oil by transesterification process has been used in this study. Experiments were conducted at constant speed of 1500rpm, full load, and at compression ratio of 17:1, 18:1, and 19:1. The effect of compression ratio on heat release rate, specific fuel consumption, and exhaust gas emissions has been investigated and presented. The fuels which gave best performance when used in engine have been identified by optimum compression ratio. The results indicate that shorter ignition delay, maximum rate of combustion pressure, and lower heat release rate at higher compression ratio were observed for POME when compared to PBDF. The brake thermal efficiency of POME was found to be maximum than PBDF at full load for all compression ratio. Exhaust gas temperature is low for biodiesels when compared to PBDF from compression ratio 17:1 to 19:1. The emission of CO, CO2, and HC dropped with compression ratio 17:1 and it slightly increased when compression ratio is increased. The engine performance was found to be optimum when using POME as fuel, at compression ratio 19:1 during full load condition. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - Water consumption has become a serious concern in renewable fuels production. This paper proposes a framework to address sustainable transport systems design where both environmental (i.e. carbon and water footprints) and economic performances are taken into account along the bioethanol supply chain. A multi-objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming modeling framework supporting strategic design and planning decisions for multi-period and multi-echelon upstream ethanol supply chains is developed. Hybrid biofuel production networks, where both corn grain and stover are used as suitable feedstocks, are optimized according to several features, involving technology selection and by-products end-use option. A case study is presented referring to the emerging Italian biofuels market. Results show the effectiveness of mathematical-programming-based tools to optimal design of biofuels supply chains, assessing the pros and cons of alternative configurations and, thus, allowing investors to drive planning decisions. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Underwater high-voltage discharges (3.5 kV) resulting in 4.9 kJ shock waves (50-60 MPa) were studied at the laboratory scale as a Jatropha curcas L. seed disintegration method. Grinding and macerating in an excess of methanol (3.5:1) was advantageous because methanol acts both as a liquid carrier for the pressure shock waves and as a solvent that increases the efficiency of oil extraction while remaining usable for esterification. The influence of the number of shock waves and the intensity of methanol maceration on the heat values of the pressed cake are stated in detail. Soxhlet extraction demonstrated that a greater than 94% oil extraction was achieved. The increased disintegration of vacuoles rich in oil was documented by surface area analysis, mineralization kinetics analysis, and electron microscopy. The working volumes were small, and the proportion of energy inadequate compared to the yields released; however, much can be improved by upgrading the process. © 2012 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: This article seeks to address aviation as an emerging biofuel consumer and to discuss sustainability issues and consequences for feedstock production concepts. Biojet fuels have been identified as a promising, readily deployable alternative to fossil-based aviation fuels. At the same time they are highly criticised as their production may have negative social and environmental impacts. Therefore, the paper aims to identify major sustainability issues and assessment challenges and relate these to the production of biojet fuel feedstock. Design/methodology/approach: Two plant oil production concepts are presented that address the sustainability issues discussed. Both concepts are being investigated within the research project "Platform for Sustainable Aviation Fuels". A literature-based overview of sustainability issues and assessment challenges is provided. Additionally, conceptual insights into new plant oil production concepts are presented. Findings: The use of biojet fuels is often hailed as a strategy for the aviation industry to become more sustainable. However, biofuels are not necessarily sustainable and their potential to reduce GHG emissions is highly debated. Several unresolved sustainability issues are identified highlighting the need for improved assessment methods. Moreover, the two concepts presented have the potential to provide sustainably grown feedstock, but further empirical research is needed. Originality/value: This article addresses researchers and practitioners by providing an overview of sustainability issues and assessment challenges related to biojet fuels. Consequences are identified for two plant oil feedstock concepts: catch cropping in temperate regions and silvopastoral systems in tropical and subtropical regions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The sugars present in bio-oil produced by fast pyrolysis can potentially be fermented by microbial organisms to produce cellulosic ethanol. This study shows the potential for microbial digestion of the aqueous fraction of bio-oil in an enrichment medium to consume glucose and produce ethanol. In addition to glucose, inhibitors such as furans and phenols are present in the bio-oil. A pure glucose enrichment medium of 20 g/l was used as a standard to compare with glucose and aqueous fraction mixtures for digestion. Thirty percent by volume of aqueous fraction in media was the maximum additive amount that could be consumed and converted to ethanol. Inhibitors were removed by extraction, activated carbon, air stripping, and microbial methods. After economic analysis, the cost of ethanol using an inexpensive fermentation medium in a large scale plant is approximately 14 per gallon. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

AB  - Algae have contributed greatly to the creation of the Earth's environment and the development of human civilization. Currently, microalgae are considered to be among the most promising sources for biofuel. Most microalgae accumulate triacylglycerols; however, fatty acid methyl esters produced from triacylglycerols by transesterification have critical end-use issues. Hydrocarbons produced by Botryococcus and Aurantiochytrium are the most suitable algal oils for replacing existing transportation fuels and are highly compatible with existing petroleum infrastructure. Over the years, many technologies have been investigated for achieving sustainable biofuel production using oleaginous microalgae; however, existing techniques of algal fuel production are suitable mainly for small-scale procedures or for the recovery or removal of high-value products. This situation strongly influences life cycle assessment studies for algal fuel production, and published life cycle assessments show different and discrepant results - reliable data on inputs and outputs from industrial-scale experiments are needed for solving these problems. The estimated cost of algal fuel production is still high compared with that of fossil crude oils. The integration of water treatment and algal biomass production, in a coupled hybrid production system comprising of phototrophic and heterotrophic algae, has tremendous potential for improving the economy of future algal fuels. © 2012 Future Science Ltd.

AB  - Introduction:Paving workers are exposed to polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) while working with hot-mix asphalt (HMA). Further characterization of the source and route of these exposures is necessary to guide exposure-reduction strategies.Methods:Personal air (n 144), hand-wash (n 144), and urine (n 480) samples were collected from 12 paving workers over 3 workdays during 4 workweeks. Urine samples were collected at preshift, postshift, and bedtime and analyzed for 10 hydroxylated PACs (1-OH-pyrene; 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-OH-phenanthrene; 1-, 2-OH-naphthalene; 2-, 3-, 9-OH-fluorene) by an immunochemical quantification of PACs (I-PACs). The air and hand-wash samples were analyzed for the parent compounds corresponding to the urinary analytes. Using a crossover study design, each of the 4 weeks represented a different exposure scenario: a baseline week (normal conditions), a dermal protection week (protective clothing), a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) week, and a biodiesel substitution week (100% biodiesel provided to replace the diesel oil normally used by workers to clean tools and equipment). The urinary analytes were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models.Results:Postshift and bedtime concentrations were significantly higher than preshift concentrations for most urinary biomarkers. Compared with baseline, urinary analytes were reduced during the dermal protection (29% for 1-OH-pyrene, 15% for I-PACs), the PAPR (24% for 1-OH-pyrene, 15% for I-PACs), and the biodiesel substitution (15% for 1-OH-pyrene) weeks. The effect of PACs in air was different by exposure scenario (biodiesel substitution > dermal protection > PAPR and baseline) and was still a significant predictor of most urinary analytes during the week of PAPR use, suggesting that PACs in air were dermally absorbed. The application temperature of HMA was positively associated with urinary measures, such that an increase from the lowest application temperature (121°C) to the highest (154°C) was associated with a 72% increase in ΣOH-fluorene and 1-OH-pyrene and an 82% increase in ΣOH-phenanthrene. Though PACs in hand-wash samples were not predictors of urinary analytes, the effects observed during the PAPR scenario and the week of increased dermal protection provide evidence of dermal absorption.Conclusions:Our results provide evidence that PACs in air are dermally absorbed. Reducing the application temperature of asphalt mix appears to be a promising strategy for reducing PAC exposure among paving workers. Additional reductions may be achieved by requiring increased dermal coverage of workers and by substituting biodiesel for diesel oil as a cleaning agent. © 2012 The Author 2012.

AB  - Increasing demands for petroleum have stimulated sustainable ways to produce chemicals and biofuels. Specifically, fatty acids of varying chain lengths (C6-C16) naturally synthesized in many organisms are promising starting points for the catalytic production of industrial chemicals and diesel-like biofuels. However, bio-production of fatty acids from plants and other microbial production hosts relies heavily on manipulating tightly regulated fatty acid biosynthetic pathways. In addition, precursors for fatty acids are used along other central metabolic pathways for the production of amino acids and biomass, which further complicates the engineering of microbial hosts for higher yields. Here, we demonstrate an iterative metabolic engineering effort that integrates computationally driven predictions and metabolic flux analysis techniques to meet this challenge. The OptForce procedure was used for suggesting and prioritizing genetic manipulations that overproduce fatty acids of different chain lengths from C6 to C16 starting with wild-type E. coli. We identified some common but mostly chain-specific genetic interventions alluding to the possibility of fine-tuning overproduction for specific fatty acid chain lengths. In accordance with the OptForce prioritization of interventions, fabZ and acyl-ACP thioesterase were upregulated and fadD was deleted to arrive at a strain that produces 1.70g/L and 0.14g fatty acid/g glucose (~39% maximum theoretical yield) of C14-16 fatty acids in minimal M9 medium. These results highlight the benefit of using computational strain design and flux analysis tools in the design of recombinant strains of E. coli to produce free fatty acids. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Due to the depleting amount of petroleum reserves and the increasing awareness on environmental concerns, biodiesel has become one of the most demanding and promising substitutes for the petroleum based fossil fuels. In this study, the biodiesel derived from waste cooking oil through the transesterification process was optimized using Response Surface Methodology. The biodiesel derived under optimum conditions was used for investigating the effect of injection pressure and timing on performance, emission and the combustion characteristics of single cylinder, four-stroke direct injection diesel engine at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. On varying the injection pressure and timing, it was found that the combined effect of higher injection pressure of 280 bar and an advanced injection timing of 25.5°bTDC had significant improvement in the brake thermal efficiency, cylinder gas pressure and heat release rate. Reduction in nitric oxide (NO) and smoke emission was also observed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Renewable non-edible plant oils such as jatropha and karanj have potential to substitute fossil diesel fuels in CI engines. A multi-cylinder water cooled IDI type CI engine has been tested with jatropha and karanj oils and comparisons made against fossil diesel. The physical and chemical properties of the three fuels were measured to investigate the suitability of jatropha and karanj oils as fuels for CI engines. The engine cooling water circuit and fuel supply systems were modified such that hot jacket water preheated the neat plant oil prior to injection. Between jatropha and karanj there was little difference in the performance, emission and combustion results. Compared to fossil diesel, the brake specific fuel consumption on volume basis was around 3% higher for the plant oils and the brake thermal efficiency was almost similar. Jatropha and karanj operation resulted in higher CO 2 and NO x emissions by 7% and 8% respectively, as compared to diesel. The cylinder gas pressure diagram showed stable engine operation with both plant oils. At full load, the plant oils gave around 3% higher peak cylinder pressure than fossil diesel. With the plant oils, cumulative heat release was smaller at low load and almost similar at full load, compared to diesel. At full load, the plant oils exhibited 5% shorter combustion duration. The study concludes that the IDI type CI engine can be efficiently operated with neat jatropha (or karanj) oil preheated by jacket water, after small modifications of the engine cooling and fuel supply circuits. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The study assesses the impacts of the biofuels production to the socio-economic development in Thailand. The four kinds of biofuels considered in the analyses are ethanol from cassava, molasses and sugarcane ethanol as well as palm biodiesel. The key elements of socio-economic development including employment generation, economic effects on GDP and trade balance are investigated based on a combination of process and input-output analysis. The results show that producing ethanol and biodiesel require about 17-20 and 10 times more workers than gasoline and diesel as per energy content, respectively. Direct employment in agriculture contributes to more than 90% of total employment. Nevertheless, there are the significant differences in the characteristics of employment in the agriculture and biofuel processing sectors. The overall impacts of ethanol production in Thailand in year 2022 are the employment generation of around 238,700-382,400 person-years, 150 M$ additional GDP, imported goods worth 1583 M$ but 2547 M$ of imports would be saved if compared to petroleum fuels. The other socio-economic aspects such as agricultural improvement and rural development due to biofuels policy in Thailand and some policy measures that need to be urgently promoted are also discussed in the study. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The increasing use of liquid biofuels has been justified by highly volatile and rising oil prices, geopolitical instability of countries that control most of proven oil reserves, growing demand for passenger transportation and environmental concerns, especially climate change. Investments in the sector are increasing steadily, with oil majors being responsible for rising investments into liquid biofuel joint ventures, research and development projects and logistics. This paper analyses the underlying motivations of these investments by evaluating corporate diversification and integration strategies. Findings indicate that vertical integration and diversification are an integral part of oil major's strategic behavior toward biofuels, although strategies differ substantially among companies. In the short term current major oil companies' investments in liquid biofuels are driven by the requirement to comply with binding mandates for biofuels, whereas in the long-term liquid biofuels, if produced on a significant scale, could be classified as non-conventional liquid hydrocarbon reserves for oil majors where access to other (non-)conventional resources is not secured. Finally, given existing technology lock-ins it seems unlikely whether different paths for producing liquid biofuels will be able to co-exist in the long term, or there will be only one dominant path possibly controlled by large oil companies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Oil content of wild genotypes of Jatropha curcas L. collected from Assam, North East India, was studied. A total of 20 genotypes were used to investigate the oil content and variation in the oil content was found to be between 23.70 and 46.60%. Among them four high oil yielding genotypes was selected. Physicochemical properties of the oil and biodiesel obtained from those four genotypes were analyzed to check the suitability of these genotypes as potential candidate for biodiesel production. The gas chromatographic (GC) analysis showed amount of total monounsaturated fatty acid (oleic acid) is more in comparison to polyunsaturated fatty acid. 1H NMR profile of the oil and biodiesel demonstrated the successful conversion to methyl ester. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen and oxygen environment revealed the thermal and oxidative stability of oil and methyl esters. The obtained results were found to be within acceptable range of standards specifications of ASTM D6751, showing a promising source for biodiesel production in North East India. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Vegetable oil and fats can be considered as an important renewable source for the energy production. There are many applications where these biofuels are used directly in engines. However, the use of pure vegetable oils causes some problems as consequence of its chemical and physical characteristic. Viscosity is one of the most important parameters affecting several physical and mechanical processes of the operation of the engine. The determination of this parameter at different tis important to determine the behavior of the vegetable oil and fats. In this work we investigated the effects of two analytical chemical parameters (iodine number and saponification number) and forecasting models have been proposed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative diesel fuel produced through the transesterification of vegetable oils or animal fats and it is composed of esters with long chain fatty acids, unsaturated or saturated. Oxidation reactions determine the degradation of biodiesel, affecting its oxidative stability. The oxidation stability is determined by the property of fuel to resist to the chemical changes during storage. Chemical changes appear at the main qualitative indices: acid value, iodine number, refraction number, viscosity, induction period, cetane number and flash point. The use of natural and synthetic antioxidants may be a way to improve the oxidative stability of biodiesel. Although oils contain large amounts of natural antioxidants, they are lost during processing. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of the oil extracted from Medicago sativa on the oxidation of biodiesel produced from sunflower oil. Samples of biodiesel added to the oil extracted from Medicago sativa (1%) were stored for 12 months at room temperature. The acid value, the refraction number and the induction period were monthly determined. Gaseous emissions (CO, CO2, hydrocarbons, O2) released by burning biodiesel in a diesel monocyclic R Y50 engine, were determined using a COSTECH ECS 4010-CHNS-O device. Values obtained for samples of biodiesel in a mixture with oil from Medicago sativa showed increased stability to oxidation compared with that of pure biodiesel.

AB  - Biodiesel can be a potential alternative to petroleum diesel, but its high production cost has impeded its commercialization in most parts of the world. One of the main drivers for the generation and use of biodiesel is energy security, because this fuel can be produced from locally available resources, thereby reducing the dependence on imported oil. Many countries are now trying to produce biodiesel from plant or vegetable oils. However, the consumption of large amounts of vegetable oils for biodiesel production could result in a shortage in edible oils and cause food prices to soar. Alternatively, the use of animal fat, used frying oils, and waste oils from restaurants as feedstock could be a good strategy to reduce the cost. However, these limited resources might not meet the increasing demand for clean, renewable fuels. Therefore, recent research has been focused the use of residual materials as renewable feedstock in order to lower the cost of producing biodiesel. Microbial oils or single cell oils (SCOs), produced by oleaginous microorganisms have been studied as promising alternatives to vegetable or seed oils. Various types of agro-industrial residues have been suggested as prospective nutritional sources for microbial cultures. Since the most abundant residue from agricultural crops is lignocellulosic biomass (LCB), this byproduct has been given top-priority consideration as a source of biomass for producing biodiesel. But the biological transformation of lignocellulosic materials is complicated due to their crystalline structure. So, pretreatment is required before they can be converted into fermentable sugar. This article compares and scrutinizes the extent to which various microbes can accumulate high levels of lipids as functions of the starting materials and the fermentation conditions. Also, the obstacles associated with the use of LCB are described, along with a potentially viable approach for overcoming the obstacles that currently preclude the commercial production of biodiesel from agricultural biomass. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgal lipids are promising alternative feedstocks for biodiesel production. Scenedesmus sp. NJ-1, an oil-rich freshwater microalga isolated from Antarctica, was identified to be a suitable candidate to produce biodiesel in this study. This strain could grow at temperatures ranging from 4 to 35 °C. With regular decrease in nitrate concentration in the medium, large quantities of triacylglycerols accumulated under batch culture conditions detected by thin layer chromatography and BODIPY 505/515 fluorescent staining. Scenedesmus sp. NJ-1 achieved the average biomass productivity of 0.105 g l-1 d-1 (dry weight) and nearly the highest lipid content (35 % of dry cell weight) was reached at day 28 in the batch culture. Neutral lipids accounted for 78 % of total lipids, and C18:1 (n-9), C16:0 were the major fatty acids in total lipids, composing 37 and 20 % of total fatty acids of Scenedesmus sp. NJ-1 grown for 36 days, respectively. These results suggested that Scenedesmus sp. NJ-1 was a good source of microalgal oils for biodiesel production. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Investigation of soot and ash particulate matter deposited in diesel particulate filters (DPFs) operating with biofuel (B100) and diesel (pure diesel: B0 and diesel80/biofuel20 blend: B20) by means of optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) reveals the following: the rapeseed methyl ester biofuel used for this study contributes to ash production, mainly of Ca-S- and P-bearing compounds ranging in size between 50 and 300 nm. Smaller ash particles are less common and build aggregates. Ash is deposited on the inlet DPF surface, the inlet channel walls, and in B100-DPF at the plugged ends of inlet channels. The presence of Fe-Cr-Ni fragments, down to tens of nanometers in size within the ash is attributed to engine wear. Pt particles (50-400 nm large) within the ash indicate that the diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) upstream of the DPF shows aging effects. Radial cracks on the coating layer of the DOC confirm this assumption. The B100-DPF contains significantly less soot than B20 and B0. Based on the generally accepted view that soot reactivity correlates with the nanostructure of its primary particles, the length and curvature of graphene sheets from biofuel- and diesel-derived soot were measured and computed on the basis of HRTEM images. The results show that biofuel-derived soot can be more easily oxidized than diesel soot, not only during early formation but also during and after considerable particle growth. Differences in the graphene sheet separation distance, degree of crystalline order and size of primary soot particles between the two fuel types are in line with this inference. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2012.

AB  - High-cost downstream process is a major bottleneck for producing microalgal biodiesel at reasonable price. Conventional lipid extraction process necessitates biomass drying process, which requires substantial amount of energy. In this regard, lipid extraction from wet biomass must be an attractive solution. However, it is almost impossible to recover lipid directly from wet microalgae with current technology. In this study, we conceived osmotic shock treatment as a novel method to extract lipid efficiently. Osmotic shock treatment was applied directly to wet Chlamydomonas reinhardtii biomass with water content >99%, along with both polar and non-polar organic solvents. Our results demonstrated that osmotic shock could increase lipid recovery approximately 2 times. We also investigated whether the presence of cell wall or different cell stages could have any impact on lipid recovery. Cell wall-less mutant stains and senescent cell phase could display significantly increased lipid recovery. Taken together, our results suggested that osmotic shock is a promising technique for wet lipid extraction from microalgal biomass and successfully determined that specific manipulation of biomass in certain cell phase could enhance lipid recovery further. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Within the last decade efforts in geophysical detection and monitoring of fossil fuel releases into the subsurface have shown increasing success, including the ability to geophysically detect and delineate enhanced and natural biodegradation and remediation activities. The substitution of biofuels, such as ethanol, for fossil fuels is becoming persistent in the national and international marketplaces making it subject to the same types of accidental releases and exposure scenarios currently associated with the transport and storage of fossil fuels. Thus, there is interest from both academics and regulators to investigate the feasibility of applying geophysical methodologies to biofuel releases. In this study, we performed experimental and numerical investigations on the feasibility of using ground penetrating radar (GPR) to monitor the migration of an ethanol release. A tank scale model of a closed hydrologic system was prepared with Ottawa sand and instrumented with an automated gantry measurement apparatus for time-lapse measurement of zero offset and coincident GPR reflections on multiple horizontal planes. Measurements were acquired in the unsaturated and saturated zones throughout the injection and transport of the ethanol release. The results of the monitoring suggest a measureable contrast within both time and frequency domains of the GPR data coincident with the ethanol release and subsequent migration. We conclude that the monitoring of ethanol in a sand matrix at various levels of saturation is possible with GPR. © 2012.

AB  - The size distribution of elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC) and particle-phase PAHs emission from a direct injection diesel engine fueled with a waste cooking biodiesel, ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD, 10-ppm-wt), and low sulfur diesel (LSD, 400-ppm-wt) were investigated experimentally. The emission factor of biodiesel EC is 90.6. mg/kW. h, which decreases by 60.3 and 71.7%, compared with ULSD and LSD respectively and the mass mean diameter (MMD) of EC was also decreased with the use of biodiesel. The effect of biodiesel on OC emission might depend on the engine operation condition, and the difference in OC size distribution is not that significant among the three fuels. For biodiesel, its brake specific emission of particle-phase PAHs is obviously smaller than that from the two diesel fuels, and the reduction effect appears in almost all size ranges. In terms of size distribution, the MMD of PAHs from biodiesel is larger than that from the two diesel fuels, which could be attributed to the more effective reduction on combustion derived PAHs in nuclei mode. The toxicity analysis indicates that biodiesel could reduce the total PAHs emissions, as well as the carcinogenic potency of particle-phase PAHs in almost all the size ranges. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The traditional heating and microwave assisted method for biodiesel production using cation ion-exchange resin particles (CERP)/PES catalytic membrane were comparatively studied to achieve economic and effective method for utilization of free fatty acids (FFAs) from waste cooking oil (WCO). The optimal esterification conditions of the two methods were investigated and the experimental results showed that microwave irradiation exhibited a remarkable enhanced effect for esterification compared with that of traditional heating method. The FFAs conversion of microwave assisted esterification reached 97.4% under the optimal conditions of reaction temperature 60. °C, methanol/acidified oil mass ratio 2.0:1, catalytic membrane (annealed at 120. °C) loading 3. g, microwave power 360. W and reaction time 90. min. The study results showed that it is a fast, easy and green way to produce biodiesel applying microwave irradiation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the present study a laminar premixed ethylene flame was doped with different amounts of ethanol in order to understand the influence on biofuels in the total amount of particulate matter and the size distribution functions of the formed carbonaceous particles. Four different flames were investigated: one of pure ethylene as reference and three with an increased amount of ethanol, i.e. 10%, 20% and 30%. The equivalence ratio of the four flames was kept constant at 2.01. The particle size distribution functions were obtained using a nano-Differential Mobility Analyzer (nano-DMA). The results showed a general reduction of the total volume fraction of particulate when ethanol was added. The reduction of the formed particles increased as a function of the amount of ethanol added. The particle size distribution for pure ethylene flame and ethanol doped flames at different heights with the same amount of particles are quite similar. This indicates that in premixed flames, ethanol mostly affects gas phase chemistry and consequently the formation of incipient particles. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This article presents the results obtained in the combustion of samples of biofuels using a commercial burner. We first provide the chemical and physical characterisation of the most abundant biofuels in Spain whose combustion we intend to study: glycerine, used vegetable oil, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, soya oil and Animal By-products Not Intended for Human Consumption (ABNIHC) category 1 and 3 fats. We then classify the technologies used in the combustion of liquid fuels, specifying the main parameters that characterise their working parameters and the physical features of the liquid fuel, as recommended by the leading burner manufacturers. For each biofuel described, we choose the most appropriate burner technology for combustion, adopting two criteria, and we obtain suitable pulverisation as well as stable combustion. Finally, we present the results obtained in the combustion of the samples in a low pressure auxiliary air fluid pulverisation burner, the type of burner able to burn the widest range of biofuels. © 1012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Used palm oil collected from different restaurants in Tirunelveli region of south India was converted into methyl esters (biodiesel) by transesterification. Biodiesel produced from used palm oil was blended with diesel by different volume proportions (25%, 50% and 75%). Biodiesel and its blends were tested in a DI diesel engine at constant speed by varying loads (between 20% and 100%) to analyze its performance, emission and combustion profile. The results obtained were compared with diesel fuel. B25 and B50 showed performances similar to diesel fuel. Smoke density of B100 and B75 were lower than diesel by 19% and 10% at full load. At full load measured CO emission for B100 and B75 were 52.9% and 35.2% lower than diesel HC emission for B100 and B75 were 38.09% and 19.05% lower than diesel. NO X emission was higher for all biodiesel blends. B75 showed lower amount of emissions throughout the test. Ignition delay for B100, B75, B50 and B25 were 2.1°, 1.9°, 1.7° and 1° lower than diesel. Combustion profile was smoother and no knocking was experienced while operating with biodiesel blends. B50 produced peak cylinder pressure. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative to petroleum diesel fuel. It is a renewable, biodegradable, and nontoxic biofuel. Interest in the production of biodiesel from Jatropha curcas L. seeds has increased in recent years, but the ability of J. curcas to grow in salt-prone areas, such as the Caatinga semiarid region, has received considerably meager attention. The aim of this study was to identify the main physiological processes that can elucidate the pattern of responses of J. curcas irrigated with saline water, which commonly occurs in the semiarid Caatinga region. This study measured the activity of the antioxidant enzymes involved in the scavenging of reactive oxygen species, which include catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. The levels of chlorophyll (Chl), carotenoids, amino acids, proline, and soluble proteins were also analyzed. The net carbon assimilation rate (PN), stomata conductance (gs), and transpiration rate (E) decreased with salt stress. The activities of CAT and APX were decreased, while H2O2 and MDA levels as well as electrolyte leakage were significantly increased in salt-stressed plants compared to the untreated ones. These observations suggest that the ability of J. curcas plants resist to salt stress is associated with the activities of protective enzymes and their defensive functions. However, our results indicate that the reactive oxygen species scavenging system is not sufficient to protect J. curcas leaves against oxidative damage caused by salt stress, and, therefore, it cannot be treated as a salt tolerant plant species.

AB  - Taking into consideration the importance of the necessity of the reduction of the greenhouses gases emitted into the free atmosphere from combustion processes, and the environmental impact resulted when bio-fuels are used in small-scale cogeneration plants to produce energy a research was accomplished to depict solutions to reduce the CO 2 exhaust. The focal point is the analysis of the behaviour of a small-scale cogeneration plant in terms of emissions, especially CO 2, when the primary energy source is replaced by a blended fuel consisting of bio-butanol and diesel. The paper focuses thus on results regarding the CO 2 potential reduction when using bio-butanol.

AB  - As part of the United States Navy green energy initiative, engineers at Rolls-Royce and NAVSEA conducted a combustion assessment for a blend of 50 algae-derived HRD76 biofuel and 50 conventional F76 military diesel. The assessment consisted of combustion rig testing with Rolls-Royce Model 501-K34 gas turbine combustion system hardware. Identical tests were performed with the biofuel blend and a baseline fuel consisting of 100 F76 military diesel. The test results quantified the impact of the alternative fuel blend on ignition, lean blow-out, combustor exit temperature profile, combustion system hardware temperatures, primary zone flame radiance, carbon deposition, and emissions. This paper discusses the methods and results of the combustion rig tests. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - In-use emission rates for a marine vessel operating on hydrotreated algae biofuel are reported for the first time. Emission measurements were made on a four-stroke marine diesel engine from a Stalwart class vessel to compare the emission profile from burning ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) to a 50:50 blend of ULSD and algae biofuel (A50). In-use emission measurements followed the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 8178-4 D2 certification test cycle protocol. Particulate matter (PM 2.5), nitrogen oxides (NO x), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO 2) were sampled in accordance with the ISO 8178-2 protocol for each mode of the test cycle. Switching fuel from ULSD to A50 resulted in significant ∼35% lower PM 2.5 emissions for 25 and 50% load and an overall weighted PM 2.5 reduction of ∼25%. Overall reductions of 30 and 20% were observed in elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC), respectively. PM 2.5 was dominated by OC (77-94%) for both fuels. NO x emissions were reduced by ∼10% on switching from ULSD to A50. Overall, the emissions of CO 2 and CO were reduced by 5 and 18%, indicating a slight improvement in fuel economy for this engine while operating on A50. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - To mitigate the diesel particle pollution problem, diesel vehicles are fitted with modern exhaust after-treatment systems (ATS), which efficiently remove engine-generated primary particles (soot and ash) and gaseous hydrocarbons. Unfortunately, ATS can promote formation of low-vapor-pressure gases, which may undergo nucleation and condensation leading to formation of nucleation particles (NUP). The chemical nature and formation mechanism of these particles are only poorly explored. Using a novel mass spectrometric method, online measurements of low-vapor-pressure gases were performed for exhaust of a modern heavy-duty diesel engine operated with modern ATS and combusting low and ultralow sulfur fuels and also biofuel. It was observed that the gaseous sulfuric acid (GSA) concentration varied strongly, although engine operation was stable. However, the exhaust GSA was observed to be affected by fuel sulfur level, exhaust after-treatment, and driving conditions. Significant GSA concentrations were measured also when biofuel was used, indicating that GSA can be originated also from lubricant oil sulfur. Furthermore, accompanying NUP measurements and NUP model simulations were performed. We found that the exhaust GSA promotes NUP formation, but also organic (acidic) precursor gases can have a role. The model results indicate that that the measured GSA concentration alone is not high enough to grow the particles to the detected sizes. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, the bio-fuel was prepared from raw Cashew Nut Shell liquid (CNSL) by distillation process subjectedto different temperatures. The biofuel, diesel and ethanolblends (BDEB) were prepared and tested in a single cylinder Direct-Injection (DI) diesel engine to investigate the performance and emission characteristics of the engine under five engine loads at the speed of 1500rpm. Here the ethanol is used as an additive to enhance the combustion. The mixture of Commercial diesel, bio-fuel from CNSL and ethanol mixture called BDEB is used to run the direct injection diesel engine. The different combination of BDEB namely BDEB 5 (Diesel75%, CNSL 20% and Ethanol 5%), BDEB 10 (Diesel70%, CNSL 20% and Ethanol 10%) and BDEB15 (Diesel 65%, CNSL 20% and Ethanol 15%), were tested in the engine. The results are compared with neat diesel operation. The effect of test fuels on engine brake specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency, Carbon monoxide (CO), Hydrocarbon (HC), and Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) emissions was investigated. The experimental results showed that the emissions of CO, HC decreased and NOx increased. The brake thermal efficiency, exhaust gas temperature, Brake specific fuel consumption increased for BDEB15 as compared to other combination of fuel namely BDEB5 and BEB10. The results proved that the use of BDEB in compression ignition engine is a viable alternative fuel to diesel with less HC and CO emissions. © Research India Publications.

AB  - In this study, an alternative diesel fuel, of which chemical modification was made by transesterification with short chain methyl alcohols, was produced from cottonseed oil. The modified products were then evaluated according to their fuel chemical properties as compared to diesel fuel. The purpose of this study is to investigate the emission characteristics of the fuel blend of 75% cottonseed oil methyl ester with 25% diesel fuel in a single cylinder unmodified diesel engine. The effects of biofuel and diesel fuel blend on a direct injected, four strokes, and single cylinder diesel engine exhaust emissions were studied. The results showed on the emissions of the engine that there was about 36% reduction in CO, about 18% reduction in CO 2, and about 15% reduction in NOx. These results show that B75 fuel has better emission characteristics than diesel fuel. The reduction exhaust emissions made B75 a suitable alternative fuel for diesel engines and could help in controlling air pollution. © 2012 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The effects of growing Jatropha in on-farm and on-station degraded lands were evaluated on carbon (C) sequestration and soil properties. Jatropha accumulated and added to soil significant amounts of C (305kgha -1year -1) from the year one itself. Overall, a 3-5-year old plantation added per year around 4000kg plant biomass equivalent to 1450kgCha -1 - 800kg C through leaves, 150kg C through pruned twigs, and 495kg C as deoiled Jatropha cake. Biodiesel C replacement in the fossil fuel was 230kgha -1. Besides adding biomass to the soil, and C replacement in fossil fuel; the standing Jatropha rendered ecosystem service by fixing 5100-6100kgha -1C as the aboveground plus belowground biomass. Carbon additions by Jatropha during 4 years increased C content in the degraded surface soil layer by 19%, resulting in about 2500kgha -1C sequestered. Huge C additions and live root activity under Jatropha increased microbial population, respiration rate and microbial biomass C and N in soil. Along with C additions, 4000kgha -1year -1 plant biomass recycled into the soil 85.5kg nitrogen, 7.67kg phosphorus, 43.9kg potassium, 5.20kg sulphur, 0.11kg boron, 0.12kg zinc and other nutrients. The C additions improved water holding capacity of the soil under Jatropha as compared with the adjacent control soil which increased by 35% at 30kPa and 21% at 1500kPa soil water potential. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Exposure to fine fractions of particulate matter (PM 2.5) is associated with increased hospital admissions and mortality for respiratory and cardiovascular disease in children and the elderly. This study aims to estimate the toxicological risk of PM2.5 from biomass burning in children and adolescents between the age of 6 and 14 in Tangará da Serra, a municipality of Subequatorial Brazilian Amazon. Methods. Risk assessment methodology was applied to estimate the risk quotient in two scenarios of exposure according to local seasonality. The potential dose of PM2.5 was estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation, stratifying the population by age, gender, asthma and Body Mass Index (BMI). Results: Male asthmatic children under the age of 8 at normal body rate had the highest risk quotient among the subgroups. The general potential average dose of PM 2.5 was 1.95μg/kg.day (95% CI: 1.62 - 2.27) during the dry scenario and 0.32μg/kg.day (95% CI: 0.29 - 0.34) in the rainy scenario. During the dry season, children and adolescents showed a toxicological risk to PM2.5 of 2.07μg/kg.day (95% CI: 1.85 - 2.30). Conclusions: Children and adolescents living in the Subequatorial Brazilian Amazon region were exposed to high levels of PM2.5 resulting in toxicological risk for this multi-pollutant. The toxicological risk quotients of children in this region were comparable or higher to children living in metropolitan regions with PM2.5 air pollution above the recommended limits to human health. © 2012 de Oliveira et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Recent developments in synthetic biology are described and characterized as moving the era of biotechnology into platform technologies. Platform technologies enable rapid and diffuse innovations and simultaneous product development in diffuse markets, often targeting sectors of the economy that have traditionally been thought to have little relationship to one another. In the case of synthetic biology, pharmaceutical and biofuel product development are occurring interactively. But the regulatory and ethical issues associated with these two applications share very little overlap. As such, there is some risk that focus on traditional medical applications, for which the ethical expertise is highly developed, will overshadow the ethical issues that arise in connection with land use and its attendant socioeconomic consequences, especially in the developing world. The 2010 report of the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethics exhibits this tendency. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Background: Lipids produced from filamentous fungi show great promise for biofuel production, but a major limiting factor is the high production cost attributed to feedstock. Lignocellulosic biomass is a suitable feedstock for biofuel production due to its abundance and low value. However, very limited study has been performed on lipid production by culturing oleaginous fungi with lignocellulosic materials. Thus, identification of filamentous fungal strains capable of utilizing lignocellulosic hydrolysates for lipid accumulation is critical to improve the process and reduce the production cost. Results: The growth performances of eleven filamentous fungi were investigated when cultured on glucose and xylose. Their dry cell weights, lipid contents and fatty acid profiles were determined. Six fungal strains with high lipid contents were selected to culture with the hydrolysate from dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment of wheat straw. The results showed that all the selected fungal strains were able to grow on both detoxified liquid hydrolysate (DLH) and non-detoxified liquid hydrolysate (NDLH). The highest lipid content of 39.4% was obtained by Mortierella isabellina on NDLH. In addition, NDLH with some precipitate could help M. isabellina form pellets with an average diameter of 0.11 mm. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the possibility of fungal lipid production from lignocellulosic biomass. M. isabellina was the best lipid producer grown on lignocellulosic hydrolysates among the tested filamentous fungi, because it could not only accumulate oils with a high content by directly utilizing NDLH to simplify the fermentation process, but also form proper pellets to benefit the downstream harvesting. Considering the yield and cost, fungal lipids from lignocellulosic biomass are promising alternative sources for biodiesel production. © 2012 Zheng et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The main objective of the present work was to investigate the influence of additive 2-ethylhexyl-nitrate (2-EHN) on the characteristics of auto-ignition and combustion of rapeseed oil (used as biofuel in diesel engines). The biofuel for diesel engines must meet several goals: to ensure a safe and fast engine start at any environmental temperature, to allow a safe operation of the engine with a yield as high as possible, to burn completely without producing harmful substances for human health, while maintaining the properties. In this sense, the purpose of the experimental research has been to determine: cetane number, ignition delay, the start of the main combustion, the combustion period of crude and filtered rapeseed oil additived in proportions of 1%, 1.5% and 2% with 2-ethylhexyl-nitrate compared with diesel fuel (witness fuel).

AB  - The work characterizes the changes in volatile and semivolatile PM emissions from a gas turbine engine resulting from burning alternative fuels, specifically gas-to-liquid (GTL), coal-to-liquid (CTL), a blend of Jet A-1 and GTL, biodiesel, and diesel, to the standard Jet A-1. The data presented here, compares the mass spectral fingerprints of the different fuels as measured by the Aerodyne high resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer. There were three sample points, two at the exhaust exit plane with dilution added at different locations and another probe located 10 m downstream. For emissions measured at the downstream probe when the engine was operating at high power, all fuels produced chemically similar organic PM, dominated by C xHy fragments, suggesting the presence of long chain alkanes. The second largest contribution came from CxH yOz fragments, possibly from carbonyls or alcohols. For the nondiesel fuels, the highest loadings of organic PM were from the downstream probe at high power. Conversely, the diesel based fuels produced more organic material at low power from one of the exit plane probes. Differences in the composition of the PM for certain fuels were observed as the engine power decreased to idle and the measurements were made closer to the exit plane. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The main aim of this study is to reduce the use of petroleum diesel by using domestic renewable sources such as waste oil as fuel. Ever increasing of diesel engine usage due to its higher fuel efficiency can cause severe environmental damage particularly urban areas. Rapid growth of population, urbanization and industrialization are the main factors which increase the air pollutants particularly CO2 emission to the environment. Continuous addition of CO2 emission to atmosphere is responsible for the formation of global warming, acid rain and cancer risks etc. Biodiesel is the primary source to solve the entire above problems. Because it is a renewable, low polluted, non-toxic, biodegradable well known alternative fuel to diesel engines. Presently most of the biodiesel fuels are produced from food grade oils only. Biodiesel from food oils can cause food oil crisis and increases the production cost of biodiesel. This will encourage the development of biodiesel from cheapest sources like non-edible oils and waste oils. Therefore present investigation was made to produce biodiesel fuel from waste oil and the important fuel properties were analyzed.

AB  - Depleting fossil resources, a constantly rising energy demand and worries about greenhouse gas emissions force society to explore novel concepts for future mobile propulsion. In the context of biofuels, the identification of novel, sustainably producible, tailored molecules meeting the property specifications derived from advanced engine combustion concepts therefore constitutes a major objective. Due to the tremendous amount of possible molecular structures, solely experimental search strategies are infeasible and highlight the need for a computer-aided biofuel identification framework. To this end, a holistic approach for deriving truly predictive Quantitative-Structure-Property-Relationships (QSPRs) for engine-relevant fuel properties is presented. Such QSPRs are combined with a rigorous generation of molecular structures aiming at identification of single-compound fuel candidates for use in compression ignition (CI) engines. Besides addressing thermophysical fuel properties relevant to CI engines, an accurate QSPR model for the cetane number has been established and integrated into the fuel identification framework. A comprehensive list of potential CI fuel molecules is generated automatically and subsequently screened by sequentially applying property constraints to identify those compounds predicted to exhibit all desired physicochemical properties. In conjunction with the rigorous generation of structures, the outlined holistic QSPR methodology thus represents a feasible strategy for rapid computer-aided identification of fuel candidates tailored for optimal engine performance. © 2012 SAE International.

AB  - A novel hydrothermal catalytic liquefaction process for Chlorella pyrenoidosa was studied in the paper to explore the new resources of bio-fuel. The effects of catalytic liquefaction temperature, reaction time and catalyst on the yield of bio-fuel were investigated, and the reaction conditions were optimized via orthogonal optimization method. The chemical groups and components of final bio-fuel were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that the optimal reaction was taken place at 300°C for 20 minutes as Ce/HZSM-5 was selected as a catalyst with 5% mass fraction and the volume ratio of Chlorella pyrenoidosa to solvent was 1:10. The maximum liquefaction yield reached to 39.87% and the heating value of final bio-fuel was up to 26.09 MJ/kg. The main components of bio-fuel from Chlorella pyrenoidosa contained alcohol, ester derivatives and some hydrocarbons. Compared with other lignocellulosic bio-fuels, the prepared bio-fuel can be regarded as an alternative diesel fuel because of their similar chemical components and higher heat value. The research is helpful for the preparation of bio-fuel from microalgaes.

AB  - A promising renewable energy scenario involves growing photosynthetic microalgae as a biofuel feedstock that can be converted into fungible, energy-dense fuels. Microalgae transform the energy in sunlight into a variety of reduced-carbon storage products, including triacylglycerols, which can be readily transformed into diesel fuel surrogates. To develop an economically viable algal biofuel industry, it is important to maximize the production and accumulation of these targeted bioenergy carriers in selected strains. In an effort to identify promising feedstock isolates we developed, evaluated and optimized contemporary high-throughput cell-sorting techniques to establish a collection of microalgae isolated from highly diverse ecosystems near geographic areas that are potential sites for large-scale algal cultivation in the Southwest United States. These efforts resulted in a culture collection containing 360 distinct microalgal strains. We report on the establishment of this collection and some preliminary qualitative screening studies to identify important biofuel phenotypes including neutral lipid accumulation and growth rates. As part of this undertaking we determined suitable cultivation media and evaluated cryopreservation techniques critical for the long-term storage of the microorganisms in this collection. This technique allows for the rapid isolation of extensive strain biodiversity that can be leveraged for the selection of promising bioenergy feedstock strains, as well as for providing fundamental advances in our understanding of fundamental algal biology. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ethylene glycol monobutyl ether palm oil monoester (EGMEPM) was synthesized through transesterification with palm oil and Ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (EGME). Through L 9(3 4) orthogonal experiments, optimum transesterification conditions were gained as: n(EGME):n(palm oil) = 10:1, w(metal sodium) = 1.2% total amount of alcohol at 70°C for 120 min. EGMEPM yielded 85.7%. The new biofuel had a high cetane number (77), good solubility, and a large flash point. Engine combustion experiment testified that burning the novel bioenergy has little influence on engine operation. Compared with 0# diesel fuel, the pressure lifting ratio reduced 2.9%-23.9% for B25 blends and 12.8%-38.9% for the novel bioenergy (B100), and the maximal instantaneous heat release rate lowered by 11.6%-33.3% for B25 and by 26.8%-42.7% for B100, respectively. When the diesel engine burnt B100 under partial loads at 1400 rpm, smoke, CO, HC, and NO X emissions were reduced.Copyright © Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Present study describes optimized production of waste cooking oil biodiesel (WCOB) using chemical and enzymatic transesterification. Maximum WCOB yield was 89% for chemical transesterification catalyzed by NaOCH 3 and 95.9% for enzymatic transesterification using NOVOZYME-435. Optimized WCOB yield was procured for chemical transesterification when reactions were performed for 90 min at 45C using 0.75% NaOCH 3 and 6:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, whereas, enzymatic transesterification at 32.50C for 60 h using 0.75% NOVOZYME-435 and 6:1 methanol: oil molar ratio. When compared the exhaust emission levels from diesel engine exhaust operated on conventional diesel fuel with the waste cooking oil biodiesel blends (WCOB), a notable reduction (%) in CO and PM levels was observed for WCOB5, WCOB20, WCOB40, WCOB50, WCOB80, and WCOB100 whereas in case of NOx emissions reduction (%) was observed only in case of WCOB5, WCOB20, and WCOB40, respectively.

AB  - This study used pure fossil diesel (D100) and a 20% (v/v, volume percent) waste-edible-oil-biodiesel blend (W20, 20% waste-edible-oil-biodiesel + 80% diesel) as the fuels for a generator to investigate the mass concentrations of various sized PMs (PM0.01-0.056 (nano particles), PM0.01-0.1 (ultrafine particles), PM0.01-1 (submicron particles), PM0.01-2.5 (fine particles), PM0.01-10 and PM0.01-18) and particle-bound carbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and PAHs' toxicity equivalences (BaPeq) in generator emissions. The engine load was set as either 0 or 3 kW. MOUDIs and Nano-MOUDIs were used as the samplers. Human male single cells (U937) and the method MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide) were used to test the cell toxicity of particle extracts (obtained from organic-solvent extraction). The results showed that, compared with D100, using W20 effectively reduced the PM (by 21.0-72.8%), particulate EC (by 2.69-57.3%), particulate OC (by 30.8-47.5%), Total-PAHs (by 64.1-81.9%), and Total-BaPeq (by 70.9-92.6%) in all sized particles emitted from the diesel generator, regardless of engine load. The reduction of PM0.01-18 (81.3%) was higher in the lung respirable accumulation mode particles (PM0.1-1). Regardless of fuel and loading, the emitted PM0.01-18 exhibited a single-modal distribution and peaked in the submicron size range (0.18-0.32 μm). Compared with no engine load, with the exception of PM0.01-0.1 and PM0.01-0.056, the OC contents of various particle sizes in PM at 3 kW engine load using D100 and W20 were all reduced (by 13.3-15.0% and 28.9-31.7%, respectively), while the EC content increased (by 27.5-29.1% and 37.9-41.4%, respectively). Moreover, the cell toxicity to U937 (per μg PM) of particle extract was higher for nano (PM0.01-0.056) and ultrafine (PM0.056-0.1) particles than for the other sized ones. However, compared with D100, using W20 could reduce the cell toxicity to U937 (per μg PM) of extracts from all sized particles, especially for nano and ultrafine particles (reduction = 32-46%) at 3 kW engine load. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.

AB  - This paper is a study on the effects on the amounts of trace elements in case of possible repeat accidental or environmental exposure with fish oil biodiesel. For this purpose, 35 male Wistar albino rats were used in the study. Rats were divided into five groups. The first group was determined as the control group. The rats in this group were gavaged orally with 250 mg/kg sunflower oil. The rats in the second and third groups were administered by oral gavage of 250 mg/kg (D1) and 500 mg/kg (D2) diesel fuel mixed with equal amounts of sunflower oil, respectively. The rats in the fourth group were administered by oral gavage of 250 mg/kg fish oil biodiesel (F1) and the rats in the fifth group were administered by oral gavage of 500 mg/kg fish oil biodiesel (F2), both mixed with equal amounts of sunflower oil. At the end of the study, bioelement concentrations in the serum and the kidney, lung, and liver tissues were measured using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy. It was observed that serum Ca, Mg, and Sr concentrations were significantly (p < 0.001) higher and Cu concentration was significantly (p < 0.01) higher in the control group than in the biodiesel groups. Kidney Mg concentration was significantly (p < 0.01) lower in the control group than in the diesel groups. Kidney Mg concentration was significantly (p < 0.001) lower in the D2 group than in the F2 group. Kidney Mg concentration was significantly (p < 0.01) lower in the control group than in the diesel groups. Lung Cd, Co, Cu, Cr, Na, and Zn concentrations were different significantly higher in the control group than in the other groups. Liver Al concentration was different significantly higher in the control group than in the other groups. Liver Ca concentration was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the control group than in the biodiesel groups. Serum and lung tissue bioelements concentrations were lower in diesel and biodiesel groups than in control group. Due to consumption for biochemical reaction of these elements, bioelements concentration could be low in diesel and biodiesel groups. Some trace elements concentrations in the kidney and liver were very high in the diesel groups. High concentration of these elements in the diesel groups might cause toxic effects. Fish oil biodiesel could be chosen as an alternative fuel instead of diesel fuel. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - To evaluate the potential of the green agla Chlorella zofingiensis as a feedstock for biodiesel production, the effects of nitrogen and phosphate on lipid accumulation and growth of C. zofingiensis were studied. The maximum specific growth rate (μmax) reached 2.15 day-1 when the concentration of NaNO3 and K2HPO4·3H2O was 1.0 g L-1 and 0.01 g L-1, respectively. The lipid contents of C. zofingiensis grown in media deficient of nitrogen (65.1%) or phosphate (44.7%) were both higher than that obtained from cells grown in full medium (33.5%). The highest lipid productivity (87.1 mg L-1 day-1) was also obtained from cells grown in nitrogen deficient media, indicating nitrogen deficiency was more effective than phosphate deficiency for inducing lipid accumulation in C. zofingiensis. In addition, the feasibility of cultivating the alga in 60 L flat plate photobioreactors and 10 L bottles outdoors for biodiesel was also tested. It was found that C. zofingiensis could adapt to fluctuating temperatures and irradiance of outdoors and the highest μmax and lipid productivity could reach 0.362 day-1 and 26.6 mg L-1 day-1 outdoors, respectively. The lipid production potential of C. zofingiensis is projected to be 31.1 kg ha-1 day-1 in outdoor culture. These results suggested that C. zofingiensis is a promising organism for feedstock production of biofuel and can be used in scaled up culture outdoors. © 2012 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

AB  - A well-to-wheels life cycle analysis on total energy consumptions and greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions for alternative fuels and accompanying vehicle technologies has been carried out for the base year 2010 and projected to 2020 based on data gathered and estimates developed for China. The fuels considered include gasoline, diesel, natural gas, liquid fuels from coal conversion, methanol, bio-ethanol and biodiesel, electricity and hydrogen. Use of liquid fuels including methanol and Fischer-Tropsch derived from coal will significantly increase GHG emissions relative to use of conventional gasoline. Use of starch-based bio-ethanol will incur a substantial carbon disbenefit because of the present highly inefficient agricultural practice and plant processing in China. Electrification of vehicles via hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV) and battery electric vehicle technologies offers a progressively improved prospect for the reduction of energy consumption and GHG emission. However, the long-term carbon emission reduction is assured only when the needed electricity is generated by zero- or low-carbon sources, which means that carbon capture and storage is a necessity for fossil-based feedstocks. A PHEV that runs on zero- or low-carbon electricity and cellulosic ethanol may be one of the most attractive fuel-vehicle options in a carbon-constrained world. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas (Jatropha) is a tropical shrub that is gaining popularity as a biofuel feedstock plant. Phorbol esters (PEs) are tetracyclic tiglian diterpenoids that are present in Jatropha seeds and other parts of plant. Epidermal cell irritating and cancer promoting PEs not only reduce commercial values of Jatropha seed cake but also cause some safety and environment concerns on PE leaching to soil. A simple bioassay of PE toxicity was conducted by incubating 48h old brine shrimp (Artemia salina) nauplii with Jatropha oil for 24h. 1-4% of Jatropha oil (corresponding to PE concentration of 25-100mgL-1) had mortality rate of 5-95%, with LC50 estimated to be 2.7% of oil or 67mgL-1 of PE. Jatropha oil was incubated with clay or black soil (autoclaved or non-autoclaved) in the darkness or under sunlight for different periods of time before oil was re-extracted and tested for PE content by HPLC and for remaining toxicity with the brine shrimp bioassay. Under sunlight, PE decreased to non-detectable level within six days. Toxicity reduced to less than 5% mortality rate that is comparable to rapeseed oil control within the same period. In contrast, PE level and toxicity remained little changed when Jatropha oil was incubated in the darkness. Such PE degradation/detoxification was also found independent of the presence of soil or soil microorganisms. We conclude that sunlight directly degrades and detoxifies PEs and this finding should alleviate the concern on long term environmental impact of PE leaching. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A low cost method to convert triglycerides to biodiesel by transesterification reaction has been investigated. The new approach is based on controlled feeding of oil into a pool of alcohol allowing easy dispersion of oil creating large interfacial area for mass transfer. It also enabled equilibrium constants to shift in the forward direction due to excess of alcohol in the dispersion. As a result product yield higher than 95% could be achieved at lower energy input compared to conventional method. Comparisons made with conventional batch and co-solvent enabled method show differences and highlight improvements. Reactions were conducted in one liter reactor at various residence time, temperature and molar ratio of canola oil with methanol in presence of potassium hydroxide as the catalyst. Samples were collected at regular intervals and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) to determine the reaction progress. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae have been considered as a promising feedstock for biofuels and greenhouse gas reduction. A low-cost harvesting technology without secondary contamination for down-stream extraction is a key requirement to make algal biofuel commercially viable. A novel harvesting method using ammonia as a flocculant to make the algal biomass settable was devised and studied. Another major advantage of this approach is that the ammonia added will be reused as fertilizer in the subsequent cultures. The results indicated that ammonia-induced flocculation led to more than 99% removal of algae at 12h. The OD600 of algae growing in the ammonia-enriched flocculation medium treated with heating and CO2 was 2 times than that of initial after 6days. These results suggested that this flocculation method was efficient, convenient and allowed the reuse of the flocculated medium, therefore providing an option for economic harvesting and cultivation of microalgae. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A novel green microalgae strain from Lake Fuxian has been isolated and identified as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production. The novel strain was named Monoraphidium sp. FXY-10 based on its morphological and genomic characterization. The lipid productivities, fatty acid profiles, and microalgae recovery efficiency (ηa) of FXY-10 were investigated and compared under autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions. FXY-10 under autotrophic conditions exhibited a higher cellular lipid content (56.8%) than those under heterotrophic conditions (37.56%). However, FXY-10 growing under heterotrophic conditions exhibited more than 20-fold increase in lipid productivity compared with that under autotrophic conditions (148.74mgL-1d-1 versus 6.88mgL-1d-1). Moreover, higher saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (77.5%) of FXY-10 was obtained under heterotrophic culture conditions, suggesting its potential as a biodiesel feedstock. Gravity sedimentation was proposed as the harvesting biomass method based on the 97.9% microalgae recovery efficiency of heterotrophic cells after settling for 24h. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of the present work was to evaluate waste-to-energy technology for the utilization of crude glycerol (84.5% purity) surplus, collected by the largest Lithuanian biodiesel plants. The research examined the use of glycerol and woody (timber) cutting waste (WCW) to produce fuel briquettes. Two ratios of glycerol mass share 10% and 20% per unit volume were proposed as a partial substitute for WCW in briquette production process, thus solving glycerol utilization problems present in Lithuania. Proposed volumes of additive are in strong agreement with EN 14961-1. Affirmative proportions for interfusion of input materials, durability rating of fuel briquettes, characterization of combustion regimes and emission characteristics were assessed based on their composition. The optimum fuel properties were demonstrated by WCW briquettes containing maximum 10% glycerol mass concentration. Combustion of such briquettes exposed low CO, SO 2 and NO X emission levels, falling under requirements of LAND 43-2001. Further increase in glycerol share is not recommendable, in the larger part due to the decrease in physical-mechanical properties, but not from emission constrains. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bio-oil must be upgraded to be suitable for use as a high-grade transport fuel. Crude bio-oil has a high content of carboxylic acids which can cause corrosion, and the high oxygen content of these acids also reduces the oil's heating value. In this paper, acetic acid and propanoic acid were chosen as the model carboxylic acids in bio-oil. Their behavior in the production of liquid hydrocarbons during a catalytic conversion process was investigated in a micro-fixed bed reactor. The liquid organic phase from this catalytic conversion process mainly consisted of liquid hydrocarbons and phenol derivatives. Under the condition of low Liquid Hourly Space Velocity (LHSV), the liquid organic phase from acetic acid cracking had a selectivity of 22% for liquid hydrocarbons and a selectivity of 65% for phenol derivatives. The composition of the organic products changed considerably with the LHSV increasing to 3 h -1. The selectivity for liquid hydrocarbons increased up to 52% while that for phenol derivatives decreased to 32%. Propanoic acid performed much better in producing liquid hydrocarbons than acetic acid. Its selectivity for liquid hydrocarbons was as high as 80% at LHSV = 3 h -1. A mechanism for this catalytic conversion process was proposed according to the analysis of the components in the liquid organic phases. The pathways of the main compounds formation in the liquid organic phases were proposed, and the reason why liquid hydrocarbons were more effectively produced when using propanoic acid rather than acetic acid was also successfully explained. In addition, BET and SEM characterization were used to analyze the catalyst coke deposition. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pyrolysis of biomass followed by hydroprocessing may provide infrastructure-compatible transportation fuels. In this work, a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the production of gasoline and diesel from forest residues via fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing, from production of the feedstock to end use of the fuel in a vehicle, is performed. The fast pyrolysis and subsequent hydrotreating and hydrocracking processes are based on a Pacific Northwest National Laboratory design report. Stages other than biofuels conversion, including forest residue production and harvesting, preprocessing, feedstock transportation, fuel distribution, and vehicle operation, are based on previous work. Probability distribution functions are assumed for parameters involved in the pyrolysis process for Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis. This LCA for the production of gasoline and diesel via pyrolysis and upgrading assumes grid electricity is used and supplemental natural gas is supplied to the hydrogen plant. Gasoline and diesel produced via pyrolysis are estimated to have greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of CO 2 equivalent of 117 g km -1 and 98 g km -1, respectively, and net energy value (NEV) of 1.09 MJ km -1 and 0.92 MJ km -1, respectively. All values from the uncertainty analysis have lower GHG emissions and higher NEV than conventional gasoline in 2005. Grid electricity and natural gas used account for 81% of the net GHG emissions in the base case. An evaluation of a case with biomass-derived electricity shows significant improvement in GHG emissions. © 2012.

AB  - The search for alternative sources of energy, such as biodiesel, has been stimulated, since this biofuel is highly susceptible for biodegradation and has low toxicity, thus, reducing the impact in ecosystems. The objective of this study was to select a bacterial consortium with potential for degrading diesel/biodiesel blends (B20) obtained from areas contaminated with hydrocarbons/esters. In order to evaluate the biodegrability of the blend, six enzyme assays were conducted: alkane hydroxylase, Catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, Protocatechol 3,4-dioxygenase, ρ-NPA hydrolysis (esterase), and release of fatty acids through titration (lipase), with estimative of total protein and biosurfactant production (surface tension measurement and emulsifying index E24). The best results obtained allowed the selection of four bacteria isolates (Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus pumilus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) for compiling a consortium, which will be used for bioaugmentation strategies in soils contaminated with these fuels. This consortium exhibited high potential for biodegradation of biodiesel, and might be an efficient alternative for cleaning up these contaminated environments.

AB  - The concentration and composition of PAHs emitted from biomass cooking fuel were characterized in a rural non-smoking household in northern China. Twenty-two parent PAHs (pPAHs), 12 nitro-PAHs (nPAHs), and 4 oxy-PAHs (oPAHs) were measured in the kitchen, bedroom, and outdoors during both summer and winter. The most severe contamination occurred in the kitchen in the winter, where the daily mean concentrations of pPAHs, nPAHs, and oPAHs were 7500 ± 4100, 38 ± 29, and 8400 ± 9200 ng/m 3, respectively. Our results suggest that the nPAHs were largely from secondary formation in ambient air while oPAHs were either from primary emission of biomass burning or secondary formation from pPAHs in the kitchen. The daily mean benzo(a)pyrene equivalent exposure concentration was as high as 200 ± 160 ng/m 3 in the winter for the housewife who did the cooking compared to 59 ± 37 ng/m 3 for the control group that did not cook. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: One of the major areas for increasing the use of renewable energy is in traffic fuels e.g. bio-based fuels in diesel engines especially in commuter traffic. Exhaust emissions from fossil diesel fuelled engines are known to cause adverse effects on human health, but there is very limited information available on how the new renewable fuels may change the harmfulness of the emissions, especially particles (PM). We evaluated the PM emissions from a heavy-duty EURO IV diesel engine powered by three different fuels; the toxicological properties of the emitted PM were investigated. Conventional diesel fuel (EN590) and two biodiesels were used - rapeseed methyl ester (RME, EN14214) and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) either as such or as 30% blends with EN590. EN590 and 100% HVO were also operated with or without an oxidative catalyst (DOC + POC). A bus powered by compressed natural gas (CNG) was included for comparison with the liquid fuels. However, the results from CNG powered bus cannot be directly compared to the other situations in this study.Results: High volume PM samples were collected on PTFE filters from a constant volume dilution tunnel. The PM mass emission with HVO was smaller and with RME larger than that with EN590, but both biofuels produced lower PAH contents in emission PM. The DOC + POC catalyst greatly reduced the PM emission and PAH content in PM with both HVO and EN590. Dose-dependent TNFα and MIP-2 responses to all PM samples were mostly at the low or moderate level after 24-hour exposure in a mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Emission PM from situations with the smallest mass emissions (HVO + cat and CNG) displayed the strongest potency in MIP-2 production. The catalyst slightly decreased the PM-induced TNFα responses and somewhat increased the MIP-2 responses with HVO fuel. Emission PM with EN590 and with 30% HVO blended in EN590 induced the strongest genotoxic responses, which were significantly greater than those with EN590 + cat or 100% HVO. The emission PM sample from the CNG bus possessed the weakest genotoxic potency but had the strongest oxidative potency of all the fuel and catalyst combinations. The use of 100% HVO fuel had slightly weaker and 100% RME somewhat stronger emission PM induced ROS production, when compared to EN590.Conclusions: The harmfulness of the exhaust emissions from vehicle engines cannot be determined merely on basis of the emitted PM mass. The study conditions and the engine type significantly affect the toxicity of the emitted particles. The selected fuels and DOC + POC catalyst affected the PM emission from the heavy EURO IV engine both qualitative and quantitative ways, which influenced their toxicological characteristics. The plain HVO fuel performed very well in emission reduction and in lowering the overall toxicity of emitted PM, but the 30% blend of HVO in EN590 was no better in this respect than the plain EN590. The HVO with a DOC + POC catalyst in the EURO IV engine, performed best with regard to changes in exhaust emissions. However some of the toxicological parameters were significantly increased even with these low emissions. © 2012 Jalava et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Brazilian commercial gasoline follows a rigid quality control, regulated by Brazilian Government Petroleum, Natural Gas, and Biofuels Agency, ANP, following international analytical protocols, such as ASTM and ABNT, covered by Regulation ANP No. 309. Each property is a complicated function of the gasoline chemical composition, which would be represented by diverse types of mathematical correlations. However, these correlations are not adjusted to Brazilian gasoline, whose chemical composition is modified by anhydrous ethanol addition. The purpose of this work is to find correlations, using partial least-squares (PLS) regressions, between 13C NMR Brazilian gasoline fingerprintings and several physicochemical parameters, such as relative density, distillation curve (temperatures related to 10, 50, and 90% of distilled volume, final boiling point and residue), octane numbers (motor and research octane number and antiknock index), hydrocarbon compositions (olefins, aromatics, and saturated) and anhydrous ethanol and benzene. 150 representative gasoline samples, collected randomly from different gas stations, were analyzed following international analytical protocols. All 13C NMR spectroscopic fingerprintings, reported in parts per million (ppm), FIDs (free induction decays) were zero filled and Fourier transformed. A data matrix, composed of 13C NMR chemical shifts and physicochemical parameters, was constructed and used in PLS regression. 13C NMR fingerprinting of 100 gasoline samples were employed in the training set, and 50 samples formed the prediction set. In 13C NMR-PLS models, root-mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) and prediction (RMSEP) were the mains parameters considered to select the "best model", which shown results roughly similar in magnitude to the repeatability and reproducibility of ASTM and NBR officials analytical protocols. 13C NMR-PLS multivariate regression, as an alternative analytical methodology, offers an appealing procedure for commercial automotive gasoline quality control. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The production of fuel grade ethanol from nonfood grade crops in South Africa has the potential to reduce reliance on imported oil and minimize the negative environmental consequences of fossil fuels. This article presents a preliminary assessment of the technical and economic feasibility of producing fuel-grade ethanol from nonfood, small grain crops cultivated on marginal lands in the Western Cape of South Africa, namely triticale, low-grade wheat, feed barley, and malt barley. It also explores the potential of grain fiber fractionation (separation of starch from bran) on process economics for a dry-mill process. A conservative "base-case" economic model was developed for a processing capacity of 200 000 metric tonnes per annum (tpa) at maximum expected feedstock prices. The overall average unit costs of production for each grain were compared for three possible process configurations, i.e. a conventional dry-mill starch-to-ethanol plant, an advanced starch-to-ethanol plant with fractionation and energy recovery from bran, and a hybrid integrated cellulosic plant with fractionation, hydrolysis, and fermentation of bran. Triticale demonstrated the greatest economic potential of all grains, regardless of technology type, while the advanced process technology option-fiber fractionation and steam generation from bran combustion-achieved the lowest overall costs of production, across all grain types. For the conservative base-case model, it was found that the government subsidy of ZAR 1.50/L proposed under the South African Biofuels Strategy is insufficient to ensure economic feasibility for any of the grains or technology options under scenarios with high feedstock costs. The government subsidy would need to be increased by at least 124% before profitable operation during times with high feedstock prices would be possible. A sensitivity analysis of the economic assumptions of the base-case model demonstrated that feedstock price is the most important determinant of production costs and that the economic feasibility of such technologies relies heavily on a favorable ethanol selling price. When assuming maximum theoretical starch-ethanol yields, and considering fluctuation in feedstock prices in the range from ZAR 1589/t to ZAR 3680/t (as observed in South Africa during the period between 2005 and 2012), the best economic results were observed for an advanced starch-to-ethanol plant processing triticale grain at a rate of 200 000 tpa (production cost between ZAR 4.25/L and ZAR 8.48/L). Due to uncertainty of commodity price fluctuations, it is recommended that static, deterministic models for economic feasibility should therefore be enhanced to incorporate uncertainty and quantitative risk assessment in process and economic parameters, by adopting stochastic simulation methods to account for price volatility. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Fatty acid methyl ether (FAME) is a green biofuel that can be used as an alternative fuel to replace conventional petroleum. A novel solid base catalyst, CsF/CaO, was used to catalyze the transesterification of soybean oil to produce FAME. This catalyst showed strong basicity, resulting in high reactivity on transesterification. With an 8% catalyst dosage, 12:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil and 1% water content in oil, the FAME yield reached 98% at 65 °C in 1 h. Moreover, the catalyst also exhibited high resistance to water, which allowed more flexibility for biodiesel mass production. The transesterification of soybean oil followed a second-order reversible kinetic rate equation. The forward reaction rate constants and apparent activation energy were evaluated. Comparisons with the experimental data indicated that the kinetic model was suitable for predicting the yield of FAME. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Our companion paper discussed the yield benefits achieved by integrating deacetylation, mechanical refining, and washing with low acid and low temperature pretreatment. To evaluate the impact of the modified process on the economic feasibility, a techno-economic analysis (TEA) was performed based on the experimental data presented in the companion paper. Results: The cost benefits of dilute acid pretreatment technology combined with the process alternatives of deacetylation, mechanical refining, and pretreated solids washing were evaluated using cost benefit analysis within a conceptual modeling framework. Control cases were pretreated at much lower acid loadings and temperatures than used those in the NREL 2011 design case, resulting in much lower annual ethanol production. Therefore, the minimum ethanol selling prices (MESP) of the control cases were $0.41-$0.77 higher than the $2.15/gallon MESP of the design case. This increment is highly dependent on the carbohydrate content in the corn stover. However, if pretreatment was employed with either deacetylation or mechanical refining, the MESPs were reduced by $0.23-$0.30/gallon. Combing both steps could lower the MESP further by $0.44∼$0.54. Washing of the pretreated solids could also greatly improve the final ethanol yields. However, the large capital cost of the solid-liquid separation unit negatively influences the process economics. Finally, sensitivity analysis was performed to study the effect of the cost of the pretreatment reactor and the energy input for mechanical refining. A 50% cost reduction in the pretreatment reactor cost reduced the MESP of the entire conversion process by $0.11-$0.14/gallon, while a 10-fold increase in energy input for mechanical refining will increase the MESP by $0.07/gallon. Conclusion: Deacetylation and mechanical refining process options combined with low acid, low severity pretreatments show improvements in ethanol yields and calculated MESP for cellulosic ethanol production. © 2012 Tao et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Biomass burning (BB) contributes large amounts of black carbon (BC) and particulate organic matter (POM) to the atmosphere and contributes significantly to the earth's radiation balance. BB particles can be a complicated optical system, with scattering and absorption contributions from BC, internal mixtures of BC and POM, and wavelength-dependent absorption of POM. Large amounts of POM can also be externally mixed. We report on the unique ability of multi-wavelength photo-acoustic measurements of dry and thermal-denuded absorption to deconstruct this complicated wavelength-dependent system of absorption and mixing. Optical measurements of BB particles from the Four Mile Canyon fire near Boulder, Colorado, showed that internal mixtures of BC and POM enhanced absorption by up to 70%. The data supports the assumption that the POM was very weakly absorbing at 532 nm. Enhanced absorption at 404 nm was in excess of 200% above BC absorption and varied as POM mass changed, indicative of absorbing POM. Absorption by internal mixing of BC and POM contributed 19(±8)% to total 404-nm absorption, while BC alone contributed 54(±16)%. Approximately 83% of POM mass was externally mixed, the absorption of which contributed 27(±15)% to total particle absorption (at 404 nm). The imaginary refractive index and mass absorption efficiency (MAE) of POM at 404 nm changed throughout the sampling period and were found to be 0.007 ± 0.005 and 0.82 ± 0.43 m2 g-1, respectively. Our analysis shows that the MAE of POM can be biased high by up to 50% if absorption from internal mixing of POM and BC is not included.

AB  - Production of renewable fuels and chemicals from lignocellulosic feedstocks requires an efficient pretreatment technology to allow ready access of polysaccharides for cellulolytic enzymes during saccharification. The effect of pretreatment on wheat straw through a low-temperature and low-pressure soaking aqueous ammonia (SAA) process was investigated in this study using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (Py-GC/MS), solid and liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and thermogravimetry/differential thermogravimetry (TG/DTG) to demonstrate the changes in lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose structure. After treatment of 60 mesh wheat straw particles for 60 h with 28-30% ammonium hydroxide (1:10 solid/liquid) at 50 °C, sugar recovery increased from 14% (untreated) to 67% (SAA treated). The FTIR study revealed a substantial decrease in absorbance of lignin peaks. Solid and liquid state NMR showed minimal lignin structural changes with significant compositional changes. Activation energy of control and pretreated wheat straw was calculated according to the Friedman and ASTM methods and found to be decreased for SAA-treated wheat straw, from 259 to 223 kJ/mol. The SAA treatment was shown to remove significant amounts of lignin without strongly affecting lignin functional groups or structure. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The environmental concerns and the European liquid (bio) fuel regulations have determined a growing demand on biofuels. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis can provide clean synthetic fuels containing low concentrations of sulfur, nitrogen, and aromatics. While Fischer-Tropsch synthesis using natural gas and coal is a well established and commercialized process for more than 70 years, the new technology of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis using biomass as feedstock is gaining more and more attention due to the possibilities of using renewable raw materials. In this work, in order to optimize the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, the influence of operating conditions has been studied in a slurry reactor using a Co-based catalyst. Experiments were performed at different syngas composition (variation of H2/CO ratio) and pressure (24, 20, and 16 bar), keeping the other parameters (temperature, 230 °C; gas flow, 5 Nm3/h) constant. The effects of pressure on CO conversion, product distribution, C5+ selectivity, Par/Ole ratio, and α value were investigated, and the results were compared with data from literature. It was found that-increasing the reaction pressure-heavier hydrocarbons were formed, and CO conversion increased from 44. 2 to 63. 7 %. A slight change has been observed in the case of an α value between 0. 89 and 0. 9, C5+ selectivity between 90. 6 and 91. 7 %, and Par/Ole ratio between 11. 4 and 14. 1. An important role for the results obtained was attributed to H2/CO ratio variation during the experiments. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to estimate emissions of some pollutants (CO, NOX, HC, SOX, and PM) in diesel fleet due to the addition of biodiesel in different blends, as well as to assess atmospheric pollutant concentrations in the metropolitan area of Porto Alegre (MAPA). The methodology was based on inventories from mobile sources based on US EPA's technical report. Regarding air quality the following parameters were determined: PM10, PM2.5, CO, NOX, O3, SO2, HC and PAHs. The results showed a decrease for emissions PM, CO, and HC, and a slight increase for NOX. The characterization of atmospheric pollutants in the metropolitan area of Porto Alegre showed that they are influenced by mobile sources, particularly diesel vehicles. The diagnosis of ratios analysis that was applied to facilitate the identification of sources of PAHs, indicated an influence of diesel oil.

AB  - The biofuels industry is rapidly growing with the goal of providing a sustainable fuel alternative to petroleum products. However, two challenges persist in limiting current biofuels technologies as a viable alternative: (1) the cost of feedstock and (2) the quality of the fuel. Metabolic engineering shows the potential to overcome these two challenges, enabling the bioconversion of cheaper feedstocks into improved fuels in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner. Metabolic engineering is the systematic attempt to understand, design, and engineer cellular metabolic networks using a wide range of interdisciplinary tools and strategies. It is rapidly emerging as the enabling technology behind the development of the next generation of biofuels. Several examples of current research demonstrate how metabolic engineering has begun to contribute both novel and creative solutions toward bringing promising biofuel technologies to fruition: production of higher chain alcohols, fermentation of lignocellulosic material, and production of fatty acid derivatives. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Purpose The critically discussed effects on biodiversity due to the intensive cultivation of energy crops are largely lacking in the LCAs of biofuels due to basic methodological deficits. This was the starting point to develop a new methodology for impact assessment on biodiversity. The central research question to be clarified was: how can the spatial references, which are necessary for the assessment of biodiversity, be included in the usually spatially unspecific LCA. Methods Prevalent methods for both LCA and environmental planning were investigated with regard to interfaces and integration capabilities as well as differences. Drawing on this analysis a theoretical and methodological approach was developed which integrates the spatially specific procedure of environmental planning into the product-specific approach of the LCA. The available geodata and statistical data base for the assessment was examined for Germany and the method adapted to the data situation in Germany. Results and discussion The resulting methodological approach is explained and tested. It is compatible with LCA principles and leads to product-specific quantitative results. The method can be applied on a higher geographic level (Germany) but, nevertheless, makes reference to spatial characteristics of biodiversity on different scales. This is achieved by combining area specific data about biodiversity with statistical data about pressure factors on the regional level. The procedure is demonstrated by the example of bio-ethanol from wheat. An overall view of the various indicators yields a "Biodiversity profile" for the considered fuel and a specific bio-fuel target. This approach leads the way for an integration of spatial knowledge about biodiversity into the spatially non-specific LCA.

AB  - Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is a fast-growing and high biomass producing plant species, which has been traditionally grown as multiple-use crop and recently considered as an energy crop. In order to screen accessions that can be cultivated in cadmium (Cd)-contaminated soils for biodiesel production, the ability of Cd tolerance and bioaccumulation of 18 hemp cultivars or ecotypes were evaluated in pot experiment under 25 mg Cd kg-1 (dry weight, DW) soil condition, in terms of plant growth, pigment contents, chlorophyll fluorescence, and Cd accumulation at 45 days after seedling emergence. Results showed that seedlings of all cultivars, except USO-31, Shenyang and Shengmu, could grow quite well under 25 mg Cd kg-1 (DW) soil condition. Among them, Yunma 1, Yunma 2, Yunma 3, Yunma 4, Qujing, Longxi, Lu'an, Xingtai, and Shuyang showed great biomass (&gt;0.5 g plant-1), high tolerance factors (68.6-92.3%), and little reduction of pigment content and chlorophyll fluorescence under 25 mg Cd kg-1 (DW) soil stress, indicating these cultivars had a strong tolerance to Cd stress and could be cultivated in Cd-contaminated soils. Cultivars Longxi, Lu'an, Xingtai, Yunma 2, Yunma 3, Yunma 4, and Qujing exhibited higher Cd concentrations and total Cd in shoots. These cultivars, therefore, are good candidates for the implementation of the new strategy of cultivating biodiesel crops for phytoremediation of Cd-contaminated soils. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The crude Tung oil with 4.72 mg KOH/g of acid value (AV) was converted by direct transesterification, and the reaction mixture was quantified. The phase distribution data showed that 38.24% of excess methanol, 11.76% of KOH, 10.13% of soap and 4.36% of glycerol were in the biodiesel phase; 0.35% of biodiesel dissolved in the glycerol phase. Tung oil biodiesel as well as its blends with 0# diesel was investigated under different storage conditions. The results indicated that higher temperature greatly influenced the storage stability, especially when the volume fraction of Tung oil biodiesel is increased in the blends. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - In this study, 97 microalgal strains purchased from algae bank and 50 microalgal strains isolated from local waters in Minnesota were screened for their adaptability growing on a 20-fold diluted digested swine manure wastewater (DSMW). A pool of candidate strains well adapted to the DSMW was established through a high-throughput screening process. Two top-performing facultative heterotrophic strains with high growth rate (0.536 day-1 for UMN 271 and 0.433 day-1 for UMN 231) and one strain with high omega-3 unsaturated fatty acid (EPA, 3.75 % of total fatty acids for UMN 231) were selected. Subsequently, a sequential two-stage mixo-photoautotrophic culture strategy was developed for biofuel and animal feed production as well as simultaneous swine wastewater treatment using above two strains. The maximal biomass concentration and lipid content at the first and second stages reached 2.03 g/L and 23.0 %, and 0.83 g/L and 19.0 % for UMN 271 and UMN 231, respectively. The maximal nutrient removals for total phosphorus and ammonia after second-stage cultivation were 100 and 89.46 %, respectively. The experiments showed that this sequential two-stage cultivation process has great potential for economically viable and environmentally friendly production of both renewable biofuel and high-value animal feed and at the same time for animal wastewater treatment. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Investigating the susceptibility of various fuels to anaerobic biodegradation has become complicated with the recognition that the fuels themselves are not sterile. Bacterial DNA could be obtained when various fuels were filtered through a hydrophobic teflon (0.22 μm) membrane filter. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes from these preparations were PCR amplified, cloned, and the resulting libraries sequenced to identify the fuel-borne bacterial communities. The most common sequence, found in algal- and camelina-based biofuels as well as in ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) and F76 diesel, was similar to that of a Tumebacillus. The next most common sequence was similar to Methylobacterium and was found in the biofuels and ULSD. Higher level phylogenetic groups included representatives of the Firmicutes (Bacillus, Lactobacillus and Streptococcus), several Actinobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Alphaproteobacteria (Methylobacterium and Sphingomonadales), Betaproteobacteria (Oxalobacteraceae and Burkholderiales) and Deltaproteobacteria. All of the fuel-associated bacterial sequences, except those obtained from a few facultative microorganisms, were from aerobes and only remotely affiliated with sequences that resulted from anaerobic successional events evident when ULSD was incubated with a coastal seawater and sediment inoculum. Thus, both traditional and alternate fuel formulations harbor a characteristic microflora, but these microorganisms contributed little to the successional patterns that ultimately resulted in fuel decomposition, sulfide formation and metal biocorrosion. The findings illustrate the value of molecular approaches to track the fate of bacteria that might come in contact with fuels and potentially contribute to corrosion problems throughout the energy value chain. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study presents a parametric fitting of the economics of bio-oil stabilization and hydroprocessing to naphtha and diesel range blend fuel. The data is fit with a response surface model (RSM). Technical variables evaluated in this study are rate of bio-oil upgrading and natural gas input rate. Economic variables considered include bio-oil, natural gas, hydrogen, catalyst, capital, and fossil carbon costs. Our base case consists of a 1440 tonnes per day bio-oil upgrading biorefinery concept design for the production of naphtha and diesel range blend stock fuels. The RSM represents variation around this base case. The process model includes reforming, stabilization, and hydroprocessing sections. Total project investment for this concept is $171.5 million or $2.34 per gallon of bio-oil input capacity. This base case biorefinery generates 71.8 million gallons of fuel (5182 barrels per day) at a minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of $2.48 per gallon. We investigated the techno-economic impacts of different hydrogen sources on the bio-oil upgrading process. Hydrogen from bio-oil reforming results in the lowest biofuel emissions but is not always economical. A portion of available bio-oil should be converted to hydrogen under two main conditions: the cost of hydrogen from bio-oil is lower than procuring hydrogen from other sources and the lost income due to a lower biofuel output; and/or when there is a market or policy constraint limiting fossil fuel use. Results indicate that to minimize fuel costs, the amount of bio-oil upgraded should decrease from ≥90% to 80% as bio-oil prices decline from $1.37 to $0.70 per gallon depending on market conditions. Carbon emission constrains such as those mandated by the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) could force bio-oil upgrading rates to less than 90%. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present greenhouse gas study results for biofuels produced with partial qualified utilisation of pulp wood or forest residues when integrated into kraft pulp mill systems. The impact of considering biogenic carbon on the results is also presented. Design/methodology/approach: The material and energy balances of the integrated ethanol production were simulated for the study with a mill-wide simulation model. Data for the simulation were obtained from prehydrolysis and cooking experiments. The life cycle model for greenhouse gas calculation was created based on the simulation results. In this paper, the change of forest carbon stock caused by residue removal from forest soil and carbon delay of forest growth after stand felling were also taken into consideration, to discuss the true greenhouse gas emissions of forest biomass utilisation. Findings: The emission reduction levels achieved with these ethanol fuels derived from forest biomass ranged from 80 to 90 per cent when biogenic carbon emissions were neglected. Originality/value: The findings indicate that in both cases a significant percentage of the side flows containing energy can be utilised to produce excess electricity when the ethanol plant is integrated into the pulp mill. The findings also indicate that the carbon storage impact of forest biomasses affects significantly the emission values of both studied fuels and overturns the emission savings of prehydrolysed chip based ethanol. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Self-sufficiency in energy requirement is critical to the success of any developing economy. Apart from the search for alternatives, there is a need to achieve energy independence, directing much focus on biofuels. Biodiesel is simple to use, biodegradable, nontoxic, and essentially free of sulfur and aromatics. Oil was extracted from the seeds of Blighia unijugata and Luffa cylindrica, subjected to chemical characterization and biodiesel production. The oil yield from the seed of B. unijugata was 50. 82 ± 1. 20% while that of L. cylindrica was 39. 10 ± 0. 20%. The biodiesel produced had ester content above 98%. The flash point of the biodiesel from B. unijugata and L. cylindrica was above 120°C while the phosphorus content was also below 1 ppm in both cases. The oxidative stability of B. unijugata was 44. 30 ± 0. 30 h, while that of L. cylindrica was lower than this value due to its high unsaturation. The copper strip corrosion value of the biodiesel was also found to be 1A. This study showed that the high free fatty acid content of B. unijugata and L. cylindrica seed oil can be reduced in a one-step pretreatment of esterification reaction using H 2SO 4 as catalyst thus reducing the problem of soap formation encountered when using oil with high free fatty acid for the production of biodiesel. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to address the issue of the production cost of second generation biofuels via the thermo-chemical route. The last decade has seen a large number of technical-economic studies of second generation biofuels. As there is a large variation in the announced production costs of second generation biofuels in the literature, this paper clarifies some of the reasons for these variations and helps obtain a clearer picture. This paper presents simulations for two pathways and comparative production pathways previously published in the literature in the years between 2000 and 2011. It also includes a critical comparison and analysis of previously published studies. This paper does not include studies where the production is boosted with a hydrogen injection to improve the carbon yield. The only optimisation included is the recycle of tail gas. It is shown that the fuel can be produced on a large scale at prices of around 1.0-1.4 € per l. Large uncertainties remain however with regard to the precision of the economic predictions, the technology choices, the investment cost estimation and even the financial models to calculate the production costs. The benefit of a tail gas recycle is also examined; its benefit largely depends on the selling price of the produced electricity. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Although the life cycle environmental impacts of biofuels have been recently reported, studies that focus on specific regions and use real fleet data for the use phase are still lacking. In Pennsylvania, the Penn Security Fuels Initiative required 2% biodiesel (B2), effective on January 1, 2010, with higher blending levels required in the future if production thresholds are met. This study quantifies the environmental impacts of biodiesel blends to meet increasing regional biodiesel demand. A process life cycle model was developed using data collected from collaboration with Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. For PennDOT, both in-state and out-of-state production scenarios were analyzed to estimate the possible environmental impacts of biodiesel blends. The results show that fertilizer usage in the agricultural phase, soy oil extraction and refining, feedstock and fuel transportation, and fuel combustion in the use phase are main contributors to biodiesel's life cycle environmental impacts for all blends. Comparing biodiesels with ultra low sulfur diesel, significant environmental tradeoffs exist between global warming potential and eutrophication. For Pennsylvania, an in-state farming and processing preference has the lowest environmental impacts for B5. However, the limited area of farmlands in Pennsylvania may not satisfy the state's biodiesel needs with higher blending levels. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Enhanced environmental quality, fuel security, and economic development, along with reduced prices of blended diesel, are often used as justifications for a U.S. federal excise tax exemption on biodiesel fuels. However, the possible effect of increased overall consumption of fuel in response to lower total prices, mitigating the environmental and fuel security benefits, are generally not considered. Taking this price response into account, the optimal U.S biodiesel subsidy is derived. Estimated values of the optimal subsidy are close to the recently expired subsidy, revealing the subsidy's environmental and security benefits. However, further positive environmental and security benefits from the biodiesel tax-exemption subsidy may be obtained if the subsidy is combined with a federal excise tax on petroleum diesel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Changing linkages between agricultural and energy markets have attracted considerable attention in research and policy discussions during recent years. As one of the largest biofuel markets worldwide, the German biodiesel market is of particular interest. It has grown rapidly since the beginning of the new millennium, with this growth being driven mainly by political interventions. Vertical price transmission channels along the biodiesel supply chain are analyzed in this study. We examine the relationship between diesel and biodiesel prices, and between rapeseed oil, soy oil, and biodiesel prices between 2002 and 2008. Due to pronounced changes in market conditions and the policy framework, a regime-dependent Markov-switching vector error-correction model is used. The regimes are characterized by markedly different price adjustment behaviors. Before 2005 and from late 2007 onward, a regime characterized by the strong orientation of biodiesel prices toward diesel prices dominates. Between 2005 and 2007, biodiesel and rapeseed oil prices are mutually interdependent. Frequent switches between the regimes of the price dynamics during this period indicate a high extent of uncertainty and instability in the market. © 2012 International Association of Agricultural Economists.

AB  - Blast furnace slag (BFS), a high volume byproduct resulting from iron-making processes, was used as a low-cost and abundant precursor for preparing a hydrocalumite, and the thus prepared slag-made hydrocalumite and its derivatives were applied for transesterifications of esters including triglycerides. In the transesterification of n-ethyl butyrate, calcined samples provided higher catalytic activities than those of the as-synthesized hydrocalumite due to the interfusion of slag-derived impurity elements, such as Fe and Mn, which act as catalyst promoters. Furthermore, the catalyst calcined at 800 °C in air worked as an efficient catalyst for the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol, affording up to 97% yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) after 6 h under relatively moderate reaction conditions (i.e., methanol/soybean oil = 12, reaction temperature = 60 °C, use of 1 wt% catalyst), and its catalytic performance was reproduced even after air-exposure for 1 day. It is believed that the slag-made hydrocalumite can replace existing solid base catalysts as a low-cost alternative for biodiesel production and potentially contribute to the sustainable chemical processes in an economical and ecological way. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Multivariate local linear regression and parametric error correction models are applied to assess price linkages and price transmission patterns between food and energy prices in Spain. Weekly biodiesel, sunflower and crude oil prices observed from November 2006 to October 2010 are used in the empirical analysis. Results suggest the existence of a long-run, equilibrium relationship between the three prices studied. Biodiesel is the only variable that adjusts to deviations from this long-run relationship. Local linear regression techniques show that the speed of adjustment of biodiesel prices is faster when biodiesel is relatively cheap than when it is expensive. Energy prices are also found to influence sunflower oil prices through short-run price dynamics. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Droplet collision occurs frequently in regions where the droplet number density is high. Even for Lean Premixed and Pre-vaporized (LPP) liquid sprays, the collision effects can be very high on the droplet size distributions, which will in turn affect the droplet vaporization process. Hence, in conjunction with vaporization modeling, collision modeling for such spray systems is also essential. The standard O'Rourke's collision model, usually implemented in CFD codes, tends to generate unphysical numerical artifact when simulations are performed on Cartesian grid and the results are not grid independent. Thus, a new collision modeling approach based on no-time-counter method (NTC) proposed by Schmidt and Rutland is implemented to replace O'Rourke's collision algorithm to solve a spray injection problem in a cylindrical coflow premixer. The so called "four-leaf clover" numerical artifacts are eliminated by the new collision algorithm and results from a diesel spray show very good grid independence. Next, the dispersion and vaporization processes for liquid fuel sprays are simulated in a coflow premixer. Two liquid fuels under investigation are jet-A and Rapeseed Methyl Esters (RME). Results show very good grid independence in terms of SMD distribution, droplet number distribution and fuel vapor mass flow rate. A baseline test is first established with a spray cone angle of 90°and injection velocity of 3 m/s and jet-A achieves much better vaporization performance than RME due to its higher vapor pressure. To improve the vaporization performance for both fuels, a series of simulations have been done at several different combinations of spray cone angle and injection velocity. At relatively low spray cone angle and injection velocity, the collision effect on the average droplet size and the vaporization performance are very high due to relatively high coalescence rate induced by droplet collisions. Thus, at higher spray cone angle and injection velocity, the results expectedly show improvement in fuel vaporization performance since smaller droplet has a higher vaporization rate. The vaporization performance and the level of homogeneity of fuel-air mixture can be significantly improved when the dispersion level is high, which can be achieved by increasing the spray cone angle and injection velocity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A recent life cycle assessment (LCA) reported that biodiesel production in supercritical alcohols (SCA) produces a higher environmental load than the homogeneous catalytic process because an enormous amount of energy is required to recover excess alcohol. However, the excess alcohol could be dramatically reduced by increasing the operating temperature to 400. °C; although the product would have to be considered as an alternative biofuel instead of biodiesel. A comparative LCA of the biodiesel production in two SCA at 300. °C (C-SCA) and novel biofuel production in the same two SCA at 400. °C (N-SCA) is presented. It was clear that the N-SCA process produces a dramatically reduced environmental load over that of the C-SCA process due to a lower amount of excess alcohol being used. The N-SCA process could be improved in terms of its environmental impact by changing from fossil fuel to biomass-based fuels for the steam generation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae can be converted to an energy-dense bio-oil via pyrolysis; however, the relatively high nitrogen content of this bio-oil presents a challenge for its direct use as fuels. Therefore, hydrothermal pretreatment was employed to reduce the N content in Nannochloropsis oculata feedstock by removing proteins without requiring significant energy inputs. The effects of reaction conditions on the yield and composition of pretreated algae were investigated by varying the temperature (150-225. °C) and reaction time (10-60. min). Compared with untreated algae, pretreated samples had higher carbon contents and enhanced heating values under all reaction conditions and 6-42% lower N contents at 200-225. °C for 30-60. min. The pyrolytic bio-oil from pretreated algae contained less N-containing compounds than that from untreated samples and the bio-oil contained mainly (44.9% GC-MS peak area) long-chain fatty acids (C14-C18) which can be more readily converted into hydrocarbon fuels in the presence of simple catalysts. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, we analyze the relationships between the prices of biodiesel, ethanol and related fuels and agricultural commodities with a use of minimal spanning trees and hierarchical trees. To distinguish between short-term and medium-term effects, we construct these trees for different frequencies (weekly and monthly). We find that in short-term, both ethanol and biodiesel are very weakly connected with the other commodities. In medium-term, the biofuels network becomes more structured. The system splits into two well separated branches - a fuels part and a food part. Biodiesel tends to the fuels branch and ethanol to the food branch. When the periods before and after the food crisis of 2007/2008 are compared, the connections are much stronger for the post-crisis period. This is the first application of this methodology on the biofuel systems. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) and palm tree (Elaeis guianeensis) are crops with high biofuel yields, 7.6 m 3 ha -1 y -1 of ethanol and 4 Mg ha -1 y -1 of oil, respectively. The joint production of these crops enhances the sustainability of ethanol. The objective of this work was comparing a traditional sugarcane ethanol production system (TSES) with a joint production system (JSEB), in which ethanol and biodiesel are produced at the same biorefinery but only ethanol is traded. The comparison is based on ISO 14.040:2006 and ISO 14044:2006, and appropriate indicators. Production systems in Cerrado (typical savannah), Cerradão (woody savannah) and pastureland ecosystems were considered. Energy and carbon balances, and land use change impacts were evaluated. The joint system includes 100% substitution of biodiesel for diesel, which is all consumed in different cropping stages. Data were collected by direct field observation methods, and questionnaires applied to Brazilian facilities. Three sugarcane mills situated in São Paulo State and one palm oil refinery located in Para State were surveyed. The information was supplemented by secondary sources. Results demonstrated that fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions decreased, whereas energy efficiency increased when JSEB was compared to TSES. In comparison with TSES, the energy balance of JSEB was 1.7 greater. In addition, JSEB released 23% fewer GHG emissions than TSES. The ecosystem carbon payback time for Cerrado, Cerradão, and Degraded Grassland of JSEB was respectively 4, 7.7 and -7.6 years. These are typical land use types of the Brazilian Cerrado region for which JSEB was conceived. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study deals with the determination of the activation energy for the thermal decomposition of two renewable fuels - crude glycerin and beef tallow. The activation energies were investigated by using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) in the temperature range of 25-600 °C in atmosphere of synthetic air. The TG curves of the thermal decomposition process of both samples were divided into several phases and the second, called PH2, was chosen for the kinetic study because it is associated with the combustion ignition. Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) showed an endothermic event at the PH2 region for the crude glycerin corresponding to devolatilization, while for beef tallow, this step presented an exothermic event, called LTO (low-temperature oxidation), which is correlated with devolatilization followed by combustion. For the entire PH2, activation energy values for crude glycerin were between 90 kJ mol -1 and 42 kJ mol -1, while for the beef tallow they ranged from 50 kJ mol -1 to 113 kJ mol -1. The activation energy values obtained at the pre-ignition stage - conversion between 0 and 0.45 - showed that the crude glycerin with higher values requires an additional energetic support at the start of combustion processes and the beef tallow ignites more easily, presenting lower values. According to the Wolfer's equation, a direct relation between the activation energy and the ignition delay is established and the results of this study provides useful data for the development and design of new combustion chambers and engines when non-traditional fuels are used as feedstock. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Due to depletion and higher prices of crude oil, biodiesel is gaining more importance day by day. Biodiesel is renewable and eco-friendly and its emission profile is much lower than fossil fuels. A large number of researches have been done on identification of new feedstocks and cheaper technologies for biodiesel production. Among many feedstocks used oils have been reported as a cheaper feedstock for biodiesel production. Transesterification of veg fried oil and non-veg fried oil was studied in a batch type reactor with NaOH and methanol. The reactions were optimized, veg fried oil and non-veg fried oil gave an maximum ester yield of 91% and 87% respectively for 0.6 wt.% of NaOH with a molar ratio of 6:1 for 3 h at 65 °C. Fatty acid profile of these two methyl esters were similar and their parent oil was found to be palm olein. Fuel properties were some what closer to each other. These esters (B100) and their blends with diesel (B25, B50, B75) when utilized in DI diesel engine showed better emission profile. B75 was found to be the best. An artificial neural network (ANN) was created with brake power and biofuel blend as input and brake specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency, NO X, HC, CO and smoke density as output. Back propagation algorithm was used and the data obtained from engine test was utilized for training the network. The SIMULINK model of the trained neural network was generated to predict the fuel emissions and performance. The trained neural network with a correlation coefficient of 0.9989 and 0.999 gave better predictions for B15, B30, B60 and B90, the results were found to be acceptable. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - On January 1 2008, Brazil included yet another element into its energy matrix: biodiesel. The predominant biodiesel production process involves a phase of transesterification that yields glycerol as a by-product. The use of this glycerol is limited since it is considered an unrefined raw material that must be refined for its various types of use. Several studies have addressed identification of possible uses for unrefined glycerol. Given the diversity of uses, an overview is necessary. The purpose of this work is to present alternatives currently being considered for the use of unrefined glycerol as a by-product of biodiesel production, aiming to contribute to the sustainable consolidation of the biofuel market. Exploratory research was carried out to identify these viable alternatives for the use of this by-product. The possibilities include the production of chemical products, fuel additives, production of hydrogen, development of fuel cells, ethanol or methanol production, animal feed, co-digestion and co-gasification, and waste treatment among others. The present research reveals that there are promising possibilities for the use of unrefined glycerol, which may help consolidate the sustainability of the biofuel market. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Combustion of renewable biofuels, including energydense biodiesel, is expected to contribute significantly toward meeting future energy demands in the transportation sector. Elucidating detailed reaction mechanisms will be crucial to understanding biodiesel combustion, and hydrogen abstraction reactions are expected to dominate biodiesel combustion during ignition. In this work, we investigate hydrogen abstraction by the radicals H·, CH 3·, O·, HO2·, and OH· from methyl formate, the simplest surrogate for complex biodiesels. We evaluate the H abstraction barrier heights and reaction enthalpies, using multireference correlated wave function methods including size-extensivity corrections and extrapolation to the complete basis set limit. The barrier heights predicted for abstraction by H·, CH3·, and O· are in excellent agreement with derived experimental values, with errors ≤1 kcal/mol. We also predict the reaction energetics for forming reactant complexes, transition states, and product complexes for reactions involving HO2· and OH·. High-pressure-limit rate constants are computed using transition state theory within the separable-hindered-rotor approximation for torsions and the harmonic oscillator approximation for other vibrational modes. The predicted rate constants differ significantly from those appearing in the latest combustion kinetics models of these reactions. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biofuel consumption in Romania is over 160,000 tones if we consider the rate of 4% required to participate in diesel fuel sold, of which most is imported. Production capacity of Romanian companies can ensure an achievement of 280-300 thousand tons of biodiesel per year. In 2007, Romania has produced only 30,000 tones of biodiesel. By-products obtained from the biofuel industry were introduced in feed of lambs. Regarding the body weight gain, all experimental groups were situated beyond the control group. Body mass growth rate is 3.5 times higher in the group fed with supplement of sunflower meal, 4.16 times higher in that fed with soybean meal supplements and 5.2 times higher in the group fed with additional rape meal. After the second week, the differences are decreasing, as the absolute value of body weight gain. Analyzing main serological and biochemical parameters of lambs, normal levels of total protein, albumin, glucose, K, increased urea, alkaline phosphatase and low values of the enzyme AST, cholesterol, Na, Fe, Ca., Mg were founded. As deviations compared to reference values from literature are not significant it can be concluded that these products used in appropriate proportion in feed of lambs are not harmful to their health. © 2012 University of Bucharest.

AB  - The impact of biodiesel and second generation biofuels on nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from heavy-duty engines was investigated using a California Air Resources Board (CARB) certified diesel fuel. Two heavy-duty engines, a 2006 engine with no exhaust aftertreatment, and a 2007 engine with a diesel particle filter (DPF), were tested on an engine dynamometer over four different test cycles. Emissions from soy- and animal-based biodiesels, a hydrotreated renewable diesel, and a gas to liquid (GTL) fuel were evaluated at blend levels from 5 to 100%. NOx emissions consistently increased with increasing biodiesel blend level, while increasing renewable diesel and GTL blends showed NOx emissions reductions with blend level. NO x increases ranged from 1.5% to 6.9% for B20, 6.4% to 18.2% for B50, and 14.1% to 47.1% for B100. The soy-biodiesel showed higher NOx emissions increases compared to the animal-biodiesel. NOx emissions neutrality with the CARB diesel was achieved by blending GTL or renewable diesel fuels with various levels of biodiesel or by using di-tert-butyl peroxide (DTBP). It appears that the impact of biodiesel on NOx emissions might be a more important consideration when blended with CARB diesel or similar fuels, and that some form of NOx mitigation might be needed for biodiesel blends with such fuels. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In order to produce petroleum alternatives from biomass, a significant amount of research has been focused on oils from microalgae due to their origin, which would not affect food availability. Nanoporous hybrid catalysts composed of ns Al2O3 and zeolites have been proven to be very useful compared to traditional catalysts in hydrotreating (HT), hydrocracking (HC), and catalytic cracking (CC) of large molecules. To evaluate the reaction scheme and products from model isoprenoid compounds of microalgae oil, nanoporous hybrid catalyst technologies (CC: ns Al2O3/H-USY and ns Al2O3/H-GaAlMFI; HC: [Ni-Mo/-Al2O3]/ns Al2O3/H-beta) were studied. The major product from CC on ns Al2O3/H-USY was highly aromatic gasoline, while the product from HC was half-isoparaffinic/ olefinic kerosene. Although more than 50wt of the products from HT/CC on the USY catalyst was liquefied petroleum gas due to overcracking, the product from HT/CC on the MFI catalyst was high-octane-number gasoline. Delightfully, the product from HT/HC was kerosene and its average number was 11, with more than 80wt being isoparaffinic. As a result, it was demonstrated that hydrotreating may convert isoprenoid oil from microalgae over nanoporous hybrid catalysts into a variety of products. © Copyright 2012 Toshiyuki Kimura et al.

AB  - Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modeling of a continuous countercurrent hydrolysis process was performed using ANSYS-CFX. The liquid properties and flow behavior such as density, specific heats, dynamic viscosity, thermal conductivity, and thermal expansivity as well as water solubility of the hydrolysis components triglyceride, diglyceride, monoglyceride, free fatty acid, and glycerol were calculated. Chemical kinetics for the hydrolysis reactions were simulated in this model by applying Arrhenius parameters. The simulation was based on actual experimental reaction conditions including temperature and water-to-oil ratio. The results not only have good agreement with experimental data but also show instantaneous distributions of concentrations of every component in hydrolysis reaction. This model provided visible insight into the continuous countercurrent hydrolysis process. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As consumers continue to be concerned about the future of sustainable agriculture and the scarci-ty of natural resources, biofuels can be an important component of the "people" solution through job creation, development and interiorizing economic activities of a country through moving money from cities into rural areas. The Brazilian sugarcane industry is well developed in terms of corporate social responsibility and can serve as an example for other countries such as Africa. The objective of this article is to show how sugar cane can contribute to the development of Africa by producing renewable fuel for use in booming African cities. A supply of sugar can be developed for use in local markets and exports. Other opportunities exist to produce bioelectricity from the process of burning the bagasse and other new products such as plastic and diesel. In the case of Ethanol, this fuel has proven to be the most efficient in competing with gasoline in the last 40 years, and Africa may gain with a strategic plan on ethanol. © 2012 International Food and Agribusiness Management Association (IFAMA).

AB  - Biofuels, the hydrocarbons less than C 18, produced by catalytic cracking of nonedible vegetable oils are the potential source to battle energy demand and pollution. Among the non edible oils, jatropha is the apt candidate for the production of biofuel. Jatropha oil can be cracked catalytically over solid acid catalysts to yield liquid fuels with superior characteristics. We present here the hydrothermal syntheses of a microporous solid acid catalyst (HZSM-5 with Si/Al = 14), mesoporous materials (AlMCM-41) with varying Si/Al ratios (Si/Al = 18, 41, 72 and 95) and composite catalyst comprising HZSM-5 (as core) and varying coating percentages (5, 10 and 20%) of AlMCM-41 (as shell). All the synthesized catalysts were characterized by using XRD, BET N 2 sorption studies, ICP, TPD and SEM techniques. Herein we report the catalytic activities of all the synthesized catalysts towards the cracking of jatropha oil obtained at the optimized conditions of temperature - 400 °C, WHSV - 4.6 h -1 and reaction time - 1 h. Of all the mesoporous catalysts with varying Si/Al ratios, AlMCM-41 (Si/Al = 18) was found to be the most active catalyst as it converted 65% of jatropha oil yielding 39% of bioliquid fuel with 47% and 36% selectivities towards green diesel and green gasoline respectively. In the core-shell architecture of the composite catalyst, different % coatings of the best active mesoporous material (AlMCM-41, Si/Al = 18) over the best active microporous material (ZSM-5, Si/Al = 14) were done. AlMCM-41/ZSM-5 (25, 15, 10) showed remarkable performance in the conversion of jatropha oil (99%) yielding 70% of bioliquid fuel with very high selectivity (61%) towards green gasoline. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aldehyde emissions were measured from two heavy-duty trucks, namely 2000 and 2008 model year vehicles meeting different EPA emission standards. The tests were conducted on a chassis dynamometer and emissions were collected from a constant volume dilution tunnel. For the 2000 model year vehicle, four different fuels were tested, namely California ultralow sulfur diesel (CARB ULSD), soy biodiesel, animal biodiesel, and renewable diesel. All of the fuels were tested with simulated city and high speed cruise drive cycles. For the 2008 vehicle, only soy biodiesel and CARB ULSD fuels were tested. The research objective was to compare aldehyde emission rates between (1) the test fuels, (2) the drive cycles, and (3) the engine technologies. The results showed that soy biodiesel had the highest acrolein emission rates while the renewable diesel showed the lowest. The drive cycle also affected emission rates with the cruise drive cycle having lower emissions than the urban drive cycle. Lastly, the newer vehicle with the diesel particulate filter had greatly reduced carbonyl emissions compared to the other vehicles, thus demonstrating that the engine technology had a greater influence on emission rates than the fuels. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and the energy recovery potential of mesophilic (30-35 °C) anaerobic digestion of animal wastes (manure) at a centralized biogas plant (CBP) for 35,000 cattle. The proposed CBP is composed of an equalization tank followed by pasteurization and 3+[1/2] modules; i.e. each module consists of four completely mixed anaerobic reactors with a capacity of treating the manure from 10,000 cattle. The effect of maize silage loading, as the cosubstrate, both on biomethane production and feasibility of the system was also evaluated. Besides, the transport fuel substitutes of the produced biomethane with or without co-substrate were also investigated. Results of the proposed CBP indicated that biomethane production increased ca. 1.65 fold with co-substrate addition and pay-back periods for one module treating 10,000 cattle manure are calculated to be ca. 11 and 7.0 yr without and with silage addition, respectively. Besides, considering the potential revenue when replacing transport fuels, about 74 heavy goods vehicles or 1,560 cars may be powered per year by the biogas produced from the proposed CBP where the co-digestion of manure and maize silage is applied. © IWA Publishing 2012.

AB  - Ten yeast strains were evaluated concerning their capabilities to assimilate biodiesel-derived glycerol in batch cultivation. The influence of glycerol concentration, temperature, pH and yeast extract concentration on biomass production was studied for the yeast selected. Further, the effect of agitation on glycerol utilization by the yeast Hansenula anomala was also studied. The yeast H. anomala CCT 2648 showed the highest biomass yield (0.30 gg -1) and productivity (0.19 gL -1 h -1). Citric acid, succinic acid, acetic acid and ethanol were found as the main metabolites produced. The increase of yeast extract concentration from 1 to 3 gL -1 resulted in high biomass production. The highest biomass concentration (21 gL -1), yield (0.45 gg -1) and productivity (0.31 gL -1 h -1), as well as ribonucleotide production (13.13 mg g -1), were observed at 700 rpm and 0.5 vvm. These results demonstrated that glycerol from biodiesel production process showed to be a feasible substrate for producing biomass and ribonucleotides by yeast species. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

AB  - This study evaluates the sustainability of biodiesel for transport in Thailand in terms of the availability of fresh fruit bunches (FFB) and crude palm oil (CPO) supply to satisfy the future demands for food and fuel, and the contribution of palm biodiesel to mitigating climate change if biodiesel induces land-use change (LUC). Five land conversions including rubber, cassava, paddy field, set-aside land, and forest land to oil palm are considered along with their displacement effects to other land types to evaluate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the direct and indirect land-use impacts. The net feedstock balance reveals that the policy to expand 0.4 million hectare (Mha) for new oil palm plantations accompanied with an increase of FFB yield to 22 megagrams per hectare (Mg/ha) by 2012 would help avoid a CPO shortage; however, this increase in land use needs to be strongly encouraged. The GHG analyses show a wide range of net GHG balances compared to diesel depending on which type of land is converted and which options are used to treat the oil palm wastes. Except for forest land conversion, direct LUC emissions from converting other lands to oil palm will render benefit to the GHG balance of biodiesel. Indirect LUC emissions through crop displacements, however, will generally worsen the balance. Several recommendations are therefore suggested for sustainable palm biodiesel production in the future. © 2012 by Yale University.

AB  - This study analyzes the potential environmental impacts and socioeconomic benefits of installing a pilot plant for biodiesel production from used cooking oil (UCO) collected from hotels, restaurants, and bars in the Copacabana district of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Currently much of this oil is used to produce soaps or simply disposed of directly into the sewage system, contributing to the eutrophication of bodies of water. An analysis is made of the production of biodiesel by the alkaline transesterification of UCO with ethanol using a sodium hydroxide catalyst. In order to analyze the environmental impacts, the ten stages of the life cycle of biodiesel made from UCO are assessed. The environmental impact of producing 1 metric ton of biodiesel is evaluated on the basis of the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. In order to assess the economic feasibility of the pilot plant, a cash flow deterministic method was employed to evaluate the investment required. The social performance of the project was assessed using Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) indicators. The environmental analysis showed that ethanol production and fuel combustion are the stages that had the highest environmental impact. The findings of the economic analysis showed that it would be feasible for the Rio de Janeiro city council to implement a pilot plant in the Copacabana district of the city. The results of the social performance analysis indicated that the project would have a positive impact on local job and income generation. © 2012 by Yale University.

AB  - The emissions generated by five trucks from model years 1999, 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2010, were studied. Emissions measurements using a portable emissions measurement system were performed on the five trucks driven with 20% biodiesel. Three of the five trucks were also operated with ultralow sulfur diesel. A Comparison of data from the 1999 model year truck vs. 2010 showed that both particulate matter and NO dropped by 90%. Assessment on the impact of biodiesel revealed that CO emissions were lower with biodiesel because it is oxygenated as compared to standard petroleum derived fuel. Particulate matter varied from one truck to another. Hydrocarbon levels were below the detection limits in all cases and a slight reduction in NO levels was observed in some cases.

AB  - Biodiesel is promoted as environmentally less harmful than diesel fuel. Nevertheless its water-solublefraction (WSF) may contain methanol, which appears by a reversion of the transesterification reaction, when biodiesel contacts water. This paper evaluated the loss of the lysosomal membrane integrity in liver homogenate of juvenils Tilapia exposed to biodiesels-WSF, through the increase of the acid phosphatase activity, as an evidence of citotoxicity. Differences in the enzyme activity levels (3.4, 2.3 and 0.8 mU mg-1 total protein over the control value, which was 1.6 mU mg-1 total protein), found for castor oil, waste cooking-oil and palm oil-biodiesels, respectively, were indicative of their toxicity according to this decreasing trend. WSF-chromatograms suggest the cytotoxicity as related to methanol. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

AB  - Microalgae are currently receiving strong consideration as a potential biofuel feedstock to help meet the advanced biofuels mandate of the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act because of its theoretically high yield (gal/acre/year) in comparison to current terrestrial feedstocks. For algal methyl ester biodiesel, fuel properties will be directly related to the fatty acid composition of the lipids produced by the given microalgae strain. Several microalgae species under consideration for wide scale cultivation, such as Nannochloropsis, produce lipids with fatty acid compositions containing substantially higher quantities of long chain-polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) in comparison to terrestrial feedstocks. It is expected that increased levels of LC-PUFA will be problematic in terms of meeting all of the current ASTM specifications for biodiesel. Moreover, these same LC-PUFA fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA: C20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA: C22:6) are known to have high nutritional value, thereby making separation of these compounds economically attractive. Given the uncertainty in the future value of these LC-PUFA compounds and the economic viability of the separation process, the goal of this study was to examine the oxidative stability of algal methyl esters with varying levels of EPA and DHA. Tests were conducted using a Metrohm 743 Rancimat with automatic induction period determination following ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards, which call for induction periods of at least 3 and 6 h, respectively. Tests were conducted at a temperature of 110 °C and airflow of 10 l/h with model algal methyl ester compounds synthesized from various sources to match the fatty acid compositions of several algae strains subjected to varying removal amounts of roughly 0% to 100% LC-PUFA. In addition, tests were also conducted with real algal methyl esters produced from multiple sources. The bis-allylic position equivalent (BAPE) was calculated for each fuel sample to quantify the level of unsaturation. The induction period was then plotted as a function of BAPE, which showed that the oxidative stability varied exponentially with the amount of LC-PUFA. The results suggest that removal of 45 to 65 of the LC-PUFA from Nannochloropsis-based algal methyl esters would be sufficient for meeting existing ASTM specifications for oxidative stability. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - The petroleum fuel is nearing the line of extinction. Recent research and technology have provided promising outcomes to rely on biodiesel as the alternative and conventional source of fuel. The use of renewable source - vegetable oil constitutes the main stream of research. In this preliminary study, Waste Cooking Oil (WCO) was used as the substrate for biodiesel production. Lipase enzyme producing fungi Rhizopus oryzae 262 and commercially available pure lipase enzyme were used for comparative study in the production of Fatty Acid Alkyl Esters (FAAE). The whole cell (RO 262) and pure lipase enzyme (PE) were immobilized using calcium alginate beads. Calcium alginate was prepared by optimizing with different molar ratios of calcium chloride and different per cent sodium alginate. Entrapment immobilization was done for whole cell biocatalyst (WCB). PE was also immobilized by entrapment for the transesterification reaction. Seven different solvents - methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, iso-propanol, iso-butanol and iso-amyl alcohol were used as the acyl acceptors. The reaction parameters like temperature (30°C), molar ratio (1:3 - oil:solvent), reaction time (24. h), and amount of enzyme (10% mass ratio to oil) were also optimized for methanol alone. The same parameters were adopted for the other acyl acceptors too. Among the different acyl acceptors - methanol, whose reaction parameters were optimized showed maximum conversion of triglycerides to FAAE-94% with PE and 84% with WCB. On the whole, PE showed better catalytic converting ability with all the acyl acceptor compared to WCB. Gas chromatography analysis (GC) was done to determine the fatty acid composition of WCO (sunflower oil) and FAAE production with different acyl acceptors. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Canadian pinewood was pyrolyzed at 450. °C in an Infrared oven and the pyrolysis vapors were converted by passing through a catalyst bed at 450. °C. The catalysts studied were amorphous silica alumina (ASA) containing alkali metal or alkaline earth metal species including Na, K, Cs, Mg and Ca. The catalysts effectiveness to reduce the bio-oil oxygen content, to enhance the bio-oil energy density and to change the liquid and gas product distribution were evaluated using different techniques including gravimetric analysis, elemental analysis, Karl-Fischer titration, GC/MS and micro-GC analysis. According to the results K/ASA found to be the most effective catalysts for conversion of hollocellulose (hemicellulose and cellulose)-derived vapors of pinewood while Cs/ASA catalyst was the most effective catalyst for conversion of lignin-derived vapors and production of hydrocarbons. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Etherification of glycerol (GLY) with isobutylene (IB) to produce biofuels was investigated in liquid phase using spherical silica supported Hyflon® catalysts (SSHC). As reference catalyst, Amberlyst® 15 (A-15) acid ion-exchange resin was used. Experiments were carried out in batch mode at a reaction temperature ranging from 323 to 343K. SSHC were found to be very effective systems in etherification of glycerol with IB, providing cumulative di- and tri-ethers yields higher than that obtained by using A-15 catalyst. Furthermore, such catalysts were stable and easily reusable; no leaching of active phase was observed. The formation of poly-substituted ethers, suitable additives for conventional fuels, was favored by operating at an isobutylene/glycerol molar ratio &gt;3 and low reaction time (&lt;6h); however, the concentration of mono-ether reached values lower than 3wt.% only when SSHC catalyst was used. Turnover frequency of glycerol (TOF GLY) highlighted that SSHC systems were much more active than A-15 catalyst: the accessibility and nature of active sites and the surface properties of catalysts were indicated as the main factors affecting the catalytic behavior. A lower acid site density of SSHC than that of A-15 catalyst was decisive in preventing the occurrence of oligomerization reaction which leads to the formation of di-isobutylene (DIB), precursors of gummy products. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The oleaginous microalga Chlorella sp. LAM-H screened from freshwater was proven to be a prospective feedstock for oil production according to its fatty acid composition. In order to enhance lipid production, response surface methodology (RSM) was used with central composite design (CCD) to optimize the heterotrophic cultivation of microalgae. The experiment results showed that a satisfactory second-order polynomial regression equation was achieved with a high coefficient of determination (R 2=0.9911) in analysis of variance. The effects of individual factors and their interactions on lipid productivity were successfully revealed. The greatest lipid productivity reached 247.16mgl -1d -1 under the optimal conditions of glucose concentration 26.2gl -1, sodium nitrate concentration 2.06gl -1 and temperature 28.18°C. Moreover, validation tests were performed and the results were very close to the predicted values. It was demonstrated that the obtained model was effective for predicting lipid productivity of the isolated microalga. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The exhaust emissions from a diesel power generator operating with waste cooking oil biodiesel blends have been studied. Fuel blends with 25%, 50% and 75% of biodiesel concentration in diesel oil were tested, varying engine load from 0 to 25kW. The original engine settings for diesel oil operation were kept the same during the experiments with the biodiesel blends. The main physical-chemical characteristics of the fuel blends used were measured to help with the analysis of the emission results. The results show that the addition of biodiesel to the fuel increases oxides of nitrogen (NOX), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and exhaust gas opacity were also increased with the use of biodiesel. Major increase of NOX was observed at low loads, while CO and HC were mainly increased at high loads. Using 50% of biodiesel in diesel oil, the average increase of CO2, CO, HC and NOX throughout the load range investigated was 8.5%, 20.1%, 23.5% and 4.8%, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - The complementary blending of tung oil biodiesel with coconut oil and palm kernel oil biodiesels was investigated to improve the biodiesel properties. Tung oil is considered a potential non-edible oil feedstock for biodiesel production. However, tung oil biodiesel has unfavorable fuel properties, including a high density, kinematic viscosity, and iodine value and low oxidation stability because of the high content of α-elaeostearic acid (C18:3). In contrast, medium-chain saturated fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) such as lauric acid methyl ester (C12:0) is the predominant component in palm kernel oil and coconut oil biodiesels. The palm kernel oil and coconut oil biodiesels exhibited a low density, kinematic viscosity, and iodine value as well as high oxidation stability, features that are complementary to the deficiencies of tung oil biodiesel. An optimum blending ratio obtained comprised the COME, PKME, and TME at a weight ratio of 20:20:60. Most of the fuel properties of the optimum biodiesel blend could meet the biodiesel specifications, with the exception of the oxidation stability. In addition, the multiple linear correlations between the properties of biodiesel blends and their FAME composition were established. Furthermore, the effectiveness of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), N,N'-di-sec-butyl-p-phenylenediamine (PDA), and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) at concentrations between 1000 and 20,000 ppm was investigated to improve the oxidation stability of the biodiesel blend. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Microalgae, with the ability to mitigate CO2 emission and produce carbohydrates and lipids, are considered one of the most promising resources for producing bioenergy. Recently, we discovered that autophagy plays a critical role in the metabolism of photosynthetic system and lipids production. So far, more than 30-autophagy related (ATG) genes in all subtypes of autophagy have been identified. However, compared with yeast and mammals, in silico and experimental research of autophagy pathways in microalgae remained limited and fragmentary. Principal Findings: In this article, we performed a genome-wide analysis of ATG genes in 7 microalgae species and explored their distributions, domain structures and evolution. Eighteen "core autophagy machinery" proteins, four mammalian-specific ATG proteins and more than 30 additional proteins (including "receptor-adaptor" complexes) in all subtypes of autophagy were analyzed. Data revealed that receptor proteins in cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting and mitophagy seem to be absent in microalgae. However, most of the "core autophagy machinery" and mammalian-specific proteins are conserved among microalgae, except for the ATG9-cycling system in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the second ubiquitin-like protein conjugation complex in several algal species. The catalytic and binding residues in ATG3, ATG5, ATG7, ATG8, ATG10 and ATG12 are also conserved and the phylogenetic tree of ATG8 coincides well with the phylogenies. Chlorella contains the entire set of the core autophagy machinery. In addition, RT-PCR analysis verified that all crucial ATG genes tested are expressed during autophagy in both Chlorella and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Finally, we discovered that addition of 3-Methyladenine (a PI3K specific inhibitor) could suppress the formation of autophagic vacuoles in Chlorella. Conclusions: Taken together, Chlorella may represent a potential model organism to investigate autophagy pathways in photosynthetic eukaryotes. The study will not only promote understanding of the general features of autophagic pathways, but also benefit the production of Chlorella-derived biofuel with future commercial applications. © 2012 Jiang et al.

AB  - Jatropha curcas a multipurpose, drought resistant, perennial plant belonging to family Euphorbiaceae is known for biodiesel production. This paper highlights the role of biotechnological tools in the genetic improvement of Jatropha. In tropical and subtropical countries Jatropha is a potential biofuel crop. It can be grown in low to high rainfall areas either as a commercial crop or hedge. The limitations in available germplasm include lack of knowledge of the genetic base, poor yield, low genetic diversity and vulnerability to a wide array of insects and diseases. Great scope exists for genetic improvement through conventional methods, induced mutations, interspecific hybridization and genetic transformation. Reliable and highly efficient tissue culture protocols for direct and callus-mediated shoot regeneration and somatic embryogenesis are established for Jatropha which indicates potential for widening the genetic base through biotechnological tools. Assessment of genetic diversity using molecular markers disclosed low inter-accessional variability in local Jatropha curcas germplasm. The current status and future prospects of in vitro regeneration, genetic transformation and the role of molecular tools in the genetic enhancement of the oilseed crop are discussed. This paper gives an overview on role of biotechnological techniques in the improvement of Jatropha plant emphasizing the benefit to the rural and urban economy.

AB  - The partitioning behavior of six petrodiesel/soybean-biodiesel blends (B0, B20, B40, B60, B80, and B100, where B100 is 100% unblended biodiesel) in water was investigated at various oil loads by the 10-fold dilution method. Five fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), C10-C20 n-alkanes, and four monoaromatic compounds were targeted for analysis. Only the aromatic compounds were partitioned according to Raoults law at all oil loads. The partitioning of the FAMEs and n-alkanes at higher oil loads was found to be orders of magnitude higher than the reported aqueous solubilities of these compounds, and directly correlated with the amount of oil load applied. Depth filtration of the water-accommodated fractions (WAFs) significantly reduced the observed concentrations of the FAMEs and n-alkanes, but did not appreciably affect the aromatic compounds. The FAMEs and n-alkanes concentrations in the filtered WAFs agreed with the aqueous solubilities of those compounds reported in the literature, but the n-alkanes showed progressive deviations from those solubilities with the increase in the amount of biodiesel in the blends. Further dilution experiments on pure n-hexadecane confirmed the presence of a metastable colloidal phase that seems to be controlled by hydrophobic interactions and surface phenomena. The addition of biodiesel to the oil blend appeared to have a positive impact on the dissolved concentrations and the colloidal accommodation of the n-alkanes. Autoxidation of the biodiesel constituents was found to be significant, and increased with increasing oil loads. Chemical products such as hexanal, n-butyl acetate, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, and diethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate were positively identified among the FAMEs autoxidation byproducts. Our data suggest a positive enhancement for biodiesel on the formation of the oil in water colloidal phase, possibly by forming a surfactant-cosurfactant-like pair of the FAMEs and their autoxidation byproducts. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Black carbon (BC) emissions from China are of global concern. A new BC emission inventory (PKU-BC(China)) has been developed with the following improvements: (1) The emission factor database was updated; (2) a 0.1° × 0.1° gridded map was produced for 2007 based on county-level proxies; (3) time trends were derived for 1949-2007 and predicted for 2008-2050; and (4) the uncertainties associated with the inventory were quantified. It was estimated that 1957 Gg of BC were emitted in China in 2007, which is greater than previously reported. Residential coal combustion was the largest source, followed by residential biofuel burning, coke production, diesel vehicles, and brick kilns. By using a county-level disaggregation method, spatial bias in province-level disaggregation, mainly due to uneven per capita emissions within provinces, was reduced by 42.5%. Emissions increased steadily since 1949 until leveling off in the mid-1990s, due to a series of technological advances and to socioeconomic progress. BC emissions in China in 2050 are predicted to be 920-2183 Gg/yr under various scenarios; and the industrial and transportation sectors stand to benefit the most from technological improvements. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This work improved the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) quality produced using a stoichiometric methanol to oil molar ratio, removing monoglycerides (MGs), diglycerides (DGs) and glycerol by using a ceramic membrane. This work improved the conventional biodiesel batch reactor (CBR) performance, adding a refining stage using a ceramic membrane according to two different operational strategies: a batch reactor membrane system (CBR-MS) and a sequential batch membrane reactor (SBMR). The SBMR strategy showed the best results with an 87. wt.% FAME conversion yield and a 99.9% glycerol removal efficiency. SBMR was based on the operation of consecutives cycles of charge, transesterification, and discharge of permeate by operating the membrane only when a 70% FAME conversion was reached. This allowed both to work with a low viscosity product, increasing the permeate flux during the filtration process, and to diminish MG and DG content in the permeate. The application of the SBMR strategy improved a 34% the FAME content in the final product, in comparison to the CBR and 13% in comparison to CBR-MS. In addition, MG content was reduced a 79% in the final product in comparison to the CBR and a 20% compared to the CBR-MS. Finally, the DG content was reduced a 78% in comparison to the CBR and a 50% compared to the CBR-MS system when applying the SBMR strategy. It is proposed that the biodiesel successful separation-refining performance depends on the evolution of the emulsion during transesterification, as the ceramic membrane cannot remove MG and DG, but using the adequate strategy, their removal is possible from the biofuel stream. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present study of experimentation, locally available biofuels, such as rubber seed oil (non edible oil), coconut oil, and palm oil (edible oils), were used as alternative fuels to diesel in a compression ignition engine. The properties of these oils, such as viscosity, specific gravity, calorific value, flash point, and fire point, were determined. The effect of temperature on viscosity of vegetable oils (rubber seed oil, coconut oil, and palm oil) was examined. It was found that the viscosity of coconut oil reduces drastically compared to rubber seed oil and palm oil at all temperatures (40-80°C). High viscosity of vegetable oils was reduced by preheating to use directly in engines. The performance and emission characteristics of a single cylinder, direct-injection diesel engine were determined using diesel and vegetable oils (unheated and preheated conditions). The CO emission was reduced and performance improved for preheated vegetable oils. It is concluded that from the findings of experimentation, the preheated vegetable oils could be used as substitutes to diesel fuel for short-term engine operation. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Synthetic antioxidants are an alternative to prevent or retard the degradation of biofuels made from vegetable oils. In this study, it was evaluated the oxidative stability of B100 soybean oil biodiesel, in the presence of tercbutylhydroquinone (TBHQ). The results showed that the induction period, that precedes the seeding process, was delayed in the presence of the antioxidant. Moreover, the obtained results suggest that the B100 biodiesel containing TBHQ can present a storage time at 25 °C, three times longer than the estimated time for the pure B100.

AB  - Biofuels have been getting considerable attention because of global emphasis on reducing greenhouse gases, considering the environment and energy security. The use of biodiesel to (partially) replace fossil diesel has a significant potential for reducing pollution and creating economic benefits for farmers. Jatropha curcas is a non-edible crop and an important source for producing clean energy from its oil. Seeds and other parts of Jatropha can be processed to produce oil containing substances called phorbol esters. These esters can recovered as valuable co-products to be used for various agricultural, medical and pharmaceutical applications. On the other hand, clays (bentonite) are usually in fixing the organic compounds. In the present study we investigated the adsorption and sorption of phorbol esters on clays. We found that the optimum conditions for adsorption of phorbol esters were using 15% (w/v) of bentonite stirred at 100 rpm and at room temperature. Bentonite characterization was done using infrared spectroscopy and X-rays diffraction. Desorption of phorbol esters has been evaluated and achieved co-product recovery of 82-100% from Jatropha oil. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

AB  - Biofuels (biodiesel) when used in mixtures with fossil fuels (diesel oil) become potential soil contaminants. The natural attenuation due to the low cost and little intervention in the natural conditions of the area is a competitive technique in soil decontamination. The aim of this study was to evaluate the degradation in laboratory of a residual soil from basalt contaminated with diesel and biodiesel mixtures. The soil was contaminated with a proportion of 4% relating to the mass of dry soil and compacted in the natural density of 1.6 g/cm3. The final soil moisture after contamination was 34%. It was used six different percentages of biodiesel called: B0, B5, B12.5, B20, B50, and B100. The mixture were molded in bioreactors in duplicate. Samples were collected after 105 days and they were analyzed by the Soxhlet extraction method and gas chromatography. The results showed that mixtures with higher percentage of biodiesel are more degradable. This shows that besides biodiesel being more biodegradable than diesel, it also assists in the degradation of fossil mixtures. To up to 12,5% of biodiesel in the mixture there was no significant difference in degradation.

AB  - The Planning Commission, Government of India has set a target of 20 per cent blending of diesel with bio-diesel by the year 2012 to reduce the wide gap between demand and supply of petroleum products. This requires cultivating bio-diesel yielding crops on 11 M.ha to yield 13 M.t. of bio-diesel per year. In response to this, the Government of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP) launched a massive bio-fuel plantation programme in 2004-05. Since there was not enough research data to back a massive field plantation, GoAP sanctioned a R&D project on bio-fuels to CRIDA. The on-farm experiments were initiated in farmers' fields during kharif, 2005 in 69 acres in three districts of Andhra Pradesh with three levels each of irrigation, nutrition, pruning and four levels of spacings. The wider spacing (3×2m or 4×2m) enabled inter-cropping, partial mechanisation, response to irrigation in Jatropha. Irrigation at 30 per cent of evapo transpiration level in combination with N and P at 45g and 100g per plant gave better results. The capsule bearing bunches were more, when the plants were pruned at 45 cm or 60 cm height. In order to provide immediate income to the farmer besides improving soil fertility, legume inter-cropping with pigeonpea, blackgram and horsegram was successfully taken up. Farmers were disappointed with the low levels of yields (0.5 - 0.8 t/ha) even after five years because of non-availability of promising variety/selection and no immediate buyers for the harvested seed in the vicinity. There is a need for quality seed collection, value addition and increased wages. The scientific know-how will have to be disseminated through mass media, training of trainers and seed collectors; seminars, etc. on various aspects of production technology and processing.

AB  - Recent increases in energy demands as a consequence of population growth and industrialization, and pollution caused during the extraction and combustion of fossil fuel sources have driven the development of new energy sources that do not cause pollution and are inexpensive and renewable. Consequently, it is necessary to develop alternative ways of generating biofuels that put less pressure on agricultural lands and water supplies, and ensure ecosystems conservation. In order to achieve the proposed goals related to energetic coverage and independence, several approaches have been developed, including biodiesel production using vegetal oils as feedstock. The aim of the current research project was to apply a nonconventional bioprocess for in vitro biomass and oil production of Jatropha curcas, for assessing different J. curcas varieties, where seed tissue was isolated and used for callus induction. Once friable callus was obtained, cell suspension cultures were established. The cell viability, fatty acid content, and characteristics were used to select the most promising cell line according to its fatty acid profile and ability to grow and develop under in vitro conditions. Oil produced by cell suspension culture of the Jatropha varieties studied was extracted and characterized by GC/MS. Differences encountered among Jatropha varieties were related to their fatty acid profiles, oil content (% on dry basis), and cell viability measurements (%). © 2012 Publishing Technology.

AB  - There are a wide and growing variety of feedstocks for biodiesel fuel. Most commonly, these feedstocks contain triglycerides which are transesterified into the fatty acid alkyl esters (FAAEs) which comprise biodiesel fuel. While the tranesterification reaction itself is simple, monitoring the reaction progress and reaction products is not. Gas chromatography- mass spectrometry is useful for assessing the FAAE products, but does not directly address either the tri-, di-, or monoglycerides present from incomplete transesterification or the free fatty acids which may also be present. Analysis of the biodiesel reaction mixture is complicated by the solubility and physical property differences among the components of the tranesterification reaction mixture. In this contribution, we present a simple, rapid HPLC method which allows for monitoring all of the main components in a biodiesel fuel transesterification reaction, with specific emphasis on the ability to monitor the reaction as a function of time. The utilization of a relatively new, core-shell stationary phase for the HPLC column allows for efficient separation of peaks with short elution times, saving both time and solvent. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

AB  - In this work fluorescence-based method to assess the biodiesel production from different refined vegetable oils is presented. Four different refined oils (soybean, sunflower, canola, and corn) and their respective biodiesel were used and the fluorescence of the compounds contained in their compositions was taken as a probe. The results show that the fluorescence intensity of the biodiesel is lower than one verified in the vegetable oil. The data achieved point out that the ratio between the fluorescence intensity of biodiesel and oil is about 0.6 regardless of the vegetable oil feedstock investigated. Reduced content of fluorophores as well as low viscosity of the biodiesel regarding the oil have been raised as hypotheses to explain the low fluorescence intensity of the biodiesel. The results obtained may provide the basis for the development of an alternative method able to give fast and accurate information about the conversion of oil into biodiesel without the requirement of dilution or pretreatment of the biodiesel. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

AB  - Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), a renewable liquid biofuel popularly known as biodiesel, is emerging as a suitable replacement to common diesel fuel (CDF) in unmodified Compression Ignition (CI) engine. Present article reports the development of a process to reduce the operating cost during the conversion of vegetable oil to biodiesel through the application of ultrasound energy. Around 98% yield of FAME could be achieved with low reaction parameters such as methanol-oil molar ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction time, and temperature. The optimum condition for the maximum 98% yield was 1.0 wt% of NaOH catalyst, 5:1 methanol: oil molar ratio and temperature 55°C under a sonication frequency of 20 kHz. With these reaction parameters the conversion occurred in just 5 minutes. The FAME obtained was purified in an effective way by water washing followed by passing over a bed of silica gel. The purified FAME was subjected to the evaluation of its fuel characteristics in a four-stroke, single-cylinder CI engine, which could operate with variable compression ratio. The engine performance study revealed that lower blends of biodiesel up to B20 could be an efficient fuel for an unmodified CI engine. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Diesel engines are most suitable for biodiesel fuel because diesel fuel has a higher cetane number compared to gasoline and diesel engines have no spark ignition system; hence, engine conversion is easy and cost effective. For these reasons, in this study, the spray behavior characteristics of vegetable palm oil were analyzed by using a common-rail injection system of a commercial diesel engine, and the results were compared with those obtained for the diesel fuel. The injection pressures and blend ratios of palm oil and diesel fuel (BD3, BD5, BD20, BD30, BD50, and BD100) were the main parameters. The experiments were conducted for different injection pressures-500 bar, 1000 bar, 1500 bar, and 1600 bai-by setting the injection duration at 500 us. We determined there is no significant difference in the macro characteristics of the spray behavior (spray penetration and spray angle) in response to any change in the blend ratio of palm oil and diesel fuel at a fixed injection pressure. In particular, all experiments showed a spray angle of approximately 15°. © 2012 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - A wide range of bioenergy crops has been proposed as feedstocks that can serve as renewable and ecologically sound substitutes to fossil fuels. In the United States, corn grain (Zea mays) ethanol is the primary biofuel, with over 49 billion liters produced in 2010. Along with the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 mandate, concerns about competition for food, land availability, nutrient and water requirements, energy balances, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have prompted researchers to investigate other potential feedstocks. These include second-generation lignocellulosic feedstock and third-generation biodiesel from microalgae and cyanobacteria. However, each feedstock option has associated benefits and consequences for its use. One technique used to evaluate the energy efficiency of bioenergy production systems is the life-cycle assessment (LCA), where system inputs and outputs are computed in terms of either C or energy equivalents to assess the net gains in energy or C offsets. This article collates and synthesizes information about feedstock production options. Results show a wide range of calculated energy and GHG balances, even for the same feedstock species. Discrepancies in LCA and uncertainty thus make direct comparisons difficult and prevent a consensus in determining feedstock suitability. Recommendations must be based upon LCA model assumptions, crop species, cultivation methods, management practices, and energy conversion choices. Currently lignocellulosic feedstock, while a better alternative than corn grain, is not a long-term viable energy source. New feedstocks and technologies are necessary if bioenergy is to be C-neutral and efficient in energy production and land use. Although C fluxes are considered in LCA, one important ecosystem C stock that has previously been left out of many LCA models is changes to soil organic carbon (SOC). Future research, developments, and priorities are discussed for options to produce low C fuel sources and stabilize the climate. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - seed crops, such as rapeseed, sunflower, soyabean and safflower and non-edible seed oil plantation crops Jatropha and Pongamia have proved to be internationally viable commercial sources of vegetable oils for biodiesel production. Considering the paucity of edible oils and unsustainability of arable land under perennial plantation of Jatropha and Pongamia in countries such as India, the prospects of seed oil producing Cleome viscosa, an annual wild short duration plant species of the Indogangetic plains, were evaluated for it to serve as a resource for biodiesel. The seeds of C. viscosa resourced from its natural populations growing in Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi areas of Aravali range were solvent extracted to obtain the seed oil. The oil was observed to be similar in fatty acid composition to the non-edible oils of rubber, Jatropha and Pongamia plantation crops and soybean, sunflower, safflower, linseed and rapeseed edible oil plants in richness of unsaturated fatty acids. The Cleome oil shared the properties of viscosity, density, saponification and calorific values with the Jatropha and Pongamia oils, except that it was comparatively acidic. The C. viscosa biodiesel had the properties of standard biodiesel specified by ASTM and Indian Standard Bureau, except that it had low oxidation stability. It proved to be similar to Jatropha biodiesel except in cloud point, pour point, cold filter plugging point and oxidation stability. In view of the annual habit of species and biodiesel quality, it can be concluded that C. viscosa has prospects to be developed into a short-duration biodiesel crop.

AB  - Background: Acetals can be considered important bio-based diesel additives. The production of most of these compounds, from an alcohol and an aldehyde, suffers from low conversion due to thermodynamic limitations. These limitations can be overcome through the removal of the by-product water. Previous studies showed that the in situ dehydration options of reactive distillation and pervaporation membrane reactor integration offer little advantage or at least not at reasonable unit dimensions. The aim of the present work is the development of a membrane based process and comparison with other alternatives (based on experimental data). Results: Three different membrane processes were developed. The one in which the reaction mixture is recycled over a first dehydration membrane module and subsequently through a simple distillation column, was found to give the highest overall conversion (100%) at low recycle rates and reasonable membrane area. This process was techno-economically compared with other possible alternatives: (1) a process based on a conventional tubular reactor and several distillation columns; and (2) a process based on reactive distillation. Conclusions: Efficient water removal by membranes avoids possible azeotropes in downstream distillation units making them much simpler, reducing considerably the unit sizes and the energy demand (40% lower). © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Thermal hydrolysis of triglycerides to form free fatty acid (FFA) is a well-established industry practice. Recently, this process has been employed as a first step in the production of biofuels from lipids. To that end, batch and continuous hydrolysis of various feedstocks has been examined at the laboratory scale. Canola, the primary feedstock in this paper, camelina and algal oils were converted to high quality FFA. For the different reaction temperatures, the continuous hydrolysis system was found to provide better yields than the laboratory batch system. In addition, CFD simulation with ANSYS-CFX was used to model the performance and reactant/product separation in the continuous, counter-flow reactor. The effects of reaction temperature, water-to-oil ratio (ratio of water and oil volumetric inflow rate), and preheating of the reactants were examined experimentally. Optimization of these parameters has resulted in an improved, continuous process with high mass yields (89-93%, for reactor temperature of 260°C and water-to-oil ratio of 4:1) and energy efficiency (76%, for reactor temperature of 250°C and water-to-oil ratio of 2:1). Based on the product quality and energy efficiency considerations, the reactor temperature of 260°C and water-to-oil ratio of 4:1 have provided the optimal condition for the lab scale continuous hydrolysis reaction. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires 15.2 billion gallons of domestic alternative fuels per year by 2012, of which 2 billion gallons must be from advanced biofuel and emit 50% less life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than petroleum-based transportation fuels. Microalgal biodiesel, one type of advanced biofuel, has the qualities and potential to meet the RFS's requirement. A comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) of four microalgal biodiesel production conditions was investigated using a process LCA model with Monte Carlo simulation to assess global warming potential (GWP), eutrophication, ozone depletion and ecotoxicity potentials. The four conditions represent minimum and maximum production efficiencies and different sources of carbon dioxide and nutrient resources, i.e. synthetic and waste resources. The GWP results of the four CO 2 microalgal biodiesel production conditions showed that none of the assumed production conditions meet the RFS's GHG requirement. The GWP results are sensitive to energy consumption in harvesting process. Other impacts such as eutrophication, ozone depletion and ecotoxicity potentials, are sensitive to percent lipid content of microalgae, service lifetime of PBRs and quantity of hexane in extraction process, respectively. Net energy ratio and other emissions should be included in future RFS for a more sustainable fuel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article evaluates the environmental performance of a biofuel production system based on the fast pyrolysis of short-rotation poplar biomass using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. The system includes a circulating fluidized bed reactor followed by bio-oil upgrading through hydrotreating and hydrocracking to produce gasoline and diesel. The investigated system was selected on the basis of an overview of available technologies for the production and upgrading of fast pyrolysis bio-oil. Inventory data for the whole system were collected and used in order to carry out the life cycle impact assessment. Seven impact categories were evaluated: cumulative energy demand, global warming, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, land competition, acidification and eutrophication. Feedstock pre-treatment, pyrolysis and steam reforming for the production of the hydrogen required for hydroprocessing were identified as the subsystems with the highest contributions to the potential impacts. Within these subsystems, natural gas production, electricity generation and direct emissions to air were the main contributors. Special attention should also be paid to the production of the lignocellulosic biomass feedstock, especially to the associated land occupation and fertilizer requirements. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel, a mixture of long chain fatty acid esters, is an environmental friendly alternative to fossil fuel. This fuel is produced by a transesterification reaction between vegetable oils or animal fats and a short chain alcohol, usually methanol, in the presence of a catalyst. European governments are targeting the incorporation of 10% of biofuels in transportation fuels by 2020. Therefore, the global market for biodiesel is expected to have a significant growth in the next 10 years. According to the European legislation, from the 25 parameters that have to be analyzed to certify biodiesel quality, oxidative stability is of concern, especially when storing biodiesel for long periods. In fact, that property measures the susceptibility of biodiesel to oxidative degradation and is strongly dependent on the type of oil used in the production process and on storage conditions. Thus, EN 14214 establishes a minimum value of 6 h for the oxidative stability of biodiesel under stressed conditions of a standardized assay. This work reports the use of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), coupled with multivariable classification and calibration techniques, to determine the oxidative stability of biodiesel with and without antioxidants. Therefore, biodiesel samples produced from soybean, palm, rapeseed, sunflower and waste frying oils, from mixtures of these oils and also several of these samples after different storage conditions and storage periods some of them containing antioxidants (induction periods between 0.66 and 17.75 h) were used to develop the calibration models. The model for samples without antioxidants is able to estimate the oxidative stability of unknown samples with a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.6 h, which is similar to the reference method error (0.5 h). The introduction of samples containing antioxidants in the calibration/validation sets led to higher prediction errors (RMSEP = 1.28 h) that may be considered acceptable. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study explores the use of high performance ICP-MS to characterize neem biodiesel and commercial biofuels in terms of their trace elemental profiles. A detailed study of this nature delineating heavy metal trends could make a useful contribution to biofuels research. Trace metals in biofuels can create unwanted problems in machinery and engines and therefore, there is a need for consummate quantitative assessment of such species. Biodiesel is known to be a valuable alternative energy resource and can be employed in existing vehicular engines without the need for serious changes in contemporary machinery. However, it has been reported that certain biofuels tend to corrode rubber hosing and tubes in vehicles, and leave unwanted deposits that could ultimately clog fuel lines. Also, trace metal emissions from use of biodiesel could lead to air pollution. Therefore, the presence of trace metals in biofuels can be detrimental both to the environment and equipment. The neem biodiesel that we investigated was produced in our laboratory from neem feedstock (kernels and fruit). A two-step acid-base catalyzed esterification process was applied to produce the neem biodiesel. Small quantities of the sample were digested in mild acid media and submitted to high resolution ICP-MS analysis. The basic physical properties of neem biodiesel were in agreement with those of regular petrodiesel (2D). Forty elements were detected in the neem biofuel and their levels were compared with those of commercially obtained biofuels (B100C/B100R) treated and analyzed under identical conditions. In general the neem biodiesel displayed a higher level of purity. The study is of definite interest to environmentalists and ongoing sustainable development. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The study investigates the effects of non-esterified rapeseed oil, a commonly used liquid first-generation renewable bio-fuel utilized in existing compression ignition engines, on the behavior of the fuel in the high-pressure diesel fuel injection system with a traditional mechanically controlled fuel injection pump. The experiments were carried on a Zetor tractor engine powered by diesel fuel, biodiesel and heated fuel-grade rapeseed oil, instrumented with direct and low-cost indirect fuel injection line pressure sensors. The order-of-magnitude higher viscosity, higher bulk modulus, and higher density of rapeseed oil compared to diesel fuel were found to have measurable effects on the fuel delivery timing, fuel pressure, load on the fuel injection pump, and maximum fuel delivery rates. The low-cost clamp-on pressure sensors provided a good quantitative information about the injection timing but only a qualitative information about the absolute pressure. With rapeseed oil, the load on the fuel injection pump was slightly increased, and the rapeseed oil was delivered earlier and at higher pressures, counteracting the poorer atomization and increased combustion delay, with differences between heated rapeseed oil and diesel fuel decreasing with increasing fuel temperature, but subject to diminishing returns. The fuel temperatures at the injector were markedly higher than at the injection pump inlet at higher engine load, and lower at lower loads. Looping fuel return line to the fuel filter inlet accelerated the warm-up of the fuel. Heating of the fuel past about 55°C and additional electric heating of the high-pressure injection lines had no marked effects on combustion timing or exhaust emissions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The production of biodiesel is greatly increasing due to its environmental benefits. However, production costs are still rather high compared to petroleum-based diesel fuel. In this investigation we report a production process that reduces the cost of biodiesel. The process proposed in this investigation, brings biodiesel production cost down due to the use of a solar heater as energy source to attain the reaction temperatures, the use of nonedible Jatropha curcas crude oil (JCCO) as raw material, and the use of low cost Zn filings as esterification catalyst. This biofuel was produced from nonedible Mexican J. curcas crude oil (JCCO) by a two step catalyzed process. The free fatty acids (FFAs) were first esterified with methanol, catalyzed by Zn filings. This catalyst showed a high FFA esterification activity and high stability. XRD study indicated that after 20 esterification runs, the Zn metallic surface remained unaffected. The use of Zn filings prevents the water waste streams, excess of methanol, high pressure and high cost stainless steel equipment used to eliminate the homogeneous acid catalyst that would have been used for the FFA esterification. During the second step, the triglycerides present in the JCCO were transesterified with methanol catalyzed by NaOH. The chromatographic analysis of the biodiesel obtained, revealed that the process proposed in this investigation led to a very high quality biodiesel, meeting the international requirements for its utilization as a fuel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article reported the synthesis of phosphorylated compounds derived from cardanol, a phenolic by-product of the cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) industry, and its application as antioxidants for biodiesel. These compounds were added in biodiesel samples in three different concentrations (500, 1000 and 2000 ppm) and their antioxidants activities were tested by thermogravimetric analysis (TG), analyzing the onset (T e) and endset (T o) temperatures values as reference parameters, as also by evaluating their integral procedure degradation temperatures (IPDTs). The results showed that the addition of new antioxidants increased the thermal stability of biodiesel, making this biofuel more resistant to thermo-oxidative process. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this comparative study, direct conversion of algal biomass into biodiesel using supercritical methanol (SCM) and microwave-assisted (MW) transesterification methods was investigated. Wet algal biomass was used as feedstock in the supercritical methanol process and dry algal biomass for the microwave-assisted transesterification. Experimental runs were designed using a response surface methodology and the process parameters such as wet/dry algae to methanol ratio, reaction temperature, reaction time and catalyst concentrations were optimized for both processes. The microwave-assisted approach improves extractions of algae significantly, with a higher efficiency, reduced extractive-transesterification time and increased yield. While the non-catalytic supercritical methanol method produces highly purified extracts (free of harmful solvents and catalyst residues), and reduces energy consumption in separation and purification steps. The algal biodiesel samples from SCM and MW processes were compared using FT-IR and TGA analysis methods to identify the functional group attributions and thermal stability of the biofuel samples, respectively. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of algal biomass and lipid extracted algae (LEA) and energy requirements for the two processes are also presented. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Terracotta pots were converted into simple, single chamber, air-cathode bio-batteries. This bio-battery design used a graphite-felt anode and a conductive graphite coating without added catalyst on the exterior as a cathode. Bacteria enriched from river sediment served as the anode catalyst. These batteries gave an average OCV of 0.56V±0.02, a Coulombic efficiency of 21±5%, and a peak power of 1.06mW±0.01(33.13mW/m 2). Stable current was also produced when the batteries were operated with hay extract in salt solution. The bacterial community on the anode of the batteries was tested for air tolerance and desiccation resistance over a period ranging from 2days to 2weeks. The results showed that the anode community could survive complete drying of the electrolyte for several days. These data support the further development of this technology as a potential power source for LED-based lighting in off-grid, rural communities. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Laminar premixed flames of the two smallest isomeric amines, dimethylamine and ethylamine, were investigated under one-dimensional low-pressure (40. mbar) conditions with the aim to elucidate pathways that may contribute to fuel-nitrogen conversion in the combustion of biomass. For this, identical flames of both fuels diluted with 25% Ar were studied for three different stoichiometries (Φ= 0.8, 1.0, and 1.3) using in situ molecular-beam mass spectrometry (MBMS). Quantitative mole fractions of reactants, products and numerous stable and reactive intermediates were determined by electron ionization (EI) MBMS with high mass resolution to separate overlapping features from species with different heavy elements by exact mass. Species assignment was assisted by using single-photon vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization (PI) MBMS. The results indicate formation of a number of nitrogenated intermediates, including toxic species such as HCN, in appreciable concentrations. Such intermediate species mole fractions may depend not only on stoichiometry, but also on fuel structure.We attempted to analyze the major pathways in the two flames with a detailed combustion model developed for this purpose. For this, thermochemical values for a number of intermediates had to be determined from quantum chemistry calculations. Also, specific sets of reactions were incorporated for the two fuels. While many trends seen in the experiments can be successfully reproduced by the simulations, additional efforts may be needed to reliably describe the fuel-nitrogen chemistry in the combustion of biomass-related model fuels with amine functions. © 2012 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - Increasing demand for renewable feedstock-based biofuels is driving the interest and rapid development of processes to produce fuels and chemicals from biomass-generated syngas. Biomass is gasified to produce syngas that can be converted via thermochemical routes to fuels and chemicals such as alcohols, olefins, and fuel grade hydrocarbons. An alternate route to produce liquid products from syngas is through gas fermentation, a hybrid thermochemical/ biochemical process. Biomass gasification, thermochemical syngas conversion routes, and gas fermentation are described including a comparison for converting biomass to ethanol via thecurrent thermochemical route versus gas fermentation. © 2012 American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).

AB  - A comprehensive examination is made of the characteristics and quality requirements of bio-oil from fast pyrolysis of biomass. An appreciation of the potential for bio-oil to meet a broad spectrum of applications in renewable energy has led to a significantly increased R&D activity that has focused on addressing liquid quality issues both for direct use for heat and power and indirect use for biofuels and green chemicals. This increased activity is evident in North America, Europe, and Asia with many new entrants as well as expansion of existing activities. The only disappointment is the more limited industrial development and also deployment of fast pyrolysis processes that are necessary to provide the basic bio-oil raw material. © 2012 American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).

AB  - Biodiesel was produced from waste frying oil (WFO) using powdered calcined clamshell (Mereterix mereterix) as a heterogeneous catalyst. Clamshell calcined at 1173 K for 2.5 and 3.5 h showed different catalytic activities. Calcination for 3.5 h resulted in a catalyst of higher activity and reduced transesterification reaction time. The raw and calcined clamshells were characterized by XRD, FTIR, XRF spectroscopy and BET analysis. The XRD peaks showed the characteristics peaks of CaO at 2θ = 37.4, 47.3, and 54.4°. A few high intensity peaks of Ca(OH) 2 at 2θ = 17.9 and 34.1° in the calcined catalyst were also obtained which might have formed due to exposure of CaO with atmospheric air. The used catalyst showed peaks at 8.2 and 10.1° which were characteristic of calcium glyceroxide which was formed due to reaction of calcium oxide and glycerol. Formation of Ca(OH) 2 in the calcined clamshell was also confirmed by FTIR spectra which showed a sharp OH - stretching band. The catalyst was found to comprise principally of calcium (97%) and a few minor elements (Si, Na, Fe, Al, Sr, S, Mn) as analyzed by XRF. The surface area of the calcined clamshell was found to be 2.6 m 2 g -1. The optimum values for various parameters were found to be 3.0 g of catalyst and 25 ml of methanol per 100 ml of oil (6.03:1, methanol to oil molar ratio) at 333 K in 3 h. A high yield (&gt;89%) and conversion (&gt;97%) were obtained on optimization of variables. With the mandatory compulsion by National Biofuel Policy in India to blend 20% of biofuels i.e. bioethanol and biodiesel in the spark ignition and compression ignition engines respectively from 2017 strengthens the applicability of the present study that utilizes waste resources as feedstock and catalyst in the production of a green fuel i.e. biodiesel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - For European homes without access to the natural gas grid, the main fuels-of-choice for heating are heating oil and LPG. How do the carbon footprints of these compare? Existing literature does not clearly answer this, so the current study was undertaken to fill this gap.Footprints were estimated in seven countries that are representative of the EU and constitute two-thirds of the EU-27 population: Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland and the UK. Novelties of the assessment were: systems were defined using the EcoBoiler model; well-to-tank data were updated according to most-recent research; and combustion emission factors were used that were derived from a survey conducted for this study.The key finding is that new residential heating systems fuelled by LPG are 20% lower carbon and 15% lower overall-environmental-impact than those fuelled by heating oil. An unexpected finding was that an LPG system's environmental impact is about the same as that of a bio heating oil system fuelled by 100% rapeseed methyl ester, Europe's predominant biofuel. Moreover, a 20/80 blend (by energy content) with conventional heating oil, a bio-heating-oil system generates a footprint about 15% higher than an LPG system's.The final finding is that fuel switching can pay off in carbon terms. If a new LPG heating system replaces an ageing oil-fired one for the final five years of its service life, the carbon footprint of the system's final five years is reduced by more than 50%. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Euphorbia lathyris L. is a weed that grows in central and southern Chile. Its seeds have a high oil content, as do those of Brassica napus L. and Ricinus communis L. The oils of these species can be used for biodiesel production. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the yield and quality of biodiesel produced from the oil of E. lathyris, as compared with that of B. napus and R. communis, and to characterize chemically its press cake. The biodiesel was elaborated using basic transesterification on the laboratory scale. We determined the yield of biodiesel and its main quality parameters according to current quality standards. The press cake was characterized chemically and its caloric value was determined. The results indicate that it is possible to produce biodiesel from the oil of E. lathyris with a yield of 91.1%; the quality of the E. lathyris biodiesel was equivalent to that obtained using B. napus oil and superior to that obtained with R. communis oil. Given their properties, the press cakes resulting from the oil extraction process of E. lathyris and the other two plants studied can be used in other productive processes such as the production of biofertilizers or thermal energy (17.75-23.84MJkg -1). © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper attempts an integrated environmental assessment of certain crops, their products and by-products, which are promoted in Greece, as potential raw materials for liquid biofuel and low carbon energy production. The analysis is based on the experimental results of a Greek state funded research project (Hi-Bred fuels), which investigated the integrated management of energy crops for both biofuel and energy production. Four crops, some new for Greek agriculture and other indigenous, namely rapeseed, soya, sunflower and cotton, were cultivated under "real farming" conditions, keeping detailed data of all important aspects affecting their environmental profile. The main industrial processes employed in Greece for extracting, processing and esterifying vegetable oil from the oleiferous seeds were also identified and studied in detail. The data collected during the various production steps were introduced in Global Emission Model for Integrated Systems (GEMIS) software in order to create production cycle models of both non-esterified (straight vegetable oil) and esterified (biodiesel) biofuel models. Dedicated experiments were performed on a diesel passenger car in order to investigate the applicability of the final products. Results indicate that sunflower has the optimal environmental characteristics with respect to biofuel production with potential GHG savings of 58-71% depending on the end product. Rapeseed followed with GHG savings potential of 48%-62%, soyabean oil (47%-60%) and cottonseed oil (35%-47%). For the different products, and production steps, the results of the analysis for energy, CO 2 equivalent emissions and other pollutant emissions are presented. Results concerning energy crops adaptability in Greek climate conditions and their product yields were quite promising, with the exception of the watering demands, which in some cases were not sustainable (GHG savings below 35%). Vehicle application results indicate that on a low level concentration (up to 10%v/v) all biofuels may be employed without important effects on vehicle emissions. Finally it is concluded that the use of residual waste biomass is a key aspect for achieving sustainable and environmentally efficient biofuels. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We report the preparation of two hydrocracking catalysts Pd/CoMoO4/silica and Pd/CNTs/CoMoO4/silica (CNTs, carbon nanotubes). The structure, morphologies, composition, and thermal stability of catalysts were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The catalyst activity was measured in a Parr reactor with camelina fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) as the feed. The analysis shows that the palladium nanoparticles have been incorporated onto mesoporous silica in Pd/CoMoO4/silica or on the CNTs surface in Pd/CNTs/CoMoO4/silica catalysts. The different combinations of metals and supports have selective control cracking on heavy hydrocarbons. © 2012 Ling Fei et al.

AB  - Nowadays, the increasing oil consumption throughout the world induces crucial economical, security, and environmental problems. As a result, intensive researches are undertaken to find appropriate substitution to fossil fuels. In view of the large amount of eucalyptus trees present in arid areas, we focus in this study on the investigation of using eucalyptus biodiesel as fuel in diesel engine. Eucalyptus oil is converted by transesterification into biodiesel. Eucalyptus biodiesel characterization shows that the physicochemical properties are comparable to those of diesel fuel. In the second phase, a single cylinder air-cooled, DI diesel engine was used to test neat eucalyptus biodiesel and its blends with diesel fuel in various ratios (75, 50, and 25 by v) at several engine loads. The engine combustion parameters such as peak pressure, rate of pressure rise, and heat release rate are determined. Performances and exhaust emissions are also evaluated at all operating conditions. Results show that neat eucalyptus biodiesel and its blends present significant improvements of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbon, and particulates emissions especially at high loads with equivalent performances to those of diesel fuel. However, the NOx emissions are slightly increased when the biodiesel content is increased in the blend. Copyright © 2012 Lyes Tarabet et al.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic computer aided technique to design a sustainable (safe, environmentally friendly and economical) tailor-made "green diesel" blend that satisfies a set of desirable target properties. In this work, the software, Integrated Computer Aided System (ICAS) was used to predict the green diesel properties. The blending model is formulated to identify a set of feasible mixture blends that satisfy the desirable target properties such as density and viscosity. The blend design problem is formulated as an NLP problem and solved through GAMS. Application of the systematic technique yields several promising green diesel blends. Four final candidate blends were selected based on three key criterion, i.e. cost, sulfur content and carbon dioxide emissions. The results show that the best diesel contains 82.4% diesel, 16.6% butanol and 1% butyl levulinate. This diesel blend contributes to the reduction of CO 2 emission and sulfur content by up to 15% and 17%, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Experimental work has been carried out on a small displacement Euro 5 automotive diesel engine fueled alternatively with ultralow sulfur diesel (ULSD) and with two blends (30% vol) of ULSD, with two different fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) obtained from rapeseed methyl ester (RME) and jatropha methyl ester (JME). The engine-out particulate matter (PM) emissions have been characterized in terms of number and mass size distributions; measurements were performed under different engine operating conditions that are representative of the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), including cold start of the engine. No significant differences were detected in the particle numbers (PN) for the different fuels under steady-state operating conditions, while a moderate reduction in particle mass size distribution was observed for the biofuel blends. The effects on PN emissions due to shifts in the engine operating points on the calibration maps, caused by the different fuel characteristics, have been shown to be significantly larger than the effects due to the different combustion characteristics of the biofuel blends, thus highlighting the need for a specific adjustment of the engine calibration. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) diesel fuel is a promising biofuel candidate that can complement or substitute traditional diesel fuel in engines. It has been already reported that by changing the fuel from conventional EN590 diesel to HVO decreases exhaust emissions. However, as the fuels have certain chemical and physical differences, it is clear that the full advantage of HVO cannot be realized unless the engine is optimized for the new fuel. In this article, we studied how much exhaust emissions can be reduced by adjusting engine parameters for HVO. The results indicate that, with all the studied loads (50%, 75%, and 100%), particulate mass and NOx can both be reduced over 25% by engine parameter adjustments. Further, the emission reduction was even higher when the target for adjusting engine parameters was to exclusively reduce either particulates or NOx. In addition to particulate mass, different indicators of particulate emissions were also compared. These indicators included filter smoke number (FSN), total particle number, total particle surface area, and geometric mean diameter of the emitted particle size distribution. As a result of this comparison, a linear correlation between FSN and total particulate surface area at low FSN region was found. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A novel hybrid (sequential) comprehensive 2D - multidimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC - MDGC) method for complex sample manipulation and separation is described. It incorporates a separation step that approximates slow modulation GC × GC, prior to microfluidic Deans switch heart-cutting of a targeted region(s) into a third analytical column. It allows discrete single or multiple components, bands or regions, or any combination of these to be selected and excised from within the 2D GC × GC separation space. The excised individual components can be further collected and studied. Alternatively, any unresolved or poorly resolved components, or regions that require further separation, can be transferred to an additional (third) column separation step. The method is applied to separation and quantitative analysis of oxygenates in a thermally stressed algae-derived biofuel oil by using flame ionization detection (FID), without any prefractionation. This permits oxygenated compounds to be fully resolved from saturated (matrix) compounds, which are completely excluded from the third column. Improved separation was obtained between target classes (aldehydes, 2-ketones, alcohols, acids). Excellent calibration linearity, and retention time and peak area reproducibility were obtained for 14 oxy-compounds present in trace amount in the complex biofuel matrix. Accuracy of microfluidic transfer to the third column, and the profile reproducibility before and after heart-cut operations, was demonstrated by extracting single components from a complex coffee volatile sample. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Emission properties and quantities from combustion sources can vary significantly during operation, and this characteristic variability is hidden in the traditional presentation of emission test averages. As a complement to the emission test averages, we introduce the notion of statistical pattern analysis to characterize temporal fluctuations in emissions, using cluster analysis and frequency plots. We demonstrate this approach by comparing emissions from traditional and improved wood-burning cookstoves under in-field conditions, and also to contrast laboratory and in-field cookstove performance. Compared with traditional cookstoves, improved cookstoves eliminate emissions that occur at low combustion efficiency. For cookstoves where the only improvement is an insulated combustion chamber, this change results in emission of more light-absorbing (black) particles. When a chimney is added, the stoves produce more black particles but also have reduced emission factors. Laboratory tests give different results than in-field tests, because they fail to reproduce a significant fraction of low-efficiency events, spikes in particulate matter (PM) emissions, and less-absorbing particles. These conditions should be isolated and replicated in future laboratory testing protocols to ensure that stove designs are relevant to in-use operation. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Fast-pyrolysis based processes can be built on small-scale and have higher process carbon and energy efficiency as compared to other options. H2Bioil is a novel process based on biomass fast-hydropyrolysis and subsequent hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and can potentially provide high yields of high energy density liquid fuel at relatively low hydrogen consumption. This paper contains a comprehensive financial analysis of the H2Bioil process with hydrogen derived from different sources. Three different carbon tax scenarios are analyzed: no carbon tax, $55/metric ton carbon tax and $110/metric ton carbon tax. The break-even crude oil price for a delivered biomass cost of $94/metric ton when hydrogen is derived from coal, natural gas or nuclear energy ranges from $103 to $116/bbl for no carbon tax and even lower ($99-$111/bbl) for the carbon tax scenarios. This break-even crude oil price compares favorably with the literature estimated prices of fuels from alternate biochemical and thermochemical routes. The impact of the chosen carbon tax is found to be limited relative to the impact of the H2 source on the H2Bioil break-even price. The economic robustness of the processes for hydrogen derived from coal, natural gas, or nuclear energy is seen by an estimated break-even crude oil price of $114-$126/bbl when biomass cost is increased to $121/metric ton. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Present study deals with the optimization of biodiesel production using rapeseed oil as feedstock and NaOCH3 as a catalyst. Optimization of different reaction parameters, such as catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, reaction time. and alcohol to oil molar ratio, was done using response surface methodology (RSM). The optimal experimental conditions for biodiesel production were as follows: catalyst concentration (%) 0.30, reaction temperature 55°C, molar ratio 6.75, and reaction time 60 min. Under these optimal conditions, 97.5 percentage yield of biodiesel was obtained. The observed and predicted values of rapeseed oil methyl esters (ROMEs) yield showed a linear relationship. The fuel properties such as specific gravity 0.876 ± 0.01, flash point 168 ± 0.48°C, fire point 197.8 ± 0.31°C, pour point -7 ± 0.060°C, cloud point -2 ± 0.10°C kinematic viscosity 4.42 ± 0.26 mm2/sec, and sulfur content 0.002 mg/Kg of the produced biodiesel show the suitability of rapeseed oil biodiesel, as fuel. Moreover, engine performance test of the Rapeseed oil biodiesel (rapeseed oil methyl esters, ROME) was examined. The results showed that CO and particulate matter (PM) emissions of the ROME were lower than those of diesel fuel. NOX emissions of the ROME were lower for B5, B20, B40, and B50, while higher for B80 and B100. These results show the environment benefits of biodiesel. © 2012 The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer.

AB  - Biodiesel can be defined as fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) or fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) obtained from the transesterification of triacylglycerides (TAGs) from vegetable oils and animal fats; however, oleaginous microalgae are emerging as potential substitutes of these feedstocks for biodiesel production. The use of the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii P. A. Dang as a model system for lipid metabolism studies offers the advantage that extensive physiological and genomic data are available. The presence of naturally occurring FAMEs has been reported previously in plants and microalgae. In this study, oil extracts of C. reinhardtii batch cultures at the end of the growth phase were analyzed before and after the transesterification reaction to investigate the presence of naturally occurring FAMEs in this microalga. As a result, the presence of these compounds was observed in hexane oil extracts of C. reinhardtii before transesterification. Five FAMEs were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) before and after transesterification, while one additional FAME appeared only after transesterification. Additionally, three FAEEs were also identified before and after the transesterification reaction. Therefore, naturally occurring FAMEs and FAEEs are reported in C. reinhardtii. These results will pave the way for further studies on the biosynthesis of these compounds in green microalgae, and their potential use as biofuels. © Springer-Verlag and the University of Milan 2011.

AB  - Possible alternative raw materials for producing biodiesel fuel are as follows: Camelina sativa oil, fibre linseed oil and waste animal fat. The aim of this work was to analyse the emissions of the engine running on multi-component fuels containing fossil diesel fuel (D), linseed or Camelina sativa oil fatty acid methyl esters (LSME and CME respectively) and beef tallow (TME) fatty acid methyl esters. The concentration of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) in the mixtures with fossil diesel fuel varied from 10% to 30%. The mass proportion of LSME (or CME) and TME in the mixtures was 1:4. The lowest NOx concentration in exhaust gases was observed when the mixtures contained 10% of biofuel. For the mixtures containing CME and LSME, NOx concentrations reached 290 and 295 ppm respectively when the engine rotation speed was 1200 min-1 and 370 and 375 ppm respectively when rotation speed was 2000 min-1. CO concentration was the lowest when fuel contained 30% of the FAME mixture. HC concentration was slightly higher when the mixtures containing LSME were used relative to the mixtures containing CME. The amount of HC did not fluctuate considerably (195÷254 ppm) at rotation speeds between 1200 and 2000 min-1. Lower HC concentration was found in exhaust gas when the fuels containing 10% and 20% of biofuel were used. The lowest concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was found when the mixtures contained 30% of biofuel made of LSME or CME corresponding to 30 μg/m3 and 38 μg/m3 at a rotation speed of 1200 min-1 and 640 μg/m3 and 670 μg/m3 at a rotation speed of 2000 min-1 respectively. The greatest amount of smokiness at a high rotation speed of 2000 min1 was observed when the mixture contained 30% of multi-component biodiesel fuel. It was found that the fuel containing a mixture of 30% of LSME biofuel and 20% of CME biofuel had a small advantage. © 2012 Copyright Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika.

AB  - Biodiesel obtained from vegetable oils as an alternative fuel for diesel engine is becoming increasingly important. The biodiesel quality and yield are affected by the properties of the oil used. The properties of the oil vary from region to region depending on the nature of the soil in which oil crops are cultivated, agricultural practices, rainfall etc. In this study the raw oil from Jatropha Curcas seeds grown in the western Ghat section of South India was tested for its physiochemical properties to determine its suitability for biodiesel production. A bench scale, compact biodiesel processor was developed locally by the authors and biodiesel was produced from raw Jatropha Curcas oil using alkali based transesterification process. The physiochemical properties of the biodiesel produced meet the ASTM standards but the yield was comparatively low (80%v/v) because of the high free fatty acid content (13.7 mg KOH/g of oil) in the raw Jatropha Curcas oil. The brake thermal efficiency of the biodiesel produced as a fuel in a four stroke single cylinder diesel engine coupled with an electric generator (34.19%) at maximum load conditions shows the possibility of utilization of biodiesel produced as a fuel in the diesel engine.

AB  - The paper presents the findings of comparative investigations into the operation of Audi 80 1.9l 4 cylinder diesel engine, TDI, type 1Z, 66 kW powered by new FAME (fatty acid methyl esters) mixtures of spring (SCME) and winter (WCME) camelina-based biofuel and mineral diesel. The article assesses the principles of operating electronic control over the diesel engine (ECS) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and looks at a positive impact of the system on energetic (be,ηe) and ecological (CH, NOx, CO2, SM) parameters. The ECS of the average and maximal power of the engine improve in-cylinder air injection that has an impact on an increase in ηe by approximately 30% and reduces the emission of the harmful components from incomplete combustion. It is accepted that in case diesel fuel is replaced by FAME biofuels (RME - rapeseed methyl ester; SCME - spring camelina methyl ester; WCME - winter camelina methyl ester), ECS control parameters shall not be retrofitted or additionally optimized. The properties of camelina-based biofuel mixtures B30 (SCME) and B30 (WCME) and diesel fuel are similar to the properties of the standard mixtures of RME biofuel B30 (RME). If compared to diesel fuel, the use of camelina-based biofuel mixtures B30 (SCME) and B30 (WCME) enables lower emissions of harmful components from exhaust gases, which makes approximately 15% of CH and 20÷25% of SM. © 2012 Copyright Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika.

AB  - Oils available in mango, tangerine and African star seeds were extracted and characterized to determine their fuel worthiness for biofuel production. Furthermore, the fuel properties of the three oils were within the range observed for some common oil seeds like rapeseed, soybean and sunflower, which are widely sourced for the production of biodiesel on an industrial scale. The low iodine values of the oil extend their applications as non-drying oil for lubrication purposes, however, the fuel properties exhibited by the oils enlist them as potential oil seeds for the production of biofuel and further research on the improvement of their properties will make them suitable biofuel of high economic values. © 2012 Institute of Agrophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Aviation sector have been improved consistently. As of the parallel to this, there is an important rising in the air transportation. Pollutant emissions from aircraft emissions increase with the increasing of the air traffic. In this study, the nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and unburned hydrocarbon (HC) from turbofan and turbojet engines of different manufacturer companies are investigated for used passenger transportation and private intentions. In the study, the variations with fuel flow and power setting of engine emissions are determined using International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) data. Also, the effect of three different methyl butanoate blends including pure biodiesel fuel (100 % methyl butanoate), 20% methyl butanoate -80% Jet A fuel, and 50% methyl butanoate-50% Jet A fuel on the emissions of CF6-80C gas turbine turbofan engine has been investigated in the present study. It is determined that the NOx emission increases with the increasing of the fuel flow for investigated engines. Contrary to NOx emissions, it is also determined that the CO and HC emissions are much little levels at the high power settings comparison low power settings. It is determined that the incomplete combustion in low power settings reasons this case. It is found that the blend fuels and pure biofuel produce less CO, HC and NOx emissions than Jet A fuel.

AB  - Biofuels represent a possibility to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within the transport sector. In this context the sustainability of biofuels, especially so called 1 st generation biofuels led to controversial discussions in the past. Biofuels from waste and residues represent a well suited but quantitative limited alternative due to their sustainability. At an international level, different approaches for converting waste and residues into biofuels can be found. Developing countries in general use classic transesterification of waste fats to produce biodiesel. Technically advanced options such as pyrolysis, gasification, Fischer-Tropsch-Diesel, anaerobic fermentation and distillation, as well as biogas production coupled with biomethane upgrading, are mostly found in industrialized countries. Within this study, different waste to biofuel options are reviewed ranging from small scale to industrial scale and take into account used raw materials, technological application and (potential) GHG-reduction. Further the potential of several wastes and residues for gasification processes and synthesis of biofuels in Germany is described. Biofuel from waste offers promising funding incentives because of the "double counting" according to 2009/28/EC and the switch in mandatory blending from an amount based quota to a GHG-based blending quota in 2015. © 2012 Global NEST Printed in Greece All rights reserved.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis and upgrading is a promising thermochemical pathway that produces pyrolysis oil that can be upgraded via hydroprocessing into hydrocarbon-based transportation fuels (drop-in biofuels). The internal rate of return (IRR) of a fast pyrolysis and upgrading facility is a function of feedstock cost and projected revenues. We calculate the IRR of a fast pyrolysis and upgrading facility under six different policy scenarios: (1)a baseline scenario in which the facility receives no government support; (2)a scenario in which cap-and-trade (H.R. 2454) is enacted with both carbon price and offsets; (3)a scenario in which the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC) is modified to include drop-in biofuels; (4)a scenario in which the VEETC is replaced with a variable VEETC; (5)the revised Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2); and (6)the Cellulosic Biofuel Producer Tax Credit (CBPTC). Combinations of these policy scenarios are also analyzed. We find that the policies responsible for increasing the value of pyrolysis products increase facility IRR the most, whereas policies minimizing facility tax burden have an only marginal effect on IRR. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - This paper considers the use of a non-edible plant, Jatropha curcas (J. curcas), for the production of biofuel as a substitute for traditional fossil fuel. It is shown that the net energy balance and greenhouse gases (GHGs) balance are positive. The investment value in biofuel from J. curcas is also studied, and both its intrinsic and option values are calculated. A reference case is evaluated, namely, the cultivation of J. curcas as a substitute for conventional fuel in a specific less-developed country, Kenya, that lies in the tropical region where J. curcas grows. The investment is modeled as a perpetual investment call option. It is shown that the Net Present Value is positive for a vast range of discount factors and investment costs, while the option value depends crucially on the parameters of the model. A positive option value points out those cases in which it is optimal to defer the investment even if it entails a positive and possibly high Net Present Value. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The benefits of using a 350 °C heated single pass spray chamber following a segmented flow injection methodology were demonstrated for the analysis of petroleum products through inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The present work shows that a small sample volume (i.e., 5 μl or less) can be precisely injected into the system following a manual procedure. Two different sample introduction systems were employed: a Cyclonic spray chamber and a single pass spray chamber (a modified version of the Torch Integrated Sample Introduction System, TISIS) equipped with a heating brass hollow cylinder. First the effect of temperature on the peak shape and sensitivity has been studied for a set of nineteen different organic products (gasoline, superethanol, diesel and biodiesel diluted in xylene). The results have proved that the higher the chamber walls temperature, the higher the sensitivity. As a result limits of detection decreased below 7 μg l -1 for elements such as manganese, vanadium and silicon. Furthermore, memory effects were less severe as the temperature raised. Another benefit of increasing the TISIS chamber walls temperature is that matrix effects became less pronounced as compared to a Cyclonic chamber. Thus, at 350 °C non-spectral interferences are eliminated likely because the analyte transport efficiency to the plasma is close to 100% irrespective of the sample analyzed. This has two important consequences: (i) it is possible to obtain a calibration line by merely modifying the injected solution volume and (ii) a single xylene based solution can be used as a universal standard. The developed procedure was applied to the analysis of nineteen spiked petroleum derivatives with recoveries for manganese, silicon, vanadium and copper in the range 95-106%. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This study is an experimental determination of the energy return on investment (EROI) for algal biocrude production at a research facility at the University of Texas at Austin (UT). During the period of this assessment, algae were grown at several cultivation scales and processed using centrifugation for harvesting, electromechanical cell lysing, and a microporous hollow fiber membrane contactor for lipid separation. The separated algal lipids represent a biocrude product that could be refined into fuel and the post-extraction biomass could be converted to methane. To determine the EROI, a second-order analysis was conducted, which includes direct and indirect energy flows, but does not include energy expenses associated with capital investments. The EROI for the production process evaluated here was significantly less than 1, however, the majority of the energy consumption resulted from non-optimized growth conditions. While the experimental results do not represent an expected typical case EROI for algal fuels, the approach and end-to-end experimental determination of the different inputs and outputs provides a useful outline of the important parameters to consider in such an analysis. The Experimental Case results are the first known experimental energy balance for an integrated algal biocrude production facility, and as such, are expected to be helpful for setting research and development priorities. In addition to the Experimental Case (based on direct measurements), three analytical cases were considered in this work: (1) a Reduced (Inputs) Case, (2) a Highly Productive Case, and (3) a Literature Model. The Reduced (Inputs) Case and the Highly Productive Case speculate the energy use for a similar system in an improved, commercial-scale production setting. The Literature Model is populated with relevant data that have previously been reported in the literature. For the Experimental Case, Reduced Case, Highly Productive Case, and Literature Model, the estimated second-order EROI was 9.2 × 10 -4, 0.074, 0.22, and 0.35, respectively. These results were dominated by growth inputs (96%, 89%, 87%, and 61% of the total energy requirement, respectively). Furthermore, the EROI was adjusted using quality factors that were calculated according to the price of each input, yielding a quality-adjusted EROI that parallels a partial financial return on investment analysis. For the Experimental Case, the Reduced Case, and the Highly Productive Case, the quality-adjusted EROI was 9.2 × 10 -5, 0.013, and 0.36, respectively. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - While current approaches have limitations for efficient and cost-effective microalgal biofuel production, new processes, which are financially economic, environmentally sustainable, and ecologically stable, are needed. Typically, microalgae cells are small and grow individually. Harvest of these cells is technically difficult and it contributes to 20-30% of the total cost of biomass production. A new process of pelletized cell cultivation is described in this study to co-culture a filamentous fungal species with microalgae so that microalgae cells can be co-pelletized into fungal pellets for easier harvest. This new process can be applied to microalgae cultures in both autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions to allow microalgae cells attach to each other. The cell pellets, due to their large size, can be harvested through sieve, much easier than individual cells. This method has the potential to significantly decrease the processing cost for generating microagal biofuel or other products. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study provides a novel methodology for biodiesel (FAME) production under ambient pressure, which resolves most drawbacks of current commercialized biodiesel conversion via the transesterification reaction. This has been achieved by means of a thermo-chemical process and a true continuous flow system. This also enables combination of esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) and transesterification of triglycerides into a single process without utilizing a catalyst, and leads to a 98-99 ± 0.5 % conversion efficiency of FAME within 1. min in the temperature range of 350-500 °C. High FFA content in oil feedstock is not a matter of the new process, which enables the use of a broader variety of feedstocks, including all edible and inedible fats. Another feature of this novel method is that it does not produce wastewater. Thus, the new process has potential to spur a breakthrough in the lowest cost of biodiesel production. Moreover, this method also requires utilization of carbon dioxide during biodiesel production, an additional environmental benefit. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An approach based on energy gain was utilized to optimize algal cultivation in bubble columns. Net energy gain was estimated considering the energy input for mixing and providing carbon dioxide, and the energy that can be generated from the lipids extracted from the algal biomass. Energy input for sparging was minimized based on the gas-to-culture volume ratio and energy output from lipid production was maximized based on nitrate and CO 2 levels. Sparging at a gas-to-culture volume ratio of 0.18min -1 with CO 2-enrichment of 0.5% and initial nitrate concentration of 1mM was optimal for improving net energy gain with Nannochloropsis salina. Sparging with CO 2-enriched air of 0.5% along with nitrogen starvation resulted in 50% more lipid productivity than sparging with ambient air. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigated nitrogen and phosphorus assimilation and lipid production of microalgae in industrial wastewater. Two native strains of freshwater microalgae were evaluated their biomass growth and lipid production in modified BBM medium. Chlamydomonas sp. TAI-2 had better biomass growth and higher lipid production than Desmodesmus sp.TAI-1. The optimal growth and lipid accumulation of Chlamydomonas sp. TAI-2 were tested under different nitrogen sources, nitrogen and CO 2 concentrations and illumination period in modified BBM medium. The optimal CO 2 aeration was 5% for Chlamydomonas sp. TAI-2 to achieve maximal lipid accumulation under continuous illumination. Using industrial wastewater as the medium, Chlamydomonas sp. TAI-2 could remove 100% NH 4 +-N (38.4mg/L) and NO 3 --N (3.1mg/L) and 33% PO 4 3--P (44.7mg/L) and accumulate the lipid up to 18.4%. Over 90% of total fatty acids were 14:0, 16:0, 16:1, 18:1, and 18:3 fatty acids, which could be utilized for biodiesel production. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, alkaline earth metal oxides (i.e., MgO, CaO, and SrO) were used as catalysts for the transesterification of olive oil with methanol. The most efficient catalyst was further doped with either CaO or SiO 2 to improve its catalytic activity, which was evaluated by conducting transesterification at different reaction temperatures, different water content, and using different types of oils. Finally, repeated tests were conducted to evaluate the reusability of the doped catalyst. The results show that the conversion of refined olive oil to biodiesel was more than 80% in 15min when SrO was applied, while using SrO doped SiO 2 (SrO/SiO 2) further increased the conversion to 95% in 10min. SrO/SiO 2 also featured good water and free fatty acids (FFAs) tolerance, as the conversion was still higher than 90% (in 20min) when the water and FFAs contents were increased to 3.23 and 3.14wt.%, respectively. Addition of hexane significantly improved the reusability of SrO/SiO 2 for transesterification, as the biodiesel production still reached nearly 80% after the catalyst was repeatedly used for four times. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Uncertainty information is essential for the proper use of life cycle assessment and environmental assessments in decision making. To investigate the uncertainties of biodiesel and determine the level of confidence in the assertion that biodiesel is more environmentally friendly than diesel, an explicit analytical approach based on the Taylor series expansion for lognormal distribution was applied in the present study. A biodiesel case study demonstrates the probability that biodiesel has a lower global warming and non-renewable energy score than diesel, that is 92.3% and 93.1%, respectively. The results indicate the level of confidence in the assertion that biodiesel is more environmentally friendly than diesel based on the global warming and non-renewable energy scores. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Engineering strategies were applied to improve the CO 2 fixation rate and carbohydrate/lipid production of a Scenedesmus obliquus CNW-N isolate. The light intensity that promotes cell growth, carbohydrate/lipid productivity, and CO 2 fixation efficiency was identified. Nitrogen starvation was also employed to trigger the accumulation of lipid and carbohydrate. The highest productivity of biomass, lipid, and carbohydrate was 840.57mgL -1d -1, 140.35mgL -1d -1. The highest lipid and carbohydrate content was 22.4% (5-day N-starvation) and 46.65% (1-day N-starvation), respectively. The optimal CO 2 consumption rate was 1420.6mgL -1d -1. This performance is better than that reported in most other studies. Under nitrogen starvation, the microalgal lipid was mainly composed of C16/C18 fatty acid (around 90%), which is suitable for biodiesel synthesis. The carbohydrate present in the biomass was mainly glucose, accounting for 77-80% of total carbohydrates. This carbohydrate composition is also suitable for fermentative biofuels production (e.g., bioethanol and biobutanol). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A continuous biodiesel production from the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol was investigated in a fixed bed reactor packed with D261 anion-exchange resin as a heterogeneous catalyst. The conversion to biodiesel achieved 95.2% within a residence time 56. min under the conditions: reaction temperature of 323.15. K, n-hexane/soybean oil weight rate of 0.5, methanol/soybean oil molar ratio of 9:1 and feed flow rate of 1.2. ml/min. The resin can be regenerated in-situ and restored to the original activity to achieve continuous production after the resin deactivation. The product obtained was mainly composed of methyl esters. No glycerol in the product was detected due to the resin adsorbing glycerol in the fixed bed, which solved the issue of glycerol separation from biodiesel. It is believed that the fixed bed reactor with D261 has a potential commercial application in the transesterification of triglyceride. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The microbial production of free fatty acids (FFAs) and reduced derivatives is an attractive process for the renewable production of diesel fuels. Toward this goal, a plasmid-free strain of Escherichia coli was engineered to produce FFAs by integrating three copies of a thioesterase gene from Umbellularia californica (BTE) under the control of an inducible promoter onto the chromosome. In batch culture, the resulting strain produced identical titers to a previously reported strain that expressed the thioesterase from a plasmid. The growth rate, glucose consumption rate, and FFA production rate of this strain were studied in continuous cultivation under carbon limitation. The highest yield of FFA on glucose was observed at a dilution rate of 0.05h -1 with the highest specific productivity observed at a dilution rate of 0.2h -1. The observed yields under the lowest dilution rate were 15% higher than that observed in batch cultures. An increase in both productivity and yield (∼40%) was observed when the composition of the nutrients was altered to shift the culture toward non-carbon limitation. A deterministic model of the production strain has been proposed and indicates that maintenance requirements for this strain are significantly higher than wild-type E. coli. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - As the world's oil reserves are limited, and as a partial mitigation of greenhouse gas emission, renewable biofuels are being considered as important contributors to the future fuel supply for the transportation sector. The combustion of biofuel-diesel mixtures in practical engines has been shown to be not only feasible but also favorable due to low particulate emission characteristics. This paper demonstrates quantifiable sooting propensity of biofuel-diesel fuel blends using classical smoke point observations and laser induced-incandescence and laser extinction optical methods. In particular, we study mixtures of 0-25% by volume of soybean biofuel in ultra-low sulfur diesel. Following the ASTM D1322 standard, we find that the maximum flame height at the smoke point condition increases linearly with increasing biofuel fraction. An alternative sooting propensity measurement is needed, however, because high biofuel/diesel blends do not produce a smoke point in the standard wick-fed lamp procedure. Using a fixed flame height, laser-based measurements are generally consistent with smoke point trends, and laser extinction calibrations provide quantitative soot volume fractions. The results show the greatest soot concentration for pure diesel fuel, B0, and the least for a 20% blend by volume of biofuel, B20. © 2012 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - Wood ash is a highly alkaline material comprises of inorganic constituents. A limited information on use of wood ash as catalyst is available in literature. The present study was undertaken to investigate the catalytic activity of wood ash for transesterification of Jatropha oil. The thermal treatment (calcination) of wood ash was carried out at temperature in the range of 500-1200 °C to produce calcined wood ash catalysts (CWC). The wood ash was also chemically activated with K 2CO 3 and CaCO 3 by double carbonate solid state reaction to yield activated wood ash catalysts (AWC). The prepared catalysts were characterized by analytical techniques for surface morphology, crystalline phases, textural characteristics and alkalinity. Methyl ester conversion of Jatropha oil was achieved in the range of 97-99% with CWC and AWC catalysts. The synthesized Jatropha methyl esters using CWC and AWC catalysts have been found meeting the critical physico-chemical properties of ASTM D-6751 standards of biodiesel. The present study revealed the possibility of producing potential heterogeneous catalyst from wood ash for biodiesel synthesis, which can find a way to utilize abundant wood ash and reduce the overall cost of biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study was conducted to standardize the esterification process parameters for the production of methyl ester of raw hemp oil. The effect of process parameters such as molar ratio, catalyst concentration, and reaction time was studied to standardize the esterification process and for estimating the highest recovery of ester with lowest possible viscosity. Based on the observations from the ester recovery and kinematic viscosity, it can be seen that raw hemp oil at 6:1 M ratio may be reacted with methanol at 60 °C reaction temperature for 45 min in the presence of 2 g of KOH and then allowed to settle for 24 h in order to get lowest kinematic viscosity with ester recovery of 90.62%. The yield of hemp methyl ester was found to be 90.62% with oil methanol ratio of 0.37 w/w and 0.01 w/w alkali catalyst. Different fuel properties such as density, kinematic viscosity, flash point, fire point, cloud point, pour point, free fatty acid content and calorific value of the hemp methyl ester and hemp oil were measured. From the properties and engine test results it has been established that methyl ester of hemp oil can be substituted for diesel oil. Methyl ester of above non-edible oil has several advantages among other new renewable and engine fuel alternatives along with its environmental benefits. © 2012.

AB  - One of the issues related to the increased use of biofuel (ethanol and biodiesel) in the transport sector concerns their higher production costs, either in pure or blended form, as compared to conventional fuels (gasoline and diesel). Based on the average cost of biodiesel, the former is not able to compete with diesel if no subsidies are provided by the government to boost its cost competitiveness. However, such a cost comparison is not a true reflection of the various potential benefits of biofuels. This study aims to evaluate the influence of externalities on the cost performance of various palm oil biodiesel blends (B5, B10 and B100) when internalized into their respective production cost for the case of Thailand. A case study of palm oil biodiesel has been assessed and compared to conventional diesel. An income elasticity of willingness to pay (WTP) was used as multiplier factor to transfer the values of selected environmental damage costs obtained from the Environmental Priority Strategies (EPS) methodology into Thai context. The three key environmental burdens considered in this work include land use, fossil energy resources depletion and air pollutants emissions i.e. CO 2, CH 4, N 2O, CO, NO x, SO 2, VOC and PM10. The results obtained indicate that environmental costs contribute to 34% of the total costs of conventional diesel. In comparison to diesel and for the same performance, the total environmental cost of biodiesel based palm methyl ester (PME) is about 3-76% lower depending on the blending levels. This is mainly due to two major advantages that biofuels present which are a reduction in the depletion of fossil energy resources and mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions. In terms of net social benefits, the promotion of biodiesel to replace diesel is economically feasible contributing a gain in welfare of about 0.01 and 0.76 THB L -1 diesel equivalent for B5 and B10 respectively. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Crude canola oil (CCO) contains about 100-300. ppm of phospholipids, which have shown negative effects on biodiesel/buffer solution phase separation, resulting in low biodiesel production yield. Therefore, phospholipids should be removed before transesterification by a degumming process for efficient production of biodiesel. In this study, two-step enzymatic processes (degumming and transesterification) were carried out for the production of biodiesel from CCO. Degumming of CCO was performed using phospholipase A2 as a degumming reagent. The initial phospholipid content was reduced to less than 5. ppm by enzymatic degumming. The effects of three formulations of enzyme catalyst on the efficiency of transesterification were investigated. As a result, conversion rates of degummed CCO to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were 68.56%, 70.15%, and 84.25%, respectively. Lipase formulation composed of a 1:1 (vol:vol) enzyme mixture of Rhizopus oryzae and Candida rugosa showed the best performance among those tested. In order to recover and reuse the lipase catalyst efficiently, a 1:1 enzyme mixture of R. oryzae and C. rugosa was immobilized on silica gel. The immobilized lipase was used in subsequent transesterification optimization experiments. Optimization of transesterification was performed by response surface methodology (RSM). A total of 20 experiments based on RSM were carried out, and the optimal reaction conditions appeared to be 24.4% (w/w) immobilized catalyst, 13.5% (w/w) buffer solution, and 15.8% (w/w) methanol based on oil mass. Conversion rate of degummed CCO to FAME was determined to be 88.9% under optimal conditions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The spray characteristics of a blended fuel containing conventional diesel fuel and unrefined biodiesel fuel were investigated. Experiments were performed to analyze the effects that blending ratio and injection pressure have on the spray behavior. The process of spray injection was analyzed through a laser diffraction particle analyzer (LDPA). In addition, spray atomization characteristics were studied using the Sauter mean diameter (SMD) as well as the droplet concentrations under various injection conditions. Fuel containing unrefined biodiesel fuel exhibited different spray patterns in comparison to conventional diesel fuel due to the fuel's high viscosity and large surface tension. The results indicate that the increase of injection pressure causes the SMD to become smaller. In contrast, an increase in the mixing ratio causes the SMD to become larger. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - RATIONALE The certification of sulfur (S) in Standard Reference Materials™ by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been exclusively performed using isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS). The ID-TIMS measurement method is limited in its capability for low concentration measurements (&lt;1 μg/g) due to the blank associated with the chemical reduction procedure (≈0.2 S μg). Newly developed materials and applications, such as biofuels made from soy and nanomedicine, pose a challenge to the ID-TIMS technique because of their very low concentrations (&lt;&lt;1 μg/g) of S. As described here, a measurement technique with low S blanks is essential for low-level S measurements. METHODS An isotope dilution (ID) multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) method combined with an internal normalization approach for mass bias correction has been used to determine low-level S concentrations in synthetically prepared mixtures using a 33S-enriched spike material. Dilute sulfur solutions (1 μg S/g) were prepared from NIST SRM 3154 (Sulfate Spectrometric Solution) to test the capability of this technique for measuring very low-level S concentrations. RESULTS The concentration results for each solution were 0.983 ± 0.004 μg/g (95% CI, n = 2, k = 2), 1.006 ± 0.005 μg/g (95% CI, n = 2, k = 2), and 0.999 ± 0.003 μg/g (95% CI, n = 2, k = 2), in excellent agreement with the gravimetric determination, deviating less than 0.35% and suggesting the technique can yield unbiased and accurate results. The blanks averaged 13 ± 0.0017 ng S (1s). CONCLUSIONS The data results provide a clear indication that the ID-MC-ICP-MS method for the determination of low-level S concentrations is feasible. The more than one order of magnitude reduction of the blanks suggests that it is a better alternative to the ID-TIMS method for very low S materials such as are encountered in biofuels and some biochemical species.

AB  - This paper describes a comparative analysis of public transport alternatives in the city of Kaunas, Lithuania. An LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) inventory analysis of fuel chains was undertaken using the midi urban bus and a similar type of trolleybus. The inventory analysis of fuel chains followed the guidelines provided by the ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards. The ReCiPe Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methodology was used to quantify weighted damage originating from five alternative fuel chains. The compressed biogas fuel chain had the lowest weighted damage value, namely 45.7 mPt/km, whereas weighted damage values of the fuel chains based on electricity generation for trolleybuses were 60.6 mPt/km (for natural gas) and 78.9 mPt/km (for heavy fuel oil). The diesel and compressed natural gas fuel chains exhibited considerably higher damage values of 114.2 mPt/km and 132.6 mPt/km, respectively. The comparative life cycle assessment of fuel chains suggested that biogas-powered buses and electric trolleybuses can be considered as the best alternatives to use when modernizing the public transport fleet in Kaunas. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Levulinic acid is considered as a versatile building block because it can be used for the synthesis of several organic chemicals. In particular, its esterification with ethanol produces ethyl levulinate that can be used as diesel miscible biofuel (DMB), preventing global warming by decreasing atmospheric CO 2 generated from the consumption of fossil fuels. This article explores the use of two groups of solid acid catalysts (sulfated oxides and zeolites with different pore structures) in the esterification of levulinc acid with ethanol aiming for ethyl levulinate production. It was found that while there is a correlation between the number of acidic sites and activity for the sulfated oxides, the same is not true for the studied zeolites where the pore channels play a more important role. Among the catalysts tested, Amberlyst-15 and sulfated SnO 2 showed a remarkable high yield of ethyl levulinate that was probably due to the strong acidity provided by SO 3H functional groups and SO 4 species, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, the methanolysis process of sunflower oil was investigated to get high methyl esters (biodiesel) content using sodium methoxide. To reach to the best process conditions, central composite design (CCD) through response surface methodology (RSM) was employed. The optimal conditions predicted were the reaction time of 60min, an excess stoichiometric amount of alcohol to oil ratio of 25%w/w and the catalyst content of 0.5%w/w, which lead to the highest methyl ester content (100%w/w). The methyl ester content of the mixture from gas chromatography analysis (GC) was compared to that of optimum point. Results, confirmed that there was no significant difference between the fatty acid methyl ester content of sunflower oil produced under the optimized condition and the experimental value (P 0.05). Furthermore, some fuel specifications of the resultant biodiesel were tested according to American standards for testing of materials (ASTM) methods. The outcome showed that the methyl ester mixture produced from the optimized condition met nearly most of the important biodiesel specifications recommended in ASTM D 6751 requirements. Thus, the sunflower oil methyl esters resulted from this study could be a suitable alternative for petrol diesels. Copyright 2012 Sara KoohiKamali et al.

AB  - Background: The desulphurization of dibenzothiophene (DBT), a recalcitrant thiophenic fossil fuel component by Serratia marcescens (UCP 1549) in order for reducing the Sulphur content was investigated. The Study was carried out establishing the growth profile using Luria Bertani medium to different concentrations of DBT during 120 hours at 28°C, and orbital Shaker at 150 rpm. Results: The results indicated that concentrations of DBT 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mM do not affected the growth of the bacterium. The DBT showed similar Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MCB) (3.68 mM). The desulphurization of DBT by S. marcescens was used with 96 hours of growth on 2 mM of DBT, and was determined by gas chromatography (GC) and GC-mass spectrometry. In order to study the desulphurization process by S. marcescens was observed the presence of a sulfur-free product at 16 hours of cultivation. Conclusions: The data suggests the use of metabolic pathway 4S by S. marcescens (UCP 1549) and formed biphenyl. The microbial desulphurization process by Serratia can be suggest significant reducing sulphur content in DBT, and showed promising potential for reduction of the sulfur content in diesel oil. © 2012 AraÃjo et al.; licensee Biomed Central Ltd.

AB  - Polyols, a typical type of alcohol containing multiple hydroxyl groups, are being regarded as a new generation of a green energy platform. In this paper, the decomposition mechanisms for three polyol molecules, i.e., 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, and glycerol, have been investigated by quantum chemistry calculations. The potential energy surfaces of propanediols and glycerol have been built by the QCISD(T) and CBS-QB3 methods, respectively. For the three molecules studied, the H 2O-elimination and C-C bond dissociation reactions show great importance among all of the unimolecular decomposition channels. Rate constant calculations further demonstrate that the H 2O-elimination reactions are predominant at low temperature and pressure, whereas the direct C-C bond dissociation reactions prevail at high temperature and pressure. The temperature and pressure dependence of calculated rate constants was demonstrated by the fitted Arrhenius equations. This work aims to better understand the thermal decomposition process of polyols and provide useful thermochemical and kinetic data for kinetic modeling of polyols-derived fuel combustion. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The inclusion of cellulosic ethanol in the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 and the revised Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) has spurred development of the first commercial scale cellulosic ethanol biorefineries. These efforts have also revived interest in the development of dedicated energy crops selected for biomass productivity and for properties that facilitate conversion of biomass to liquid fuels. While many aspects of developing these feedstocks are compatible with current agricultural activities, improving biomass productivity may provide opportunities to expand the potential for biofuel production beyond the classical research objectives associated with improving traditional food and feed crops. © 2012 Faculty of 1000 Ltd.

AB  - The production and characterization of biofuels obtained by the thermal cracking of waste fish oil (OPR) obtained at 525°C. The OPR utilized had the principal chemical composition of fatty acids, including C16:0 (15.87%), C18:2 (20.96%), C18:1 (17.29%), C20:5 (5.11%), C20:1 (7.59%), C22:6 (4.53%), and C22:1 (10.42%). The thermal cracking process led to gas and liquid fractions, which was denominated as crude bio-oil (BOB). The gas fraction average composition showed the presence of H2 (4.73%), N2 (5.57%), O2 (1.94%), CO (12.94%), CH4 (15.30%), CO2 (10.42%), C2H4 (22.94%) and C2H6 (8.64%). BOB was submitted to a simple distillation process to obtain light and heavy bio-oil. The characteristics determined for both products were compared to the characteristics and regulamentary legislation in force in Brazil, as applied to fossil fuels. The possibility of obtaining products from a residue and renewable source of energy with the characteristics of biofuels is demonstrated.

AB  - This work shows the study of the production and characterization of biofuels obtained by the thermal cracking of waste fish oil(OPR). The waste material was submitted to the process of thermal cracking in a pilot plant unit at 525 °C. The OPR utilized in this study had the principal chemical composition of fatty acids: C16:0 (15.87%), C18:2 (20.96%), C18:1 (17.29%), C20:5 (5.11%), C20:1 (7.59%), C22:6 (4.53%) and C22:1 (10.42%) among others. The thermal cracking process led to gas and liquid fractions, the latter denominated as crude bio-oil (BOB). The gas fraction was analyzed and its average composition shows the presence of H2 (4.73%), N2 (5.57%), O2 (1.94%), CO (12.94%), CH4 (15.30%), CO2 (10.42%), C2H4 (22.94%) and C2H6 (8.64%). The liquid fraction of crude bio-oil provided a yield of 73% (m/m). The BOB was submitted to a simple distillation process to obtain two new fractions of products: light bio-oil and heavy bio-oil. These fractions were obtained with yields of 31% and 54% from the BOB, and yields of 23% and 39% from the OPR, respectively. The light bio-oil and heavy bio-oil fractions were evaluated by physical-chemical tests and by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID), gas chromatography with electron capture detector (GC-ECD), gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC/MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 1H and13 C. The characteristics determined for both products were compared to the characteristics and regulamentary legislation in force in the country, as applied to fossil fuels. This work shows the possibility of obtaining products from a residue and renewable source of energy with the characteristics of biofuels. Identification of the constituents of biofuels and their physical-chemical properties described in this work may be applied in the establishment of criteria to regulate this class of fuel. © 2012, Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.

AB  - Use of additives to improve the efficiency of thermal heavy oil and bitumen recovery processes has been studied extensively over the decades. Two common types of additives used in thermal applications, mainly steam assisted recovery, are solvents and surfactants. Commercial use of solvents has setbacks due to their high costs and retrieval difficulties. Cost and stability of the surfactants under reservoir operating temperature and pressure are the major concerns. We propose the use of bio Diesel such as fatty acids methyl ester as a surfactant additive reducing heavy oil/bitumen-water interfacial tension in steam assisted recovery processes. Advantages of using bioDiesel as a surfactant additive are that bio Diesel is chemically stable under the operating pressure and temperature of the reservoir, it causes no harm on bitumen fuel quality and on release water chemistry and its use is economically feasible. We conducted a series of steam assisted bitumen recovery experiments to clarify the additional recovery potential and efficiency improvement capacity of bio Diesel. High pressure steam at 1.8 MPa pressure, 205°C was used in these tests at a 900 g/h feed rate. The porous media used was a normal grade oil sands ore obtained from a surface mine operation in Northern Alberta, Canada. Oil sands ore was packed in a basket and placed in a high pressure cell. Bitumen recovery experiments were performed by spraying canola oil fatty acid methyl ester on oil sands ore at a 2 g/kg-bitumen dosage. These tests show that bitumen recovery efficiency increases over 40%. In another series of tests, tall oil fatty acids methyl ester was injected into a high pressure steam line at a 8.3 g-bioDiesel/kg-steam dosage. Because of the solubility of bioDiesel in bitumen, the effect of bioDiesel on bitumen recovery could not be accurately concluded. Vapor pressure measurements performed on canola oil and tall oil derived bioDiesel samples suggest that saturation compositions of bioDiesel in steam at 1.8 MPa pressure and 205°C are at least one order of magnitude higher than the requested bioDiesel dosages. Further tests are planned by reducing bioDiesel dosages to about 0.5 to 1.0 g-bioDiesel/kilogram-steam and by monitoring the solubility of bioDiesel in bitumen. © 2012, IFP Energies nouvelles.

AB  - In this study, particulate matter (PM) were characterized from a place impacted by heavy-duty vehicles (Bus Station) fuelled with diesel/biodiesel fuel blend (B3) in the city of Londrina, Brazil. Sixteen priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) concentrations were analyzed in the samples by their association with atmospheric PM, mass size distributions and major ions (fluorite, chloride, bromide, nitrate, phosphate, sulfate, nitrite, oxalate; fumarate, formate, succinate and acetate; lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and ammonium). Results indicate that major ions represented 21.2% particulate matter mass. Nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium, respectively, presented the highest concentration levels, indicating that biodiesel may also be a significant source for these ions, especially nitrate. Dibenzo[a,h]anthracene and indeno[1,2,3,-cd]pyrene were the main PAH found, and a higher fraction of PAH particles was found in diameters lower than 0.25 μm in Londrina bus station. The fine and ultrafine particles were dominant among the PM evaluated, suggesting that biodiesel decreases the total PAH emission. However, it does also increase the fraction of fine and ultrafine particles when compared to diesel. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.

AB  - In 2006, Argentina has sanctioned a national law to regulate biofuel production and consumption. Since 2007, soybean actors started producing biodiesel for international market-especially to Europe- and the country quickly became the major biodiesel exporter. In 2010, around twenty processing units started supplying the domestic market. Diesel sold in Argentina contained 5% of biodiesel. The obligation to add 5% of biodiesel to diesel has passed to 7% and the goal is to increase this percentage. The State support and soybean biodiesel competitiveness have been important for biodiesel chain development but some doubts could appear about the kind of actors that could have the benefits.

AB  - In this paper, a novel biodiesel, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether cottonseed oil monoester (EGMECOM), which was synthesized through transesterification reaction of the refined cottonseed oil with ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, was developed. Its chemical structure was characterized through FT-IR, 1H NMR, and GPC analyses. Its main physical and chemical properties were tested. Also, with a two-cylinder DI diesel engine, its combustion performances and emissions characteristics were investigated. The results indicated that EGMECOM has a comparative high cetane number and a high oxygen content, which are the prime factors that determine its NO x and smoke emissions, respectively. As a result, the trade-off relationship between the NO x and smoke emissions is broken for EGMECOM fuel, which both reduce with the increase of EGMECOM fraction in the EGMECOM - diesel blends. As well, the high oxygen content shows positive effects on the reduction of both the CO and HC emissions. Compared to diesel fuel, a maximal reduction of the smoke, NO x, CO, and HC by 50.0%, 50.0%, 20%, and 55.6%, respectively, can be reached when EGMECOM is used. Besides, for EGMECOM, the combustion timing of engine is advanced, ignition delay is shortened, and the combustion is improved. Copyright © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC 2012.

AB  - Together with 106 farmers who started growing Jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) in 2004-2006, this research sought to increase the knowledge around the real-life experience of Jatropha farming in the southern India states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Launched as an alternative for diesel in India, Jatropha has been promoted as a non-edible plant that could grow on poor soils, yield oil-rich seeds for production of bio-diesel, and not compete directly with food production. Through interviews with the farmers, information was gathered regarding their socio-economic situation, the implementation and performance of their Jatropha plantations, and their reasons for continuing or discontinuing Jatropha cultivation. Results reveal that 82% of the farmers had substituted former cropland for their Jatropha cultivation. By 2010, 85% (n = 90) of the farmers who cultivated Jatropha in 2004 had stopped. Cultivating the crop did not give the economic returns the farmers anticipated, mainly due to a lack of information about the crop and its maintenance during cultivation and due to water scarcity. A majority of the farmers irrigated and applied fertilizer, and even pesticides. Many problems experienced by the farmers were due to limited knowledge about cultivating Jatropha caused by poor planning and implementation of the national Jatropha program. Extension services, subsidies, and other support were not provided as promised. The farmers who continued cultivation had means of income other than Jatropha and held hopes of a future Jatropha market. The lack of market structures, such as purchase agreements and buyers, as well as a low retail price for the seeds, were frequently stated as barriers to Jatropha cultivation. For Jatropha biodiesel to perform well, efforts are needed to improve yield levels and stability through genetic improvements and drought tolerance, as well as agriculture extension services to support adoption of the crop. Government programs will probably be more effective if implementing biodiesel production is conjoined with stimulating the demand for Jatropha biodiesel. To avoid food-biofuel competition, additional measures may be needed such as land-use restrictions for Jatropha producers and taxes on biofuels or biofuel feedstocks to improve the competitiveness of the food sector compared to the bioenergy sector. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In this study, clean combustion of straight vegetable oil (VO) is achieved by utilizing a novel flow blurring (FB) fuel injector with superior atomization characteristics. Experiments are conducted in an atmospheric pressure combustor using three different fuels: straight VO, which is fully-refined soybean oil, biodiesel produced from soybean VO, and No. 2 diesel. Combustion performance is assessed by comparing flame images, emissions profiles at the combustor exit plane, and pressure drop in fuel and atomizing air lines. Results show that the FB atomizer can create clean burning spray flames of straight VO without preprocessing and/or preheating. The FB injector produces sprays with smaller diameter fuel droplets to promote combustion in the premixed mode. All fuels resulted in similar CO emissions, while biodiesel flames had the lowest NOX emissions. Pressure drop in the fuel and atomizing air lines was independent of the fuel. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - It is often difficult to compare publications assessing the sustainability of algal biomass as a feedstock for biofuels, due to differences in data aggregation, life cycle boundaries, technical and life cycle assumptions, environmental metrics considered, and use of experimental, modeled or assumed data. Input data for the algae cultivation stage was collected from published studies, focusing on microalgae production in open-air raceway ponds. Input data was normalized to a consistent functional unit, 1. kg of dry algal biomass. Environmental impacts were applied consistently to the different study inputs in order to eliminate this source of variation between the studies. Greenhouse gas emissions, fossil energy demand, and consumptive freshwater use were tabulated for the algal feedstock growth stage for open pond systems, and results were categorized (energy use, macronutrient fertilizers, and everything else) to compare the different studies in general terms. Environmental impacts for the cultivation of algal biomass in the considered reports varied by over two orders of magnitude. To illustrate impacts of variability in the cultivation stage on the ultimate environmental footprint of microalgae biofuels, algal oil harvesting, extraction and conversion to Green Jet Fuel was examined using the Renewable Jet Fuel process developed by Honeywell's UOP. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microalgae are currently receiving strong consideration as an advanced biofuel feedstock because of their theoretically high yield (gal/acre/year) in comparison to terrestrial vegetable oil feedstocks. Microalgal lipids can be readily converted into a variety of biofuels including fatty acid methyl esters (i.e. biodiesel) via transesterification or alkanes via hydroprocessing. In contrast to paraffinic fuels whose properties can be tailored for a specific application, the properties of algal methyl ester biodiesel are directly related to the fatty acid composition of the algal lipids. Several microalgae species that are suitable for large scale cultivation such as those in the genus . Nannochloropsis produce lipids that contain long chain-polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These constituents have high value as co-products but are problematic in terms of biodiesel properties such as ignition quality and oxidative stability. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of varying levels of EPA and DHA on algal methyl ester fuel properties. Oxidative stability, Cetane Number, density, viscosity, bulk modulus, cloud point and cold filter plugging point were measured for algal methyl esters produced from various microalgae feedstocks as well as model algal methyl ester compounds formulated to match the fatty acid composition of . Nannochloropsis sp., . Nannochloropsis oculata and . Isochrysis galbana subjected to varying levels of removal of EPA and DHA. The results suggest that removal of 50 to 80% of the LC-PUFA from . Nannochloropsis-based methyl esters would be sufficient for meeting existing specifications for oxidative stability. However, higher levels of LC-PUFA removal from . Nannochloropsis-based methyl esters would be required to produce fuels with acceptable Cetane Number. The removal of EPA and DHA was shown to have a detrimental effect on cold flow properties since the algal methyl esters are also high in fully saturated fatty acid content. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The emission, concentration levels, and transboundary transport of particulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Northeast Asia were investigated using particulate PAH measurements, the newly developed emission inventory (Regional Emission inventory in ASia for Persistent Organic Pollutants version, REAS-POP), and the chemical transport model (Regional Air Quality Model ver2 for POPs version, RAQM2-POP). The simulated concentrations of the nine particulate PAHs agreed well with the measured concentrations, and the results firmly established the efficacy of REAS/RAQM2-POP. It was found that the PAH concentrations in Beijing (China, source region), which were emitted predominantly from domestic coal, domestic biofuel, and other transformations of coal (including coke production), were approximately 2 orders of magnitude greater than those monitored at Noto (Japan, leeward region). In Noto, the PAH concentrations showed seasonal variations; the PAH concentrations were high from winter to spring due to contributions from domestic coal, domestic biofuel, and other transformations of coal, and low in summer. In summer, these contribution were decrease, instead, other sources, such as the on-road mobile source, were relatively increased compared with those in winter. These seasonal variations were due to seasonal variations in emissions from China, as well as transboundary transport across the Asian continent associated with meteorological conditions. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - While LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) is considered to yield either generic or regionally/technologically specific data on products, this method's implementation can reveal a certain variability due to the nature of the local industrial process as well as to heterogeneous site characteristics in the case of natural aggregate production. Energy consumption and the release of atmospheric emissions from aggregate production processes have been investigated in this study at three quarry sites, which encompass two types of rock (and include explosives). This paper describes the methodology adopted for the specific local production investigation and offers results for the three quarry sites using seven indicators derived from the LCA framework. Site characteristics and differences have been assessed in terms of plant equipment and off-road vehicles, and a detailed description is provided of the grading conducted onsite. It is found that fine grading consumes more energy for production, given the fact this type of grading is recycled inside the plant. This assessment has been performed for 1 ton of aggregate produced during 1 year and with distinction in grading category. Results indicate that the discrepancy in local energy consumption due to site differences lies within an interval between -9.5% and +13.7%, while the interval for impacts is situated at -24.5% to +27.5% whereas for global warming potential the range is from -15.4% to +12.9% as a maximum. Explosives are assumed to contribute less than 1% to the total impacts. Both the electrical energy and fossil fuel consumption ratios are displayed. The upstream processes specific to electricity production significantly contribute to human toxicity potential and ecotoxic potential indicators, as for other indicators and also diesel production (all indicators) the contribution is in proportion close to site results ones. However, this study indicates that an environmental load decrease may be investigated with respect to quarry processes as well as equipment age and use. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Jatropha curcas seed oil is a promising feedstock for biodiesel production. The seeds contain major toxic (phorbol esters, PEs) and antinutritional (phytate and trypsin inhibitor) factors. In the present study the localisation of antinutrients and a rapid qualitative method for detecting the presence of PEs were investigated. Results: Kernels were separated into cotyledon, hypocotyl, kernel coat and endosperm. The majority of phytate (96.5%), trypsin inhibitor (95.3%) and PEs (85.7%) were localised in the endosperm. Based on PEs, a qualitative method was developed to differentiate between toxic and non-toxic Jatropha genotypes. In this method, PEs were easily detected by passing methanol extracts of kernels (Jatropha toxic and non-toxic genotypes) through a solid phase extraction (SPE) column and measuring the absorption of the resulting eluates at 280 nm. For raw kernels, SPE eluates with absorbance ≥ 0.056 were considered as toxic and those with absorbance ≤0.032 as non-toxic. For defatted kernel meals, SPE eluates with absorbance ≥ 0.059 were considered as toxic and those with absorbance ≤0.043 as non-toxic. Conclusion: The majority of antinutrients/toxic compounds are localised in the endosperm of the kernel. The qualitative method developed for rapid identification of toxic PEs could be useful in screening the toxicity of Jatropha-based products in the biodiesel industry. Further confirmation of PEs should be established by high-performance liquid chromatography. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - In this paper, Siberian apricot (Prunus sibirica L.) seed kernel oil was investigated for the first time as a promising non-conventional feedstock for preparation of biodiesel. Siberian apricot seed kernel has high oil content (50.18±3.92%), and the oil has low acid value (0.46mgg -1) and low water content (0.17%). The fatty acid composition of the Siberian apricot seed kernel oil includes a high percentage of oleic acid (65.23±4.97%) and linoleic acid (28.92±4.62%). The measured fuel properties of the Siberian apricot biodiesel, except cetane number and oxidative stability, were conformed to EN 14214-08, ASTM D6751-10 and GB/T 20828-07 standards, especially the cold flow properties were excellent (Cold filter plugging point -14°C). The addition of 500ppm tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) resulted in a higher induction period (7.7h) compliant with all the three biodiesel standards. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hybrid catalytic membranes consisting of cation ion-exchange resin particles (CERP) and polyethersulfone (PES) were prepared by immersion phase inversion and used as heterogeneous catalysts for the esterification of acidified oil with methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol. The membranes were characterized by ion exchange capacity and swelling degree tests. The membranes were annealed at different temperatures to improve catalytic activity and membranes annealed at 393. K had the highest catalytic activity. Butanol allowed the highest free fatty acids (FFAs) conversion of 95.28% since it has better miscibility than the other alcohols which strengthened mass and heat transfer. Furthermore, pseudo-homogeneous kinetic models of the esterification of acidified oil with the four alcohols were established according to the experimental data. The kinetic models can well predict the FFA conversion. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative environmentally friendly fuel made from renewable biological sources such as vegetable oils and animal fats. The present report deals with screening of 14 accessions of Jatropha curcas collected from all over India to find the most suitable ones for production of Biodiesel. From the 14 accessions of J. curcas located in the plantation at Osmania University, 4 accessions were initially selected on the basis of traits like general appearance, pest resistance, seed yield and seed-oil content. Further, the seed-oil of these 4 accessions was characterized by physico-chemical analysis to identify the elite accessions for production of biodiesel. Highest 1000-seed weight (640 g) and highest percentage seed-oil content (50.16) (extracted by Soxhlet method with hexane as the solvent) was recorded in the "KM" accession. The transesterification process is affected by the presence of high free fatty acids (recorded in "MB" accession) and high moisture content (recorded in "KM" accession) of the seed-oil which also interfere with the separation of fatty esters and glycerol during production of Biodiesel. Further, high phosphorus content and iodine number (recorded in "MB" accession) interfere with conversion of seed-oil to Biodiesel. In the above context, in spite of its yield being lower, the seed-oil of the "RSAD" accession was found to be most suitable for Biodiesel production followed by "KM", "F.W.B" and "MB" accessions, since it contains lower free fatty acids, acid value, viscosity, diglycerides and iodine number. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - If energy crops are to replace fossil fuels as source for heat, power or vehicle fuel, their whole production chain must have higher energy output than input. Industrial hemp has high biomass and energy yields. The study evaluated and compared net energy yields (NEY) and energy output-to-input ratios (R O/I) for production of heat, power and vehicle fuel from industrial hemp. Four scenarios for hemp biomass were compared; (I) combined heat and power (CHP) from spring-harvested baled hemp, (II) heat from spring-harvested briquetted hemp, and (III) CHP and (IV) vehicle fuel from autumn-harvested chopped and ensiled hemp processed to biogas in an anaerobic digestion process. The results were compared with those of other energy crops. Calculations were based on conditions in the agricultural area along the Swedish west and south coast. There was little difference in total energy input up to storage, but large differences in the individual steps involved. Further processing to final energy product differed greatly. Total energy ratio was best for combustion scenarios (I) and (II) (R O/I of 6.8 and 5.1, respectively). The biogas scenarios (III) and (IV) both had low R O/I (2.7 and 2.6, repectively). They suffer from higher energy inputs and lower conversion efficiencies but give high quality products, i.e. electricity and vehicle fuel. The main competitors for hemp are maize and sugar beets for biogas production and the perennial crops willow, reed canary grass and miscanthus for solid biofuel production. Hemp is an above-average energy crop with a large potential for yield improvements. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The residue of a fatty acid distillation was used as a diesel fuel in a medium speed diesel engine. This bio-oil was heated to 110 °C to decrease the viscosity to 8 mPa s. The injectors working with the bio-oil failed prematurely with operation times ranging from 50 to 1500 h. The injectors and the fuel were investigated in order to know the reasons of the failure and to improve the operation of the engine. The investigation revealed different causes, including plastic deformation and clogging of the injector's passages, as well as micro cracks, erosion and cavitation damage. The failed injectors were compared with non affected ones from the same engine and injectors from fossil diesel fuelled engines. It was found that the chemical and physical composition of the fuel enforced the failure of the injectors. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas seeds afford non edible oil seed source for biodiesel, therefore, production of biodiesel from this oil would avoid food versus fuel controversy. However, Jatropha seed oil contains higher amounts of free fatty acids (about 12%). Therefore this requires a two step acid-base catalyzed treatment for the trans-esterification to obtain biodiesel. However, the use of lipase enzymes affords the trans-esterification of seed oil in a single step only. Therefore, presently the research work was performed to study the trans-esterification of Jatropha seed oil by using lipase enzymes obtained from the two microbes i.e., Pseudomonas sp. and Rhizopus sp., respectively. The lipase enzyme obtained from Pseudomonas sp. was found to show more than ten times higher activity in comparison to that of Rhizopus sp. Thus, the use of Psedomonas sp. lipase also showed higher yields of biodiesel in comparison to that of Rhizopus sp. Bioprocessing of J. curcas seed oil by single step process was compared with the two step chemical process to obtain biodiesel. A comparison of the two processes has been drawn. The biodiesel obtained from the Jatropha oil seeds were characterized for physical properties like kinematic viscosity, density, flash point, pour point, acid number and water content. The residual seeds obtained after the recovery of oil were found to be good substrate for the biogasification to obtain biomethane. Bioprocesses for obtaining added value chemical from the byproduct glycerol are being developed currently. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper analyses the viability of Brassica napus as an energy crop cultivated for producing biodiesel in southern Europe. The proposed methodology assessment combines physical variables such as grain production and agroclimate conditions with environmental analysis (LCA) in order to determine the Mediterranean agroclimates areas that could be cultivated for non-food purposes. The results obtained in a local production and distribution scenario (25 km) demonstrate that the biodiesel systems analysed have a better energy balance than diesel. Biodiesel obtained a net energy benefit of 16.25 MJ kg -1 of biodiesel or 35.10 MJ kg -1 of biodiesel when the avoided impacts from coproducts (glycerine and rapemeal) are considered in comparison with conventional diesel. In terms of environmental performance, the biodiesel system also has less impact compared with diesel in three categories Abiotic Depletion (AD), Photochemical Oxidation (PO) and Global Warming Potential (GWP). The estimated impact reduction in the GWP category when is compared with diesel reached a minimum of 1.76 kg CO 2 eq. per kg of biodiesel when emissions of the use phase are included. The paper also demonstrates that agroclimates called "e", "b" and "d" that ensure grain productions higher than 2000 kg ha -1 the biodiesel commercialization from B. napus energy crop is suitable in environmental terms for an energy local and regional production and distribution strategy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Four systems for household food waste collection are compared in relation the environmental impact categories eutrophication potential, acidification potential, global warming potential as well as energy use. Also, a hotspot analysis is performed in order to suggest improvements in each of the compared collection systems. Separate collection of household food waste in paper bags (with and without drying prior to collection) with use of kitchen grinders and with use of vacuum system in kitchen sinks were compared. In all cases, food waste was used for anaerobic digestion with energy and nutrient recovery in all cases. Compared systems all resulted in net avoidance of assessed environmental impact categories; eutrophication potential (-0.1 to -2.4. kg NO3-eq/ton food waste), acidification potential (-0.4 to -1.0. kg SO2-eq/ton food waste), global warming potential (-790 to -960. kg CO2-eq/ton food waste) and primary energy use (-1.7 to -3.6. GJ/ton food waste). Collection with vacuum system results in the largest net avoidence of primary energy use, while disposal of food waste in paper bags for decentralized drying before collection result in a larger net avoidence of global warming, eutrophication and acidification. However, both these systems not have been taken into use in large scale systems yet and further investigations are needed in order to confirm the outcomes from the comparison. Ranking of scenarios differ largely if considering only emissions in the foreground system, indicating the importance of taking also downstream emissions into consideration when comparing different collection systems. The hot spot identification shows that losses of organic matter in mechanical pretreatment as well as tank connected food waste disposal systems and energy in drying and vacuum systems reply to the largest impact on the results in each system respectively. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The increasing cost of vegetable oils is turning the use of microbial lipids into a competitive alternative for the production of biodiesel fuel. The oleaginous yeast Rhodotorula graminis is able to use a broad range of carbon sources for lipid production, and is able to resist some of the inhibitors commonly released during hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials. Using undetoxified corn stover hydrolysate as substrate, the yeast achieved a lipid productivity and lipid content of 0.21. g/L/h and 34%. w/w, respectively. The corresponding results with crude glycerol as carbon source were 0.15. g/L/h and 54%. w/w, respectively. Therefore, R. graminis appears to be a suitable candidate for fermentation processes involving renewable resources. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Methyl esters were synthesized from crude karanj oil (CKO) by single step esterification with methanol using sulfuric acid (H 2SO 4) and phosphoric acid (H 3PO 4) as catalysts in a homogeneous batch process. H 3PO 4 was less active than H 2SO 4 during the process as it presented very low ester yields (&lt;20%) for the various molar ratios of fatty acid to alcohol studied. With H 2SO 4 as catalyst, the yield was as high as 89.8% at 65°C after 5h. The fatty acids profile of the oil (palmitic acid: ∼12%; stearic acid: ∼8%; oleic acid: ∼52% and linolenic acid of 17%) and the different reactivities of the acids were responsible for the observed differences in conversion to methyl esters. The findings attained with this study might contribute to the economic utilization of a non-edible feedstock. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A new process evaluation methodology of microalgae biodiesel has been developed. Based on four evaluation criteria, i.e. the net energy ratio (NER), biodiesel production costs, greenhouse gases (GHG) emission rate and water footprint, the model compares various technologies for each step of the process, from cultivation to oil upgrading. An innovative pathway (hybrid raceway/PBR cultivation system, belt filter press for dewatering, wet lipid extraction, oil hydrotreating and anaerobic digestion of residues) shows good results in comparison to a reference pathway (doubled NER, lower GHG emission rate and water footprint). The production costs are still unfavourable (between 1.94 and 3.35. €/L of biodiesel). The most influential parameters have been targeted through a global sensitivity analysis and classified: (i) lipid productivity, (ii) the cultivation step, and (iii) the downstream processes. The use of low-carbon energy sources is required to achieve significant reductions of the biodiesel GHG emission rate compared to petroleum diesel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Algal biofuels are a growing interest worldwide due to their potential in terms of sustainable greenhouse gas displacement and energy production. This article describes a comparative survey of biodiesel production and conversion yields of biodiesel via alkaline transesterification of acylglycerols extracted from the microalgae Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum, grown under silicate or nitrate limitation, and that of model vegetable oils: soybean, and rapeseed oil. Acylglycerols were extracted with n-hexane and the total yield per biomass was determined by gravimetric assay. Under our conditions, the total acylglycerol yield from the microalgae studied was 13-18% of total dry weight. The biodiesel samples were analyzed using gas chromatography-flame ionization detector to determine quantitative information of residual glycerol, mono-, di-, and tri-acylglycerol concentrations in the biodiesel. All of the algal-based biodiesel demonstrated less mono-, di-, and tri-acylglycerol concentrations than the vegetable-based biodiesel under identical transesterification conditions. The fatty acid compositions of all the feedstock oils and their resultant biodiesel were also analyzed and reported. Based on the fatty acid methyl ester compositions of our samples we qualitatively assessed the suitability of the algal-derived biodiesel in terms of cetane number (CN), cold-flow properties, and oxidative stability. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012;109: 1146-1154. Published 2011. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA. This work presents the feasibility of producing biodiesel, at the bench-scale, from extracted algal acylglycerols produced by Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira Pseudonana under targeted environmental conditions. Using GC-FID the authors quantified the residual glycerol, MAGs, DAGs, TAGs, and total free glycerol within the resultant biodiesel. The fatty acid profiles for the feedstock oils and their resultant biodiesel methyl esters are also presented along with a qualitative assessment of the suitability of the diatom-based biodiesel in terms of cetane number (CN), cold-flow properties, and oxidative stability. © 2011.

AB  - With the abatement potential of end-of-pipe technologies for road transport becoming increasingly marginal, and with greater emissions reductions still needed in order to reduce pollution, alternative strategies involving behavioural change and choices between fossil fuelled or low carbon vehicles becomes more important. The environmental requirements include local air quality objectives, meeting national emissions ceilings to limit transboundary effects, and to aspire to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper we use the BRUTAL sub-model of the UK integrated Assessment Model (UKIAM) to investigate a selection of alternative strategies including downsizing of cars, switching from petrol to diesel, and the introduction of electric, bio-fuelled or hydrogen vehicles into the fleet, relative to a business-as-usual projection for 2020. Projected impacts upon air quality limit values, national emissions ceilings and CO 2 emissions are assessed in relation to local, national and international objectives. We discuss related life-cycle impacts, implications for infrastructure, and potential impacts upon emissions from other sectors in order to highlight the full potential implications of the different strategies within the context of changes resulting from other policy developments at different scales. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The goal of this study is to evaluate the life cycle performance of two alternative pathways to biofuels in the shipping industry: the 'diesel route' and the 'gas route'. The diesel route comprises of a shift from heavy fuel oil to marine gas oil and then a gradual shift to biodiesel, whereas the gas route comprises of a shift to liquefied natural gas and then a gradual shift to liquefied biogas. The two routes are assessed in a case study for the ferry traffic between the Swedish mainland and the island Gotland. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to evaluate the environmental performance with the functional unit chosen to be one year of ro-pax ferry service, including both passenger and goods transportation. The gas route is indicated to have better overall environmental performance than the diesel route. Furthermore, use of biofuels is illustrated as one possible measure to decrease the global warming impact from shipping, but to the expense of greater environmental impact for some other impact categories. As an example, the global warming potential (GWP 100) was shown to decrease with the use of biofuels in this study, while the eutrophication potential and the primary energy use increased. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - California's target for reducing economy-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. We develop transition scenarios for meeting this goal in California's transportation sector, with focus on light-duty vehicles (LDVs). We explore four questions: (1) what options are available to reduce transportation sector GHG emissions 80% below 1990 levels by 2050; (2) how rapidly would transitions in LDV markets, fuels, and travel behaviors need to occur over the next 40 years; (3) how do intermediate policy goals relate to different transition pathways; (4) how would rates of technological change and market adoption between 2010 and 2050 impact cumulative GHG emissions?We develop four LDV transition scenarios to meet the 80in50 target through a combination of travel demand reduction, fuel economy improvements, and low-carbon fuel supply, subject to restrictions on trajectories of technological change, potential market adoption of new vehicles and fuels, and resource availability. These scenarios exhibit several common themes: electrification of LDVs, rapid improvements in vehicle efficiency, and future fuels with less than half the carbon intensity of current gasoline and diesel. Availability of low-carbon biofuels and the level of travel demand reduction are "swing factors" that influence the degree of LDV electrification required. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The rapid increase of the vehicle population makes the transport sector a significant contributor to China's BC emissions. In this study, we developed an inventory to estimate emissions, reductions, and projections of BC from on-road vehicles. Total emissions of on-road vehicles were 15.0 Gg in 1990 and 64.0 Gg in 2009. Diesel vehicles were the biggest contributor, emitting 83%-95% of total emissions. Results of provincial-level analysis showed that Guangdong, Shandong, and Hebei had higher emissions than other provinces. Emission standards introduced by the government to reduce particulate matter (PM) resulted in decreased BC emissions. Total reductions were up to 375.8 Gg in the period of 1999-2009, equivalent to 270 Tg CO 2 (100-year). Projections show that emissions continue to decline from 2010 but start to increase from 2015 under a BAU scenario. If EURO V/VI emission standards are implemented, emissions will decline steadily until 2025. Further reductions of BC can be achieved by using biodiesel and low-sulfur fuels. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas oil (JCO) has a high content of free fatty acids and has been used extensively as a feedstock in biodiesel production. In the present study, the transesterification reaction of JCO to Jatropha curcas methyl ester (biodiesel) was performed in a continuous pulsed loop reactor under atmospheric conditions. The JCO was pre-treated prior to the reaction to reduce the free fatty acid content to below 1% (w/w). The operating parameters of the loop reactor were optimised based on the conversion of the JCO to Jatropha curcas biodiesel and included reaction temperature, molar ratio of oil to MeOH, reaction time and oscillation frequency. The findings show that the highest reaction conversion of 99.7% (w/w) was achieved using KOH catalyst and 98.8% conversion was obtained using NaOCH 3 catalyst. The optimal operating conditions were a molar ratio of 6:1, an oscillation frequency of 6Hz, temperature of 60°C, feedstock FFA content of 0.5% (w/w) and only 10min of reaction time. As a commercial commodity, the physical properties of biodiesel were analysed, and they compared well with the characteristics of fossil-based diesel fuel. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Conversion of canola oil to normal alkane hydrocarbons was investigated using sequential reactions: continuous thermal hydrolysis and fed-batch thermo-catalytic decarboxylation. The free fatty acid (FFA) intermediate product from hydrolysis was quantified using GC-FID, which showed 99.7% conversion and the following components: palmitic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, stearic, arachidic and behenic acids. The FFA was saturated then decarboxylated at an average rate of 15.5 mmoles/min using a 5% Pd/C catalyst at 300°C. Approximately 90% decarboxylation conversion to n-alkanes was achieved within 5 h of the reaction. The resulting mixture of n-alkanes can be readily converted into renewable diesel using isomerization to improve the cold flow properties of the fuel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Currently, biodiesel, a biofuel obtained from vegetable oils or animal fats, is becoming increasingly important in power generation. The properties of biodiesel are tied to the chemical composition of the oil or fat from which it was obtained. Esters prepared with saturated fatty acids have a high cloud point, high viscosity, while the unsaturated esters are less viscous and more easily oxidized. In this sense, the present study aimed to evaluate the oxidative stability as well as the hydrodynamic properties of quaternary mixtures of soybean (SBO), cotton (CTO), jatropha curcas (JCO) and babassu oils (BBO). The samples M4O (12.50 JCO:25.00 SBO:12.50 CTO:50.00 BBO, w/w%) and SBO showed the best kinematic viscosities, while the samples M1O (16.67 JCO:33.33 SBO:33.33 CTO:16.67 BBO, w/w%) and CTO showed the best pour point and fluidity point. The oxidation induction time (OIT) was measured using pressure differential scanning calorimetry (PDSC) and also Rancimat and Petro-Oxy apparatuses. The replacement of the studied individual oils by their quaternary mixtures was shown to improve the deficiencies of the individual oils. Among the individual oils, BBO displayed the highest and CTO the lowest OIT values. As for the mixtures, the best and the worst OIT were M4O and M1O, respectively. When the oxidative stability and cold flow properties were analyzed together, the sample that showed the best performance of them all was M3O (14.29 JCO:42.86 SBO:14.29 CTO:28.56 BBO, w/w%). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. has recently drawn the attention of the international research community due to its potential as a biodiesel crop. Although Jatropha is relatively tolerant to drought and salinity, poorly drained production areas have suffered increasing problems associated with flooding by saline water. Since the combined effects of flooding and salinity stress are not known, the objective in this work was to investigate physiological and morphological responses of J. curcas plants to flooding by fresh water or salt water. Plant growth, leaf water relations, leaf gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, carbohydrate and organic solutes, and leaf mineral nutrients were determined in three month-old plants exposed to flooding for 10 days with water containing 0, 150 or 300mM NaCl. Flooding decreased shoot and root growth but there were no significant difference between 0 and 300mM NaCl treatments. In 0mM NaCl flooded plants, leaves suffered dehydration as relative water content (RWC) and leaf water potential (Ψ w) decreased progressively resulting in decreased leaf turgor potential (Ψ P). In 300mM NaCl flooded plants, however, Ψ w remained high as leaf osmotic potential (Ψ π) decreased and Ψ P increased. Increased leaf Cl - and Na + concentration enabled this osmotic adjustment avoiding leaf dehydration but toxic values were reached in leaves. Leaf gas exchange parameters [net assimilation of CO 2 (ACO2), stomatal conductance (g s)] and quantum efficiency of PSII (Φ PSII) were reduced similarly by flooding but internal CO 2 concentration was highest in the 300mM NaCl treatment. Soluble sugars and starch was reduced in leaves and roots, and leaf Ca, Mg and P concentration was increased in plants under flooding. J. curcas plants are sensitive to flooding condition regardless of the level of salinity confirming their salinity tolerance even under flooded conditions. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Fossil fuels are being heavily depleted due to increasing anthropogenic activities worldwide, and burning them contributes to global climate warming and air pollution. Vegetable oils are one of the main feedstocks for biodiesel: they are non-toxic and environmentally friendly. Rising global population, decreasing arable lands and a decline in crop yields from desertification and salinization demands that biodiesel feedstock be grown on unproductive agricultural lands. To estimate whether five plants growing on such land in China could be used as energy plants, we determined their seed oil content (SOC) and relative fatty acid content, and estimated the cetane number (CN) of the biodiesel produced from these plant oils by a fitted regression between different C18 fatty acids and CN. Results showed that four plants can be developed as energy plants, including Datura candida (SOC = 22.9%, CN = 50.8), Xanthium sibiricum (SOC = 41.9%, CN = 46.5), Kosteletzkya pentacarpos (SOC = 18.6%, CN = 45.9) and Hibiscus trionum (SOC = 17.5%, CN = 46.9). The fifth plant, Rhus typhina, was not adapted as an energy plant because of its low SOC, 9.7%. Our data provide a scientific basis for growing energy plants in unproductive agricultural lands as biodiesel resources. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work proposed a method to predict the dynamic viscosity values of the hypothetical acidic oils-based biodiesel fuels. A topological index that can formulate the molecular structural information of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) components into dimensionless form was built from the integration and modification of the distance matrix and adjacency matrix of the molecular structure. Results show that both the caprylic acid (C8:0) and linoleic acid (C18:2) are beneficial components for reducing the biodiesel fuel's dynamic viscosity. Nine hypothetical acidic oils-based biodiesel fuels were made from the mixing of C8:0 or C18:2 with one vegetable oil at the same mass ratio, including peanut, canola, coconut, palm, soybean, corn, rapeseed, sunflower and cottonseed oils, and the dynamic viscosity values of them were predicted. The dynamic viscosity values were ranged at 0.90-2.13 mPa s (with the addition of C8:0) and 2.83-4.07 mPa s (with the addition of C18:2). This investigation is expected to provide some suggestions for the selection of some components that are beneficial for reducing the product's dynamic viscosity, so that the atomization characteristic of a low-quality feed can be improved by adding some suitable components into it. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is a promising alternative diesel fuel which has increased worldwide public interest in a number of countries including China. But the high cost of producing biodiesel from feedstock, predominately food grade oils, limited its economic feasibility. An alternative of using grease extracted from restaurant waste to produce biodiesel is a potential low cost approach. However, this approach generates a significant large quantity of solid residual fraction which required proper disposal. This study was conducted to evaluate the potential of a secondary biodiesel production from the solid residual fraction of restaurant waste after typical grease extraction (SRF) employing a high fat containing insect, black soldier fly, Hermetia illucens. The SRF was sampled and fed to black soldier fly larvae. The resulting larval biomass was used for crude grease extraction by petroleum ether. The extracted crude grease was then converted into biodiesel by acid-catalyzed (1% H 2SO 4) esterifi{ligature}cation and alkaline-catalyzed (0.8% NaOH) transesterifi{ligature}cation. About 23.6 g larval grease-based biodiesel was produced from approximately 1000 larvae grown on 1 kg of SRF. The weight of SRF was reduced by about 61.8% after being fed by the black soldier fly larvae for 7 days. The amount of biodiesel yield from restaurant waste was nearly doubled (original restaurant waste grease, 2.7%; larval grease, 2.4%). The major methyl ester components of the biodiesel derived from black soldier fly larvae fed on SRF were oleinic acid methyl ester (27.1%), lauric acid methyl ester (23.4%), and palmitic acid methyl ester (18.2%). Most of the properties of this biodiesel met the specifications of the standard EN 14214, including density (860 kg/m 3), viscosity (4.9 mm 2/s), fl{ligature}ash point (128 °C), cetane number (58) and ester contents (96.9%). These results indicated that black soldier fly larval biomass obtained from larvae reared on SRF could potentially be used as a non-food feedstock for biodiesel production. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of biodiesel production from restaurant waste, it also helps to better manage and significantly reduce the large quantity of solid residual fraction produced during the process of biodiesel production using restaurant waste. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Automotive transportation plays a major role in air pollution. Conventional technologies for reducing internal combustion engines emissions are reaching their limits, and one way of reducing pollution levels is using biofuels with obvious environmental benefits. Spark ignition engines can be fuelled with pure ethanol or different gasoline-ethanol blends. This theoretical study presents a method of evaluating emissions reduction when bioethanol is used. Several operating strategies are investigated, for the entire speed range of a 2-litre overhead camshaft (OHC) multi-port fuel injection engine, with different air-fuel ratios. CO 2, CO and NO x emissions values are calculated and the effect of ethanol addition in the fuel blend is evaluated. A reduction of all 3 emissions values is noticed as the ethanol volume in the fuel blend increases. Calculated values should be considered engine out emissions and not tail pipe emissions. Modern engines for transport vehicles are equipped with catalytic converters, systems that manifest variations in conversion efficiency for different temperature values during operation. The effect on catalytic systems that lower combustion temperature has, when increasing ethanol content in the fuel mix, is subject to further studies.

AB  - The present study adopted a two-step approach in the development of a methodology to identify and rank the important factors affecting in-vehicle particulate matter (PM). Firstly, the important factors affecting the monitored vehicular PM were identified using regression trees, considering several factors (meteorology, time-related, indoor sources, on-road, and ventilation) that could impact the vehicular indoor air quality. Secondly, the analysis of variance was used as a complementary sensitivity analysis to the regression tree results to rank the significant factors affecting vehicular PM. In-vehicle PM concentrations and sub-micron particle numbers were mainly influenced by the monthly/seasonal changes. Visibility and ambient PM 2.5 additionally influenced the sub-micron particles. Furthermore, this study emphasized the variation of the monitored vehicular PM levels under different combinations of the ranked influential factors. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The reduction of both exhaust gases and carbon dioxide emissions is necessary to meet future emissions regulations for diesel engines. Exhaust after-treatment devices are gradually being applied to diesel engines to reduce exhaust gases. Diesel particulate filters (DPF), an after-treatment device for diesel engines, in some cases require fuel post injection for regeneration. Post injection is usually conducted at the midpoint of the expansion stroke, and therefore causes fuel adhesion to the cylinder wall. However, using biofuels in a diesel engine is an effective way of reducing carbon dioxide emissions. It is well known that biofuels are chemically unstable, but the effects of biofuels on piston lubrication condition have not been thoroughly studied. In this study, piston lubrication condition during post injection in a single cylinder DI diesel engine using biofuel was investigated. Piston and ring friction forces were measured under engine operating conditions by means of a floating liner device to investigate the lubrication condition of the piston and rings. Both light fuel oil and biofuel were used in the measurements, with rapeseed methyl ester (RME) being used as the biofuel. Lubricating oil on the cylinder wall was also sampled under engine operating conditions, and the effect of post injection on fuel adhesion to the cylinder wall was analyzed. It was found that the effect of post injection on fuel adhesion to the cylinder wall was remarkable around the top dead center (TDC), and the fuel dilution rate reached approximately 90. The results of the measurement of the piston friction forces showed that post injection caused an increase in the friction forces at the compression TDC (CTDC) in the cases of both RME and light fuel oil, and the friction forces at CTDC increased according to the delay of the post injection timing. The increase in the piston friction forces was moderate in the case of RME. It seems that the higher viscosity and the oiliness of RME suppressed the increase in piston friction forces at TDC. The following effects were found in this study. Fuel post injection caused fuel adhesion to the cylinder wall. Such phenomena affected the lubrication condition of the piston. In the case of RME, the increase in the piston friction forces caused by post injection was smaller than that of light fuel oil, but the effects on piston lubrication condition in the case of using other biofuels needs to be investigated. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - Higher oil prices and increased interest in energy security have stimulated research on bio fuels. In order to achieve sustainability, renewable energy sources must be developed and explored. Bio-diesel derived from micro algae is considered as one such sustainable source. An important step to determine the feasibility of algae bio-fuel is quantifying the potential of commercial scale algal bio-fuel production. A deterministic mathematical model was developed to predict the technical potential of micro-algae bio-fuels in India. The model aims to identify suitable growth locations based on sunlight and local climatic conditions for algal biomass cultivation. The model incorporates realistic limits for light distribution, land use, transmission, photon utilization, photosynthetic efficiencies, and oil content based on literature data. For each scenario of oil fraction and sunlight, the model calculates potential oil yield, biomass produced, and growth rates. This preliminary resource assessment estimates annual algal biomass yield between 159 and 345 metric tons per hectare and 57,000 to 1, 62,000 liters of lipids per hectare based on the solar radiation intensity available in India.

AB  - In the present work, temperature dependent models for the prediction of densities and dynamic viscosities of pure compounds within the range of possible alternative fuel mixture components are presented. The proposed models have been derived using machine learning methods including Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. Experimental data used to train and validate the models was extracted from the DIPPR database. A comparison between models using an ample range of molecular descriptors and models using only functional group count descriptors as inputs was performed, and consensus models were created by testing different combinations of the individual models. The resulting consensus models predictions were in agreement with the available experimental data. Comparisons were also made between predictions of our models and correlations validated by the DIPPR staff. Our models were used to predict densities and dynamic viscosities of compounds for which no experimental data exists. Our models were also used to estimate other properties such as kinematic viscosities, critical temperatures, and critical pressures for compounds in the database. Finally, predictions were used to study the main trends of density and viscosity at the aforementioned temperatures as a function of the number of carbon atoms for chemical families of interest. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Increased demand in transportation fuels, environmental concerns, and depletion of fossil fuels require the development of efficient conversion technologies for second-generation biofuels. The main objective of this work is to efficiently liquefy biomass into energy-dense biocrude. A novel two-step process is proposed in which acidic subcritical water followed by alkaline supercritical water media are utilized for the liquefaction. The concept is tested with switchgrass. The first step is carried out at 200 °C in acidic subcritical water to liquefy hemicelluloses to biocrude while avoiding the repolymerization reactions that would otherwise produce char. In the second step, the remaining unliquefied biomass (biomass-H) is subjected to supercritical water at 380 °C with Ca(OH) 2 as catalyst for minimizing the formation of char, enhancing lignin solubilization and therefore increasing liquefaction of the remaining polysaccharides toward biocrude. The proposed two-step liquefaction produces a significantly higher amount of biocrude, as compared to the traditional one-step process. The yield of biocrude from the proposed process is 40% on mass basis and 67% on energy basis of the feedstock biomass. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Cost-effective production of lignocellulosic biofuels remains a major financial and technical challenge at the industrial scale. A critical tool in biofuels process development is the techno-economic (TE) model, which calculates biofuel production costs using a process model and an economic model. The process model solves mass and energy balances for each unit, and the economic model estimates capital and operating costs from the process model based on economic assumptions. The process model inputs include experimental data on the feedstock composition and intermediate product yields for each unit. These experimental yield data are calculated from primary measurements. Uncertainty in these primary measurements is propagated to the calculated yields, to the process model, and ultimately to the economic model. Thus, outputs of the TE model have a minimum uncertainty associated with the uncertainty in the primary measurements. Results: We calculate the uncertainty in the Minimum Ethanol Selling Price (MESP) estimate for lignocellulosic ethanol production via a biochemical conversion process: dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment of corn stover followed by enzymatic hydrolysis and co-fermentation of the resulting sugars to ethanol. We perform a sensitivity analysis on the TE model and identify the feedstock composition and conversion yields from three unit operations (xylose from pretreatment, glucose from enzymatic hydrolysis, and ethanol from fermentation) as the most important variables. The uncertainty in the pretreatment xylose yield arises from multiple measurements, whereas the glucose and ethanol yields from enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation, respectively, are dominated by a single measurement: the fraction of insoluble solids (fIS) in the biomass slurries. Conclusions: We calculate a $0.15/gal uncertainty in MESP from the TE model due to uncertainties in primary measurements. This result sets a lower bound on the error bars of the TE model predictions. This analysis highlights the primary measurements that merit further development to reduce the uncertainty associated with their use in TE models. While we develop and apply this mathematical framework to a specific biorefinery scenario here, this analysis can be readily adapted to other types of biorefining processes and provides a general framework for propagating uncertainty due to analytical measurements through a TE model. © 2012 Vicari et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Utilization of biofuels to vehicles is attracting attention globally from viewpoints of preventing global warming, effectively utilizing the resources, and achieving the local invigoration. Representative examples are bioethanol and biodiesel. This study highlights biodiesel and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) in view of reducing greenhouse gas emission from heavy-duty diesel vehicles. Biodiesel is FAME obtained through ester exchange reaction by adding methanol to oil, such as rapeseed oil, soybean oil, palm oil, etc. As already reported, FAME has fuel properties different from conventional diesel fuel, resulting in about 10% increase in NOx emission [1],[2],[3]. Suppression of such increase in the NOx emission during operating with biodiesel requires adjustment of the combustion control technology, such as fuel injection control and EGR, to the use of biodiesel. However, designing of vehicles and engines for dedicated use of biodiesel cannot be expected much because of the development cost. Besides, biodiesel suffers deterioration in low-temperature fluidity in cold climate, so that certain users use diesel fuel only in such cold climate. In this way, many issues must be solved before the vehicles and engines use only biodiesel. On the other hand, HVO is fuel produced by the hydrotreating reaction used in the oil refining process. It is possible for any fatty oil to be raw oil of this fuel. In addition, HVO is able to be used in substitution for conventional diesel fuel since it mainly consists of paraffinic hydrocarbon. In this study, NOx emission was investigated when FAME and HVO were used for heavy-duty diesel engine under steady-state condition and JE05 driving cycle. From the results of this study, it was confirmed that the fuel injection volume had increased compared to the hydrocarbon fuels such as HVO and diesel fuel because the FAME had small lower heating value (LHV) per unit volume. It was thus confirmed that the combustion control state such as the EGR ratio and the fuel injection pressure had changed. This was presumed to be one of the factors causing the increase in NOx. It was revealed that FAME and the hydrocarbon fuel could suppress the increase in the NOx emission because the higher the H/C ratio of a fuel was, the more the flame temperature decreased. The above results showed that HVO having the LHV per unit volume equivalent to diesel fuel with the high H/C ratio was the biomass-derived diesel alternative fuel which could suppress the increase in NOx emission.

AB  - In order to investigate carbonyl compound emission of methanol-diesel fuel and bio-diesel fuel, 14 sorts of different carbonyl compound from 3 different fuels (diesel, methanol-diesel and biodiesel) were investigated using High-performance Liquid Chromatography. The result showed the unregulated emissions from the two substitute fuels were greatly variable: 1) the overall specific emission of carbonyl compound increased. Compared with diesel, the carbonyl compound emission from Methanol-diesel increased 144.6%, and emission from biodiesel increased 67.5%; 2) formaldehyde was above 35.3% in the carbonyl compound emission under the testing condition; 3) In general, carbonyl compound increased as speed increasing or load decreasing when engine fueled methanol-diesel and biodiesel. The study provides reference for building carbonyl compound standards for using substitute fuels and matching the environment protection energy saving requirements.

AB  - To improve enzymatic biodiesel production, we developed a packed-bed reactor (PBR) system using recombinant cells, into which a strong enolase promoter and 5' untranslated region were introduced. Aspergillus oryzae expressing Fusarium heterosporum lipase was immobilized within biomass support particles (BSPs) during cultivation and used directly as a whole-cell biocatalyst. BSP-immobilized A. oryzae carrying three copies of the expression cassette showed a higher performance than previously developed cell systems, resulting in 87.5% conversion after 10 passes in PBR. The performance was also affected by operational factors including residence time and methanol feeding. After optimization, the PBR system attained a final methyl ester content of 96.1% with a residence time of 140. min per pass and stepwise addition of 4.25. molar equivalents of methanol to oil for 6 passes. Moreover, lipase activity was maintained for 5 batch cycles. Therefore, the developed PBR employing a high-lipase-expression system is considered useful for improving enzymatic biodiesel production. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Background: Jatropha curcas is recognized as a new energy crop due to the presence of the high amount of oil in its seeds that can be converted into biodiesel. The quality and performance of the biodiesel depends on the chemical composition of the fatty acids present in the oil. The fatty acids profile of the oil has a direct impact on ignition quality, heat of combustion and oxidative stability. An ideal biodiesel composition should have more monounsaturated fatty acids and less polyunsaturated acids. Jatropha seed oil contains 30% to 50% polyunsaturated fatty acids (mainly linoleic acid) which negatively impacts the oxidative stability and causes high rate of nitrogen oxides emission. Results: The enzyme 1-acyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine delta 12-desaturase (FAD2) is the key enzyme responsible for the production of linoleic acid in plants. We identified three putative delta 12 fatty acid desaturase genes in Jatropha (JcFAD2s) through genome-wide analysis and downregulated the expression of one of these genes, JcFAD2-1, in a seed-specific manner by RNA interference technology. The resulting JcFAD2-1 RNA interference transgenic plants showed a dramatic increase of oleic acid (> 78%) and a corresponding reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acids (< 3%) in its seed oil. The control Jatropha had around 37% oleic acid and 41% polyunsaturated fatty acids. This indicates that FAD2-1 is the major enzyme responsible for converting oleic acid to linoleic acid in Jatropha. Due to the changes in the fatty acids profile, the oil of the JcFAD2-1 RNA interference seed was estimated to yield a cetane number as high as 60.2, which is similar to the required cetane number for conventional premium diesel fuels (60) in Europe. The presence of high seed oleic acid did not have a negative impact on other Jatropha agronomic traits based on our preliminary data of the original plants under greenhouse conditions. Further, we developed a marker-free system to generate the transgenic Jatropha that will help reduce public concerns for environmental issues surrounding genetically modified plants. Conclusion: In this study we produced seed-specific JcFAD2-1 RNA interference transgenic Jatropha without a selectable marker. We successfully increased the proportion of oleic acid versus linoleic in Jatropha through genetic engineering, enhancing the quality of its oil. © 2012 Qu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Modern analytical chemistry of industrial products is in need of rapid, robust, and cheap analytical methods to continuously monitor product quality parameters. For this reason, spectroscopic methods are often used to control the quality of industrial products in an on-line/in-line regime. Vibrational spectroscopy, including mid-infrared (MIR), Raman, and near-infrared (NIR), is one of the best ways to obtain information about the chemical structures and the quality coefficients of multicomponent mixtures. Together with chemometric algorithms and multivariate data analysis (MDA) methods, which were especially created for the analysis of complicated, noisy, and overlapping signals, NIR spectroscopy shows great results in terms of its accuracy, including classical prediction error, RMSEP. However, it is unclear whether the combined NIR + MDA methods are capable of dealing with much more complex interpolation or extrapolation problems that are inevitably present in real-world applications. In the current study, we try to make a rather general comparison of linear, such as partial least squares or projection to latent structures (PLS); "quasi-nonlinear", such as the polynomial version of PLS (Poly-PLS); and intrinsically non-linear, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector regression (SVR), and least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVM/LSSVM), regression methods in terms of their robustness. As a measure of robustness, we will try to estimate their accuracy when solving interpolation and extrapolation problems. Petroleum and biofuel (biodiesel) systems were chosen as representative examples of real-world samples. Six very different chemical systems that differed in complexity, composition, structure, and properties were studied; these systems were gasoline, ethanol-gasoline biofuel, diesel fuel, aromatic solutions of petroleum macromolecules, petroleum resins in benzene, and biodiesel. Eighteen different sample sets were used in total. General conclusions are made about the applicability of ANN- and SVM-based regression tools in the modern analytical chemistry. The effectiveness of different multivariate algorithms is different when going from classical accuracy to robustness. Neural networks, which are capable of producing very accurate results with respect to classical RMSEP, are not able to solve interpolation problems or, especially, extrapolation problems. The chemometric methods that are based on the support vector machine (SVM) ideology are capable of solving both classical regression and interpolation/extrapolation tasks. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.

AB  - The substitution of mineral oil with vegetable oil as a lubricant in a CI engine is explored in this study. The experiments have been conducted with neat pongamia oil, blend of pongamia oil and mineral oil (50% V/V), and neat mineral oil as lubricants; and neat pongamia oil, blends of pongamia oil, and diesel in proportions of 20, 40, and 100, neat pongamia ester, and blends of pongamia ester and diesel in proportions of 20, 40, and 100 as fuel. For various combinations of fuel and lubricant, NOx, smoke, CO, HC, BSEC, EGT, and friction power were compared. It was found that there was no difficulty in operating the engine using the lubricants considered in this work. Further, it was found that the best results were recorded for the fuel-lubricant combination of neat pongamia as both fuel and lubricant. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

The formation of this active phase was verified by X-ray diffraction, whereas the study by transmission electron microscopy revealed that the catalyst is mainly constituted of nickel phosphide particles of relatively uniform size dispersed within the SBA-15 channels. Both Ni 2P/SBA-15 and a reference Ni/SBA-15 catalyst were tested for the hydrodeoxygenation of methyl oleate (C 17H 33-COO-CH 3) in a fixed-bed continuous flow reactor. This compound was used as a convenient surrogate of triglyceride molecules present in vegetable oils that following catalytic hydrotreating yields n-alkanes as the main products. In the whole range of pressure studied (3-40 bar) and for temperatures higher than 290 °C, both systems achieve more than 80% ester conversion at 20 h -1 WHSV, although the Ni/SBA-15 catalyst presents a slightly higher activity. Overall, higher pressure and lower temperature and space velocity favors the formation of C 18 hydrocarbon, which is the preferred product in terms of carbon atom economy. Nevertheless, under all the assayed conditions, the n-C 18/n-C 17 ratio was remarkably higher for Ni 2P/SBA-15 than for Ni/SBA-15 catalysts. On the basis of these results, it can be concluded that both deoxygenation and decarboxylation occur simultaneously over the Ni 2P catalyst, whereas decarboxylation and cracking are the prevailing processes over the Ni catalyst. Owing to these high yields of long-chain paraffins, Ni 2P/SBA-15 can be considered as a very promising catalyst for the production of green diesel. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Ni/HZSM-5 catalysts with different Ni loadings were prepared by impregnation method, and their catalytic performance was evaluated in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) upgrading of the model reactant methyl hexadecanoate (MHD) to liquid alkane fuels. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM, NH 3-TPD, and BET. Ni loadings were obviously influenced by the acidity, and thus significantly affected their catalytic performance. Over 7 wt.% Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst, MHD conversion of more than 90% and total liquid C 5-C 16 hydrocarbon selectivity of 83% were obtained under the optimum reaction condition, possibly due to the synergistic effect of metal Ni and acid HZSM-5. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is an effective strategy for controlling the levels of nitrogen oxides (NOX) emitted from a diesel engine, the full potential of EGR in NOX/PM trade-off and engine performance (i.e., fuel economy) has not fully been exploited. Significant work into the cause and control of particulate matter (PM) has been made over the past decade with new cleaner fuels and after-treatment devices emerging to comply with the current and forthcoming emission regulations. In earlier work, we demonstrated that engine operation with oxygenated fuels (e.g., biodiesel) reduces the PM emissions and extends the engine tolerance to EGR before it reaches smoke-limited conditions. The same result has also been reported when high cetane number fuels such as gas-to-liquid (GTL) are used. To further our understanding of the relationship between EGR and PM formation, a diesel particulate filter (DPF) was integrated into the EGR loop to filter the recirculated soot particulates. The control of the soot recirculation penalty through filtered EGR (FEGR) resulted in a 50% engine-out soot reduction, thus showing the possibility of extending the maximum EGR limit or being able to run at the same level of EGR with an improved NOX/soot trade-off. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Lipids extracted from seeds of Camelina sativa have been successfully used as a reliable source of aviation biofuels. This biofuel is environmentally friendly because the drought resistance, frost tolerance and low fertilizer requirement of Camelina sativa allow it to grow on marginal lands. Improving the species growth and seed yield by genetic engineering is therefore a target for the biofuels industry. In Arabidopsis, overexpression of purple acid phosphatase 2 encoded by Arabidopsis (AtPAP2) promotes plant growth by modulating carbon metabolism. Overexpression lines bolt earlier and produce 50% more seeds per plant than wild type. In this study, we explored the effects of overexpressing AtPAP2 in Camelina sativa. Results: Under controlled environmental conditions, overexpression of AtPAP2 in Camelina sativa resulted in longer hypocotyls, earlier flowering, faster growth rate, higher photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance, increased seed yield and seed size in comparison with the wild-type line and null-lines. Similar to transgenic Arabidopsis, activity of sucrose phosphate synthase in leaves of transgenic Camelina was also significantly up-regulated. Sucrose produced in photosynthetic tissues supplies the building blocks for cellulose, starch and lipids for growth and fuel for anabolic metabolism. Changes in carbon flow and sink/source activities in transgenic lines may affect floral, architectural, and reproductive traits of plants. Conclusions: Lipids extracted from the seeds of Camelina sativa have been used as a major constituent of aviation biofuels. The improved growth rate and seed yield of transgenic Camelina under controlled environmental conditions have the potential to boost oil yield on an area basis in field conditions and thus make Camelina-based biofuels more environmentally friendly and economically attractive. © 2012 Zhang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The paper outlines the Emission and Biofuel Directives relating to CO2 emissions in cars and the fiscal penalties incurred by manufacturers failing to meet targets. The effect on emissions of the biofuel directives are quantified through a test programme which measures emissions from a turbo-charged diesel engine using a range of biodiesel fuels, using standard diesel fuel to obtain a comparison. The tests measure O2, NOx, THC and CO emissions data as well as CO2. The results are difficult to quantify but, with the exception of corn oil show an increase in CO2 emissions. Corn oil also shows a reduction in other emissions. The discussion considers other mechanisms which can reduce overall global automotive emissions including range extenders for electric vehicles. © 2012, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

AB  - The development of biodiesels is being driven by the need for reducing emissions from diesel engines without modifying engines and for saving energy. The major obstacle to biodiesel commercialization is the high cost of raw materials. Biodiesel from waste cooking oil is an economical source and an effective strategy for reducing the raw material cost. Although biodiesels made from waste cooking oil have been previously investigated, PAH emissions from heavy-duty diesel engines (HDDEs) with catalyzer fueled with biodiesel from waste cooking oil and its blend with ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) for the US-HDD transient cycle have seldom been addressed. Experimental results indicate that ULSD/WCOB (biodiesel made from waste cooking oil) blends had lower PM, HC, and CO emissions but higher CO 2 and NO x emissions when compared with that of ULSD. Using ULSD/WCOB blends instead of ULSD decreased PAHs by 14.1%-53.3%, PM by 6.80%-15.1%, HC by 6.76%-23.5%, and CO by 0.962%-8.65% but increase CO 2 by 0.318-1.43% and NOx by 0.384-1.15%. Using WCOB is an economical source and an effective strategy for reducing cost, and solves the problem of waste oil disposal. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.

AB  - A life cycle approach was adopted for energy, green house gas (GHG) emissions and renewability assessment for production of 1. ton of Jatropha biodiesel. Allocation and displacement approaches were applied for life cycle inventory, process energy and process GHG emission attribution to co-products. The results of process energy and GHG emission analyses revealed that the amount of process energy consumption and GHG emission in the individual stages of the life cycle assessment (LCA) were a strong function of co-product handling and irrigation. The GHG emission reduction with respect to petroleum diesel for generating 1. GJ energy varied from 40% to 107% and NER values from 1.4 to 8.0 depending upon the methodology used for energy and emission distribution between product and co-products as well as irrigation applied. However, GHG emission reduction values of 54 and 40 and NER (net energy ratio) values of 1.7 and 1.4 for irrigated and rain-fed scenarios, respectively indicate the eco-friendly nature and renewability of biodiesel even in the worst scenario where total life cycle inventory (LCI), process energy and GHG emission were allocated to biodiesel only. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - All nations have been confronted with the energy crisis due to depletion of finite fossil fuels reserves, which results an increasing global demand of biofuels for energy security, economic stability and reduction in climate change effects, and generate the opportunity to explore new biomass sources. The production of sustainable bioenergy is a challenging task in the promotion of biofuels for replacing the fossil based fuels to mitigate challenges of fossil based energy consumption. Algae might be a very promising source of biomass in this context as it sequesters a significant quantity of carbon from atmosphere and industrial gases and is also very efficient in utilizing the nutrients from industrial effluents and municipal wastewater. If developed sustainably, the algae biofuel industry may be able to provide large quantities of biofuels with potentially minimal environmental impacts. However, in order to realize this, a complete analysis of full life cycle impact of algal biofuel production in the context of issues such as water resource management, land use impact, energy balance and air emissions are very necessary. The commercial-scale production of algae requires careful consideration of many issues that can be broadly categorized into four main areas: selecting algae species that produce high oil levels and grow well in specified environments, algae growth methods, water sources and related issues, and nutrient and growth inputs. © Sila Science.

AB  - The possibility of inflammation and neutrophil activation in response to indoor air pollution (IAP) from biomass fuel use has been investigated. For this, 142 premenopausal, neversmoking women (median age, 34 years) who cook exclusively with biomass (wood, dung, crop wastes) and 126 age-matched control women who cook with cleaner fuel liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) were enrolled. The neutrophil count in blood and sputum was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) in biomass users than the control group. Flow cytometric analysis revealed marked increase in the surface expression of CD35 (complement receptor-1), CD16 (F Cγ receptor III), and β 2 Mac-1 integrin (CD11b/CD18) on circulating neutrophils of biomass users. Besides, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that they had 72%, 67%, and 54% higher plasma levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-12, respectively, and doubled neutrophil chemoattractant interleukin-8. Immunocytochemical study revealed significantly higher percentage of airway neutrophils expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase, while the serum level of nitric oxide was doubled in women who cooked with biomass. Spectrophotometric analysis documented higher myeloperoxidase activity in circulating neutrophils of biomass users, suggesting neutrophil activation. Flow cytometry showed excess generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by leukocytes of biomass-using women, whereas their erythrocytes contained a depleted level of antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD). Indoor air of biomass-using households had two to four times more particulate matter with diameters of &lt;10 μm (PM 10) and &lt;2.5 μPM 2.5) as measured by real-time laser photometer. After controlling potential confounders, rise in proinflammatory mediators among biomass users were positively associated with PM 10 and PM 2.5 in indoor air, suggesting a close relationship between IAP and neutrophil activation. Besides, the levels of neutrophil activation and inflammation markers were positively associated with generation of ROS and negatively with SOD, indicating a role of oxidative stress in mediating neutrophilic inflammatory response following chronic inhalation of biomass smoke. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Brazil, the world third largest producer of biodiesel, and also the third largest producer of chicken, may increase the energy matrix, using oil derived from chicken, as an alternative to fossil fuels and reduce dependence on soybean oil for this purpose. The country can produce over 350 million liters of chicken oil per year. Considering the application of alternative fuels on diesel engines in agricultural machinery. The study aimed to evaluate the performance of a engine agricultural tractor with 53kW coupled by PTO in dynamometer bench operating with methyl biodiesel oil chicken and mix with diesel oil. Fuels B5 (reference), B20, B40, B60, B80 and B100 mixtures were used. The power, torque, torque reserve, fuel consumption, energy consumption and thermal efficiency of the engine were evaluated. The trial was conducted with a completely random design (CRD) in a factorial design with six treatment, which was held after the analysis of variance and adjusted means for the regression equations. Losses were observed in the generation of power and torque, increase in fuel consumption, reduction of energy consumption and improvement in engine thermal efficiency, according to the increasing proportion of biodiesel in the blend.

AB  - The use of foodstuffs as raw materials for energy production, such as ethanol from corn or biodiesel from vegetable oils, increases the prices of meat and milk. Extensive use of crop foodstuffs (maize and vegetable oils) may cause other significant problems such as starvation in developing countries. The use of foodstuffs as raw materials for energy production, such as ethanol from maize and sugar cane, and biodiesel from soybean and canola increases the prices of meat and milk. To reduce these risks should be initiated application of food operating certificate. For this purpose a Food Using Protocol must be organized with broad participation. This should be an international protocol like Kyoto Protocol. © Sila Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pot experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects of drought and salinity stresses and mulch amendment on Jatropha in sand dune soil under three conditions: glasshouse, shade house and open area. Plants were irrigated with freshwater and diluted seawater adjusted to two levels of electrical conductivity- 3 and 6 dS m -1. The results showed that experimental conditions remarkably affected the evapo-transpiration rate, soil moisture, salts accumulation and plant biomass production. Low temperature (23°C) conditions exhibited highest plant growth and soil moisture and lowest salts deposition. Plants showed no symptoms of heat stress in the glasshouse. The shade house and the open area profoundly reduced plant biomass and water content in the soil. Compared to the control, the mulch amended treatments had sufficient water for plant growth even in the high temperature of the open area. High salt content was found in salinity treated pots but the salinity level did not reduce Jatropha growth. Salt accumulated in the salinity treated pots helped retain more water, reduced the temperature and provided nutrients to the plants, with results which were almost similar to those from the mulch effect. The temperature conditions of the shade house and the open area (max&gt;40°C) caused substantial water loss and induced death of plants. Jatropha is a succulent and drought tolerant plant and a close irrigation interval is not the best option for Jatropha growth. But, organic amendment is needed when there is a big loss of soil water due to heat stress condition. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In the present study, microalgae were cultured under indoor and outdoor systems with high density and biomass. Their chemical analysis showed high lipid (28.2 and 21.6% respectively) and fatty acid methylesters (FAME) content. Fatty acids such as palmitic acid (16:0), oleic acid (18:1) and linoleic acid (18:2) were reported to be high in C. marina and S. costatum. S. costatum is containing more eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Marine diatom, S. costatum is efficiently converting the algal oil into biodiesel (87%) followed by C. marina which is produced the 70% of the biodiesel. Biodiesel yield of presently studied marine microalgae was being comparatively higher than that of existing oil crops. It is clearly implied that, marine microalgae C. marina and S. costatum were considered as a promising feedstock for biodiesel production in near future.

AB  - A new procedure based on exposure of ethanol biofuel samples to UV radiation in the presence of low molecular weight organic acids was developed for the determination of total Hg (inorganic and organometallic species: Hg 2+, CH 3Hg + and CH 3CH 2Hg +) by photochemical vapor generation coupled with atomic absorption spectrometry (photo-CV-AAS). For each species, the optimum conditions for photochemical generation were investigated, including the effects of medium composition, exposure time to the UV radiation and transfer gas flow rate. The accuracy was evaluated by assessing the recoveries of species-specific spikes (91-107%) as well as by assessing recovery from a mixture of all species of the mercury added to the ethanol biofuel samples based on calibration standards prepared in high purity bidistilled ethanol. The limits of detection ranged from 0.05 to 0.09 μg L -1 for all addition and recovery tests, enabling the determination of total Hg. The proposed method is sensitive, simple (no sample pretreatment) and provides a direct approach to the generation of mercury vapor from ethanol biofuel samples while promoting "green" chemistry. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.

AB  - The effects of phase separation temperatures (5-90°C) on losses of higher fatty acid (C 16 and C 18) ethyl esters in the glycerol phase were investigated. Losses of ethyl esters produced from ethanolysis of rapeseed oil were 30-60% higher when NaOH rather than KOH was used as homogeneous catalyst. The losses decreased with an increase in separation temperature, resulting in an increase in the yield of the ester phase. The concentration of impurities (e.g. alkali metals, free glycerol and glycerides) in the ester phase increased with increasing separation temperature due reversible transesterification and reciprocal solubility of the compounds. Carbonates formed during neutralization of the catalysts are also transesterification catalysts and they cause reverse reaction. The ethyl ester bound in the glycerol phase during NaOH-mediated catalysis can be extracted by heating the separated glycerol phase to 60-90°C. The ester yield is increasing with increasing separation temperature, however with decreasing quality. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An innovative approach to increase biofuel feedstock lipid yields from municipal sewage sludge via manipulation of carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio and glucose loading in activated sludge bioreactors was investigated. Sludge lipid and fatty acid methyl ester (biodiesel) yields (% cell dry weight, CDW) were enhanced via cultivation in activated sludge bioreactors operated at high initial C:N ratio (≥40:1) and glucose loading (≥40 g L -1). Under C:N 70, 60 g L -1 glucose loading, a maximum of 17.5 ± 3.9 and 10.2 ± 2.0% CDW lipid and biodiesel yields, respectively, were achieved after 7 d of cultivation. The cultured sludge lipids contained mostly C 16-C 18 fatty acids, with oleic acid consistently accounting for 40-50% of the total fatty acids. Microbial composition in activated sludge exposed to C:N 70 shifted toward specific gammaproteobacteria, suggesting their relevance in lipid production in wastewater microbiota and potential value in biofuel synthesis applications. © 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).

AB  - Increasing emphasis on biofuel to meet the growing energy demand while reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, Jatropha curcas has attracted the attention of researchers, policy makers and industries as a good candidate for biodiesel. It is a non-edible oil crop, drought tolerant and could be grown on degraded lands in the tropics without competing for lands currently used for food production. J. curcas being a wild plant, much about its water requirement and production potential of promising clones in different agroclimatic conditions is not known. Water use assessment of J. curcas plantations in the semi-arid tropical location at ICRISAT, Patancheru indicated that crop evapotranspiration of J. curcas under no moisture stress varied from 1410 to 1538. mm per year during 2006-2009. Under field conditions the crop evapotranspiration varied from 614 to 930. mm depending on the atmospheric demand, rainfall and crop phenological stage. Patterns of soil-water depletion indicated that with growing plant age from two to five years, depth of soil-water extraction increased from 100 to 150. cm by fifth year. Monthly water use of Jatropha varied from 10-20 (leaf shedding period) to 140. mm depending on water availability and environmental demand. This study indicated that J. curcas has a good drought tolerance mechanism, however under favorable soil moisture conditions Jatropha could use large amounts of water for luxurious growth and high yield. These findings highlight the need to carefully identify suitable niche areas for Jatropha cultivation and assess the implications of large J. curcas plantations on water availability and use under different agroecosystems, particularly so in water scarce regions such as semi-arid and arid regions in the tropics. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A life cycle assessment (LCA) and an energy balance analysis of marine microalgal biomass production were conducted to determine the environmental impacts and the critical points of production for large scale planning. The artificial lighting and temperature conditions of an indoor bubble column photobioreactor (bcPBR) were compared to the natural conditions of an equivalent outdoor system. Marine microalgae, belonging to the dinoflagellate and raphidophyte groups, were cultured and the results were compared with published LCA data obtained from green microalgae (commonly freshwater algae). Among the species tested, Alexandrium minutum was chosen as the target marine microalgae for biomass production under outdoor conditions, although there were no substantial differences between any of the marine microalgae studied. Under indoor culture conditions, the total energy input for A. minutum was 923 MJ kg -1 vs. 139 MJ kg -1 for outdoor conditions. Therefore, a greater than 85% reduction in energy requirements was achieved using natural environmental conditions, demonstrating the feasibility of outdoor culture as an alternative method of bioenergy production from marine microalgae. The growth stage was identified as the principal source of energy consumption for all microalgae tested, due to the electricity requirements of the equipment, followed by the construction material of the bcPBR. The global warming category (GWP) was 6 times lower in outdoor than in indoor conditions. Although the energy balance was negative under both conditions, this study concludes with suggestions for improvements in the outdoor system that would allow up-scaling of this biomass production technology for outdoor conditions in the Mediterranean. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Implementing biodiesel in fleet vehicles has been a challenge to many agencies. Issues related to pricing, availability, fuel quality, and winter operability have made it difficult to maintain successful programs. In addition, fuel efficiency and impact on equipment are additional concerns that need to be considered. Thus, a study was undertaken to establish best practices for implementation of biodiesel programs that sought information on existing biodiesel programs, practices, and lessons learned. A list of best practices was complied, with added inputs from literature review, and prioritized using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. This paper describes the study and provides specific recommended practices for ensuring fuel quality and year-round operability. The recommendations will assist with the implementation of successful biodiesel programs in both the public and private sectors. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Oil provides energy for 95% of transportation and the demand of transport fuel continues to rise. According to the assessment of IPCC (International Panel on Climate Change) to climate change, global oil demand will rise by 60% from 75 Mb/d in 2000 to 120 Mb/d in 2030. Almost three quarter of the increase in demand will be form the transport sector. Oil will remain the fuel of choice in road, sea and air transportation. Our country being a developing country, the increase in demand in our country for oil for use in the transport sector will grow at a much higher rate. All countries including India are grappling with the problem of meeting the ever increasing demand of transport fuel with the constraints of international commitments, legal requirements, environmental concerns, and limited resources. In this context transport fuels of biological origin have drawn a great deal of attention during the last two decades. Biofuels are renewable liquid fuels coming from biological raw materials and have been proved to be good substitute for oil in the transportation sector. As such Biofuels ethanol and Biodiesel are gaining world wide acceptance as a solution for problems of environmental degradation, energy security, retracting imports, rural employment and agricultural economy. With a view to add Bio-Fish Oil to the list of biodiesel, experimental studies were made using this bio oil in a single cylinder diesel engine and generator set as substitute for diesel fuel and the results are discussed. It is also blended with oxygenate and EGR technique also used to improve the performance and reduce the emission of the engine. Encouraging results were obtained from this investigation. The percentage reduction is CO - 91%, CO 2 - 62%, NO x - 92% and C xH y - 90% were attained when the engine was run at maximum load using BFO with 2% additive with EGR and there was reduction in all the percentages when the engine was run in other loads also. In the case of NO x, there was an increase of this emission by about 48% in the maximum load with BFO when compared with diesel, for obvious reasons and that was also reduced because of the addition of oxygenates and EGR technique. The optimum values were obtained with 2% of additive. When this percentage is increased or decreased the emission were increased. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Corn fiber hydrolysate was used as feedstock for microbial lipids production using the oleaginous Mortierella isabellina M2. First, we evaluated the effects of varying the HCl concentration, temperature, time and substrate concentration on corn fiber hydrolysis, then the effects of varying the concentrations of sugars, the nitrogen source, and culture time on lipid accumulation by M. isabellina M2. Under optimized corn fiber hydrolysis conditions, the sugars yield reached 83%. The microbial lipid content reached up to 50% when glucose, xylose, mannose and arabinose were used as single carbon sources, and when the corn fiber hydrolysate was used, the optimum sugar concentration, nitrogen source and cultivation time (for batch cultivation under otherwise constant conditions) were 60 g/l, 2 g/l (NH 4) 2SO 4, and 6 days, respectively. In validation experiments under this set of culture conditions the biomass, lipid content and lipid yield reached 17.5 g/l, 50.5% and 8.84 g/l, respectively. Results of GC/MS analysis indicate that the fatty acid composition of the lipid was similar to that of vegetable oil, thus it is a promising material for biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel can be produced by transesterification of plant oils. The oil content and fatty acid composition of fifty peanut accessions and two soybean accessions were analyzed and compared. In comparison of the oil content, peanut seeds contain a much higher proportion of oil (51.9% of the total seed mass) than soybean seeds (23.3%). Significant variability in oil content (45.9%-55.4%) was detected among peanut accessions. In comparison of the fatty acid composition, peanut seeds contain much higher proportions of oleic acid (43.2%) and behenic acid (3.2%) than soybean seeds (28.8% and 0.3%), and much lower proportions of linoleic acid (35.0%) and linolenic acid (0.1%) than soybean seeds (49.1% and 6.3%). The major differences in fatty acid composition imply fewer double bonds present in peanut oil than in soybean oil. In other words, peanut oil is less susceptible to oxidation than soybean oil. Significant variability in oleic acid (37.0%-55.6%), linoleic acid (25.2%-39.7%), palmitic acid (8.2%-13.8%), and stearic acid (1.7%-6.5%) was detected among peanut accessions. Significant negative correlations of oleic acid with other major fatty acids were detected. Our results indicated that higher oil content and better fatty acid composition of peanut seeds make it a better oilseed crop for biodiesel production. Moreover, based on the variability detected in oil content and fatty acid composition among peanut accessions, there is potential to increase oil content and alter fatty acid composition through peanut breeding. © 2012.

AB  - Jatropha curcas seeds contain 30-35% oil, which can be converted to high quality biodiesel. However, Jatropha oil is toxic, ascribed to the presence of phorbol esters (PEs). In this study, isolated phorbol ester rich fraction (PEEF) was used to evaluate the activity of PEs using three aquatic species based bioassays (snail (Physa fontinalis), brine shrimp (Artemeia salina), daphnia (Daphnia magna)) and microorganisms. In all the bioassays tested, increase in concentration of PEs increased mortality with an EC 50 (48h) of 0.33, 26.48 and 0.95mgL -1 PEs for snail, artemia and daphnia, respectively. The sensitivity of various microorganisms for PEs was also tested. Among the bacterial species tested, Streptococcus pyogenes and Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 215mgL -1 PEs; and Pseudomonas putida were also sensitive with MIC of 251mgL -1 PEs. Similarly, Fusarium species of fungi exhibited EC 50 of 58mgL -1 PEs, while Aspergillus niger and Curvularia lunata had EC 50 of 70mgL -1. The snail bioassay was most sensitive with 100% snail mortality at 1μg of PEs mL -1. In conclusion, snail bioassay could be used to monitor PEs in Jatropha derived products such as oil, biodiesel, fatty acid distillate, kernel meal, cake, glycerol or for contamination in soil or other environmental matrices. In addition, PEs with molluscicidal/antimicrobial activities could be utilized for agricultural and pharmaceutical applications. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Ultimate and proximate analyses and thermal degradation of bio-oils from pinewood and palm empty fruit bunches (PEFB) were carried out to evaluate the oils' potential for production of fuels for transport, heat and power generation, and of hydrogen via the calculation of performance indicators. The pinewood and PEFB oils indicated good theoretical hydrogen yields of 13.7 and 15.9wt.% via steam reforming, but their hydrogen to carbon effective ratios were close to zero, and their propensity for fouling and slagging heat exchanger surfaces via combustion was high. Both oils exhibited two phases during mass loss under nitrogen flow at heating rates of 3-9Kmin -1, but the kinetics of their thermal degradation from TGA-FTIR analysis indicated different degradation mechanisms that were well reproduced by a nth order reaction model for pinewood and Jander's 3D-diffusion model for PEFB. These findings lead to recommendations on pretreatments prior to the oils' utilisation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is a promising alternative energy source to diesel fuel and determining its biodegradability is an important aspect of addressing potential environmental spills. The aim of this study was to compare the biodegradability of biodiesel and its effect on soil microbial diversity with that of normal diesel using blends of biodiesel with diesel in microcosm experiments with soil from the Atlantic Rain Forest. Degradation was monitored by respirometry and GC analysis of the substrates. The highest respiration rates were observed in soil contaminated with the B50 (41.47mg CO 2/kg) and B100 (42.35mg CO 2/kg) blends. Soil contaminated with blends B5, B20, B50 and B100 showed higher numbers of culturable heterotrophic microbes than control soil. Chromatographic analyses showed that microcosms contaminated with diesel fuel and the B5 blend had less biodegradation than soil contaminated with the B20, B50 and B100 blends (80%, 62% and 84% of biodegradation, respectively). DGGE analysis showed that samples contaminated with the B5, B20, B50 blends and D100 showed changes in microbial community after the incubation period. Interestingly, soil contaminated with B100 decreased the microbial community compared with the other contaminated samples. While the degradation of pure biodiesel (B100) was efficient, microbial diversity of soil was reduced, which could compromise the overall activity of microorganisms involved in the bioremediation of contaminated soils. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article discusses an integrated framework built to compute the cost of stover-based E85, as well as its life cycle energy efficiency and CO 2 emission, with consideration of uncertainties of the policy-related factors, in China. Results show that co-product treatment greatly influenced the performance of E85 route. The calculated values of energy efficiency in co-product burning for electricity scenario (the base scenario) and that in co-product for selling scenario (the alternative scenario) are 4.41 and 3.61, respectively. CO 2 emission of the stover-based route is 99.7% more than that of the gasoline route in the base scenario and 55.3% less than that of the gasoline in the alternative scenario. The costs of E85 in these two scenarios are 9.78 and 7.76yuan/L, respectively. Based on the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, the article suggests the following: (1) stover-based E85 is currently not competitive in terms of cost; (2) on the current stage, to make E85 competitive, policymakers should be concerned about stimulating processing innovation, providing subsidies on ethanol, feedstock and co-product, as well as raising gasoline price, rather than increasing carbon tax rate/promoting Cleaner Development Mechanism (CDM) projects or influencing consumers' Willingness to Pay (WTP) for E85. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Peru has introduced a law to promote the use of biofuels with the objective to increase employment, strengthening agriculture development, providing an economic alternative to illegal drug production. In this work, the costs of biodiesel production from oil palm and Jatropha were analyzed under different scenarios. They include the participation of associations of smallholders and commercial producers as raw material provides in biodiesel business in Peru. The scenarios considered have a strong social dimension in which they explicitly consider how productions' costs change when smallholders supply a proportion of the feedstock to the industry. Production cost profiles were generated using the chemical process simulation and economical evaluation software packages provided by Aspen Technology. Total production cost found for oil palm biodiesel production ranged between 0.23 and 0.31. USD/L and Jatropha biodiesel production costs were between 0.84 and 0.87. USD/L. These production costs were analyzed and compared to biodiesel ex-factory prices and diesel fuel production cost factors. The results suggest that including smallholders in the supply chain can be under some conditions competitive with liquid biofuel production systems that are purely large scale. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The thermal degradation of free fatty acids and animal fat in a moving bed of sodium carbonate and 5 wt% of water were carried out at 430 ± 20°C at a pilot scale plant. During start-up the loading rates for a 60:40 mixture of oleic and stearic acids were 10 kg/h resulting in a 69 ± 5% of bio-crude. The acidity index was remarkably low within a range of 0.64-0.80 mg KOH/g during 3 weeks of operation. The loading rates for animal fat were increased from 10 to 40 kg/h corresponding to a weight hourly space velocity of 0.03-0.1 h -1 over a period of 6 months. Heat transfer into the reactor was the limiting criterion. The main product with a yield of 65 ± 5% was bio-crude showing an acidity index of 0.5-1.8 mg KOH/g. The mean value for kinematic viscosity at 40°C was 1.78 mm 2/s. The net calorific value of bio-crude was 41.6 MJ/kg. Coke deposits on sodium carbonate were determined to be 5 ± 1%. The gaseous products ranged from 25 wt% to 30 wt%. The presence of CO 2, H 2, CH 4, C 2H 6, C 2H 4 and C 3 to C 5 hydrocarbons as major components was established by gas chromatography. The gases were directly fed into an on-site gas line and used for heating purposes. The distillation curve of bio-crude from animal fat showed hydrocarbon based bio-fuels in the boiling ranges of gasoline and diesel. Upon rectification 66% of bio-diesel and 21% of bio-gasoline were obtained. This corresponds to a total yield of 43% bio-diesel and 14% bio-gasoline from animal fat. The bio-diesel had favorable low-temperature properties (cold filter plugging point = -18°C) with oxidation stability between that of mineral oil based diesel and fatty acid methyl ester fuels. The gasoline fraction lacked low-boiling hydrocarbons as indicated by a vapor pressure of 26 kPa instead of 60-90 kPa (DIN EN 228). Thus, water-cooled condensers need to be improved for a full-scale plant. The results are discussed in terms of German specifications for standard fuels. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Surplus of glycerol due to the increase of biodiesel production has become an economic drawback for the development of biofuel itself. In this work, we show that it is possible to take advantage of glycerol for the synthesis of derivatives such as ketals, which can be used in biodiesel blends. The synthesis of ketals has been successfully carried out in good yields by using a cheap and reusable catalyst, K10 montmorillonite. The analysis of biodiesel blends quality parameters revealed the improvement of their cold properties, but some parameters such as fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) content and oxidation stability do not reached EN14214 specifications. In order to overcome this issue, esterification of the free hydroxyl group has been carried out leading to products with improved and promising properties for biodiesel blends. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recently, vegetable oils have received increased attention as a source of renewable fuels. However, the high viscosity of vegetable oils makes them problematic for long-term use in diesel engines. Therefore, vegetable oil reverse micelle microemulsions have been evaluated as an alternative method of reducing vegetable oil viscosity while eliminating the trans-esterification reaction and avoiding the unpurified glycerol and its environmental problems. Since extended-surfactants can form microemulsions with a high solubilization capacity and with a wide range of oils, extended-surfactant-based reverse micelle microemulsion systems were evaluated in this research. The objective of this research is to study the phase behavior of carboxylate-based extended surfactant microemulsion systems with the goal of formulating optimized systems for biofuel. It was found that carboxylate-based extended surfactants were able to form reverse micelle microemulsions without salt addition, thereby eliminating the phase separation and precipitation which had been observed with sulfate-based extended surfactants. In addition, fuel properties such as viscosity and temperature dependence were favorable and thus support the continued development of these surfactant-based fuel systems for use in diesel engines. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Emission rates and composition of known hazardous air pollutants in the exhaust gas from a commercial agriculture tractor, burning a range of biodiesel blends operating at two different load conditions were investigated to better understand the emission characteristics of biodiesel fuel. Ultra-Low Sulfur Petroleum Diesel (ULSD) fuel was blended with soybean oil and beef tallow based biodiesel to examine fuels containing 0% (B0), 50% (B50) and 100% (B100) soybean oil based biodiesel, and 50% (B50T) and 100% (B100T) beef tallow biodiesel. Samples were collected using a dilution source sampler to simulate atmospheric dilution. Particulate matter and exhaust gases were analyzed for carbonyls, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) to determine their respective emission rates. This analysis is focused on the emissions of organic compounds classified by the US EPA as air toxics and include 2,2,4 trimethylpentane, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m-, p- and o-xylene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and methylethyl ketone. Emission rates of 2,2,4 trimethylpentane, toluene, ethylbenzene, m-, p- and o-xylene decreased more than 90% for B50, B100 and B100T blends; decreases in emission rates of benzene, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were more modest, producing values between 23 and 67%, and methyl ethyl ketone showed decreases not exceeding 7% for the studied biodiesel blends. PAHs emission rates were reduced by 66% for B50, 84% for B100, and by 89% for B100T. The overall emissions of toxic organic compounds were calculated and expressed as benzene equivalents. The largest contributors of toxic risk were found to be formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. Reductions in formaldehyde emissions were 23% for B50 and 42% for B100 soybean, and 40% for B100T beef tallow compared to B0. Similarly, acetaldehyde reductions were 34% for B50 and 53% for B100 soybean biodiesel and 42% for B100T beef tallow biodiesel. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The efficacy of gossypol as an antioxidant additive in fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) prepared from soybean oil (SME), waste cooking oil (WCME) and technical grade methyl oleate (MO) was investigated. Gossypol is a naturally occurring polyphenolic aldehyde with antioxidant properties isolated from cottonseed that is toxic to humans and animals. At treatment levels of 250 and 500 ppm, gossypol exhibited statistically significant improvements in the induction periods (IPs; EN 14112) of SME, WCME and MO. Efficacy was most pronounced in SME, which was due to its higher concentration of endogenous tocopherols (757 ppm) versus WCME (60 ppm) and MO (0 ppm). A comparison of antioxidant efficacy was made with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and γ-tocopherol. For FAMEs with low concentrations of endogenous tocopherols (WCME and MO), γ-tocopherol exhibited the greatest efficacy, although treatments employing BHT and gossypol also yielded statistically significant improvements to oxidative stability. In summary, gossypol was effective as an exogenous antioxidant for FAMEs investigated herein. In particular, FAMEs containing a comparatively high percentage of endogenous tocopherols were especially suited to gossypol as an antioxidant additive. © 2011.

AB  - In this paper, the feasibility of crude Jatropha curcas L. oil (CJCO) as raw material to produce biodiesel under low-frequency ultrasonic irradiation (40 kHz) assisted is examined. A two-step transesterifi cation process (acid catalyzed esterifi cation followed by alkaline catalyzed transesterifi cation) is employed to produce biodiesel. In the fi rst step, the high level of free fatty acid (FFA), 12.5%, of CJCO is successfully reduced to less than 3% by acid catalyzed esterifi cation with 15% w/w methanol to oil ratio, catalyst concentration 3.0% w/w, ultrasonic irradiation time 20 min at under reaction temperature 30°C, which are selected as optimum conditions for the acid catalyzed esterification. Then, the second step, alkaline catalyzed transesterifi cation is carried out as methanol to oil ratio 15% w/w, catalyst concentration 1% w/w, reaction temperature 30°C and ultrasonic irradiation time 30 min. This results to high percentage of conversion to biodiesel about 98%. Comparing the results obtained under the ultrasonic irradiation in this study with those under conventional stirring conditions, ultrasonic irradiation technique signifi cantly illustrated the higher effi ciency than the conventional method, especially for the high FFA oil. © 2012 by Japan Oil Chemists' Society.

AB  - There has been keen interest in camelina (Camelina sativa L. Crantz) in recent years due to the unique fatty acid composition of the seed oil for human and animal consumption and, more importantly, the value of the seed oil to provide "green energy" to fuel commercial and military aircraft. The objective of our research was to evaluate several planting dates and two planting methods for camelina stand establishment and seed yield. Field experiments were conducted for three years at four distinct rainfed agro-environments in the Pacific Northwest, USA. Average crop-year precipitation at the sites during the three years was: Lind WA, 228. mm; Pendleton OR, 421. mm; Moscow ID (one year only), 760. mm; and Corvallis OR, 993. mm. Camelina was planted on an average of five dates at each site (n= 55) from early October to mid April at a rate of 6. kg/ha by either drilling seed at a shallow depth or broadcasting seed on the soil surface. Although camelina has excellent cold hardiness, the best plant stands were achieved with the late-winter and early-spring plantings. Four divergent planting date yield responses across sites were: no yield differences at Lind; increased yield with later planting dates at Pendleton; reduced yield with later plantings at Moscow (one year data); and a curvilinear response at Corvallis with the lowest yields from plantings in early fall and those after March 1 and highest yields from late-fall and mid-winter plantings. Both drilling and broadcast were effective for planting camelina with no overall advantage of either method. Seed yields ranged from <100. kg/ha during an extreme drought year at Lind to 2900. kg/ha at Moscow. Averaged across the four Pacific Northwest agro-environments in this study, we recommend: (i) late February-early March as the best overall planting date because of optimum stands and seed yield and having effective control of winter-annual broadleaf weeds with herbicide applied just prior to planting, and (ii) the broadcast method of planting as it generally equaled or slightly exceeded drilling for plant stand establishment and seed yield and can be accomplished more quickly at less expense. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Furfural, a cellulose model compound, was converted into gasoline-range fuels through catalytic fast pyrolysis. H-ZSM-5-based catalysts were employed in a continuous fixed bed system. The reaction temperature, reactant contact time, and catalytic promoter are keys to manipulate the product distribution. The first step in furfural conversion is the decarbonylation of furfural to form furan, followed by furan conversion to intermediates (e.g., cyclohexene and 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde) in the ZSM-5 pores. These intermediates can then be transformed into aromatics, coke, light olefins, and carbon oxides. A reaction temperature of 500°C generated the highest yield of aromatics and the lowest amount of coke. A long contact time (∼1.5 s) also provided the highest aromatic selectivity. The promoter, zinc oxide, plays an important role in hydrogen atom transfer. This is attributed to the change of acid site concentration and Lewis acid sites created by anchored Zn ions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Wax ester synthases (WSs) can synthesize wax esters from alcohols and fatty acyl coenzyme A thioesters. The knowledge of the preferred substrates for each WS allows the use of yeast cells for the production of wax esters that are high-value materials and can be used in a variety of industrial applications. The products of WSs include fatty acid ethyl esters, which can be directly used as biodiesel. Results: Here, heterologous WSs derived from five different organisms were successfully expressed and evaluated for their substrate preference in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We investigated the potential of the different WSs for biodiesel (that is, fatty acid ethyl esters) production in S. cerevisiae. All investigated WSs, from Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus DSM 8798, Rhodococcus opacus PD630, Mus musculus C57BL/6 and Psychrobacter arcticus 273-4, have different substrate specificities, but they can all lead to the formation of biodiesel. The best biodiesel producing strain was found to be the one expressing WS from M. hydrocarbonoclasticus DSM 8798 that resulted in a biodiesel titer of 6.3 mg/L. To further enhance biodiesel production, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase was up-regulated, which resulted in a 30% increase in biodiesel production. Conclusions: Five WSs from different species were functionally expressed and their substrate preference characterized in S. cerevisiae, thus constructing cell factories for the production of specific kinds of wax ester. WS from M. hydrocarbonoclasticus showed the highest preference for ethanol compared to the other WSs, and could permit the engineered S. cerevisiae to produce biodiesel. © 2012 Shi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background. Biofuel has been the focus of intensive global research over the past few years. The development of 4 th generation biofuel production (algae-to-biofuels) based on metabolic engineering of algae is still in its infancy, one of the main barriers is our lacking of understanding of microalgal growth, metabolism and biofuel production. Although fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis pathway genes have been all cloned and biosynthesis pathway was built up in some higher plants, the molecular mechanism for its regulation in microalgae is far away from elucidation. Results. We cloned main key genes for FA biosynthesis in Haematococcus pluvialis, a green microalga as a potential biodiesel feedstock, and investigated the correlations between their expression alternation and FA composition and content detected by GC-MS under different stress treatments, such as nitrogen depletion, salinity, high or low temperature. Our results showed that high temperature, high salinity, and nitrogen depletion treatments played significant roles in promoting microalgal FA synthesis, while FA qualities were not changed much. Correlation analysis showed that acyl carrier protein (ACP), 3-ketoacyl-ACP-synthase (KAS), and acyl-ACP thioesterase (FATA) gene expression had significant correlations with monounsaturated FA (MUFA) synthesis and polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) synthesis. Conclusions. We proposed that ACP, KAS, and FATA in H. pluvialis may play an important role in FA synthesis and may be rate limiting genes, which probably could be modified for the further study of metabolic engineering to improve microalgal biofuel quality and production. © 2012 Lei et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Stack field testing at four municipal waste-to-energy (WTE) plants was conducted to investigate total number concentrations and size distributions in a size range extended towards the evaluation of ultrafine (UFP) and nanoparticle (NP) fractions with diameters smaller than 100nm and 50nm, respectively. Measurements were performed with a specifically designed sampling line, equipped with a dilution system and a particle counting device for measuring both primary particles in raw flue gases at stack conditions and the contributions of condensable origin, arising from their cooling and dilution immediately following stack release into the atmosphere. Average concentration levels detected ranged between 5×103-6×105cm-3: for all sampling conditions, ultrafine fractions largely prevailed in number size distributions, with average diameters constantly located in the nanoparticle size range. Stack concentrations appeared to be influenced by the design and process configuration of flue gas cleaning systems, with most significant effects related to the presence of wet scrubbing units and the baghouse operating temperature of dry removal processes. Chemical speciation (i.e., trace metals, anions and cations, carbonaceous compounds) of size-resolved particulate fractions was performed on one of the plants. NP and UFP composition was essentially in accordance with the most important fuel and combustion process characteristics: in particular, the presence of chlorides and metal species was consistent with the respective waste feed content and their expected behavior during combustion and flue gas cleaning processes. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Camelina (Camelina sativa L. Crantz) is a non-food oilseed crop which holds promise as an alternative biofuel energy resource. Its ability to grow in a variety of climatic and soil conditions and minimal requirements of agronomical inputs than other oilseed crops makes it economically viable for advanced biofuel production. We designed a study to investigate the effect of paclobutrazol [2RS, 3RS)-1-(4-Chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1- yl)pentan-3-ol] (PBZ), a popular plant growth regulator, on the seed and oil yield of Camelina sativa (cv. Celine). Results: A field-based micro-trial setup was established in a randomized block design and the study was performed twice within a span of five months (October 2010 to February 2011) and five different PBZ treatments (Control: T 0; 25 mg l -1: T 1; 50 mg l -1: T 2; 75 mg l -1: T 3; 100 mg l -1: T 4; 125 mg l -1: T 5) were applied (soil application) at the time of initiation of flowering. PBZ at 100 mg l -1 concentration (T 4) resulted in highest seed and oil yield by 80% and 15%, respectively. The seed yield increment was mainly due to enhanced number of siliques per plant when compared to control. The PBZ - treated plants displayed better photosynthetic leaf gas exchange characteristics, higher chlorophyll contents and possessed dark green leaves which were photosynthetically active for a longer period and facilitated higher photoassimilation. Conclusion: We report for the first time that application of optimized PBZ dose can be a potential strategy to achieve higher seed and oil yield from Camelina sativa that holds great promise as a biofuel crop in future. © 2012 Reddy et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - To investigate the effects of oxygenated biofuels on soot formation, oxidation, and distribution, a detailed comparative study using the forward illumination light extinction method was conducted in an optical constant volume combustion chamber. Various ambient temperatures (800 and 1000 K) and ambient oxygen concentrations (21, 16, and 10.5%) were investigated to mimic both conventional diesel combustion and low-temperature combustion conditions. Five oxygenated biofuels were used, including neat soybean biodiesel S100, neat butanol B100, and three alcohol-biodiesel blends that contained by volume 20% ethanol E20S80, 20% butanol B20S80, and 50% butanol B50S50. It is found that the composition of the biofuel has a larger effect on soot suppression efficiency at 800 K ambient temperature than that at 1000 K. Soot distribution is observed at larger distances from the injector, and less soot is located near the wall region with the additional oxygen content of biofuels at 21% ambient oxygen concentration. With a declining oxygen concentration, the soot concentration reduces at 800 K but increases at 1000 K. Soot formed in the spray jet region decreases at lower oxygen concentrations, and soot appears mainly near the wall region. Further, the soot distribution is more dispersed over a wider region at lower oxygen concentrations. B100 has shorter ignition delays at 10.5% oxygen concentration than B50S50 and S100 fuels, despite the fact that it has a lower cetane number. Therefore, the conventional correlation between ignition delay and cetane number does not hold for neat butanol at low oxygen concentrations. Soot concentrations are dramatically increased for soybean biodiesel from 800 to 1000 K at 10.5% oxygen, while such increases are not found for B50S50 and B100 fuels, indicating that proper choosing of the fuel will be very important to the high efficiency and clean low-temperature combustion. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Measurements of density, speed of sound, and viscosity have been carried out on liquid certified reference materials for biofuels as a function of temperature at ambient pressure. The samples included anhydrous and hydrated bioethanol and two biodiesel fuels from different feedstocks, soy and animal fat. The ethanol samples were measured from a maximum temperature of 60 to 5 °C (speed of sound) and to -10 °C (density and viscosity), respectively. The biodiesel samples were characterized from 100 °C (density and viscosity) and from 70 °C (speed of sound) to 10 °C (animal fat-based) and 5 °C (soy-based). Densities were measured with two vibrating-tube instruments of different accuracy. The speeds of sound were measured with a propagation-time method in an acoustic cell that was combined with one of the densimeters. Viscosities were measured with an open gravitational capillary viscometer and with a rotating concentric cylinder viscometer, according to Stabinger. The measurement results are reported with detailed uncertainty analyses. © 2012 by the American Chemical Society.

AB  - Activated sludge contains a microbial population responsible for the biological treatment of wastewater. This microbial population mostly consists of heterothrophic bacteria which utilize the organic content of the wastewater for growth, either as part of their cellular structures or as energy and carbon storage compounds. These compounds are mostly lipidic in nature and are or could be important raw materials for a multitude of applications in biofuel and oleochemical industries. In this study, a municipal activated sludge was analyzed for lipid storage compounds and other compound classes present in significant concentrations. Three extraction techniques, namely; Bligh & Dyer (applied on dried and partially dewatered samples) and accelerated solvent extractions, were initially investigated to identify the one resulting in the highest gravimetric and biodiesel yields. The highest yields were obtained using the Bligh & Dyer of partially dewatered sludge samples and thus, the extracts from this extraction technique were subjected to a series of analytical procedures such as precipitation, solid phase extraction, thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to characterize the major compound classes present. Results indicated that the major compounds in the samples were polyhydroxyalkanoates, wax esters, steryl esters, triacylglycerides, free fatty acids, free sterols and phospholipids. Hydrocarbons, diacylglycerides and monoacylglycerides were also detected. These compounds are either synthesized by microorganisms or from exogenous contributions. Regardless of the source of these compounds, their persistent presence in activated sludge offers another feedstock for a wide range of applications. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The conversion of palmitic and oleic acid as well as tall oil fatty acid was investigated in a fully continuous small scale fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) pilot plant. A conventional FCC zeolite catalyst was used. Experiments were performed in the range of 485-550°C. The highest gasoline yield of 44 wt.% was obtained from oleic acid at 550°C. Palmitic acid yielded the most cracking gas at 550°C with 43. 9 wt.%. The obtained gasoline was practically oxygen-free at high octane numbers. Oxygen contained in the feed was mainly converted to water and small amounts of CO2. Gasoline aromaticity clearly increased with temperature. The formation of high boiling products was enhanced by the number of C=C double bonds in the fatty acids. Large amounts of propene and ethene were formed which are valuable reactants for the polymer industry. The lower price of fatty acids in comparison with fresh vegetable oils makes them an interesting feedstock for the FCC process. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Introduction of biofuels in place of heating oils and biocomponents of heating oils is fraught with technological and technical difficulties. The final product - microemulsion bioliquid must have in its composition more appropriately selected emulsifiers package designed to maintain a constant characteristic HLB resistant to variation of bioliquid components. Final microemulsion bioliquid should be stable at a wide range of temperature, the certain period of time, and should be produced under conditions easy to apply in industry. The paper presents preliminary results focused on liquid waste from dairy industry using as microemulsion bioliquid component and an economic analysis of microemulsion bioliquids application in supplying of electricity to local grids accordingly to their needs.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable alternative diesel fuel made from vegetable oils and animal fats. The most common forms of biodiesel in the U.S. are fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) made from soybean oil, canola oil, used cooking oils, waste greases, and tallow. Cold-flow properties of biodiesel depend on the crystallization properties of high-melting FAME in the mixture. For soybean oil FAME, the saturated FAME (SFAME) species have melting points (MP) that are more than 45°C higher than the unsaturated FAME (UFAME) species. The present study evaluated the use of equations from freezing point depression theory to model crystallization onset temperatures (Tf) for binary mixtures of SFAME (MeC10 to MeC20) and UFAME (MeC18:1 and MeC18:2). Melting and crystallization properties were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) heating and cooling curve analyses. Results showed that the DSC scan rate did not significantly affect onset temperatures or peak enthalpies for analyses ofpure FAME. Hysteresis effects were observed for pure FAME where freezing points (FP) from DSC cooling curves were at slightly lower temperature than melting points (MP) from melting curves. For independent crystallization of SFAME from binary mixtures with UFAME, the effects of changes in heat capacity (ACp) as the mixture temperature decreased below the standard MP of the SFAME were negligible. Calculated Tf values were greater than FP from DSC analysis of mixtures, leading to the conclusion that binary SFAME/UFAME mixtures deviate from ideal solution behavior at low temperatures. © 2012 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - The paper discusses possibilities of increasing the performance parameters of a diesel engine and decreasing the emission of toxic compounds contained in exhaust gases by using preliminary catalytic treatment of biofuel, executed directly in the injector body. In order to enhance the impact of the catalyst on the flowing fuel the author proposes to utilize the phenomenon of turbulization in injector passages. The results of tests on a 359 type engine have shown an improvement of operational parameters and a decrease of toxic emission in exhaust gases.

AB  - Biofuels are environmental friendly and their utilization addresses global concerns about containment of carbon emissions. Biodiesel certification involves analysing these emissions for various biodiesel blends in order to certify &amp; recommend the new fuel to transport sector. Conducting the experiments for emission analysis is tedious and time consuming. Modeling the emissions operated for various biodiesel blends will help biodiesel manufacturers and certification authorities in analysing the possible pollutant levels. Artificial neural networks (ANN) can be used in modelling and prediction of biodiesel emissions operated under varying operating conditions. The objective of this research work is to design a neuro computing model to analyze the complex process of diesel engine emissions formation and estimate exhaust emissions operated with biodiesels under variable operating conditions. Experimental data of a single cylinder four stroke diesel engine run with various biodiesel blends has been used for training the network. During testing phase, emissions are predicted for new biodiesel &amp; its blends. ANN developed is based on radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN). Predictive ability of this neural network is analysed using statistical analysis. The developed model has shown improved coefficient of determination (CoD) values of 0.99, 0.99, 0.96, 0.98 and 0.95 for NO x, HC, CO, CO 2 and smoke emissions respectively. These results indicate that radial basis function neural networks are superior to the traditional back propagation algorithm based multi layer neural networks in terms of accuracy and efficiency performance. In this work, prediction &amp; emission modelling of diesel engine operated with different biodiesel blends under varying operating conditions is successfully demonstrated. Hence, RBFNN can be used as a powerful virtual sensing technology tool for prediction &amp; modelling of biodiesel emissions. © Indian Society for Education and Environment (iSee).

AB  - The microbial conversion of solid cellulosic biomass to liquid biofuels may provide a renewable energy source for transportation fuels. Endophytes represent a promising group of organisms, as they are a mostly untapped reservoir of metabolic diversity. They are often able to degrade cellulose, and they can produce an extraordinary diversity of metabolites. The filamentous fungal endophyte Ascocoryne sarcoides was shown to produce potential-biofuel metabolites when grown on a cellulose-based medium; however, the genetic pathways needed for this production are unknown and the lack of genetic tools makes traditional reverse genetics difficult. We present the genomic characterization of A. sarcoides and use transcriptomic and metabolomic data to describe the genes involved in cellulose degradation and to provide hypotheses for the biofuel production pathways. In total, almost 80 biosynthetic clusters were identified, including several previously found only in plants. Additionally, many transcriptionally active regions outside of genes showed condition-specific expression, offering more evidence for the role of long non-coding RNA in gene regulation. This is one of the highest quality fungal genomes and, to our knowledge, the only thoroughly annotated and transcriptionally profiled fungal endophyte genome currently available. The analyses and datasets contribute to the study of cellulose degradation and biofuel production and provide the genomic foundation for the study of a model endophyte system. © 2012 Gianoulis et al.

AB  - Sustainable economic and industrial growth requires safe, sustainable resources of energy. Biofuel is becoming increasingly important as an alternative fuel for the diesel engine. The use of non-edible vegetable oils for biofuel production is significant because of the increasing demand for edible oils as food. With the recent debate of food versus fuel, some non-edible oils like soapnut and Jatropha (Jatropha curcus. L) are being investigated as possible sources of biofuel. Recent research has focused on the application of heterogeneous catalysis. This review considers catalytic transesterification and the possibility of heterogeneous base catalysts. The process of transesterification, and the effect of parameters, mechanism and kinetics are reviewed. Although chromatography (GC and HPLC) are the analytical methods most often used for biofuel characterization, other techniques and some improvements to analytical methods are discussed.

Experiments were conducted to investigate pollen viability, . in vitro pollen germination and . in vivo pollen tube growth in the biofuel seed crop . Jatropha curcas. It was possible to distinguish between fresh and dead pollen using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC). Pollen germination was significantly higher in an agar-based medium composed of sucrose, boric acid and calcium nitrate compared with the control and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) treatments. Pollen from hermaphrodite flowers had lower viability, lower germination rates and shorter pollen tubes, with abnormal shapes, compared to the pollen from male flowers. Pollen tubes from both self- and cross-pollinated flowers entered the ovary within 8. h after pollination, thus confirming earlier reports of self-compatibility in this species. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many organizations are interested in biodiesel as a renewable, domestic energy source for use in transportation and heavy-duty equipment. Although numerous biodiesel emission studies exist, biodiesel exposure studies are nearly absent from the literature. This study compared the impact of petroleum diesel fuel and a B20 blend (20% soy-based biodiesel/80% petroleum diesel) on occupational and environmental exposures at a rural municipal facility in Keene, NH. For each fuel type, we measured concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), elemental carbon (EC), and organic carbon (OC) at multiple locations (in-cabin, work area, and near-field) at a materials recovery facility utilizing non-road equipment. B20 fuel use resulted in significant reductions in PM 2.5 mass (56-76%), reductions in EC (5-29%), and increases in OC (294-467%). Concentrations of PM 2.5 measured during petroleum diesel use were up to four times higher than PM 2.5 concentrations during B20 use. Further analysis of the EC and OC fractions of total carbon also indicated substantial differences between fuels. Our results demonstrate that biodiesel blends significantly reduced PM 2.5 exposure compared to petroleum diesel fuel in a workplace utilizing non-road construction-type equipment. While this suggests that biodiesel may reduce health risks associated with exposure to fine particulate matter mass, more exposure research is needed to better understand biodiesel-related changes in particulate matter composition and other exposure metrics. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The decomposition of vegetable and microalgal oils was herein analysed as a process of high interest for the production of both hydrogen and carbon, which potentially entails the advantage of attaining a negative CO 2 balance through carbon fixation. The feasibility of a series of oil decarbonization systems was evaluated by means of energy and CO 2 balances, which comprised not only the direct decarbonization process itself but also the cultivation and oil extraction stages. Three potential scenarios were assessed, embracing different options to meet the energy requirements of the systems. For each scenario, a wide range of case studies were evaluated, involving the use of rapeseed, sunflower, soybean, jatropha, Botryococcus braunii and Chlorella vulgaris oils as raw materials. Favourable energy and CO 2 balances were found for a variety of crops in different scenarios. In particular, jatropha oil from high seed yield crops and rapeseed oil from high seed yield and high oil content crops were identified as the most promising biomass feedstocks for oil decarbonization since they led to net hydrogen production as well as to negative balances of CO 2 emissions, therefore showing a carbon fixation effect. When compared to vegetable/microalgal oil transesterification to produce biodiesel, oil decomposition proved to be a more suitable alternative from a combined energy and environmental approach. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to identify the source and work practices that affect dermal exposure to polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) among hot-mix asphalt (HMA) paving workers. Methods: Four workers were recruited from each of three asphalt paving crews (12 workers) and were monitored for three consecutive days over 4 weeks for a total of 12 sampling days per worker (144 worker days). Two sampling weeks were conducted under standard conditions for dermal exposures. The third week included the substitution of biodiesel for diesel oil used to clean tools and equipment and the fourth week included dermal protection through the use of gloves, hat and neck cloth, clean pants, and long-sleeved shirts. Dermal exposure to PACs was quantified using two methods: a passive organic dermal (POD) sampler specifically developed for this study and a sunflower oil hand wash technique. Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate predictors of PAC exposures. Results: Dermal exposures measured under all conditions via POD and hand wash were low with most samples for each analyte being below the limit of the detection with the exception of phenanthrene and pyrene. The geometric mean (GM) concentrations of phenanthrene were 0.69 ng cm -2 on the polypropylene layer of the POD sampler and 1.37 ng cm -2 in the hand wash sample. The GM concentrations of pyrene were 0.30 ng cm -2 on the polypropylene layer of the POD sampler and 0.29 ng cm -2 in the hand wash sample. Both the biodiesel substitution and dermal protection scenarios were effective in reducing dermal exposures. Based on the results of multivariate linear mixed-effects models, increasing frequency of glove use was associated with significant (P &lt; 0.0001) reductions for hand wash and POD phenanthrene and pyrene concentrations; percent reductions ranged from 40 to 90%. Similar reductions in hand wash concentrations of phenanthrene (P = 0.01) and pyrene (P = 0.003) were observed when biodiesel was substituted for diesel oil as a cleaning agent, although reductions were not significant for the POD sampler data. Although task was not a predictor of dermal exposure, job site characteristics such as HMA application temperature, asphalt grade, and asphalt application rate (tons per hour) were found to significantly affect exposure. Predictive models suggest that the combined effect of substituting biodiesel for diesel oil as a cleaning agent, frequent glove use, and reducing the HMA application temperature from 149°C (300°F) to 127°C (260°F) may reduce dermal exposures by 76-86%, varying by analyte and assessment method. Conclusions: Promising strategies for reducing dermal exposure to PACs among asphalt paving workers include requiring the use of dermal coverage (e.g. wearing gloves and/or long sleeves), substituting biodiesel for diesel oil as a cleaning agent, and decreasing the HMA application temperature. © The Author 2011.

AB  - Objectives: We evaluated personal airborne exposures to polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) and total organic matter (TOM) among hot-mix asphalt (HMA) paving workers. The primary objectives of this study were to identify predictors of airborne PAC exposures, identify PAC exposure sources, and characterize how work practices may affect personal airborne exposure to PACs. Methods: Four workers were recruited from each of three asphalt paving crews (12 workers) and were monitored for three consecutive days over 4 weeks for a total of 12 sampling days per worker (144 worker-days). Three sampling weeks were conducted while maintaining standard working conditions with regard to airborne exposures. The fourth week included the substitution of biodiesel for diesel oil used to clean tools and equipment. Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate predictors of airborne exposures including weather parameters (air temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity), worksite conditions (HMA application temperature, work rate, asphalt grade, and biodiesel use), and personal factors (minutes sampled, minutes of downtime, and smoking status). Results: Concentrations of the 33 individual PACs measured in personal air samples were generally below detection limits under all conditions with the exception of fluorene [geometric mean (GM) = 65 ng m -3], naphthalene (GM = 833 ng m -3), phenanthrene (GM = 385 ng m -3), and pyrene (GM = 57 ng m -3). The summary measures of TOM (GM = 864 μg m -3) and four- to six-ring PAC (GM = 0.13 μg m -3) were detected in the majority of air samples. Although task was not a predictor of airborne exposures, job site characteristics such as HMA application temperature were found to significantly (P ≤ 0.001) affect summary and individual PAC exposures. Based on the results of multivariate linear mixed-effects models, substituting biodiesel for diesel oil as a cleaning agent was associated with significant (P ≤ 0.01) reductions in TOM, four- to six-ring PACs, and naphthalene and pyrene concentrations that ranged from 31 to 56%. Using multivariate linear mixed-effects models under standard conditions, reducing the application temperature of HMA from 149°C (300°F) to 127°C (260°F) could be expected to reduce airborne exposures by 42-82%, varying by analyte. Conclusions: Promising strategies for reducing airborne exposures to PACs among HMA paving workers include substituting biodiesel for diesel oil as a cleaning agent and decreasing the HMA application temperature. © The Author 2011.

AB  - Co-location of algae production facilities with cane sugar mills can be a technically advantageous path towards production of biodiesel. Algal biodiesel production was integrated with cane sugar production in the material and energy balance simulation program Sugars™. A model was developed that allowed comparison of production scenarios involving dewatering the algae to 20%ds (dry solids) or 30%ds prior to thermal drying. The net energy ratio, E R (energy produced/energy consumed) of the proposed process was found to be 1.5. A sensitivity analysis showed that this number ranged from 0.9 to 1.7 when the range of values for oil content, CO 2 utilization, oil conversion, and harvest density reported in the literature were evaluated. By utilizing available waste-resources from a 10,000ton/d cane sugar mill, a 530ha algae farm can produce 5.8millionLofbiodiesel/yr and reduce CO 2 emissions of the mill by 15% without the need for fossil fuels. © 2012.

AB  - In this study, biodiesel production from yellow horn (Xanthoceras sorbifolia Bunge.) seed oil using ion exchange resin as heterogeneous catalyst was investigated. After illustration of the mechanisms of transesterification reactions catalyzed by typical ion exchange resins, the factors affecting microwave-assisted transesterification process were studied. A high conversion yield of about 96% was achieved under optimal conditions using high alkaline anion exchange resins as catalyst. Analyzing the FAMEs composition by GC-MS and main physical-chemical properties demonstrated that the biodiesel product prepared from yellow horn seed oil was of high quality. Compared with conventional alkali catalyst, the outstanding characteristics of reusability and operational stability made the resin catalyst more predominant for biodiesel production. In addition, a comprehensive kinetic model was established for analyzing the reaction. The results of present research showed that microwave-assisted transesterification process catalyzed by high alkaline anion exchange resin was a green, effective and economic technology for biodiesel industry. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fossil fuel is the major source of energy for all forms of motor vehicle, with gasoline and diesel fuels dominating our personal transport. Although biofuels have been used to inject some renewable energy into the transport system, imports of oil and gas to Europe, the USA and Japan continue to rise. A move to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by driving more efficient vehicles is therefore necessary. This paper considers a shift to reduced friction hydrogen electric vehicles that give three major benefits: (i) sourcing hydrogen from low carbon sources like wind, biomass, nuclear and solar; (ii) using an electric drivetrain to minimize energy conversion to heat; and (iii) reducing resistances to motion to give lower energy requirements for traction. This energy dissipation due to friction proves to be a complex mixture of tyre losses, brake adhesion, wind resistance, fuel conversion inefficiency, motor resistance, drivetrain losses, auxiliary power consumption and so on. By considering the addition of many loss terms, it is shown that the energy dissipation in fuel cell-powered vehicles resolves into a linear function of vehicle weight. © The Author 2011.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. has recently drawn the attention of the international research community due to its potential as a biodiesel crop. In addition, it is very well adapted to arid and semiarid climate conditions. In this research, the effects of drought on growth, leaf water relation and organic solutes, leaf and root mineral concentration, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, leaf gas exchange and carbohydrate concentration were studied in seedlings of J. curcas to elucidate the physiological and morphological mechanisms related to their drought tolerance. Four-week-old seedlings were grown in growth chambers with five different water regimes corresponding to 100, 75, 50, 25, and 0% field capacity (FC) for four weeks. Seedlings, maintained a good water status regardless of the drought stress treatment because all water regimes affected the leaf relative water content, whereas the leaf water potential was only reduced in the water-stressed plants from the 0% and 25% FC treatments. Drought treatments reduced leaf, stem and root growth. However, the decrease in growth was higher in the aerial part of the plant than in the root, so that the root-to-shoot ratio in drought-stressed plants increased compared to that in the well-watered plants. Net assimilation of CO 2 (ACO2) and stomatal conductance (g s) decreased in all treatments, although ACO2 gradually declined as the water supply was decreased, while the reduction in stomatal conductance was similar in all drought stress treatments. Hence, we conclude that the strong control of transpirational water loss by reducing both stomatal conductance and biomass from aerial parts could be involved in the ability of this plant to resist drought conditions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Aims: The purpose of this study was to isolate new and potentially better polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)-producing bacteria, with a view to obtaining high yields from inexpensive substrates like glycerol, a major by-product of the biodiesel process. Methods and Results: Eleven new plant original isolates of the genus Massilia, a poorly studied lineage within the Betaproteobacteria, were isolated and characterized. Two isolates, 2C4 and 4D3c, could not be assigned to a validated Massilia species and probably represent new species. Six isolates were found to produce poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P3HB) when cultured with glucose or glycerol as carbon source. Isolate 4D6 accumulated up to 50 wt% of cell mass as polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) when grown on glycerol. Conclusions: The phyllosphere may be a good source of bacteria unrelated or weakly related to human/animal pathogens for screening for new PHA producers for industrial application. Isolate 4D6 was capable of accumulating particularly high levels of PHB from glycerol. Significance and Impact of the Study: With the increase in biodiesel production, which generates increasing amounts of glycerol as a by-product, there is a major interest in exploiting this compound as feedstock for the synthesis of interesting products, like biopolymers, such as PHA. The new Massilia sp. 4D6 isolate described in this study may be a useful candidate as a cell factory for the industrial production of PHA from glycerol. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - This paper provides an updated review on fast pyrolysis of biomass for production of a liquid usually referred to as bio-oil. The technology of fast pyrolysis is described including the major reaction systems. The primary liquid product is characterised by reference to the many properties that impact on its use. These properties have caused increasingly extensive research to be undertaken to address properties that need modification and this area is reviewed in terms of physical, catalytic and chemical upgrading. Of particular note is the increasing diversity of methods and catalysts and particularly the complexity and sophistication of multi-functional catalyst systems. It is also important to see more companies involved in this technology area and increased take-up of evolving upgrading processes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Evaluation of . Jatropha curcas germplasm comprising seven accessions indicated a wide range of variability in vegetative growth and other qualitative attributes. These characteristics could be harnessed in future improvement programme of . Jatropha curcas. Seed yield/plant had a positive and significant correlation with number of branches/plant, oil yield, plant spread (. r=. 0.806, 0.802, 0.782), plant spread had a highest correlation with plant height (. r=. 0.840). The seeds analyzed for proximate composition, fatty acid and physiochemical characteristics revealed that fiber and ash content in seed flour were high (16.5% and 4.35%). Oil content varied from 24.5% to 37.9%. The lower value of the viscosity suggests it as diesel oil. Accession JC006 could be an alternative source of linoleic acid (51%) while the accession JC001 could be a source for oleic acid (48%) and linoleic acid 42.4%. Stearic acid was highest in accession JC003 (42.9%).This evaluation has helped to identify cultivar with specific yield and vegetative growth features. Among all the seven accession evaluated accession JC007 is found to be promising which could be taken as productive genotype for commercial exploitation. © 2011.

AB  - Catalytic hydroprocessing is an effective technology with various applications in the petrochemical industry that are lately expanding in the area of biofuels production. The selection of a hydroprocessing catalyst is a critical step defining the hydrotreating products' yields and their corresponding quality as well as the expected run-length of the process. This work involves the process of selecting a suitable hydroprocessing catalyst for the conversion of waste cooking oil into biofuels. In particular three commercial catalysts are evaluated: a hydrotreating catalyst, a mild-hydrocracking catalyst and a severe hydrocracking catalyst. The catalyst effectiveness was assessed over a temperature range suggested by the catalyst manufacturers, covering a temperature range of 330-390 °C, under constant LHSV (1 h -1) and a range of pressure 8.27-13.79 MPa. Several parameters were considered for evaluating the effect of temperature including product yields, conversion, selectivity (diesel and gasoline), heteroatom removal (sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen) and saturation of double bonds. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - According to the theory of "hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB)" and the emulsification principle, the emulsification performance and stability of ethanol-diesel blends were studied with single and mixed emulsifiers and the effects of temperature on emulsification properties were analyzed. A novel mixed emulsifier, named "CLZ", was developed based on biofuel and castor oil and the effects of the ethanol-diesel blends with CLZ were investigated on the performance and emission characteristics of a diesel engine. The results indicated that with a CLZ-type emulsifier the ethanol-diesel blend E10 can keep its physical stability at a wide range of temperatures. The use of ethanol-diesel blends with a CLZ improved the break thermal efficiency and reduced the equivalent brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC). The smoke emission was reduced significantly and the NOx emission decreased slightly, while the THC emission increased. The CO emissions increased at light loads and decreased at heavy loads. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The raw material supply bottleneck is one of the obstacles currently facing the development of China's biodiesel industry. The main objective of this paper is to analyse the demands, possibilities, difficulties and suggestions surrounding the participation of restaurant enterprises in the biodiesel supply chain. Based on an analysis of the overall situation of China's biodiesel supply chain, the authors designed a structured questionnaire to survey 246 restaurant enterprises in Nanjing. The questionnaire mainly included basic aspects of restaurant enterprises, disposal of waste cooking oil (WCO), awareness and attitudes towards WCO recycling, understanding and opinion of biodiesel, and willingness and requirements for participating in the production of biodiesel. Factor analysis was then conducted on the motives of industrial restaurant enterprises for disposing of or recycling their WCO, and cluster analysis was used to classify the 246 restaurant enterprises into three clusters. Finally, the authors suggested ways to promote the development of Nanjing's biodiesel supply chain. The significant findings obtained in this paper will help to encourage restaurant enterprises to become suppliers of biodiesel production and promote the healthy development of the biodiesel industry in China. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The need for biodiesel feedstocks growing on non-arable lands is widely recognized. We present results of the synthesis and characterization of new biodiesels we produced from oils of highbush cranberry, dotted horsemint, and American hazelnut growing in Northern Wisconsin. These biodiesels, particularly those derived from highbush cranberry, exhibited remarkably good low-temperature properties, a condition that is crucial for wider usage of any biodiesel in cold climates. We also present the results on determination of the oxidative stability of the above biodiesels and discuss the growing conditions and habitats of the related plants. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work describes the mechanical and solvent extraction of Sterculia striata seed oil. It was determined that the seeds contain up to 41% in oil, which has an unusual composition. Indeed, up to 50% of the fatty acid contain cyclopropenoid ring. The oil was used as raw material to produce bio-oil and biodiesel and their physical-chemical properties were evaluated. Some of the studied physical-chemical properties of the S. striata biodiesel are in acceptable range for use as biodiesel in diesel engines, showing a promising economic exploitation of this raw material in semi-arid regions. It was also observed that the cyclopropenoid ring remains after transesterification and is decomposed during pyrolysis. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many research reported vegetable oil as a potential substitute for diesel engines with its ester form known as biodiesel. The biodiesel can be prepared by different process using vegetable oil and alcohol. The common process used for biodiesel preparation is known as transesterification. This paper presents the transesterification of Sal oil (Shorea robusta) into Sal oil methyl ester (SOME) and its performance in direct injection diesel engine. Several process parameters such as catalyst quantity, molar ratio of alcohol, reaction temperature and reaction time were studied and the optimized process conditions are amount of catalyst (NaOH) - 0.25wt%, alcohol (methanol) - 150% excess, reaction temperature - 65°C and reaction time - 1.5h. The studies with SOME as fuel in the direct injection diesel engine shows that the exhaust emissions such as CO, HC and NO x are reduced by 25%, 45% and 12%, respectively compared to diesel without significant difference in thermal efficiency. Based on this study it is concluded that the SOME can be used as fuel without any modifications in the engine and hence this biodiesel can be a potential substitute to standard diesel fuel. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The high viscosity of vegetable oil can be reduced by transesterification with alcohols and converting it into biodiesel. Biodiesel can be used neat or blended with diesel as engine fuel. This study demonstrates that esters of castor oils have a higher viscosity than safflower oil derived esters and the viscosity can be reduced by blending with diesel. The viscosity increased in a non-linear fashion as the percentage of castor esters increased in castor esters diesel blends and in castor esters safflower esters blends. Only slight increases in viscosity were observed for B40 and B60 mixtures with No. 2 diesel. Addition of ten chemical additives in castor esters at the rate of 0.01%, 0.1% and 1.0% showed limited viscosity reduction. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although Italy is one of the most important exporters of furniture in Europe, it is also a great importer of foreign timber. We decided to focus our study on Walnut tree (Juglans regia L.) as it can be considered one of the most important species for high quality timber production in Italy. Our goal is to examine the production of high quality timber deriving from a dedicated walnut tree plantation with the intent of evaluating the environmental impact from the LCA prospective (ISO 14040). The functional unit adopted here was 1 m 3 of dry solid under bark wood (u = 12%). Tillage and N-based fertilisers had the heaviest environmental impact, respectively through diesel consumption and a high NH 3 volatilization rate. The emissions produced by urea may be reduced by switching to other N-fertilisers with a lower NH 3 volatilization rate, or by choosing biofuels that can also represent an alternative to traditional diesel. Plant protection systems against animals such as metallic fences represent an unexpected hot spot because of the steel production and galvanizing processes related to them. Biodegradable protection systems might be adopted instead of metallic fences, even though this choice depends on the size of the animals. When considering the lack of data in industrial tree plantations literature with regard to the production of high quality wood, the present LCA study can be considered a useful tool in providing a deeper understanding of the key environmental impact issues related to high quality timber production. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With increased emphasis for diesel substitution, production of brown mustard (Brassica juncea), canola (Brassica napus) and camelina (Camelina sativa) used as biodiesels may increase in the High Plains. Since these are new crops to this region, understanding their growth is critical for their acceptance. The objective was to elucidate the growth pattern of these crops when spring-planted in western Nebraska. Field trials were conducted in 2005, 2006 and 2007 with early May planting. Plots were seeded 2cm deep at 200plantsm -2. Four plants were destructively sampled at about 28, 40, 53, 61, and 82 days after planting (DAP). Canopy growth was field measured. Canopy heights peaked by 61DAP at 95, 85 and 70cm for brown mustard, canola and camelina, respectively. Stem length increased to 82DAP at the rates of 1.24, 1.22 and 0.85cm/d for brown mustard, canola and camelina, respectively. Root weight accumulated linearly from 28 to 61DAP. The Brassica grew roots faster and achieved higher weights than camelina. From 28 to 40DAP, vine fresh weight accumulated rapidly for these crops, leveled and then gradually declined as leaves desiccated. Vine dry weight increased to 61DAP and then plateaued. The maximum vine dry weights, reached at 61DAP, were 4.3, 4.5 and 3.0g/plant for brown mustard, canola and camelina, respectively. By 61DAP, pods were present and accumulated dry matter while leaves senesced. Pod fresh weight reached its peak at 61DAP while its dry weight increased linearly to 82DAP at rates of 0.36, 0.24 and 0.096g/d for brown mustard, canola and camelina, respectively. Harvest in 2006 showed no significant (p&lt;0.05) difference between crops with a mean yield of about 1500kgha -1. Fatty acid composition was dramatically different between the crops as previously reported. The growth patterns of these crops indicated that all three would be suitable for production in the northern High Plains. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Residual (raw) glycerol originated from biodiesel synthesis is becoming of great environmental and economical concern due to its ever-growing surplus. In the present study, several bacterial strains were isolated and characterized for their ability to convert this raw glycerol into 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) and ethanol. The best producers of both 1,3-PD and ethanol were identified by 16S rDNA sequences to be Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pantoea agglomerans strains. Batch bioreactor cultivations under anaerobic and aerobic conditions were carried out in order to access the kinetics of glycerol consumption and product formation. Results showed that one isolated, K. pneumoniae BLh-1, was able to simultaneously produce up to 9.4 g/L of 1,3-PD with yields of 0.41 mol product mol-1 glycerol, and 6.1 g/L of ethanol with yields of 0.14 mol product mol-1 glycerol under anaerobic conditions, showing great potential for bioprocesses. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Farming operations in Africa have, in general, not adopted small-scale biodiesel production technology well for on-farm fuel usage. This is mainly due to the lack of an acceptable method to assess the economic feasibility of constructing small-scale biodiesel production facilities, and the impact of such operations on existing farming production processes. The research study summarised in this paper subsequently set out to develop a model, termed the Biodiesel Production System Optimisation Model (BPSOM), which predicts the cost of producing biodiesel on a small-scale, and optimises on-farm production processes to maximise profits. The model was validated using a South African case study to evaluate the predicted cost of biodiesel per litre produced, and the economic impact of a small-scale facility on the production profits of a farm. A proxy indicator, profit per hectare cultivated land, is introduced to measure the impact. BPSOM predicts a positive profit increase of 33% for the specific farm case study, which proves the economic potential of small-scale biodiesel production facilities for fuel usage at farm level in Africa. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Step Potential for Equilibria and Dynamics (SPEAD) model, which is a combination of discontinuous molecular dynamics simulation and thermodynamic perturbation theory, has been used to study the thermodynamic equilibrium properties of potential biofuel blending compounds. Step potentials and site sizes for predicting vapor pressures and liquid densities of secondary alcohols, esters, and cyclic ethers have been optimized. Fifty two (52) compounds were simulated for either parametrization or bench-marking. Twelve (12) new groups are parametrized in this work, which are present in secondary alcohols, esters, cyclic C5 compounds, and cyclic ethers. Errors in predicted vapor pressures are generally in the range of 10%, except in the case of multifunctional cyclic compounds, where errors of 30%-70% were found. Also, bubble points are measured for a mixture of 4-hydroxymethyl-1,3-dioxolane and 5-hydroxy-1,3-dioxane, which are superimposed on the literature data and do not suggest a significant difference in the vapor pressures of the two compounds. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The branched C 5 alcohol isopentanol (3-methylbutan-1-ol) has shown promise as a potential biofuel both because of new advanced biochemical routes for its production and because of its combustion characteristics, in particular as a fuel for homogeneous-charge compression ignition (HCCI) or related strategies. In the present work, the fundamental autoignition chemistry of isopentanol is investigated by using the technique of pulsed-photolytic Cl-initiated oxidation and by analyzing the reacting mixture by time-resolved tunable synchrotron photoionization mass spectrometry in low-pressure (8 Torr) experiments in the 550-750 K temperature range. The mass-spectrometric experiments reveal a rich chemistry for the initial steps of isopentanol oxidation and give new insight into the low-temperature oxidation mechanism of medium-chain alcohols. Formation of isopentanal (3-methylbutanal) and unsaturated alcohols (including enols) associated with HO 2 production was observed. Cyclic ether channels are not observed, although such channels dominate OH formation in alkane oxidation. Rather, products are observed that correspond to formation of OH via β-C-C bond fission pathways of QOOH species derived from β- and γ-hydroxyisopentylperoxy (RO 2) radicals. In these pathways, internal hydrogen abstraction in the RO 2 QOOH isomerization reaction takes place from either the -OH group or the C-H bond in α-position to the -OH group. These pathways should be broadly characteristic for longer-chain alcohol oxidation. Isomer-resolved branching ratios are deduced, showing evolution of the main products from 550 to 750 K, which can be qualitatively explained by the dominance of RO 2 chemistry at lower temperature and hydroxyisopentyl decomposition at higher temperature. © 2012 The Owner Societies.

AB  - This work evaluates the use of near-infrared (NIR) overtone regions to determine biodiesel content, as well potential adulteration with vegetable oil, in diesel/biodiesel blends. For this purpose, NIR spectra (12,000-6300cm -1) were obtained using three different optical path lengths: 10mm, 20mm and 50mm. Two strategies of regression with variable selection were evaluated: partial least squares (PLS) with significant regression coefficients selected by Jack-Knife algorithm (PLS/JK) and multiple linear regression (MLR) with wavenumber selection by successive projections algorithm (MLR/SPA). For comparison, the results obtained by using PLS full-spectrum models are also presented. In addition, the performance of models using NIR (1.0mm optical path length, 9000-4000cm -1) and MIR (UATR - universal attenuated total reflectance, 4000-650cm -1) spectral regions was also investigated. The results demonstrated the potential of overtone regions with MLR/SPA regression strategy to determine biodiesel content in diesel/biodiesel blends, considering the possible presence of raw oil as a contaminant. This strategy is simple, fast and uses a fewer number of spectral variables. Considering this, the overtone regions can be useful to develop low cost instruments for quality control of diesel/biodiesel blends, considering the lower cost of optical components for this spectral region. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The problems of global warming and the unstable price of petroleum oils have led to a race to develop environmentally friendly biofuels, such as palm oil or ethanol derived from corn and sugar cane. Biofuels are a potential replacement for fossil fuel, since they are renewable and environmentally friendly. This paper evaluates the combustion performance and emission characteristics of Refined, Bleached, and Deodorized Palm Oil (RBDPO)/diesel blends B5, B10, B15, B20, and B25 by volume, using an industrial oil burner with and without secondary air. Wall temperature profiles along the combustion chamber axis were measured using a series of thermocouples fitted axially on the combustion chamber wall, and emissions released were measured using a gas analyzer. The results show that RBDPO blend B25 produced the maximum emission reduction of 56.9% of CO, 74.7% of NOx, 68.5% of SO 2, and 77.5% of UHC compared to petroleum diesel, while air staging (secondary air) in most cases reduces the emissions further. However, increasing concentrations of RBDPO in the blends also reduced the energy released from the combustion. The maximum wall temperature reduction was 62.7% for B25 at the exit of the combustion chamber. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The current legislation requires the mandatory addition of biodiesel to all Brazilian road diesel oil A (pure diesel) marketed in the country and bans the addition of vegetable oils for this type of diesel. However, cases of irregular addition of vegetable oils directly to the diesel oil may occur, mainly due to the lower cost of these raw materials compared to the final product, biodiesel. In Brazil, the situation is even more critical once the country is one of the largest producers of oleaginous products in the world, especially soybean, and also it has an extensive road network dependent on diesel. Therefore, alternatives to control the quality of diesel have become increasingly necessary. This study proposes an analytical methodology for quality control of diesel with intention to identify and determine adulterations of oils and even fats of vegetable origin. This methodology is based on detection, identification and quantification of triacylglycerols on diesel (main constituents of vegetable oils and fats) by high performance liquid chromatography in reversed phase with UV detection at 205. nm associated with multivariate methods. Six different types of oils and fats were studied (soybean, frying oil, corn, cotton, palm oil and babassu) and two methods were developed for data analysis. The first one, based on principal component analysis (PCA), nearest neighbor classification (KNN) and univariate regression, was used for samples adulterated with a single type of oil or fat. In the second method, partial least square regression (PLS) was used for the cases where the adulterants were mixtures of up to three types of oils or fats. In the first method, the techniques of PCA and KNN were correctly classified as 17 out of 18 validation samples on the type of oil or fat present. The concentrations estimated for adulterants showed good agreement with the reference values, with mean errors of prediction (RMSEP) ranging between 0.10 and 0.22% (v/v). The PLS method was efficient in the quantification of mixtures of up to three types of oils and fats, with RMSEP being obtained between 0.08 and 0.27% (v/v), mean precision between 0.07 and 0.32% (v/v) and minimum detectable concentration between 0.23 and 0.81% (v/v) depending on the type of oil or fat in the mixture determined. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Renewable forms of energy, such as biofuels, have the potential to displace fossil fuels in a wide variety of applications. Further benefit can be achieved through the use of combined heat and power devices, as this is accompanied with a considerable increase in energy efficiency and lower costs associated with fuel consumption. In this study, we examined the performance of a residential microcogeneration system based on a Stirling engine and fueled by diesel and ethanol. Run on diesel, and on a lower heating value basis, the system achieved a power efficiency of 12.1%, a thermal efficiency of 73.3%, and a total efficiency of 85.4%. Powered by ethanol, the corresponding efficiencies were 11.8%, 73.9%, and 85.7%, respectively. During steady state operation, the total unburned hydrocarbon emissions for both fuels were negligible, while the particulate emissions for ethanol and diesel were found to be 0.40 mg/kWh and 0.42 mg/kWh, respectively. Emissions were extremely low, as the combustor features a continuous premixed flame that facilitates the complete burnout of already evaporated fuel. Though emissions of nitrogen dioxide, methane, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde were also negligible for both fuels, carbon monoxide and nitric oxide emissions for diesel (71 and 67 mg/m 3, respectively) were much higher than those observed for ethanol (50 and 19 mg/m 3, respectively). Lower nitric oxide emission levels for ethanol were attributed to its lower flame temperature, whereas reductions in carbon monoxide emissions were likely a result of a higher degree of fuel/air mixing with ethanol, due to higher gas jet velocities of the fuel exiting the orifices of the evaporator. Lastly, parametric studies on primary engine set points, including coolant temperature and exhaust temperature, were conducted to understand their effect on engine performance. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - We determined the fatty acid compositions of six species of freshwater microalgae belonging to the Chlorophyta, which were isolated from freshwater bodies in Assam, India. All six microalgae Desmodesmus sp. DRLMA7,. Desmodesmus elegans DRLMA13,. Scenedesmus sp. DRLMA5,. Scenedesmus sp. DRLMA9. Chlorella sp. DRLMA3 and. Chlorococcum macrostigmatum DRLMA12-showed similar fatty acid profiles 16:0, 16:4, 18:1, 18:2, and 18:3 as major components. We also compared fatty acid compositions during the late exponential and stationary growth phases of. D. elegans DRLMA13 and. Scenedesmus sp. DRLMA9 in BG11 medium. We observed enhanced percentages of total saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids with a concomitant decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acid content upon the prolonged cultivation of both microalgae. Distinct morphological features of microalgal isolates were determined by scanning electron microscopic (SEM) studies. An ornamented cell wall was found in D. elegans DRLMA13, which is characteristic of small spineless species of. Desmodesmus. The isolated microalgae were further distinguished through analysis of internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) secondary structures and compensatory base changes (CBCs). Analysis of CBCs showed the relatedness of. Chlorella sp. DRLMA3 with other Chlorella-like organisms, but it does not belong to the clade comprising. Chlorella sensu stricto, which includes. Chlorella vulgaris. The CBC count between. Scenedesmus sp. DRLMA9 and other species of. Scenedesmus provides evidence that this isolate represents a new species. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Accurate analytical methods are required to develop and evaluate the quality of new renewable transportation fuels and intermediate organic liquid products (OLPs). Unfortunately, existing methods developed for the detailed characterization of petroleum products, are not accurate for many of the OLPs generated from non-petroleum feedstocks. In this study, a method was developed and applied to the detailed characterization of complex OLPs formed during triacylglyceride (TG) pyrolysis which is the basis for generating one class of emerging biofuels. This method uses gas chromatography coupled simultaneously with flame ionization and mass spectrometry detectors (GC-FID/MS). The FID provided accurate quantification of carbonaceous species while MS enabled identification of unknown compounds. A programed temperature vaporizer using a 25°C, 0.1min, 720°Cmin -1, 350°C, 5min temperature program is employed which minimizes compound discrimination better than the more commonly utilized split/splitless injector, as verified with injections at 250 and 350°C. Two standard mixtures featuring over 150 components are used for accurate identification and a designed calibration standard accounts for compound discrimination at the injector and differing FID responses of various classes of compounds. This new method was used to identify and quantify over 250 species in OLPs generated from canola oil, soybean oil, and canola methyl ester (CME). In addition to hydrocarbons, the method was used to quantify polar (upon derivatization) and unidentified species, plus the unresolved complex mixture that has not typically been determined in previous studies. Repeatability of the analytical method was below 5% RSD for all individual components. Using this method, the mass balance was closed for samples derived from canola and soybean oil but only ca. 77wt% of the OLP generated from CME could be characterized. The ability to close the mass balance depended on sample origin, demonstrating the need for an accurate quantification method for biofuels at various stages of production. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To characterize a fuel's thermal and storage stability an understanding of the process of oxidation and oxidation pathways is essential. Oxidation pathways commence with hydroperoxides which quickly decompose to form a range of alcohols, acids and other oxygen-containing species. In the presence of significant levels of hydrocarbon-based matrix, analysis of these heteroatomic species is difficult. Applying multidimensional gas chromatography with very narrow heart-cut windows (0.20min) minimizes the number of compounds transferred to the second dimension ( 2D) column during each heart-cut. Successive heart-cuts every 2.00min are taken throughout the analytical run, since each heart-cut has a maximum retention on 2D of &lt;2.00min on the fast elution 2D column. Subsequent analyses involve incrementing or offsetting the heart-cut windows by 0.20min, so after 10 analyses, a complete coverage of the sample components can be obtained. On the polar 1D and non-polar 2D phase column arrangement, non-polar matrix compounds elute last on the 2D column, and this determines the largest 2t R; i.e. 2t R&lt;P M to ensure retained components on 2D will not overlap with subsequent heart-cuts. Heartcutting is supported by cryotrapping at the start of the 2D column in order to provide significantly better resolution. Good quality MS library match data generally demonstrate the high resolution separation of oxygenates achieved. Whilst 1D GC-MS was unsuccessful in identifying any of the oxygen-containing compounds reported here, good correlation of MS data (with average MS library similarity data) for acids (903), alcohols (909), ketones (941) and aldehydes (938) in the sample is obtained. The method requires ten sequential runs, and this can be accomplished automatically once the events table is set up. However if fewer target compounds are to be transferred, a reduced number of sequential runs can be implemented. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A comprehensive wastewater network is introduced into a thermochemical based process superstructure that will convert biomass, coal, and natural gas to liquid (CBGTL) transportation fuels. The mixed-integer nonlinear optimization (MINLP) model includes simultaneous heat, power, and water integration that utilizes heat engines to recover electricity from waste heat and several treatment units to process and recycle wastewater. A total of 108 case studies are analyzed which consist of combinations of six coal feedstocks, three biomass feedstocks, three plant capacities, and two process superstructures. This study discusses important process topological differences between the case studies and illustrates each component of the process synthesis framework using the two medium-sized capacity case studies that have low-volatile bituminous coal and biomass feedstocks. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The GC × GC solvation parameter model has been used to identify effective stationary phases for the separation of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from petroleum hydrocarbons. This simple mathematical model was used to screen the 1225 different combinations of 50 stationary phases. The most promising pairs combined a poly(methyltrifluoropropylsiloxane) stationary phase with a poly(dimethyldiphenylsiloxane) stationary phase. The theoretical results were experimentally tested by equipping a GC × GC instrument with a DB-210 primary stationary phase and an HP-50+ secondary stationary phase. This instrument was used to analyze trace levels of FAMEs in kerosene. The FAMEs were fully separated from the petroleum hydrocarbons on the secondary dimension of the 2-D chromatogram. The resulting GC × GC method was shown to be capable of accurately quantifying FAME levels as low as 2. ppm (w/w). These results demonstrate the utility of the solvation parameter model for identifying optimal stationary phases for high resolution GC × GC separations. Furthermore, this work presents an effective method for determining the level of biodiesel contamination in aviation fuel and other petroleum-based fuels. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Jet fuels currently in use in the aviation industry are exclusively kerosene-based. However, potential problems regarding security of supply, climate change, and increasing cost are becoming more significant, exacerbated by the rapidly growing demand from the aviation sector. Biofuels are considered one of the most suitable alternatives to petrochemical-based fuels in the aviation industry in the short to medium term, since blends of biofuel and kerosene provide a good balance of properties currently required from an aviation fuel. Experimental studies at a variety of stoichiometries using a flat flame burner with kerosene and kerosene/biofuel blends have been performed with product analysis by gas sampling and laser-induced fluorescence detection of OH, CO, and CO 2. These studies have been complemented by modeling using the PREMIX module of Chemkin to provide insights into and to validate combined models describing the oxidation chemistry of surrogate fuels depicting kerosene, fatty acid methyl ester biofuels, and Fischer-Tropsch derived fuels. Sensitivity analysis has identified important reactions within these schemes, which, where appropriate, have been investigated by molecular modeling techniques available within Gaussian 03. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - In the present paper, crude biodiesel prepared with sorbifolia oil as raw material by transesterification was purified by column chromatography, then the composition of biodiesel was analyzed by gas chromatography, FTIR, GC-MS and 1H NMR. Column chromatography can separate the crude biodiesel into two fractions: petroleum ether eluted fraction (A1) and methanol eluted fraction (A2). Petroleum ether eluted fraction was mainly biodiesel fraction, which was produced from sorbifolia oil by transesterification, including methyl linoleate, methyl cis-9-octadecenoate and so on; methanol eluted fraction was mainly glycerol fraction, which came from the side reaction of transesterification. The results show that the purity of refined biodiesel increased from 77.51% to 93.87%, and the product recovery rate reached up to 91.04% after the purification by column chromatography. The results obtained by FTIR and 1H NMR further showed that the column chromatography can effectively improve the purity of biodiesel. This paper provides a basis for industrialization of purification of biodiesel.

AB  - In an effort to identify a microbial lipase that can catalyze transesterification reactions used in biodiesel production, an organic solvent-tolerant lipase was purified from Streptomyces sp. CS268. The molecular weight of the purified lipase was estimated to be 37.5 kDa by SDSPAGE. The lipase showed highest activity at a temperature of 30°C and pH 8.0 while it was stable in the pH range 4.0 ∼ 9.0 and at temperatures ≤ 50°C. It showed the highest hydrolytic activity towards medium-length acyl chain pnitrophenyl decanoate with Km and Vmax values of 0.59 mM and 319.5 mmol/mg/min, respectively. Also, the lipase showed non-position specificity for triolein ydrolysis. The purified lipase catalyzed transesterification reaction of soybean oil with methanol, suggesting that it can be apotential enzymatic catalyst for biodiesel production. © 2012 The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer.

AB  - This article examines biodiesel production from nonedible oil extracted from Thespesia populnea L. plant seeds. The effects of catalyst concentration, time, water content, and temperature on transesterification were studied to get large yield of fatty acid methyl ester (biodiesel) of the Thespesia populnea L. oil. It was found that the yield of biodiesel made from the Thespesia populnea L. oil under various conditions was found 50%-92%. Biodiesel produced from this nonedible oil was tested on a diesel engine to study the effect of biodiesel fatty acid composition on the engine exhaust emission. The smoke, HC, CO, and NO x emissions for B50 blend of this biodiesel at different loads, i.e., 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%, were found higher or comparable with diesel fuel. Nonedible oils can prove viable alternatives to edible oils for biodiesel production. From the environmental point of view, biodiesel is superior fuel than fossil fuel. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biodiesel, as one of the most promising alternative fuels, has received more attention because of limited fossil fuels. A comparison of biodiesel and petroleum diesel fuel is discussed as regards engine unregulated exhaust emissions. A diesel fuel, a pure biodiesel fuel, and fuel with 20% V/V biodiesel blend ratio were tested without engine modification. The present study examines six typical unregulated emissions by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) method: formaldehyde (HCHO), acetaldehyde (C 2H 4O), acetone (C 3H 6O), toluene (C 7H 8), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and carbon dioxide (CO 2). The results show addition of biodiesel fuel increases the formaldehyde emission, and B20 fuel has little change, but the formaldehyde emission of pure biodiesel shows a clear trend of addition. Compared with the pure diesel fuel, the acetaldehyde of B20 fuel has a distinct decrease, and the acetaldehyde emission of pure biodiesel is lower than that of the pure diesel fuel at low and middle engine loads, but higher at high engine load. The acetone emission is very low, and increases for B20 and pure biodiesel fuels as compared to diesel fuel. Compared with the diesel fuel, the toluene and sulfur dioxide values of the engine show a distinct decrease with biodiesel blend ratio increasing. It is clear that the biodiesel could reduce aromatic compounds and emissions of diesel engines. The carbon dioxide emission of pure biodiesel has a little lower value than diesel, showing that the biodiesel benefits control of greenhouse gas.

AB  - An endophytic Hypoxylon sp. (strain CI-4) producing a wide spectrum of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including 1,8-cineole, 1-methyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene and cyclohexane, 1,2,4-tris(methylene), was selected as a candidate for the modulation of VOC production. This was done in order to learn if the production of these and other VOCs can be affected by using agents that may modulate the epigenetics of the fungus. Many of the VOCs made by this organism are of interest because of their high energy densities and thus the potential they might have as Mycodiesel fuels. Strain CI-4 was exposed to the epigenetic modulators suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, a histone deacetylase) and 5-azacytidine (AZA, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor). After these treatments the organism displayed striking cultural changes, including variations in pigmentation, growth rates and odour, in addition to significant differences in the bioactivities of the VOCs. The resulting variants were designated CI4-B, CI4-AZA and CI4-SAHA. GC/MS analyses of the VOCs produced by the variants showed considerable variation, with the emergence of several compounds not previously observed in the wild-type, particularly an array of tentatively identified terpenes such as α-thujene, sabinene, γ-terpinene, α-terpinolene and β-selinene, in addition to several primary and secondary alkanes, alkenes, organic acids and derivatives of benzene. Proton transfer reaction mass spectroscopic analyses showed a marked increase in the ratio of ethanol (mass 47) to the total mass of all other ionizable VOCs, from ~0.6 in the untreated strain CI-4 to ~0.8 in CI-4 grown in the presence of AZA. Strain CI4-B was created by exposure of the fungus to 100 μM SAHA; upon removal of the epigenetic modulator from the culture medium, it did not revert to the wild-type phenotype. Results of this study have implications for understanding why there may be a wide range of VOCs found in various isolates of this fungus in nature. ©2012 SGM Printed in Great Britain.

AB  - The water-soluble-fractions (WSF) from biodiesel and biodiesel/diesel blends were compared to diesel in their sub-lethal toxicity to microalgae. Chemical analyses of aromatics, non-aromatics hydrocarbons and methanol were carried out in the WSF, the former showing positive correlation with increasing diesel concentrations (B100 < B5 < B3 < B2 < D). Biodiesel interacted with the aqueous matrix, generating methanol, which showed lower toxicity than the diesel contaminants in blends. The WSF caused 50% culture growth inhibition (IC50-96 h) at concentrations varying from 2.3 to 85.6%, depending on the tested fuels and species. However, the same species sensitivity trend (S. costatum > N. oculata > T.chuii > P. subcapitata) was observed for all the tested fuels. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The aim of this study was to optimize a biotechnological process for the production of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) based on low-quality crude glycerol derived from biodiesel production. Clostridium butyricum AKR102a was used in fed-batch fermentations in 1-L and 200-L scale. The newly discovered strain is characterized by rapid growth, high product tolerance, and the ability to use crude glycerol at the lowest purity directly gained from a biodiesel plant side stream. Using pure glycerol, the strain AKR102 reached 93.7 g/L 1,3-PD with an overall productivity of 3.3 g/(L*h). With crude glycerol under the same conditions, 76.2 g/L 1,3-PD was produced with a productivity of 2.3 g/(L*h). These are among the best results published so far for natural producers. The scale up to 200 L was possible. Due to the simpler process design, only 61.5 g/L 1,3-PD could be reached with a productivity of 2.1 g/(L*h). © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The ability of bacterial strains to assimilate glycerol derived from biodiesel facilities to produce metabolic compounds of importance for the food, textile and chemical industry, such as 1,3-propanediol (PD), 2,3-butanediol (BD) and ethanol (EtOH), was assessed. The screening of 84 bacterial strains was performed using glycerol as carbon source. After initial trials, 12 strains were identified capable of consuming raw glycerol under anaerobic conditions, whereas 5 strains consumed glycerol under aerobiosis. A plethora of metabolic compounds was synthesized; in anaerobic batch-bioreactor cultures PD in quantities up to 11.3g/L was produced by Clostridium butyricum NRRL B-23495, while the respective value was 10.1g/L for a newly isolated Citrobacter freundii. Adaptation of Cl. butyricum at higher initial glycerol concentration resulted in a PD max concentration of ~32g/L. BD was produced by a new Enterobacter aerogenes isolate in shake-flask experiments, under fully aerobic conditions, with a maximum concentration of ~22g/L which was achieved at an initial glycerol quantity of 55g/L. A new Klebsiella oxytoca isolate converted waste glycerol into mixtures of PD, BD and EtOH at various ratios. Finally, another new C. freundii isolate converted waste glycerol into EtOH in anaerobic batch-bioreactor cultures with constant pH, achieving a final EtOH concentration of 14.5g/L, a conversion yield of 0.45g/g and a volumetric productivity of ~0.7g/L/h. As a conclusion, the current study confirmed the utilization of biodiesel-derived raw glycerol as an appropriate substrate for the production of PD, BD and EtOH by several newly isolated bacterial strains under different experimental conditions. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

AB  - Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fluorescence primers were used to characterize the genetic variation among 63 populations of Jatropha curcas from 10 countries in Asia, Africa and Mexico grown in provenance trials in China and Vietnam. Four primer combinations were used to generate a total of 89 bands of which 87 were polymorphic. Total genetic diversity (Ht) was low (0.15). AMOVA partitioned 31% of variability among populations and 69% within populations. Gene flow (Nm) was found to be low, 0.44, suggesting limited gene exchange among populations. Polymorphic loci (Np=16), the percentage of polymorphic loci (Pp=18%), Nei's diversity index (H=0.07) and Shannon's information index (I=0.10) all indicated low genetic diversity among populations. The populations from Mexico were exceptional as they all displayed high genetic diversity. The UPGMA-based dendrogram, with corroborative indications from Principal Coordinates Analysis, divided the populations into 4 major clusters. Subpopulations from a wide geographic range within India formed a major cluster suggesting a common origin for these subpopulations; the same was indicated for many of the Chinese subpopulations. Material from a wide range of countries in Southeast Asia and accessions from Africa formed another cluster. The Mexican populations formed a fourth, separate group, relatively distant from the other three clusters, indicating that the Asian material probably does not originate from Mexico. Despite generally low genetic diversity of cultivated Jatropha curcas in Asia, this study identified 6 Asian populations with genetic diversity considerably higher than overall population mean. Though the impact of inbreeding on jatropha fitness is not yet well-understood, it is probable that broadening the genetic base will benefit breeding programs in Asia, guarding against inbreeding depression and providing a range of material with the genetic diversity to adapt to a wide range of planting sites. Drawing from the more-diverse populations identified in Asia as well as from wild material originating in Mexico and other parts of the natural range would be a sound strategy when applied in concert with further research on the species' breeding system, quantitative trait variation and environmental plasticity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, we investigated the stability of a diesel-like fuel (DLF) produced by the pyrolysis of soybean oil. The soybean DLF was stored at room temperature over a period of six months in three different tanks. The tanks were made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and stainless steel 304, with and without an epoxy resin protection. Samples were collected at various times, and their physical-chemical parameters (viscosity, density, distillation curve, etc.) were obtained according to ASTM methods, as recommended for diesel fuel evaluation. Increases in the viscosity and density during storage were attributed to polymerisation reactions, which often lead to the formation of more viscous and dense materials. Additionally, gas chromatographic analyses showed a decrease in the content of light fractions during storage. The Rancimat method could not be applied to evaluate the oxidation stabilities for the samples. Instead, oxidation stabilities were evaluated by the consumption of O 2 at high pressures at 100°C in comparison to a soybean biodiesel sample. Although changes in the physical-chemical parameters occurred during storage, the majority of the results remained within the limits specified by the Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP) for diesel fuel. Overall, the results showed that the differences in the materials for the tanks used for DLF storage did not interfere with the biofuel parameters. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae are a potential source of biodiesel. The urgent need for an alternative and sustainable energy has created renewed interest to analyze the microalgae for biodiesel production. In this study, a dominant indigenous freshwater unicellular microalgal strain Chlorella sp., BUM11008, was examined for its efficiency towards biodiesel production. The organism was evaluated for ability to yield high of biomass and lipid productivity under normal and various nutrient-deprived conditions (nitrogen, phosphate-potassium, iron, and all three combined). Under normal conditions, after 20days of cultivation in Chu10 medium, the organism yielded a biomass of 2.58±0.07g/L, with lipid content of 312.16±2.38mg/g. In a two-phase culturing system upon nutrition deprivation, the organism was able to respond with different levels of lipid accumulation. Among the various post-harvest treatments, nitrogen deprivation yielded the highest lipid productivity of 53.96±0.63mg/Ld, followed by the combined deprivation condition (49.16±1.36mg/Ld). FAME profiles of the isolate were found to meet the requirements of international standards for biodiesel. The study leads to the conclusion that the two-phase culturing system with nitrogen starvation as post-harvest treatment would be suitable for gaining maximum biomass productivity, and lipid content of high quality fatty acids. Thus, it is proposed that Chlorella sp., BUM11008, would be a promising candidate for sustainable biodiesel production. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fuel properties are largely dependent on the fatty acid (FA) composition of the feedstock from which biodiesel is prepared. Consequently, FA profile was employed as a screening tool for selection of feedstocks high in monounsaturated FAs for further evaluation as biodiesel. Those feedstocks included ailanthus (Ailanthus altissima L.), anise (Pimpinella anisum L.), arugula (Eruca vesicaria L.), cress (Lepidium sativum L.), cumin (Cuminum cyminum L.), Indian cress (Tropaeolum majus L.), shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris L.) and upland cress (Barbarea verna (Mill.) Asch.). Other selection criteria included saturated FA content, iodine value (IV), content of FAs containing twenty or more carbons and content of trienoic FAs. Anise oil satisfied all selection criteria and was therefore selected for further investigation. Arugula, cumin and upland cress oils were selected as antagonists to the selection criteria. Preparation of FA methyl esters (FAMEs, ≥ 92wt % yield) following conventional alkaline-catalyzed methanolysis preceded fuel property determination. Of particular interest were oxidative stability and cold flow properties. Also measured were kinematic viscosity (40°C), IV, acid value, free and total glycerol content, sulfur and phosphorous content, cetane number, energy content and lubricity. FAMEs prepared from anise oil yielded properties compliant with biodiesel standards ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 whereas the antagonists failed at least one specification contained within the standards. As a result, FA profile was an efficient predictor of compliance with biodiesel standards and is therefore recommended as a screening tool for investigation of alternative feedstocks. © 2011.

AB  - This paper gives an insight of biofuel production and the status -into the co-products obtained from this industry. Furthermore this work explores the possibility of these co-products as raw materials for value-added uses in material applications. This is achieved by understanding composition, solid density, and moisture content of prominent co-products such as soy meal, DDGS (distillers' dried grains with solubles) and jatropha meal. Moisture content and density measurements showed no trend. Soy meal has the highest protein content, followed by jatropha and DDGS. Thermal stability of these co-products was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which revealed that the thermal stabilities are ranked as soy meal>DDGS>jatropha meal. FT-IR spectroscopy was used to understand the functional groups in these meals and it showed that the amide group was prominent in all of these meals. In pursuit of finding value-added uses for these co-products of biofuel industries, biodegradable polymer, i.e. polycaprolactone (PCL), based biocomposites were prepared by melt processing technique using extrusion followed by injection molding. Tensile, flexural and impact properties were evaluated. Also, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of fractured sections of the biocomposites was examined. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recently biodiesel is produced from refined/edible oils using methanol and alkaline catalyst. However, wide range of non-edible oils are available, the alkaline transesterification of these oils is difficult due the presence of large amount of free fatty acids (FFA). Hence these free fatty acids form soap with alkali, it is mandatory to reduce FFA present in non-edible oils. Acidic ion exchange resins can be used to decrease FFA level. In this study, activities of resins (Amberlite IR 120H, Amberjet 1200H) in direct esterification of FFA present in Karanja oil were examined; the acid value was reduced ≤2mg/KOH. The optimum conditions of esterification such as catalyst amount, methanol to oil ratio, and reaction time are chosen as 0.8% (w/w), 1:6 and 25min for Amberlite IR 120H and 1% (w/w), 1:6, and 25min for Amberjet 1200H. This pretreatment reduces the complexity of the process and the production cost of biodiesel by alkaline catalyzed transesterification. © 2011.

AB  - Jatropha, a non-edible oil seed yielding plant has been identified by the Government of India to produce biodiesel under National Biodiesel Mission. Failure of phase-I of National Biodiesel Mission and likely failure of phase-II requires critical analysis of policy frameworks related to its long term sustainability. Indian biofuel promotion policies like Biodiesel Purchase Policy and National Biofuel Policy have failed to yield any visible results. No tangible ground work is visible as of now to ensure success of various government plans and policies related to adoption of jatropha biodiesel. It is clearly evident that some serious bottlenecks are delaying the adoption of jatropha biodiesel. Present work identifies important policy bottlenecks like availability of land, non-remunerative pricing policy and state fear relating to loss of revenue in the case of zero duty regimes. This paper attempts to explore and critically analyze present policies and possible options taking into account the recent Indian experiences for successful adoption of jatropha biodiesel. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pinewood sawdust flash pyrolysis has been performed in continuous mode in a pilot plant provided with a conical spouted bed reactor, in the 400-600 °C range. The influence of temperature on the pyrolysis yields and product properties has been studied. Product analysis has been carried out on-line by means of chromatographic methods. High liquid yields have been achieved, with the maximum bio-oil yield (75 wt%) at 500 °C. Gas yield is very low at low temperatures and this fraction is mainly composed of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and small amounts of methane, hydrogen and C 2-C 4 hydrocarbons. Bio-oil has been characterized and its major compounds are phenols, specifically guaiacols at low temperatures and catechols at high temperatures. At 600 °C, there is an increase in light compounds due to the cracking reactions, but no aromatic compounds have been detected due to the low residence time of the volatiles in the reactor. The fuel properties of the bio-oil have been measured and the results indicate that it can be a potential substitute to conventional fuels, although its heating value should be improved by subjecting to further treatments. Char can be used as energy source or as active carbon. The char obtained at 600 °C has a high surface area and is suitable for active carbon production. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vegetable oils (in Europe particularly rapeseed) are the favoured raw material for production of methyl esters to be used as biodiesel. This paper discloses a possibility of their alternative utilization as crude oil substitute via vegetable oil steam cracking to produce short alkenes to be used in polyolefins production industry. During thermal decomposition under conditions matching those of gas-oil steam cracking (short residence time, temperature over 800 °C) vegetable oils form similar products as traditional crude-oil-based feedstocks. The yields of major pyrolysis products of various vegetable oils were determined using the apparatus employed previously to laboratory research of hydrocarbon pyrolysis and they were compared to yields obtained by cracking traditional feedstocks. Also the effects of hydrocarbon chain length and saturation of acyls forming the oils were analyzed in detail. The possibilities of processing vegetable oils by co-cracking in mixture with crude oil feedstocks are discussed and supported by experimental data. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - To extract meaningful information from complex kinetic models involving a large number of species and reactions, advanced computational techniques are required. In this work, new approaches have been proposed based on element flux calculations for systematic kinetic analysis of complex reaction models. These approaches quantify element transformation flux between species to determine a metric that accurately captures the production and consumption of species. Furthermore, a graph searching procedure is employed to retrieve all possible reaction pathways from the highly complex reaction networks. Element fluxes involved in these pathways provide an indicator to quantitatively evaluate pathway activities. Based on pathway activities, a novel approach is proposed to project the totality of the information contained in pathway weights onto a single scalar, reactivity status indicator, which enables a compact representation of local chemistry. The proposed approaches are illustrated with highly complex kinetic mechanisms describing oxidation of n-pentane, n-heptane, and a biodiesel surrogate methyl-butanoate. © 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Production of biodiesel from crude palm oil (CPO) with 6 wt% of free fatty acid (FFA) using a low-frequency ultrasonic irradiation (40 kHz) technique was investigated in the present work. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between various important parameters of the alkaline catalyzed transesterification process to obtain a high conversion to biodiesel. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to statistically analyze and optimize the operating parameters of the process. A central composite design (CCD) was adopted to study the effects of the methanol to oil molar ratio, the catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, and irradiation time on conversion to biodiesel. RESULTS: The result from the RSM analysis indicated that the methanol to oil molar ratio, catalyst concentration and irradiation time have the most significant effects on the conversion to biodiesel. Moreover, a coefficient of determination (R 2) value of 0.93 shows the fitness of a second-order model for the present study. Based on this second-order model, the optimum conditions for alkaline catalyzed transesterification of CPO were found to be a methanol to oil molar ratio of 6.44:1, catalyst concentration 1.25 wt%, reaction temperature 38.44 °C and irradiation time 25.96 min. At the calculated optimum condition, the conversion to biodiesel reached 97.85%. Under these same conditions, the experimental value was 98.02 ± 0.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The mathematical model developed has been proven to adequately describe the range of the experimental parameters studied and provide a statistically accurate prediction of the optimum conversion to biodiesel. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Waste frying oil was used to produce biodiesel using calcined snail shell as a heterogeneous base catalyst. Trans esterification reactions were carried out and the yield and conversion of the product were optimized by varying the methanol to oil molar ratio, catalyst amount, reaction temperature, and time. A biodiesel conversion of 99.58% was obtained with a yield of 87.28%. The reaction followed first order kinetics. The activation energy (E A) was 79kJ/mol and the frequency factor (A) was 2.98×10 10min -1. The fuel properties of the biodiesel were measured according to ASTM D 6751 and found to be within the specifications. Snail shell is a novel source for the production of heterogeneous base catalyst that can be successfully utilized for synthesis of biodiesel of high purity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Jatropha curcas seed is a rich source of oil; however, it can not be utilised for nutritional purposes due to presence of toxic and anti-nutritive compounds. The main objective of the present study was to quantify the toxic phytochemicals present in Indian J. curcas (oil, cake, bio-diesel and glycerol). Results: The amount of phorbol esters is greater in solvent extracted oil (2.8 g kg -1) than in expeller oil (2.1 g kg -1). Liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis of the purified compound from an active extract of oil confirmed the presence of phorbol esters. Similarly, the phorbol esters content is greater in solvent extracted cake (1.1 g kg -1) than in cake after being expelled (0.8 g kg -1). The phytate and trypsin inhibitory activity of the cake was found to be 98 g kg -1 and 8347 TIU g -1 of cake, respectively. Identification of curcin was achieved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the concentration of curcin was 0.95 g L -1 of crude concentrate obtained from cake. Conclusion: Higher amounts of phorbol esters are present in oil than cake but bio-diesel and glycerol are free of phorbol esters. The other anti-nutritional components such as trypsin inhibitors, phytates and curcin are present in cake, so the cake should be detoxified before being used for animal feed. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - The growth and lipid productivity of an isolated microalga Chlorella vulgaris ESP-31 were investigated under different media and cultivation conditions, including phototrophic growth (NaHCO 3 or CO 2, with light), heterotrophic growth (glucose, without light), photoheterotrophic growth (glucose, with light) and mixotrophic growth (glucose and CO 2, with light). C. vulgaris ESP-31 preferred to grow under phototrophic (CO 2), photoheterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions on nitrogen-rich medium (i.e., Basal medium and Modified Bristol's medium), reaching a biomass concentration of 2-5g/l. The growth on nitrogen-limiting MBL medium resulted in higher lipid accumulation (20-53%) but slower growth rate. Higher lipid content (40-53%) and higher lipid productivity (67-144mg/l/d) were obtained under mixotrophic cultivation with all the culture media used. The fatty acid composition of the microalgal lipid comprises over 60-68% of saturated fatty acids (i.e., palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0)) and monounsaturated acids (i.e., oleic acid (C18:1)). This lipid composition is suitable for biodiesel production. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha macrocarpa grows naturally in arid environments of the Dry Chaco, northwestern Argentina, where freezing winters make impossible the cultivation of other species of the genus Jatropha. This article is the first report of J. macrocarpa seed productivity aimed to quantify the reproductive performance and seed oil characteristics at different stages of fruit ripening. In addition, J. macrocarpa is evaluated as a new oil crop for biodiesel. Fruits from natural populations near La Rioja city were hand-harvested during the 2007/8 reproductive season and classified according to 7 fruit sizes, from the smallest fruits (G1) to the largest (G7 or mature). Total seed production averaged 87 ± 8 g plant-1 throughout the growing season. Explosive dehiscence of mature fruits produced 46% of total seed loss. Mature fruits produced individual seeds of 550 ± 7 mg with a medium-to-high seed oil concentration ranging from 36 to 40%, and biomass allocation to seeds was 36% of total fruit biomass. Fruits harvested early, at the G6 stage, were lighter and had a significantly less oil concentration. Main fatty acids in mature seeds included linoleic (50%), oleic (32%), palmitic (8.5%) and stearic (7%) acids. Biodiesel quality parameters indicated only slight differences for cetane number and iodine value with respect to European normative requirements. The acceptable oil content of J. macrocarpa shows promise to be used for biodiesel production. However, the low productivity per plant and the explosive fruit dehiscence need to be corrected substantially by breeding. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - For numerical simulations of the combustion of liquid fuels, a thoroughly validated and verified quantitative model for droplet evaporation is necessary. In this work a simple single droplet infinite conductivity model is simulated for low pressure (0.1 MPa) and various temperatures (550-1050 K) using a chosen property rule (see Eq. (7)) and five convection correlations (C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5, see (Table 1) to obtain the temporal evolution of droplet diameter squared, droplet surface temperature and average evaporation rates of vegetable oil derived biofuels - rapeseed methyl ester (RME) and sunflower methyl ester (SME) - under near-quiescent conditions. The predictions are compared with the experimental and analytical results of Morin et al. [1]. The model uses an effective Reynolds number to conflate the effects of forced and natural convection. It is observed that the predicted temporal history of droplet diameter for RME droplet matches more closely with correlation C1 for T amb ≤ 748 K and correlation C2 for T amb ≥ 803 K at various ambient temperatures (i.e., from low to high evaporation rate). The correct droplet lifetime is predicted best by C1 for all temperatures. For average evaporation rates for SME, C1 best fits the experimental data. For the average evaporation rate of RME, the present model with C1 gives a better prediction than the theoretical, and corrected theoretical results of Morin et al. [1], and is observed to match closely with their experimental results. The present results using C2 are also found close to the experimental results for RME and SME. It is observed that the oxidation of RME/SME is similar to n-decane - a pure component fuel. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In agreement with the principles of green chemistry, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) allows multi-component analysis in a fast and nondestructive way, without requiring complex pre-treatments, being a safe, clean and energy saving technique. In this work, a preliminary study to develop near infrared calibration models to predict methyl esters (ME) yield, monoglycerides (MG), diglycerides (DG), triglycerides (TG), free glycerol (FG) and total glycerol (TotalG) content in biodiesel has been carried out. These parameters are considered key factors to determine biofuel quality, its commercialization and to study and monitor the transesterification reaction. For this purpose, samples of biodiesel produced from three different vegetable oils (maize oil, sunflower oil and olive-pomace oil) were analyzed following the EN14103 and EN14105 European standards as reference methods. NIRS calibration equations were validated with a group of validation samples. The mean spectra showed that the main variability on biodiesel NIR spectra occurred around 1700 and 2300 nm. Moreover, the principal components analysis (PCA) applied to the spectra revealed the grouping of samples according to the type of oils used for biodiesel production. The standard deviation of the prediction (cross validation) errors (RMSEPCV) of the calibration models and the standard deviation error (RMSEP) of the validation set resulted similar to the measurement errors (intra lab SELr) and repeatability (inter lab SELR) of each analyte. Results confirm the accuracy of the developed NIRS models for determination of glycerides content and methyl esters yield in biodiesel. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental analyses of energy systems usually lack a comprehensive perspective that takes into account their life cycle and a set of relevant impact categories. The present study tries to fulfil this need in the field of biofuel production from free fatty acid-rich wastes, therefore providing a life cycle assessment of four biodiesel production systems including esterification-transesterification of waste vegetable oils (used cooking oil) and animal fats (beef tallow, poultry fat), and in situ transesterification of sewage sludges. Reference inventory data for these systems were gathered from a literature review. Thereafter, environmental characterization values were computed for a selection of impact categories: global warming, acidification, eutrophication, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, and cumulative non-renewable energy demand. A comparison among the environmental profiles of these second generation biodiesel alternatives and those of first generation rapeseed and soybean biodiesel fuels and conventional low-sulphur diesel was also performed through a well-to-wheels analysis. Thus, biodiesel from waste vegetable oils potentially entailed the most favourable environmental performance. Nevertheless, actions aimed at minimizing thermal and electric energy demands are encouraged as they would lead to relevant environmental improvements. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - India imports more than seventy percent of the oil it uses and is looking for alternative fuel to reduce its dependence on imports. In India, bio fuels derived from non-edible oils is considered as a renewable alternative to the fossil diesel. The cost of the biodiesel is higher than diesel and hence in this work, cardanol was used as an alternative renewable fuel for the diesel engine. The engine tests were conducted on a double cylinder, direct injection, compression ignition engine. From the engine tests, it is observed that the brake power increases (by 70% approximately) as load increases. Brake specific energy conversion decreases (by 25-30% approximately) with increase in brake power. Brake thermal efficiency increases with higher brake power and emission levels (HC, CO, NOX) were nominal up to 20% blends. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This research develops models and simulations of technical performance, net emission reductions, and discounted market values of thirteen small-scale (≤6 kWe) renewable energy projects. The research uses a simple methodology suitable for small private entities and governments to compare alternative investment options for both climate change mitigation and adaptation in the southwest of Western Australia. The system simulation and modelling results indicate that privately-owned, small-scale, grid-connected renewable energy systems were not competitive options for private entities relative to sourcing electricity from electricity networks, despite subsidies. The total discounted capital and operating costs, combined with the minimal mitigation potentials of the small-scale renewable energy systems resulted in unnecessarily high electricity costs and equivalent carbon prices, relative to grid-connection and large-scale clean energy systems. In contrast, this research suggests that small-scale renewable energy systems are cost-effective for both private entities and governments and exhibit good mitigation potentials when installed in remote locations far from the electricity network, mostly displacing diesel capacity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A novel production process of biodiesel using magnetically stabilized fluidized bed reactor (MSFBR) has been developed based on cottonseed oil and the reaction conditions were also studied. The reactant flow rate and magnetic field intensity affects on the magnetic catalytic particles behavior in the column were performed, and the transesterification reaction conditions of cottonseed oil were investigated in MSFBR with nanometer magnetic catalytic particles. Under the suitable reaction conditions of methanol/oil molar ratio 8:1, 40 cm3 min-1 flow rate, 225 Oe magnetic field intensity and temperature of 65 °C, the conversion efficiency reaches to 97% in 100 min. The stability and recovery of the magnetic catalytic particles in MSFBR are much better than that in autoclave stirred reactor. The result shows that most of the resultant cottonseed oil biodiesel parameters comply with the limits established by representative biodiesel standards. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We estimated rate constants for the hydrogen abstraction from carbon-3 of 1-butanol by hydroperoxyl radical, a critically important reaction in the combustion of biofuel. We employed the recently developed multi-structural variational transition-state theory (MS-VTST), which utilizes a multifaceted dividing surface that allows us to include the contributions of multiple structures for reacting species and transition states. First, multiconfigurational Shepard interpolation-based on molecular-mechanics-guided interpolation of electronic-structure Hessian data obtained by the M08 HX/jun-cc-pVTZ electronic model chemistry-was used to obtain the portion of the potential energy surface needed for single-structure variational transition-state theory rate constants including multidimensional tunneling; then, the M08-HX/MG3S electronic model chemistry was used to calculate multi-structural torsional anharmonicity factors to complete the MS-VTST rate constant calculations. The lowest-energy structures of the transition state have strongly bent hydrogen bonds. Our results indicate that neglect of multi-structural anharmonicity would lead to errors of factors of 0.3, 46, and 171 at 200, 1000, and 2400 K for this reaction. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The rapidly growing biodiesel industry has created a scenario, where it is both important and challenging to deal with the enormous amount of crude glycerol generated as an inherent by-product. With every 100 gallons of biodiesel produced, 5-10 gallons of the crude glycerol is left behind containing several impurities which makes its disposal difficult. The objective of the present investigation was to evaluate the impact of biodiesel-derived crude glycerol upon microbial growth and production of 1,3-propanediol by Citrobacter freundii. Five different grades of crude glycerol (obtained from biodiesel preparation using jatropha, soybean, sunflower, rice bran and linseed oils) were used. Crude glycerol caused significant inhibition of microbial growth and subsequently 1,3-propanediol production as compared to pure glycerol. Therefore, a process was developed for the treatment of crude glycerol using solvents before fermentation wherein four different non-polar solvents were examined yielding different grades of pretreated glycerol. Subsequently, the potential toxic effects of pretreated glycerol on the growth and 1,3-propanediol production by C. freundii was evaluated. In case of petroleum ether-treated crude glycerol obtained from jatropha & linseed and hexane-treated crude glycerol obtained from rice bran, the yields obtained were comparable to the pure glycerol. Similarly, soybean-derived glycerol gave comparable results after treatment with either hexane or petroleum ether. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Diesel engine exhaust contains large numbers of submicrometer particles that degrade air quality and human health. This study examines the number emission characteristics of 10-1000nm nonvolatile particles from a heavy-duty diesel engine, operating with various waste cooking oil biodiesel blends (B2, B10 and B20), engine loads (0%, 25%, 50% and 75%) and a diesel oxidation catalyst plus diesel particulate filter (DOC+DPF) under steady modes. For a given load, the total particle number concentrations (N TOT) decrease slightly, while the mode diameters show negligible changes with increasing biodiesel blends. For a given biodiesel blend, both the N TOT and mode diameters increase modestly with increasing load of above 25%. The N TOT at idle are highest and their size distributions are strongly affected by condensation and possible nucleation of semivolatile materials. Nonvolatile cores of diameters less than 16nm are only observed at idle mode. The DOC+DPF shows remarkable filtration efficiency for both the core and soot particles, irrespective of the biodiesel blend and engine load under study. The N TOT post the DOC+DPF are comparable to typical ambient levels of ∼10 4cm -3. This implies that, without concurrent reductions of semivolatile materials, the formation of semivolatile nucleation mode particles post the aftertreatment is highly favored. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel production has received considerable attention in the recent past as a nonpolluting fuel. However, this assertion has been based on its biodegradability and reduction in exhaust emissions. Assessments of water and soil biodiesel pollution are still limited. Spill simulation with biodiesel and their diesel blends in soils were carried out, aiming at analyzing their cytotoxic and genotoxic potentials. While the cytotoxicity observed may be related to diesel contaminants, the genotoxic and mutagenic effects can be ascribed to biodiesel pollutants. Thus, taking into account that our data stressed harmful effects on organisms exposed to biodiesel-polluted soils, the designation of this biofuel as an environmental-friendly fuel should be carefully reviewed to assure environmental quality. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work, Raman spectroscopy and a machine learning technique known as support vector regression (SVR) are used for building an online sensor to monitor the heterotrophic algal culture conditions in a computer-interfaced bench-scale microalgal bioreactor system, for the production of bio-oil. Monitoring of process conditions in algal cultures is required to enable the use of different control strategies to maximize oil productivity. In order to correlate the Raman spectra with culture conditions, three independent experimental datasets are used. The effect of several preprocessing techniques, including Savitzky-Golay filtering, baseline correction, and standard normal variate transformation, on the goodness of fit is evaluated. A multivariate sensor for real time online monitoring of the concentrations of biomass, glucose and percentage oil content is successfully built and validated. The advantages of using the proposed real-time on-line sensor are illustrated in an experimental microalgal bioreactor system. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microalgae have emerged as an attractive feedstock for the mass production of renewable transportation fuels due to their fast growth rate, flexible habitat preferences, and substantial oil yields. As an educational tool, a laboratory was developed that mimics emerging algal biofuel technology, including the extraction of algal lipids and transesterification into biodiesel. First, students were introduced to algae as an energy feedstock and taught how to cultivate and harvest algal biomass. Next, students learned how to convert algal biomass to a transportation fuel using transesterification and extraction, including an experimental comparison of base- and acid-catalyzed transesterification methods. The energy content of homemade algae biodiesel was determined and compared to soybean biodiesel and petroleum diesel using a homemade calorimeter. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Electric-vehicles have the potential for a significant substitution of diesel and gasoline vehicles, and contribute to a reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) and particulate matter emissions. According to the European Renewable Energy Directive, the share of renewable transportation fuels should be 10% in 2020. In the project "Styrian e-mobility in 2020" the potential for reaching the target of 10% renewable fuels in 2020 has been determined by analysing different implementation scenarios. Based on a life cycle analysis, GHG and particulate matter emissions from transport services have been calculated and their potential reductions in emissions by the introduction of electric vehicles by 2020 have been determined. Reaching the European target of 10% renewable fuels in the passenger car sector by 2020 is possible with 30,700 electric-vehicles (5% of passenger cars) if the share of the additional electricity is above 50% from renewable energy and the same amount of transportation biofuel of 7% used as today.

AB  - The total palm oil production has increased in the last few years, as a result, palm oil waste which is a by-product of the milling process will also increase. The palm oil production process in mills consists of several unit operations. The processing of fresh fruit bunches of palm results in the generation of different types of residue. Among the waste generated, palm oil mill effluent (POME) is considered as the most harmful waste for the environment if discharged untreated. POME is a thick brownish liquid that contains high solids, oil and grease. Several treatment technologies have been used for POME treatment, since the direct discharge of POME adversely affects the environment. Due to the presence of high oil residue in POME, attempts have been made to recover and convert it into valuable products such as usefull chemicals and biofuel. Recovery process of oil residue from POME is difficult and not economical; therefore, its alternative usage is explored. In a preliminary study, we observed that it was possible to produce various types of liquid hydrocarbons fuel (biofuel) from oil residue from POME. Oil residue from POME has been catalytically hyrdrocracked to biofuel by Ni/Mo-ZrO2 pillared monmorillonite catalyst in fixed bed micro reactor. The data show that the catalytic activity of ZrO2 pillared montmorillonite (ZM) is more active than parent monmorillonite. While, catalyst Ni/Mo loaded on ZM can increase the catalytic activity for hydrocracking of oil residue from POME into biofuel. The products were mainly gases, biofuel and solid coke. The biofuel products consist of gasoline, kerosene and diesel oil fraction. © 2012, Chinese Institute of Environmental Engineering. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biofuels for diesel engines are produced mainly from rapeseed oil in Lithuania and the Member States of the European Union. In order to minimise an adverse impact of biodiesel fuel on the food sector, it is necessary to look for alternative feedstocks for producing biodiesel fuel including the potential utilisation of the new kinds of oilseed crops and various fatty waste. Camelina (Camelina sativa) could be one of the kinds of such oilseed crops, and therefore the physical and chemical parameters of Camelina sativa oil and biodiesel fuel produced from this oil were determined and the conformity of quality parameters with the requirements of biofuel standard was evaluated. It was found that fatty acid methyl esters made from Camelina sativa oil had a high iodine value (164.6÷169.6 g I2 / 100 g oil), and therefore could be used as fuel for diesel engines only in the mixtures with methyl esters produced from animal fat or used for frying oil. It has been established that similar mixtures can contain 50÷60% of Camelina sativa oil methyl esters. The possibilities of increasing oxidation stability as well as improving the cold flow properties of ester mixtures were investigated. The most effective antioxidant - Ionol (optimal dosage of 500 ppm) and the most efficient depressants Wintron XC-30 (optimal dosage - 1500 ppm) and Infineum R-442 (optimal dosage - 1200 ppm) were selected.

AB  - Biodiesels are promoted as alternative fuels due to their potential to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and carbon emissions. Research in this field has focused on the study of the emissions of light duty vehicles. However, particle matter and gaseous emissions emitted from heavy-duty diesel engines fueled by Jatropha Oil Biodiesel (JOB) and Ultra-Low Sulphur Diesel (ULSD) has not been studied. The objective of this study is to explore the performance and emission levels of a Cummins 4-stroke, 4.8 liter, 4-cylinder diesel engine with common rail fuel injection, equipped with a cooled Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR). There was a substantial reduction by the use of JOB in unburned hydrocarbons (-45%), carbon monoxide (-75%), and particulate matter (-25%) compared to emission from diesel fuel. At mid and high loads, NOx emissions were higher for JOB compared to ULSD. Most of the particles (64%) for ULSD were in a range of between 40 and 560 nm. On the other hand, most of the particles (94%) for JCB mode were between 6 and 40 nm. In the range between 6 and 40 nm, mass mean diameters in ULSD were 34.4, 34.7 and 33.3 nm while for JOB they were 21.3, 18.2 and 20.1 nm for 100, 50 for a 10% load, respectively.

AB  - This work studied the improvement of biomass and carbohydrate (glucose and xylose) lab-scale productivity in Chlorella vulgaris UTEX 1803 through the use of the carbon/nitrogen ratio. In order to do so, mixotrophic cultures were made by the modification of initial concentration of CH3COONa (5, 10 and 20 mM) and NaNO3 (0.97, 1.94 and 2.94 mM). All treatments were maintained at 23 ± 1°C, with light/dark cycles of 12h: 12h for 5 days. It was found that in addition to the carbon/nitrogen ratio, time also influences the concentration of biomass and carbohydrates. The treatment containing 10 mM acetate: 1.94 mM nitrate, reached a concentration of 0.79 g/L of biomass, 76.9 μg/mL of xylose and 73.7 μg/mL of glucose in the fifth day. However, the treatment containing 20 mM acetate: 0.97 mM nitrate produced 1.04 g/L of biomass, 78.9 μg/mL of xylose and 77.2 μg/mL of glucose in the third day, while in the same day the treatment containing 0 mM acetate: 2.94 mM nitrate, produced 0.55 g/L of biomass, 40.2 μg/mL of xylose and 31.3 μg/mL of glucose. The use of carbon/nitrogen ratios improved biomass productivity (from 0.55 to 1.04 g/L) as well as xylose (from 40.2 to 78.9 μg/mL) and glucose (from 31.3 to 77.2 μg/mL) concentration, representing an improvement of up to two times the production of both biomass and carbohydrates in only 3 days of culture.

AB  - With dwindling oil reserves and growing environmental concerns, researchers are looking at producing sustainable biofuels and chemicals from renewable resources like switchgrass. Biofuels and biochemicals will be produced in the near future from switchgrass in biorefineries using both biochemical and thermochemical platforms. We have summarized recent literature pertaining to different processing steps within the biochemical platform (pretreatment, enzyme hydrolysis, microbial fermentation, protein extraction) and thermochemical platform (pyrolysis, bio-oil, gasification, combustion, hydrothermal process) in this chapter. Though we have improved our fundamental understanding on the different processing steps to produce biofuels, several challenges still have to be overcome to create a bioeconomy and produce fuels and chemicals from biomass in an economic and sustainable manner.

The data have been used to obtain the equations to calculate some important physical properties of mixtures like density or viscosity, more difficult to obtain experimentally. Also, the predictive computing capacity of refractive index applied to biofuel mixtures was tested with the traditional equations Lorentz-Lorenz, Dale-Gladstone, Eykman, Newton and Kay.

AB  - Gasoline fuel is the baseline fuel in this research, to which bioethanol, biodiesel and diesel are additives. The fuel blends were prepared based on different volumes and following which, ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) test methods analysed some of the important properties of the blends, such as: density, dynamic viscosity, kinematic viscosity and water and sediment. Experimental data were analysed by means of Matlab software. The results obtained from artificial neural network analysis of the data showed that the network with feed forward back propagation of the Levenberg-Marquardt train LM function with 10 neurons in the hidden layer was the best for predicting the parameters, including: Water and sediment (W), dynamic viscosity (DV), kinematic viscosity (KV) and density (De). The experimental data had a good correlation with ANN-predicted values according to 0.96448 for regression.

AB  - Background: This paper presents the results of investigations into the distribution of fine particles in the biodiesel exhaust fumes (bio-DEP), as well as into the content of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and soluble organic fraction (SOF) in the study fractions. Material and Methods: Samples of biodiesel B20 and B40 exhaust combustion fumes were generated at the model station composed of a diesel engine from Diesel TDI 2007 Volkswagen. Sioutas Personal Cascade Impactor (SPCI) with Teflon filters and low-pressure impactor ELPI (Dekati Low Pressure Impactor) were used for sampling diesel exhaust fine particles. The analysis of PAHs adsorbed on particulate fractions was performed by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC/FL). For the determination of dry residue soluble organic fraction of biodiesel exhaust particles the gravimetric method was used. Results: The combustion exhaust fumes of 100% ON contained mainly naphthalene, acenaphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo(a)anthracene and chrysene, whilst the exhaust of B40 - single PAHs of 4 and 5 rings, such as chrysene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, dibenzo (ah) anthracene and benzo(ghi)perylene. The total content of PAHs in diesel exhaust particles averaged 910 ng/m3 for 100% ON and 340 ng/m3 for B40. The concentrations of benzo(a)antarcene were at the levels of 310 ng/m3 (100% ON) and 90 ng/m3 (B40). Conclusions: The investigations indicated that a fraction &lt; 025 μm represents the main component of diesel exhaust particles, regardless of the used fuel. Bioester B100 commonly added to diesel fuel (ON) causes a reduction of the total particulates emission and thus reduces the amount of toxic substances adsorbed on their surface. © Instytut Medycyny Pracy im. prof.

AB  - Oleaginous plants such as Jatropha Curcas Linnaeus (JCL), not intended for human consumption but used for biodiesel production, could contribute to beneficial outcomes. This plant grows on poor land (arid and marginal land) and is drought resistant. Jatropha Curcas is native to South America and widely grown in South and Central America, Africa, and Asia (Achten et al., 2007; Kumar et al., 2011). Some areas in Tunisia may be suitable for JCL, although not for food production. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the energy performance and potential of Jatropha Curcas for biodiesel production in Tunisia. The evaluation will be completed through the elaboration of an energy balance using life cycle assessment (LCA), which will facilitate the decision making process. Therefore, the cultivation of JCL production in Tunisia will be an experiment with uncertain results. The energy assessment reveals a negative energy return (EE = 0.42). Because of high investment costs and low yield per hectare, Jatropha is not a sound economic choice. Copyright © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The production of ethanol from winter wheat, in accordance with the EU Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC, RED), requires an estimation of the levels of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from biofuels, as well as a comparison of the values of emission savings as opposed to fossil fuels. In this paper, calculations were made into possible reductions of agricultural and GHG emissions in full Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) of bioethanol, which was produced from winter wheat. The study focused on an optimisation of nitrogen fertilisation for winter wheat, the selection of fertilizers with lower emissions arising from their production, as well as an increase of the sequestration of organic carbon in the soil by the use of reduced or no tillage systems. The results show that achieving a 50% reduction of GHG emissions in LCA of bioethanol produced from winter wheat is possible with an annual dose of 90 kg nitrate (N) per ha, regardless of which N fertiliser was applied. Additionally, an improvement in crop cultivation through the use of reduced or no tillage systems decreased the emissions by 53-69%, respectively. However, an annual application of 160 kg N per ha results in a saving of GHG emissions above 50% only in no tillage cultivation.

AB  - Developing of new technologies has turned the automotive internal combustion engines into smaller, more powerful and more environmental friendly power plants, especially if biofuels come in place. However, piston engines used in small aircraft are still far behind in technology and most of them still rely on technologies dating back to almost 50 year ago, trying to to keep them simple and reliable. Nevertheless, in order to cope with the rising costs of fuel and environmental awareness, the aviation industry needs engines that are more fuel efficient, less pollutant and still reliable. In this scenario, the choice of replacing the aviation gasoline (AvGas) with ethanol comes as a very promising solution. The advantages of the ethanol begin with its lower cost and easier future availability since lead-based aviation gasoline is bound to disappear. Also, from the engine's point of view, there is large room for performance improvement and efficiency optimization with the use of state of art technologies. Thus, this paper shows a study via computer simulation of the advantages of a dedicated ethanol fueled engine for use in small aircrafts. It's performance was evaluated in a 1-D simulation model of a standard 6 cylinder aircraft engine with several levels of optimization for the new fuel. Detailed analysis was performed and comparative results show gains in power and torque, together with improved fuel efficiency. Even with the increase in the volumetric consumption, the flying costs are substantially reduced and the power increase could contribute to engine downsizing and higher improvements in the future. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on the approach of 'arena of development' controversies over bioenergy in the shaping of a Danish climate strategy are analyzed as a contribution to a sustainable transition perspective on bioenergy in industrialized societies with substantial agricultural production. Bioenergy plays a prominent role in several Danish climate and energy plans, alongside with wind and solar energy, and energy savings. There are major controversies about targets for bioenergy with respect to acceptable types, sources and amounts of biomass. Strong path dependency is identified. Energy companies in Denmark convert coal fired power plants to biomass in order to sustain the role of these power plants. Their increasing use of imported wood pellets is criticized for increasing greenhouse gas emissions because of fast logging of years of forest growth. A Danish biotech company is developing enzymes for processing of biomass for biofuels. The alignment with the private car regime is strong, because biofuel enables continuation of fuel-driven vehicles as dominating transportation mode. Danish farmers see manure as important source for biogas while arguing for reduction of climate impact and nuisances from digested manure. Such biogas is questioned by some NGOs who fear manure-based biogas is used as argument for increased animal husbandry. The bioenergy controversies concern also methodologies for environmental assessments, including for indirect land use changes (ILUC), and reliability of certification schemes. The mapping of controversies identifies issues that probably need to be taken into account in shaping of Danish bioenergy strategies if these strategies should gain substantial legitimacy among environmental NGOs.

AB  - In this article, the flame speed values determined experimentally for laminar premixed flames of the vapors of two biofuels in air are presented. The laminar flame speed is a fundamental thermochemical property of fuels, and is essential for analyzing the flame propagation in practical devices, even those employing turbulent flames. The fuels obtained from transesterification of soy and canola oils are tested. Also, the diesel flames are studied to serve as a baseline for comparison. The experiments are performed with a tubular burner; pre-vaporized fuel is mixed with hot air and is ignited. The flame speed is determined at fuel-equivalence ratios of 1; 1,1 and 1,2 by recording the geometry of the flame. The experimental results show that the flame speed of biofuels is lower by about 15% than that of diesel. Also, the maximum value of flame speed is obtained at an equivalence ratio of approximately 1,1.

AB  - Use of advanced microwave technology for biodiesel production from vegetable oil is a relatively new technology. Microwave dielectric heating increases the process efficiency and reduces reaction time. Microwave heating depends on various factors such as material properties (dielectric and thermo-physical), frequency of operation and system design. Although lab scale results are promising, it is important to study these parameters and optimize the process before scaling up. Numerical modeling approach can be applied for predicting heating and temperature profiles including at larger scale. The process can be studied for optimization without actually performing the experiments, reducing the amount of experimental work required. A basic numerical model of continuous electromagnetic heating of biodiesel precursors was developed. A finite element model was built using COMSOL Multiphysics 4.2 software by coupling the electromagnetic problem with the fluid flow and heat transfer problem. Chemical reaction was not taken into account. Material dielectric properties were obtained experimentally, while the thermal properties were obtained from the literature (all the properties were temperature dependent). The model was tested for the two different power levels 4000 W and 4700 W at a constant flow rate of 840ml/min. The electric field, electromagnetic power density flow and temperature profiles were studied. Resulting temperature profiles were validated by comparing to the temperatures obtained at specific locations from the experiment. The results obtained were in good agreement with the experimental data.

AB  - The synthesis, characterization and catalytic capability of the NiW-nano-hydroxyapatite (NiW-nHA) composite were investigated in this paper. The NiW-nHA catalyst was prepared by a co-precipitation method. Then Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) were used to analyze this material. In addition, the catalytic capacity of the NiW-nHA composite was also examined by FT-IR and gas chromatography (GC). The results of FT-IR analysis indicated that Ni, W and nHA combined closely. TEM observation revealed that this catalyst was needle shaped and the crystal retained a nanometer size. XRD data also suggested that a new phase of CaWO4 appeared and the lattice parameters of nHA changed in this system. nHA was the carrier of metals. The rates of Ni/W-loading were 73.24% and 65.99% according to the EDX data, respectively. Furthermore, the conversion of 91.88% Jatropha oil was achieved at 360 °C and 3 MPa h-1 over NiW-nHA catalyst. The straight chain alkanes ranging from C15 to C18 were the main components in the production. The yield of C15-C18 alkanes was up to 83.56 wt%. The reaction pathway involved hydrocracking of the CC bonds of these triglycerides from Jatropha oil. This paper developed a novel non-sulfided catalyst to obtain a "green biofuel" from vegetable oil. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The potential of Jatropha curcas seed oil for biodiesel production is well recognized. Lipase transesterification of triglycerides is an eco-friendly alternative to chemical process. However, intoxication by methanol hampers further applicability of enzymatic transesterification. This study investigated the impact of methanol adding on transesterification efficiency for jatropha oil with methanol from 40 to 60 °C. For stepwise addition, the conversions by using methanol were from 33 to 42% at 24 h. For continuous addition, the conversions by using methanol were from 47 to 64%. Higher empirical first-order rate constants and favorable energetics for the first 6 h also demonstrated the advantages of the gradient addition over stepwise addition. Faster ME conversion for palmitic acid (C16:0) of jatropha oil was found, as well as the negative impact of double bonds of linoleic acid (C18:2) on methanolytic transesterification by both adding methods. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel is a prominent alternative fuel because of its environmental benefits and similar physiochemical properties to diesel fuel. This study investigated the impact of high quality refined, bleached and deodorized (RBD) coconut oil blends and fuel throttle setting on performance and exhaust emissions of diesel engine. The criteria regulated emissions and particulate-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were studied. The engine was operated with pure diesel and blended fuels contain of 10%, 30% and 50% of coconut oil by volume. Experiments were conducted under 75% and 50% throttle opening conditions at 2000 rpm. The use of coconut oil blends resulted in a reduction of all of the regulated emissions, except for slight fluctuations in CO2 emissions. There was no significant difference in total PAH emissions with the different throttle settings. All the coconut oil blends showed lower PAH emissions except for fluoranthene (FL) and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) compounds. Notably, coconut oil blends resulted in a maximum reduction of 40% in total PAH concentration. It was observed that coconut oil blends increased the total benzo[a]pyrene equivalent (BaPeq). However, the reduction in benzo[a]anthracene (BaA) indicated the positive effects on toxicity reduction of coconut oil as a potential substitute for fossil diesel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The beneficial use of tung oil in pre-blended oil for the production of biodiesel was studied at various blending compositions of tung, canola and palm oils (CBT, CBC and CBP). The effects of CBT, ultrasonic power (PWUS) and sample loading (VL) on the yield (YF) and the properties of acid value, iodine values (IV), kinematic viscosity (KV), density and cold filter plugging point (CFPP) were investigated. The pre-blending of tung oil with palm oil greatly decreases the CFPP of palm oil biodiesel, whereas the presence of canola and palm oils with tung oil reduces the IV and KV of tung oil biodiesel. For PWUS/VL = 0.92-2.08 W/mL, CBT can be as high as 60 wt.% with 30 wt.% CBC and 10 wt.% CBP to produce biodiesel with high YF and satisfactory qualities of the said properties. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The alkaline-catalyzed ethanolysis of rapeseed oil was studied. In the case of homogeneous catalysis (KOH), the effects of various reaction conditions on the quantity and quality of biodiesel (yield, purity, acid number, carbon residue, free glycerol, potassium content) and the glycerol phase (weight, soaps and ethyl esters content) were studied. The studied reaction conditions were: the reaction temperature and time, the catalyst concentration, the molar ratio of ethanol to oil, the revolutions of stirring, the temperature and time of deethanolisation and the initial temperature of the separation. Data was evaluated by linear regression on the statistical basis of multivariable systems. The final linear models were verified by independent experiments and they are able to predict the biodiesel quantity and quality in the range of the reaction conditions. Finally, the factor analysis of the ester phase variables was carried out. Moreover, ethanolysis was catalyzed by a heterogeneous catalytic system; attention was focused not only on catalyst activity but also on catalyst stability, which was determined by potassium leaching. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - India is having great potential for tree borne seed oils such as Mahua, Neem and Sal and out of which Sal and Mahua alone deserves commercial importance. Only a small fraction of these seeds were utilised and the rest is left behind as waste in the forest. This paper describes biodiesel preparation from these oils, their performance and emission in direct injection diesel engine. The test results show that the brake thermal efficiency is almost similar to that of the diesel. The various exhaust emissions such as CO, HC, and NOx were low compared to that of diesel. Appropriate initiatives in increasing the seed collection and additional plantation of these trees will certainly increase oil availability and use of these oils for biodiesel manufacture, will ensure sustainable source of energy for transportation and thereby minimising environmental pollution.

AB  - Triacylglycerols are among the most attractive alternative raw materials for biofuel development. Current oil plant-based technologies are limited in terms of triacylglycerol production capacity and rate. These limitations may be circumvented by biotransformation of carbohydrates into lipids; however, our understanding of microbial oleaginicity remains limited. Here we present the results of a multi-omic analysis of Rhodosporidium toruloides, a robust triacylglycerol-producing fungus. The assembly of genome and transcriptome sequencing data reveals a genome of 20.2 Mb containing 8,171 protein-coding genes, the majority of which have multiple introns. Genes including a novel fatty acid synthase are predicted to participate in metabolic pathways absent in non-oleaginous yeasts. Transcriptomic and proteomic data suggest that lipid accumulation under nitrogen-limited conditions correlates with the induction of lipogenesis, nitrogenous compound recycling, macromolecule metabolism and autophagy. The multi-omic map of R. toruloides therefore provides a valuable resource for efforts to rationally engineer lipid-production pathways. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, the effect of cooking conditions on waste oil characteristics and yield of methyl esters was investigated for biodiesel production in Trinidad and Tobago. Used cooking oil was collected from eleven restaurants that were subdivided into four categories according to the type of meals served: four Chinese restaurants, four Indian restaurants, two Fried-Chicken restaurants and one Pizzeria. The waste oils were characterised as to their acid value, free fatty acid levels, saponification, peroxide value, water concentrations and fatty acid composition. Waste oil from one restaurant from each category was then selected to undergo base catalysed transesterification. The waste oils collected from the Indian restaurants were used less intensely and had the most desirable properties with the lowest free fatty acid content while those of the Chinese restaurants produced the highest yields of methyl esters. Biodiesel produced from the waste oil of these two restaurants also met the ASTM standard for the properties tested. Waste oils from the Fried-Chicken restaurants and the Pizzeria demonstrated high degradation that was reflected in their high acid values and free fatty acid levels and correspondingly poor yields of methyl esters. Given the high proportion of these less suitable waste oil feedstocks in the local market, biodiesel production via base catalysed transesterification may not be suitable in the Trinidad and Tobago context. © 2012 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - This paper presents a comparative study on the use of three after-treatment technologies: i) EGR + DPF, ii) SCR + Urea and iii) 3-way catalyst when implemented in urban buses, to determinate the energy requirements, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), direct Land Use Change (dLUC), abiotic depletion of fossil energy by means of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).The process of production, conditioning and transporting of the fuels used by the buses (diesel, biodiesel (B100), a blended biodiesel at 20% (B20) and natural gas) were also analyzed (Well-to-Tank analysis) along with the environmental impact due to its combustion in the bus (Tank-to-Wheel analysis). The environmental impact of the manufacturing, maintenance and recycling process of the urban buses and exhaust after-treatment systems has also been evaluated.Main results shows that Life Cycle of SCR + Urea technology reduces environmental impact to a greater extent than its global Life Cycle increases it when gasoil is used resulting in a final balance more efficient than the other options, the same behavior is observed with the use of B20 and B100 but only when 0%dLUC is assumed since if the percentage of dLUC increases the effectiveness of the SCR + Urea technology in the reduction of environmental impact tend to decrease. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In electrostatic atomization, the input electrical energy causes breaking up of the droplet surface by utilizing a mutual repulsion of net charges accumulating on that surface. In this work anumber of key parameters controlling the bio-oil droplet breakup process are identified and these correlations among the droplet size distribution, specific charges of droplets and externally applied electrical voltages are quantified. Theoretical considerations of the bag or strip breakup mechanism of biodiesel droplets experiencing electrostatic potential are compared to experimental outcomes. The theoretical analysis suggests the droplet breakup process is governed by the Rayleigh instability condition, which reveals the effects of droplets size, specific charge, surface tension force, and droplet velocities. Experiments confirm that the average droplet diameters decrease with increasing specific charges and this decreasing tendency is non-monotonic due to the motion ofsatellite drops in the non-uniform electrical field. The measured specific charges are found to besmaller than the theoretical values. And the energy transformation from the electrical energy to surface energy, in addition to the energy loss, Taylor instability breakup, non-excess polarization and some system errors, accounts for this discrepancy. The electrostatic force is the dominant factor controlling the mechanism of biodiesel breakup in electrostatic atomization. © 2012 by the authors.

AB  - Biodiesel has become attractive as an alternative renewable fuel, but its large-scale production has been restricted because of the high cost of feedstock. Therefore, alternative feedstock is urgently needed to enable biodiesel production from cheap raw materials. Toward this goal, a co-conversion process using BSFL (black soldier fly larvae) and microbes (Rid-X) was established to convert rice straw and RSW (restaurant solid waste) into the larval grease of black soldier fly. In this study, about 43.8 g biodiesel was produced from 2000 BSFL grown on 1000 g mixed feed of rice straw (30%) and RSW (70%) within 10 days. About 65.5% of cellulose, 56.3% of hemicellulose, 8.8% of the lignin, 91.6% of protein and 71.6% of lipid in the feed were digested and utilized for insect biomass accumulation with the aid of Rid-X. The results showed that grease from BSFL fed on rice straw and RSW was suitable for biodiesel and most of the fuel properties were corresponding to the requirements of the standard EN 14214. The new alternative method was introduced to produce biodiesel from lignocellulose abundant materials by insect and microbes, partly bypassing the complex pretreatment of lignocellulose that needed by other biofuel technologies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigated the energy productivity and input sensitivity of sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), as compared with cotton and maize, at two coastal saline-alkali sites in Shandong Province, China. The data were collected quantitatively using a questionnaire for face-to-face interviewing of 116 farmers. The sorghum showed a lower energy input requirement than cotton and maize. The energy productivity indices were 12.4 and 9.2 for sweet sorghum, which were much higher than for cotton (3.1) at Wudi and maize (8.4) at Wendeng, respectively. Nitrogen fertilisation contributed the highest proportions (between 56% and 69% for the three crops) to the total energy consumption, as compared with the seed, labour, machinery, diesel fuel, phosphorus and potassium fertilisers, irrigation water, plastic film, and pesticides. All of the crops consumed much more non-renewable energy than renewable energy. According to the Cobb-Douglas production function, the diesel and nitrogen fertiliser energy inputs had a significantly positive impact on the sweet sorghum energy output. The energy crop showed an increasing return to scale, with cotton showing a constant and maize a decreasing return. These findings indicate that the sweet sorghum energy output is possible to be increased with further technical research and development. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The rapid depletion of fossil fuels and environmental concerns make alternative fuels such as biodiesel more attractive. Biodiesel has properties comparable to ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD), however certain properties of biodiesel such as viscosity, calorific value, density and volatility differ from ULSD. These properties strongly affect injection, air-fuel mixing and thereby combustion and performance characteristics of biodiesel in a diesel engine. In order to realize the full potential of biodiesel use in diesel engine certain modifications to engine design and injection system are required. This experimental study aims to optimize the combination of injection timing and combustion chamber geometry to achieve higher performance and lower emissions from biodiesel fueled diesel engine. Experiments were performed using a blend of 20% Pongamia Oil Methyl Ester (POME) by volume in ULSD (B20), in a single cylinder Direct Injection (DI) diesel engine equipped with pistons having Hemispherical and Toroidal Re-entrant Combustion Chamber (TRCC) geometries. The test results showed an improvement of 5.64% in brake thermal efficiency, a reduction of 4.6% in brake specific fuel consumption and a 11% increase of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) level for TRCC compared to baseline engine operated with ULSD due to better air-fuel mixing and retarded injection timing. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Deoxygenation of microalgal oil obtained by pyrolysis of microalgae was carried out for the production of hydrocarbon fuel from biomass by metal supported catalyst. Oleic acid was used as a model reactant to select an optimized catalyst. Effects of support, metal species, and metal loading on catalytic performance were investigated. Activated carbon showed better performance than silica as a support. Considering various factors in model reaction, such as metal loading, reaction temperature, activity for deoxygenation, and selectivity for decarboxylation, 5. wt% platinum supported on activated carbon (5. wt% Pt/C) was selected as an optimized catalyst. Based on these results, deoxygenation of the pyrolysis oil from Chlorella sp. KR-1 was conducted at 623 and 673. K over this selected catalyst. The product after catalytic deoxygenation was mainly composed of pure hydrocarbons, and its oxygen content was below 2.0%. The fraction in the product of which the boiling point was less than 623. K was about 90%. These properties could allow this upgraded oil to be used for transportation fuel. However, the degree of oxygen removal with microalgal pyrolysis oil was lower than that with oleic acid, implying that impurities in the pyrolysis oil may inhibit the deoxygenation reaction. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The usage of neat cashew nut shell oil (CSNO) as a fuel in direct injection diesel engine suffers from the problems of incomplete combustion and low brake thermal efficiency due to high viscosity. To overcome this problem, the CSNO was blended with camphor oil (CMPRO) which is less viscous and burns readily, in various proportions by volume. These blends were tested in a single cylinder 1500 rpm, 5.2 kW, direct injection diesel engine fitted with eddy current dynamometer. The performance, emission and combustion characteristics were studied at various loads on the engine at a constant speed of 1500 rpm and compared with neat CSNO and diesel fuel operations. Among the blends 30% camphor oil blend with CSNO (CMPRO 30), shows good performance on par with diesel fuel operation with respect to brake thermal efficiency and heat release rate at full load. The brake thermal efficiency of CMPRO 30 is 29.1% compared to base diesel engine brake thermal efficiency of 30.14%. The CMPRO 30 emits 1040 ppm of NO, while diesel emits 1068 ppm. The neat CSNO emits 983 ppm of NO. The smoke emissions are 4.22, 3.91, and 3.64 Bosch Smoke Unit for CSNO, CMPRO 30 and diesel, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The characteristics of petroleum-contaminated sediment (PCS) have been evaluated to assess whether the practice of its beneficial reuse as a sole or supplemental energy source is sustainable relative to other sediment remediation options such as monitored natural recovery (MNR), capping, or off-site disposal. Some of these remediation options for PCS are energy-intensive and/or require land utilization. The energy and compositional analysis results indicate a low carbon content (15-17%(wt)) and corresponding low energy values of 5,200 kJ/kg (2,200 Btu/lb) to 5,600 kJ/kg (2,400 Btu/lb). However, given other decision-making criteria, the sediment may contain enough value to be added as a supplemental fuel given that it is normally considered a waste product and is readily available.The thermogravimetric profiles obtained under both combustion and pyrolytic conditions showed that the sulfur contents were comparable to typical low sulfur bituminous or lignite coals found in the United States, and most of the volatiles could be vaporized below 750°C. The heavy metal concentrations determined before and after combustion of the PCS indicated that further engineering controls may be required for mercury, arsenic, and lead. Due to the potential for reduction of public health and environmental threats, potential economic savings, and conservation of natural resources (petroleum and land), removal of PCS by dredging and beneficial reuse as a supplemental fuel clearly has merit to be considered as a sustainable remediation option. This study will provide a logical evaluation process to determine whether petroleum-contaminated sediment can be reused as an energy source. The energy and emissions values were determined and evaluated whether the sediment could be combusted for viable and sustainable use, considering several factors pertinent to evaluate in the remediation decision process. Various analysis methods were employed to determine elemental compositions, heating values, thermal and emission characteristics. This evaluation process may be used as a general methodology for the determination of petroleum-contaminated sediment as a supplemental fuel that may have merit to be considered as a sustainable remediation option. © 2012 Copyright 2012 A&WMA.

AB  - Biobutanol production from cellulosic feedstock is considered promising and economically feasible. A highly efficient butanol-producing bacterial microflora (containing mainly Clostridial species) was obtained from hydrogen-producing sewage sludge. In this work, two types of agricultural waste (i.e. rice straw and sugarcane bagasse) were alkaline pretreated and then hydrolyzed using a cocktail of cellulases originating from Pseudomonas sp. CL3 and Clostridium sp. TCW1. The hydrolysates were used to produce biobutanol by the isolated mixture culture using either separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) or a combination of SHF with simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SHF-SSF) processes. In the SHF process, the maximum butanol concentration, productivity, yield and ABE (acetone-butanol-ethanol) ratio from bagasse were 2.29. g/L, 1.00. g/L. d, 0.52. mol butanol/mol reducing sugar and 0.12:1:0.06, respectively, and for rice straw were 2.92. g/L, 1.41. g/L. d, 0.51. mol butanol/mol reducing sugar and 0.19:1:0.1, respectively. In the SHF-SSF process, the maximum butanol concentration, productivity, and yield for bagasse were 1.95. g/L, 0.61. g/L. d and 0.37. mol butanol/mol reducing sugar, respectively, and for rice straw were 2.93. g/L, 0.86. g/L. d and 0.49. mol butanol/mol reducing sugar, respectively. This work demonstrated a novel and feasible approach of converting agricultural waste into a valuable biofuel (i.e. butanol). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is a promising substitute for petroleum diesel, and has been commercialized and utilized in many countries. Conventional chemical or physical methods used for biodiesel production face the drawbacks of high energy consumption or intensive use of chemicals. In contrast, using lipase-catalyzed transesterification for biodiesel synthesis is clean, effective, and water tolerance. Therefore, in this work, a self-developed Burkholderia lipase was immobilized onto hydrophobic magnetic particles (HMPs) for biodiesel production. Transesterification with the immobilized lipase could be repeatedly carried out six times without severe activity loss. The optimal conditions for the enzymatic transesterification were identified as: room temperature, 200. rpm agitation, 10% water content, and a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 4:1. Under these conditions, the conversion of oil to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) reached nearly 70% within 12. h, giving a biodiesel production rate of 43.5. g/L/h. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Increased acceptance of climate change induced by human activities and raising oil demand with unsecure deliverance compels the searching for alternative fuels. The problems with environmental degradation due to industrial wastes can be reduced by converting some of them into bio-oil. In the present work, the waste from fish processing industry is converted to bio-oil by catalytic cracking. Experiments were conducted in a direct injection diesel engine of 4.5. kW at 1500. rpm. The different test fuels of diesel, fish oil at 75 °C, bio-oil UD (undistilled bio-oil), B20D80 (20% bio-oil in fossil diesel), B80D20 (80% bio-oil in fossil diesel) and neat bio-oil were tested to assess the suitability in diesel engines through combustion, emission and performance characteristics. Experimental results show that the brake thermal efficiency is marginally higher with neat bio-oil over other test fuels. It is lower with preheated fish oil and it is almost same for both bio-oil and bio-oil UD. NOx, HC, CO and PM emissions are higher with bio-oil UD compared to bio-oil. PM, CO and HC emissions are lower with bio-oil over diesel. NOx emissions are lower with bio-oil compared to bio-oil UD but it is still higher than diesel fuel. Addition of diesel with bio-oil reduces the NOx emissions marginally. Intensity of premixed combustion is strong with bio-oil. Ignition delay and combustion duration are reduced with bio-oil due to high cetane number and oxygen concentration. Bio-oil from waste fish fat by catalytic cracking can be used as a fuel for diesel engines and also the waste to energy may reduce the environmental and climate change issues due to industrial wastes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A great fraction of the world's energy requirements are presently met through the unfettered use of fossil-derived fuels. However, due to the anticipated demise of these energy sources and the environmental and socioeconomic concerns associated with their use, a recent paradigm shift is to displace conventional fuels with renewable energy sources. Among various alternatives, biomasses have garnered tremendous interests as potential feedstock for clean energy production. While numerous biorefinery schemes and conversion technologies exist for the transformation of biomass into usable energy forms, they are not cost-efficient and economically viable to compete with the existing petroleum-refinery technologies. In particular, the recalcitrant nature of several feedstock presents a major technological obstacle for their processing and transformation. Providentially, the synergistic integration of various biochemical and bioprocessing technologies is aiding in the establishment of future biomass energy programs. This article reviews the state of the art and future challenges in the recent development of biomass and associated transformation technologies for clean production of biofuels. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel fuel (BDF) produced by alcoholysis of vegetable oils or fats is viewed as a promising renewable fuel source. Diminishing petroleum reserves and increasing environmental regulations have made the search for renewable fuel. Biodiesel is non-toxic and biodegradable, produced from renewable sources and contributes a minimal amount of net green-house gases, such as CO2, SO2 and NO emissions to the atmosphere. The main objective of the present study is to produce biodiesel from vegetable oil and to use micro-emulsions with solvents ethanol and methanol following acid, alkali and fungal enzyme catalysis methods. The best suited method of biodiesel production was ethanolic and alkali mediated trans-esterification process rather than methanolic and acidic trans-esterification. The maximum yield of biodiesel was obtained from Rhizopus oryzae lipase enzyme, ethanolic and alkali mediated trans-esterification followed by Aspergillus niger, Polyporus squamosus and Agaricus campestris.

AB  - A one-step hydrotreatment of vegetable oil combining deoxygenation and isomerization to directly produce low cloud point, high quality diesel is devised. The Pt/zeolite bifunctional catalysts prepared by using SAPO-11 and ZSM-22 zeolites as supports are used in this process. Catalytic reactions are conducted in a fixed-bed reactor under a hydrogen atmosphere. Over the bifunctional catalyst, 100 % conversion of soybean oil is obtained at 357 °C, 4 MPa, and 1 h-1, and 80 % organic liquid yield is achieved, which is close to the maximum theoretical liquid yield. In the organic products, the alkanes selectivity is 100 % with an i-alkanes selectivity above 63 %. NH3-temperature programmed desorption (TPD), pyridine IR spectroscopy, and other characterization techniques are used to study the effect of the support acidity on the reaction pathway. Over the Pt/zeolite bifunctional catalyst with less strong Lewis acid sites, the reaction proceeds via the decarboxylation plus decarbonylation pathway. This one-step method provides a new strategy to produce low cloud point, high quality diesel from biomass feedstock in a more economic and attractive way. From vegetable oil to diesel: The one-step hydrotreatment of vegetable oil combining deoxygenation and isomerization provides a new strategy to directly produce low cloud point, high quality diesel from biomass feedstock. The support acidity of the Pt/zeolite bifunctional catalyst greatly influences this process. Over the catalyst with more BrÃnsted acid sites and less strong Lewis acid sites, a more economically attractive pathway occurs. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Transport accounts for about one quarter of South Africa's final energy consumption. Most of the energy used is based on fossil fuels causing significant environmental burdens. This threat becomes even more dominant as a significant growth in transport demand is forecasted, especially in South Africa's economic hub, Gauteng province. The South African government has realized the potential of biofuel usage for reducing oil import dependency and greenhouse gas (GHG) and has hence developed a National Biofuels Industrial Strategy to enforce their use. However, there is limited experience in the country in commercial biofuel production and some of the proposed crops (i.e. rapeseed and sugar beet) have not been yet cultivated on a larger scale. Furthermore, there is only limited research available, looking at the feasibility of commercial scale biofuel production or abatement costs of GHG emissions. To assess the opportunities of biofuel production in South Africa, the production costs and consumer price levels of the fuels recommended by the national strategy are analysed in this article. Moreover, the lifecycle GHG emissions and mitigation costs are calculated compared to the calculated fossil fuel reference including coal to liquid (CTL) and gas to liquid (GTL) fuels. The results show that the cost for biofuel production in South Africa are currently significantly higher (between 30% and 80%) than for the reference fossil fuels. The lifecycle GHG emissions of biofuels (especially for sugar cane) are considerably lower (up to 45%) than the reference fossil GHG emissions. The resulting GHG abatement costs are between 1000 and 2500 ZAR2007 per saved ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, which is high compared to the current European CO2 market prices of ca. 143 ZAR2007 t-1. The analysis has shown that biofuel production and utilization in South Africa offers a significant GHG-mitigation potential but at relatively high cost. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - A sequential esterification and transesterification method was used successfully to convert high free fatty acid oil into biodiesel with almost 100% conversion. The esterification system was catalysed by ferric-alginate beads (0.16:1 ferric-alginate beads to lauric acid mass ratio, 15:1 methanol to lauric acid molar ratio, methanol refluxing temperature (65 °C), reaction time of 3 h) and transesterification was catalysed by boiler ash-calcium oxide mix (3 wt.% boiler ash, calcium oxide according to the stoichiometric amount of water produced in esterification, 15:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, methanol refluxing temperature (65 °C), reaction time of 0.5 h). Calcium oxide played a dual role to absorb the water produced by the esterification of free fatty acid and also as an active species for transesterification of triglycerides. This method was effectively used to convert palm fatty acid distillate to biodiesel with 100% conversion. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, standard diesel, neat biodiesel, biodiesel(85%)-methanol(15%) (B85M15) and biodiesel(85%)-ethanol(15%) (B85E15) fuels are tested. Experiments are carried out using a two-cylinder, 4-cycle, direct injected, water-cooled diesel engine at five loads between no load and a full load of 3000 rpm. Performance and emission characteristics of the engine fueled with biodiesel-ethanol and biodiesel-methanol blends were compared to neat biodiesel and standard diesel fuel as the baseline fuels. Overall, biodiesel-alcohol blends, as compared to diesel, reduce NO emissions while increasing CO and HC emissions, at below 70% loads. It is also shown that biodiesel-ethanol blend is more effective than biodiesel-methanol for emission reduction and overall engine performance. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Energy recovery has been found to be a promising approach for disposal of polymer waste such as expanded polystyrene (EPS) which entraps large volume of air. Biodiesel known as an advantageous alternative fuel possesses bio-solvent attributes and is feasible to be used for energy recovery from EPS. In this study, maximum EPS dissolution value in biodiesel was calculated and a homogenous fuel composition was achieved. At the second phase, several biodiesel-diesel blends (B5) containing various percentages of EPS were tested in a DI diesel engine. Statistical analyses showed that addition of a limited amount of EPS led to a significant emission reduction, NOx in particular, while engine performance criteria remained stable. It was found that B5 blend containing 50 g EPS/L biodiesel was found highly advantageous on both level of performance and emissions. Despite a 3.6% reduction in brake power, a significant decrease in brake specific fuel consumption (8.5%) and increase in brake thermal efficiency (9.8%) were observed at maximum rated power and speed operation condition of the engine when the new fuel was injected. Furthermore, sustainable reductions of CO, CO2, NOx, and soot as the major exhaust emissions were achieved. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel initiatives in India have gained momentum with the national biofuel policy targeting 20% blending of both petrol and diesel by 2017. Most of India's biofuel plans revolve around using sugarcane for bioethanol and jatropha for biodiesel production. This study, taking the southern Indian state of Karnataka as an example, aims at estimating the potential to achieve policy targets. The study spatially analyses land-use change owing to biofuel expansion and its effects on food production. We used an integrated modelling framework to simulate land-use change and bioenergy production under two scenarios - Industrial Economy (IE) and Agricultural Economy (AE). Results indicate that meeting the 20% blending target is a challenging goal to achieve under both scenarios. Bioethanol requirements can be nearly fulfilled (88% under IE and 93% under AE) because of sugarcane expansion. However, biodiesel demands cannot be fulfilled using only degraded lands as currently planned in India, but additional agricultural land (3-4% of the total cropland) will be required for jatrophabased biodiesel production. Food production will not be directly impacted until 2025, because the largest source of additional land could be short- and long-term fallows. We conclude that conservation oriented initiatives, such as water harvesting and energy conservation measures can increase productivities of biofuel crops and reduce fuel demands, respectively. State support and Clean Development Mechanism opportunities can enhance economic incentives for energy cropping. Therefore, a simultaneous and multipronged approach is needed to accommodate food and fuel demands in India. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In the context of energy security, rural development and climate change, India actively promotes the cultivation of Jatropha curcas, a biodiesel feedstock which has been identified as suitable for achieving the Indian target of 20 biofuel blending by 2017. In this paper, we present results concerning the range of environmental impacts of different Jatropha curcas cultivation systems. Moreover, nine agronomic trials in Andhra Pradesh are analysed, in which the yield was measured as a function of different inputs such as water, fertilizer, pesticides, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Further, the environmental impact of the whole Jatropha curcas biodiesel value chain is benchmarked with fossil diesel, following the ISO 14040/44 life cycle assessment procedure. Overall, this study shows that the use of Jatropha curcas biodiesel generally reduces the global warming potential and the nonrenewable energy demand as compared to fossil diesel. On the other hand, the environmental impacts on acidification, ecotoxicity, eutrophication, and water depletion all showed increases. Key for reducing the environmental impact of Jatropha curcas biodiesel is the resource efficiency during crop cultivation (especially mineral fertilizer application) and the optimal site selection of the Jatropha curcas plantations. © 2012 Simon Gmünder et al.

AB  - Bioenergy from crops is expected to make a considerable contribution to climate change mitigation. However, bioenergy is not necessarily carbon neutral because emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4 during crop production may reduce or completely counterbalance CO2 savings of the substituted fossil fuels. These greenhouse gases (GHGs) need to be included into the carbon footprint calculation of different bioenergy crops under a range of soil conditions and management practices. This review compiles existing knowledge on agronomic and environmental constraints and GHG balances of the major European bioenergy crops, although it focuses on dedicated perennial crops such as Miscanthus and short rotation coppice species. Such second-generation crops account for only 3% of the current European bioenergy production, but field data suggest they emit 40% to &gt;99% less N2O than conventional annual crops. This is a result of lower fertilizer requirements as well as a higher N-use efficiency, due to effective N-recycling. Perennial energy crops have the potential to sequester additional carbon in soil biomass if established on former cropland (0.44 Mg soil C ha-1 yr-1 for poplar and willow and 0.66 Mg soil C ha-1 yr-1 for Miscanthus). However, there was no positive or even negative effects on the C balance if energy crops are established on former grassland. Increased bioenergy production may also result in direct and indirect land-use changes with potential high C losses when native vegetation is converted to annual crops. Although dedicated perennial energy crops have a high potential to improve the GHG balance of bioenergy production, several agronomic and economic constraints still have to be overcome. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Biomass in combination with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies is one of few options that makes an actual reduction of global CO2 concentration in the atmosphere possible and is likely to be required to meet low atmospheric concentration of CO2. This study shows the global potential for combining biomass with CCS technologies (bio-CCS) up to 2030 and 2050. The assessment includes six bio-CCS routes for the production of power and biofuels in combination with CCS. For these routes we have analysed the technical and economic potential. The results show the global technical potential for bio-CCS technologies is large and, if deployed, can result in negative greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) up to 10.4Gt CO2 eq. on an annual basis in 2050. This is a large reduction potential compared to the global energy-related CO2 emissions which grew to 30.6Gt CO2 in 2010. The economic potential reaches up to 3.5Gt of negative GHG emissions when assuming a CO2 price of 50€/tonne. Next to quantitative estimates of these potentials in the form of global cost supply curves, we present recommendations to overcome possible barriers and enhance drivers to stimulate the deployment of bio-CCS technologies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mini-grids connecting households to a generator can be a solution for providing rural communities in developing countries with electricity. Substituting diesel with locally produced Jatropha oil can improve economic and environmental sustainability of rural electrification. Jatropha is known as a labor intensive crop, but little is known about how inclusion of human energy input will affect the energy balance of production of Jatropha oil. In this study we investigate human labor requirements in rural electrification with Jatropha oil. Jatropha in this study in Tanzania was grown as living fences and provided multiple benefits. An energy flow chart of generation of electricity from Jatropha oil is presented, and it is shown that human energy expenditure in production of Jatropha oil is small relative to the overall energy in the system. Time consumption however is extensive, and 7.5. hour work is required to harvest and de-hull Jatropha fruit equivalent to 1. kg Jatropha oil. 1 kg Jatropha oil can in turn provide the community with 2.5 kWh electricity through a Multi Functional Platform connected to a local grid. Potential income from harvesting Jatropha is considered so low in the study area that farmers are reluctant to venture into it. Poorer people and children in the community are allowed by the farmers to harvest for free. Collection of seeds for Jatropha oil depends on the availability of labor willing to work for an income of approximately 0.9 USD/day. Social and economic sustainability of rural electrification based on Jatropha oil can be enhanced through generous subsidy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There is a great need to provide energy to rural Africans in order to spark development and help to alleviate poverty. Although . Jatropha curcas L. is no longer considered to be a miracle crop, and large scale Jatropha biofuel programs have struggled, Jatropha still has potential to be successfully used in small scale development projects. To this end, there has been a great deal of interest in Jatropha and studies have shown the potential of Jatropha to be used with multifunctional platforms (MFPs) to provide energy to rural sub-Saharan Africa. This is a review paper which examines research on the various aspects of using Jatropha and MFPs to provide energy to rural Africans. Neat Jatropha can be used as a fuel for the type of simple diesel engines used in MFPs. Jatropha oil can also be converted to biodiesel through esterification and/or transesterification. The Jatropha plant can be used in many other ways and its utility increases the value it can bring to a village. There are challenges to increase the use of Jatropha, and among the greater difficulties are land issues (a Jatropha plantation to provide enough oil to power an MFP for a rural village would probably require about 8 ha after 5 years of growth). Despite the challenges, Jatropha has been successfully used in some development projects and merits further research. © 2012 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - Higher heating value (HHV) is an important property of a fuel, especially for vegetable oils, fats and their derivatives which are intended to replace petroleum fuels. There are lots of methods to evaluate the HHV of a fuel. In this paper, the HHV of vegetable oils, fats and their derivatives (biodiesels) is calculated by using the HHV of their pure fatty acids/methyl esters. The study reveals that, to be in a good agreement with the experimental values, the HHV of the neat compounds must be determined with the highest accuracy. With an error inferior to 2% by comparison to the experimental values, this work shows that the HHV of pure fatty acids or that of methyl esters can be judiciously used to calculate the HHV of the biofuels which they are the components. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - By using 1,3-specific Pig Pancreatic lipase (EC 3.1.1.3 or PPL), covalently immobilized on AlPO4/Sepiolite support as biocatalyst, a new second-generation biodiesel was obtained in the transesterification reaction of sunflower oil with ethanol and other alcohols of low molecular weight. The resulting biofuel is composed of fatty acid ethyl esters and monoglycerides (FAEE/MG) blended in a molar relation 2/1. This novel product, which integrates glycerol as monoacylglycerols (MG) into the biofuel composition, has similar physicochemical properties compared to those of conventional biodiesel and also avoids the removal step of this by-product. The biocatalyst was found to be strongly fixed to the inorganic support (75%). Nevertheless, the efficiency of the immobilized enzyme was reduced to half (49.1%) compared to that of the free PPL. The immobilized enzyme showed a remarkable stability as well as a great reusability (more than 40 successive reuses) without a significant loss of its initial catalytic activity. Immobilized and free enzymes exhibited different reaction mechanisms, according to the different results in the Arrhenius parameters (Ln A and Ea). However, the use of supported PPL was found to be very suitable for the repetitive production of biofuel due to its facile recyclability from the reaction mixture. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The paper reports foremost the results of a successful combustion of an innovative lignocellulosic biofuel in a gas turbine. The fuel was processed through liquefaction of lignocellulosic materials with polyhydroxy alcohols in an acid catalyzed reaction. The liquefaction process features: high efficiency, high liquid yields and inexpensive, easily available process equipment. For the purpose of this analysis the following were developed: an experimental gas turbine with internal combustion chamber, a preheated pressurized fuel supply system with swirl-air fuel injector and a heat exchanger to obtain high primary air temperatures. The paper gives results on the emissions of CO, THC, NOx and soot. For the purpose of benchmarking the turbine was also run on diesel fuel. The paper presents analyses of the underlying phenomena with which it aims to provide guidelines for improvements in the fuel processing and in the experimental equipment. It has been shown that direct utilization of this innovative lignocellulosic biofuel gives promising results. Although the CO and THC emissions are higher compared to the benchmark diesel results it has been shown that both emissions decrease with increased turbine inlet temperature and with the increased fuel preheat temperature, due to a very high viscosity of the fuel. It is additionally shown that NOx emissions are low and comparable to those of the diesel fuel, whereas soot emissions are very low for both fuels. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Decrease of fossil fuel consumption in the energy sector is an important step towards more sustainable energy production. Environmental impacts related to potential future energy systems in Denmark with high shares of wind and biomass energy were evaluated using life-cycle assessment (LCA). Based on the reference year 2008, energy scenarios for 2030 and 2050 were assessed. For 2050 three alternatives for supply of transport fuels were considered: (1) fossil fuels, (2) rapeseed based biodiesel, and (3) Fischer-Tropsch based biodiesel. Overall, the results showed that greenhouse gas emissions per PJ energy supplied could be significantly reduced (from 68 to 17 Gg CO2-eq/PJ) by increased use of wind and residual biomass resources as well as by electrifying the transport sector. Energy crops for production of biofuels and the use of these biofuels for heavy terrestrial transportation were responsible for most environmental impacts in the 2050 scenarios, in particular upstream impacts from land use changes (LUCs), fertilizer use and NOx emissions from the transport sector were critical. Land occupation (including LUC effects) caused by energy crop production increased to a range of 600-2100×106m2/PJ depending on the amounts and types of energy crops introduced. Use of fossil diesel in the transport sector appeared to be environmentally preferable over biodiesel for acidification, aquatic eutrophication and land occupation. For global warming, biodiesel production via Fischer-Tropsch was comparable with fossil diesel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper investigated the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of diesel engine fueled by biodiesel at partial load conditions. Experiments were conducted on a common-rail fuel injection diesel engine using ultra low sulfur diesel, biodiesel (B100) and their blend fuels of 10%, 20%, 50% (denoted as B10, B20 and B50 respectively) under various loads. The results show that biodiesel/blend fuels have significant impacts on the engine's brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) at partial load conditions. The increase in BSFC for B100 is faster than that of pure diesel with the decrease of engine load. A largest increase of 28.1% in BSFC is found at 10% load. Whereas for BTE, the results show that the use of biodiesel results in a reduced thermal efficiency at lower engine loads and improved thermal efficiency at higher engine loads. Furthermore, the characteristics of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions are also changed at partial load conditions. When running at lower engine loads, the CO emission increases with the increase of biodiesel blend ratio and the decrease of engine speed. However, at higher engine loads, an opposite trend is obtained. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In engine combustion studies of bioethanol blended diesel fuels, biodiesel is a very important blending fuel for preventing phase separation between diesel and bioethanol. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of biodiesel in bioethanol blended diesel fuel on ignition delay, premixed combustion phasing, engine performance and exhaust emissions characteristics. In this work, the fuel properties of diesel-bioethanol blends were measured and engine tests were conducted using a single cylinder diesel engine.Based on the experimental results, we found that increasing the biodiesel blending ratio recovered the reduced fuel density and cetane number of bioethanol blended diesel fuel, while the kinematic viscosity and surface tension both increased. In addition, the lower heating value (LHV) slightly decreased when biodiesel fuel was added. By increasing the blending ratio of biodiesel fuel, the ignition delay and the premixed combustion phasing advanced, and the IMEP decreased. However, the premixed combustion duration in all tested blended fuels showed almost similar values, regardless of the biodiesel contents. Biodiesel blending decreased the EI-HC emission in wide engine operating regions. In addition, for the premixed combustion phasing and ignition delay, the increase of biodiesel fuel influenced the decrease of EI-HC emission. In the case of EI-CO and EI-soot emissions at advanced injection timings (around 30° BTDC), when the combustion occurred in the squish area of the combustion chamber, the biodiesel blending impact was clear. The increase of biodiesel fuel reduced EI-CO and EI-soot emissions. In addition, the increase of biodiesel fuel slightly reduced the EI-NO. x emission. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recently, ABNT (Brazilian Association of Technical Standards) has presented a set of norms related to the determination of Na, K, Mg and Ca in biodiesel, recommending procedures similar to those of the European and American norms. However, it has also introduced an alternative norm (ABNT NBR 15556) wherein these 4 elements can be determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (F AAS). This work presents the studies that have supported this proposal and compares the performance of linear source equipment with a continuous source one in the application of the norm. Among the optimized factors, the low aspiration rate and the use of mineral oil solution in xylene to adjust the viscosity between samples and calibration solutions are highlighted. Precision tests (repeatability and intermediary precision) have shown adequate values, confirming the robustness of the method. Limits of detection were suitably below the legislation limits. The accuracy was confirmed by recovery tests as well as by the participation in interlaboratory proficiency tests promoted by the National Agency on Oil, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP, Brazil). The determination of these 4 elements by F AAS brings evident economic advantages to the producer, once F AAS is less expensive to purchase and maintenance. © 2012.

AB  - Some microalgae are particularly attractive as a renewable feedstock for biodiesel production due to their rapid growth, high content of triacylglycerols, and ability to be grown on non-arable land. Unfortunately, obtaining oil from algae is currently cost prohibitive in part due to the need to pump and process large volumes of dilute algal suspensions. In an effort to circumvent this problem, we have explored the use of anion exchange resins for simplifying the processing of algae to biofuel. Anion exchange resins can bind and accumulate the algal cells out of suspension to form a dewatered concentrate. Treatment of the resin-bound algae with sulfuric acid/methanol elutes the algae and regenerates the resin while converting algal lipids to biodiesel. Hydrophobic polymers can remove biodiesel from the sulfuric acid/methanol, allowing the transesterification reagent to be reused. We show that in situ transesterification of algal lipids can efficiently convert algal lipids to fatty acid methyl esters while allowing the resin and transesterification reagent to be recycled numerous times without loss of effectiveness. © 2012 by the authors.

AB  - The present work aims to produce biofuel from fish oil industrial residue and to test the biofuel in diesel engine. A 4.5 kW at 1500 rpm single cylinder air cooled direct injection diesel engine was used for the present experimental work. The experimental results show that the brake thermal efficiency marginally increases with biofuel from 29.98% (neat diesel) to the maximum of 32.4% with biofuel at 80% of maximum load. Also experiments were conducted with different blends of biofuel and diesel (B20 and B40). Though the NOx emissions are high with neat biofuel and blends, the other emissions like CO, HC and particulate matter (PM) are decreased. The PM emissions decrease when the percentage biofuel increases in the blend. It reduces from 8271 ng/s with neat diesel to 8137 ng/s with B40. It further reduces to the minimum of 7842 ng/s with neat biofuel. The cylinder peak pressure increases as the biofuel quantity increases in the blend. The rate of premixed combustion increases with neat biofuel and its blends than neat diesel. Addition of biofuel with diesel decreases the combustion duration and ignition delay due to higher cetane number of biofuel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this experimental study, the influences of re-entrant combustion chamber geometry on a diesel engine emission, performance and on the combustion were investigated using Pongamia Oil Methyl Ester (POME). For this purpose, the pistons with Toroidal Re-entrant Combustion Chamber (TRCC) and Shallow Depth Re-entrant Combustion Chamber having the same volume as that of the baseline Hemispherical open Combustion Chamber were tested in a four stroke, single cylinder, DI diesel engine. Two fuels namely, 20 percent POME blend (20% POME) with petroleum based diesel fuel (PBDF) and PBDF were used for this study. The test results for re-entrant type combustion chambers fuelled with 20% POME and PBDF were compared with baseline engine having hemispherical open type combustion chamber operated with PBDF and 20% POME blend. The test results showed that substantially higher brake thermal efficiency and lower specific fuel consumption for TRCC compared to baseline engine fuelled with 20% POME. Sharp reduction of particulates, CO and UBHC were observed for TRCC compared to the other two. However oxides of nitrogen (NOx) were higher for TRCC. The combustion analysis shows that, the ignition delay is lower for TRCC compared to baseline engine and the peak pressure is also higher at full load. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although algal biofuels possess great potential, profitable production is quite challenging. Much of this challenge is rooted in the thermodynamic constraints associated with producing fuels with high energy, low entropy, and high exergy from dispersed materials. In this study, a preliminary thermodynamic analysis is presented that calculates the energy, entropy, and exergy of the intermediate products for algal biocrude production. These values are also used in an initial attempt to characterize the thermodynamic efficiency of that system. The production pathway is simplified by assuming ideal solutions throughout. Results for the energy and exergy efficiencies, and the first-order energy and exergy return on investment, of the system are given.The summary finding is that the first-order energy return on investment in the best case considered could be as high as 520, as compared to 1.7 × 10-3 in the experimental unit under development. While this analysis shows that significant improvement may be possible, the ultimate thermodynamic efficiency of algal biofuels likely lies closer to the moderate case examined here, which yielded a first-order energy return on investment of 10. For perspective, the first-order energy return on investment for oil and gas production has been estimated in the literature to be ∼35. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Alkali-catalyzed transesterification of waste frying oils (WFO) was carried out in various conditions to investigate the effects of catalyst concentration, reaction time, methanol/oil molar ratio, reaction temperature, catalyst type (hydroxides, methoxides and ethoxides), and purification type (such as washing with hot water, purification with silica gel and dowex) on the biodiesel yields. The optimum conditions were 0.5%wt. of NaOH, 30min reaction time, 50°C reaction temperature, 7.5 methanol to oil ratio and purification with hot distilled water. 96% biodiesel yield with ∼97% ester content was obtained within in these conditions, and the activation energy was found to be as 11741Jmol-1. The determined specifications of obtained biodiesel according to ASTM D 6751 and EN 14214 standards were in accordance with the required limits. As a conclusion, the present study indicates that WFO derived fuel promises being an alternative for petrodiesel, and could be used in engines without a major modification due to its qualifications. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the experimental results carried out to evaluate the oxidation and storage stabilities of various biodiesel fuels. The biodiesel fuels are palm methyl ester (PME), jatropha methyl ester (JME), coconut oil methyl ester (COME), 20% blends of PME with diesel fuel and 20% blends of JME with diesel fuel. The ordinary diesel fuel was used for comparison purposes. Various ASTM standard methods were used to evaluate all the samples at the interval of 180 h over a 2160 h (three months) duration. Oxidation stability of the samples was measured by induction period (IP) using a Rancimat instrument. Other properties such as density, viscosity, flash point, total acid number (TAN), and total base number (TBN) were measured. The results show that almost all fuel samples met the standard specifications regarding IP. The trends for density, viscosity and TAN increased, while the TBN decreased due to oxidation. For the flash point, the trend also decreased, but the rate was very low. In overall consideration, among the biodiesels, COME was found to be better in respect to oxidation and storage stabilities. The results of this investigation will be used to sustainable development of biodiesel fuel from various stock resources. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Volatile hydrocarbon production by Ascocoryne sacroides was studied over its growth cycle. Gas-phase compounds were measured continuously with a proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) and at distinct time points with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using head space solid phase microextraction (SPME). The PTR-MS ion signal permitted temporal resolution of the volatile production while the SPME results revealed distinct compound identities. The quantitative PTR-MS results showed the volatile production was dominated by ethanol and acetaldehyde, while the concentration of the remainder of volatiles consistently reached 2,000 ppbv. The measurement of alcohols from the fungal culture by the two techniques correlated well. Notable compounds of fuel interest included nonanal, 1-octen-3-ol, 1-butanol, 3-methyl- and benzaldehyde. Abiotic comparison of the two techniques demonstrated SPME fiber bias toward higher molecular weight compounds, making quantitative efforts with SPME impractical. Together, PTR-MS and SPME GC-MS were shown as valuable tools for characterizing volatile fuel compound production from microbiological sources. © 2012 Mallette et al.

AB  - With respect to the German goal of a transition to a lead market for electromobility within a short time period, this paper empirically examines the preferences for alternative energy sources or propulsion technologies in vehicles and particularly for electric vehicles. The data stem from a stated preference discrete choice experiment with 598 potential German car buyers. In order to simulate a realistic future purchase situation, seven vehicle types were incorporated in each of the six choice sets, i.e. hybrid, gas, biofuel, hydrogen, and electric vehicles besides common gasoline and diesel vehicles. The econometric analysis with flexible multinomial probit models reveals that potential car buyers in Germany currently have a low stated preference for electric, hydrogen, and hybrid vehicles. While our paper also discusses the impact of common vehicle attributes such as purchase price or service station availability, it particularly considers the effect of socio-demographic and environmental awareness variables. The estimation results reveal that younger potential car buyers have a higher stated preference for hydrogen and electric vehicles, males have a higher stated choice of hydrogen vehicles, and environmentally aware potential car buyers have a higher stated preference for hydrogen and electric vehicles. These results suggest that common policy instruments such as the promotion of research and development, taxation, or subsidization in the field of electromobility could be supplemented by strategies to increase the social acceptance of alternative vehicle types that are directly oriented to these population groups. Methodologically, our study highlights the importance of the inclusion of taste persistence across the choice sets and a high number of random draws in the Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane simulator in the simulated maximum likelihood estimation of the multinomial probit models. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Eutrophication of water bodies is matter of concern for the last few decades because wastewater without treatment can cause serious health effects and disturb functioning of ecosystem. The objective of the current study was to utilize nutrient present in wastewater for algal growth and biodiesel production from harvested biomass of algae. Mixed algae culture (Microspora sp., Diatoms, Lyngbya sp., Cladophora sp., Spirogyra sp. and Rhizoclonium sp.) collected from Botanic Garden of Government College University Lahore was grown in artificial ponds of 13.5 L capacity. Algal growth was monitored for six days by measuring its fresh and dry weight which showed almost similar results of 3.34 g/day and 3 g/day respectively. Uptake of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (55%), total phosphorous (61%), nitrate (97%), phosphate (93%), sulphate (34%) and chloride (41%) was carried by mixed algae culture from wastewater. Seasonal variation in the absorption of nutrients in alternate months of the year showed higher uptake in March, September and November due to favorable conditions for algal growth. Yield of biodiesel produced by transesterification of dried algal biomass was calculated to be 15.13% on an average. Quality of biodiesel was analyzed for kinematic viscosity (4.5 mm2/s), flash point (167°C), specific gravity (0.895 g/ml), iodine value (80 mg/g), acid number (0.65 mg. KOH/g) and water contents (32 mg/kg). It was found that the quality of biodiesel was according to the ASTM standards for biodiesel. © Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2012.

AB  - This study presents a second-order energy return on investment analysis to evaluate the mutual benefits of combining an advanced wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) (with biological nutrient removal) with algal biofuel production. With conventional, independently operated systems, algae production requires significant material inputs, which require energy directly and indirectly, and the WWTP requires significant energy inputs for treatment of the waste streams. The second-order energy return on investment values for independent operation of the WWTP and the algal biofuels production facility were determined to be 0.37 and 0.42, respectively. By combining the two, energy inputs can be reduced significantly. Consequently, the integrated system can outperform the isolated system, yielding a second-order energy return on investment of 1.44. Combining these systems transforms two energy sinks to a collective (second-order) energy source. However, these results do not include capital, labor, and other required expenses, suggesting that profitable deployment will be challenging.

AB  - Worldwide, algal biofuel research and development efforts have focused on increasing the competitiveness of algal biofuels by increasing the energy and financial return on investments, reducing water intensity and resource requirements, and increasing algal productivity. In this study, analyses are presented in each of these areas-costs, resource needs, and productivity-for two cases: (1) an Experimental Case, using mostly measured data for a lab-scale system, and (2) a theorized Highly Productive Case that represents an optimized commercial-scale production system, albeit one that relies on full-price water, nutrients, and carbon dioxide. For both cases, the analysis described herein concludes that the energy and financial return on investments are less than 1, the water intensity is greater than that for conventional fuels, and the amounts of required resources at a meaningful scale of production amount to significant fractions of current consumption (e.g., nitrogen). The analysis and presentation of results highlight critical areas for advancement and innovation that must occur for sustainable and profitable algal biofuel production can occur at a scale that yields significant petroleum displacement. To this end, targets for energy consumption, production cost, water consumption, and nutrient consumption are presented that would promote sustainable algal biofuel production. Furthermore, this work demonstrates a procedure and method by which subsequent advances in technology and biotechnology can be framed to track progress. © 2012 by the authors.

AB  - This paper describes the effect of a mixture of rapeseed methyl ester and diesel oil on fuel consumption and power parameters of tractor engine. The hydraulic dynamometer was used to load the engine of Zetor Forterra 8641 tractor over rear power take-off. The measured tractor is almost new with less than 100 h worked. The measurements were realized for several ratios of diesel oil and rapeseed methyl ester (from pure diesel to pure rapeseed methyl ester). The engine was loaded by the dynamometer in several working points which were predefined by engine speed and its torque. The fuel consumption was measured by the flow meter in each of these points. The reduction of engine's power parameters and the increase of specific fuel consumption are expected due to the nature of rapeseed methyl ester such as e.g. lower calorific value.

AB  - The study of the diesel combustion process is a current topic by the need of thermal efficiency improving and the reduction of pollutant emissions. This circumstance has forced researchers and manufacturers to optimize this process not only in steady state operating conditions but also during transient operation. A zero dimensional thermodynamic diagnostic model, with three species (air, fuel evaporated and burned products), has been used to characterize the combustion process during load increase transient sequences at two different engine speed. In both sequences, three variables were studied: the valve position of the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), the elapsed time of the transition process and the type of fuel. Three biodiesel fuels were tested pure: rapeseed, soybean and sunflower which were compared to a commercial diesel fuel used as reference. Results are presented comparing the in-cylinder average maximum pressure and temperature, and the phasing of the combustion process based on the calculation of heat release. This study has allowed the detection of the effect of the tested engine parameters and the biodiesel fuels used on the in-cylinder thermodynamic conditions during the load transient sequences studied. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper quantitatively assesses the co-benefits of atmospheric CO2 stabilization at 400ppmv by 2100 on air pollutants emissions from road vehicles using a global energy system model treating the road transport sector in detail. It is estimated that the reduction rate of global cumulative emissions of SO2, NOx, and PM from road vehicles during the period 2020-2100 in the 400ppmv CO2 stabilization scenario compared to the no CO2 constraint scenario is 22.1%, 10.8%, and 14.4%, respectively. Such co-benefits are the largest for SO2 because biomass-derived Fischer-Tropsch products are chosen as a major alternative fuel for road transport in the former scenario and because their SO2 emission factor is zero, whereas their NOx and PM emission factors are lower than those for petroleum products only by 27% and 21%, respectively. This implies that introducing liquid biofuels would not lead to a noticeable reduction in NOx and PM emissions. Such co-benefits are the smallest for NOx. The first reason is that, except for 2100 in the no CO2 constraint scenario, heavy-duty trucks account for the largest share of global road vehicles' NOx emissions in the two scenarios throughout the time horizon. The second reason is that in each time period, heavy-duty trucks emit almost the same amount of SO2, NOx, and PM between the scenarios because of almost the same technology and fuel choices in this sector. This implies the necessity of promoting R&amp;D for developing cost-effective low-carbon alternatives to diesel heavy-duty trucks to achieve a further reduction in global air pollutants emissions from road vehicles. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of the paper is the comparison of the injection process with two fuels, a standard diesel fuel and a pure biodiesel, methyl ester of soybean oil. Multiphase cavitating flows inside injector nozzles are calculated by means of unsteady CFD simulations on moving grids from needle opening to closure, using an Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid approach which takes into account bubble dynamics. Afterward, spray evolutions are also evaluated in a Lagrangian framework using results of the first computing step, mapped onto the hole exit area, for the initialization of the primary breakup model. Two nozzles with cylindrical and conical holes are studied and their behaviors are discussed in relation to fuel properties. Nozzle flow simulations highlighted that the extent of cavitation regions is not much affected by the fuel type, whereas it is strongly dependent on the nozzle shape. Biodiesel provides a slightly higher mass flow in highly cavitating nozzles. On the contrary using hole shaped nozzles (to reduce cavitation) diesel provides similar or slightly higher mass flow. Comparing the two fuels, the effects of different viscosities and densities play main role which explains these behaviors. Simulations of the spray evolution are also discussed highlighting the differences between the use of fossil and biodiesel fuels in terms of spray penetration, atomization and cone-angle. Usage of diesel fuel in the conical convergent nozzle gives higher liquid penetration. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We use a combination of petroleum-diesel models, datasets and tools along with biodiesel-specific corrections to create a roadway-level emissions inventory capable of evaluating spatial, temporal and scale aspects of fuel distribution options for the Midwestern US. Specifically, we compare the emissions of a year-round "low-blend" biodiesel implementation scenario, already under consideration in a variety of states, with a more strategic summer-only, interstate-only "high-blend" scenario. Our results indicate that spatial and seasonal distribution decisions do affect the overall emissions impacts of any biodiesel deployment, even those at low-blend levels. However, we also finds that changes in emissions due to biodiesel are considerably smaller than those anticipated from improvements to engine and control technologies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Dual-injection strategies in spark-ignition (SI) engines allow the in-cylinder blending of two different fuels at any blend ratio, when simultaneously combining port fuel injection (PFI) and direct-injection (DI). This offers increased flexibility and the potential to optimize the combustion process depending on the engine requirement and fuel availability. Until now, little or no research evidence exists on the experimental comparison of dual-injection to DI in the combustion of gasoline-biofuel blends. Therefore, in this work the authors evaluate this comparison using a new biofuel candidate: 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF). The differences in performance are examined using D25 (25% DMF in gasoline, by volume) in a single cylinder SI research engine operating at 1500. rpm and varying load (3.5-8.5. bar IMEP). All tests were carried out at stoichiometry (λ= 1) using the cross-over theory of the carbon monoxide and oxygen emissions concentrations. The current results are promising for dual-injection. The improved mixture preparation compared to DI results in lower combustion durations and higher in-cylinder pressures. This gives rise to higher indicated thermal efficiencies and lower fuel consumption rates compared to the same blend (D25) in DI (up to 4% and 3.2%, respectively). More significantly, the lower fuel consumption rate with dual-injection (on a volumetric basis), is up to 1.2% lower than with gasoline in homogenous DI (GDI) up to 8. bar IMEP, despite the use of a lower energy density biofuel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the present work, a statistical investigation is conducted in order to quantify the effects of biodiesel blending on the regulated exhaust emissions. To this aim, the available literature on biodiesel emissions during transient/driving cycles up to the end of 2011 was gathered and the reported measurements were statistically analyzed with respect to the biodiesel percentage in the fuel blend. From the analysis, collective results, statistical data and best-fit quadratic regression curves are derived based on the emission measurements from all driving cycles. Furthermore, the effects of engine type (heavy or light-duty), dynamometer schedule (chassis or engine), engine model year and biodiesel feedstock are deducted, with separate best-fit curves provided for each case and for each exhaust pollutant. The various trends observed are discussed and explained based on fundamental aspects of diesel engine combustion and emissions. It is believed that the results of this study can prove useful to administrations and international institutions by providing a good estimate of the vehicle fleet's expected emission changes when running on biodiesel blends over neat diesel, enabling long-term planning and accommodating decision making. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work reports the use of mid- and near-infrared spectroscopy (MIR and NIR) to predict the kinematic and dynamic viscosities of biodiesel-diesel blends. A partial least square regression (PLSR) modeling method was employed to develop the calibration models based on information from four commonly used biodiesel and three different commercial diesel fuels. For MIR spectroscopy, wavelengths in the fingerprint region of 550-1500cm-1 were chosen for developing the model. The root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) for kinematic viscosity and dynamic viscosity were 0.114 and 0.119mm2/s, respectively, based on the validation set that consisted of 26 biodiesel-diesel blend samples made of six different biodiesel and three different diesel fuels. For the NIR spectroscopy, the PLSR model established using the spectral regions of 1100-1500nm, 1600-1700nm, and 1800-2200nm obtained better results. The RMSEP were 0.070mm2/s for kinematic viscosity and 0.062mm2/s for dynamic viscosity prediction. The results indicated that both MIR and NIR can be used to accurately predict the viscosities of biodiesel-diesel blends, but better results can be obtained using NIR spectroscopy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Due to using of fossil fuels, the world today is faced with serious environmental pollution. However, these fuels are limited and depleting day by day as the consumption is increasing very rapidly. Hence, it is necessary to find out a clean alternative fuel produced from renewable sources. Biodiesel is an alternative fuel that can be used directly in diesel engine as pure or blended with diesel fuel. In this study, the effects of biodiesel produced from waste cooking oil (WCO) and its different blends with diesel fuel on the tractor diesel engine torque and power, oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions, brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake thermal efficiency, cylinder pressure and hear release rate are analysed and presented. Use of WCO biodiesel results in advanced start of injection, advanced combustion process, shorter ignition delay and increased heat release rate. Thus, higher cylinder peak pressure and temperature lead to increase NOx while PM is reduced. Although, the increase of the WCO percentage in the fuel blend reduces the engine torque and power, the results show some torque and power recovery for this reduction. The lower heating value of WCO results in increased BSFC but the engine brake thermal efficiency is not affected significantly. Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is an effective technique for reducing NOx emissions when using biodiesel-diesel fuel blends. When same percentage of EGR are used in the cases of diesel and WCO, NOx emissions are reduced to similar values, but the PM emissions are significantly lower in the case of WCO biodiesel. Thus, biodiesel with EGR can be used to reduce NOx and PM emissions simultaneously. The brake thermal efficiency obtained with WCO biodiesels is higher than that of diesel fuel when applying same EGR rate. Similarly, the reduction of engine torque and increase of BSFC are lower with WCO biodiesels with respect to diesel fuel. Thus, EGR has lower negative effect on engine performance in case of WCO biodiesels compared to diesel fuel.

AB  - Biodiesel continues to be an alternative fuel of interest for use in diesel engines. Although biodiesel's properties are similar to petroleum diesel's, certain differences create possibilities for parameters, such as efficiency, to be different. The objective of the study is to identify the parameters that influence gross indicated fuel conversion efficiency and how they are affected by the use of biodiesel relative to petroleum diesel, in a production-ready diesel engine. This study of nine operating conditions observes mostly insignificant differences in efficiency among the three fuels. This seems to result from a tradeoff between biodiesel's inherently shorter combustion durations, which phases combustion better for higher efficiency, and its inherently lower air-fuel ratios, which causes a relatively lower ratio of specific heats resulting in lower efficiency. Both features seem to be linked to the fuel-bound oxygen of biodiesel. Because of the changing fractions of premixed and diffusion combustion and turbocharger performance at different engine speeds and loads, the influences of the two competing factors vary with operating condition. Significant differences in efficiency are mostly manifested by system response issues, where the engine controller alters due to a response of an interpreted higher load with the use of the lower energy-density biodiesel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Colombian Biofuels Policy defines many aspects of biofuel production but whether the policy is feasible is not known. This paper takes a holistic view of the country-level production and distribution system to evaluate policy feasibility. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer programming model and analyse the Colombian biodiesel policy given their current infrastructure, feedstock supply and demand. Model results provide several useful insights on how to design the overall system and also to support policy decision-makers. This paper contributes to the literature by analysing how the production-distribution network structure affects the cost and feasibility of biodiesel adoption. © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The use of vegetable oils in diesel engines is nearly as old as the diesel engine itself. The use of vegetable oils as motor fuel has become more attractive recently because of their environmental benefits and the fact that it is made from renewable resources. Vegetable oils can be used as fuels for Diesel engines, but their viscosities are much higher than usual diesel fuel and require modifications of the engines. Transesterification has been considered to reduce the high viscosity of vegetable oils. The competitive potential of biodiesel is limited by the price of vegetable oils, which strongly influences the final price of this biofuel. The most common raw materials for biodiesel in the US today are virgin soybean oil, animal fats, and recycled vegetable oil. The fact is that biodiesel fuels produced from vegetable oils and animal fats are very similar. © Sila Science.

AB  - This study uses a global chemical transport model to estimate the distribution of isocyanic acid (HNCO). HNCO is toxic, and concentrations exceeding 1 ppbv have been suggested to have negative health effects. Based on fire studies, HNCO emissions were scaled to those of hydrogen cyanide (30%), resulting in yearly total emissions of 1.5 Tg for 2008, from both anthropogenic and biomass burning sources. Loss processes included heterogeneous uptake (pH dependent), dry deposition (like formic acid), and reaction with the OH radical (k=1×10-15 molecule-1cm3s-1). Annual mean surface HNCO concentrations were highest over parts of China (maximum of 470 pptv), but episodic fire emissions gave much higher levels, exceeding 4 ppbv in tropical Africa and the Amazon, and exceeding 10 ppbv in Southeast Asia and Siberia. This suggests that large biomass burning events could result in deleterious health effects for populations in these regions. For the tropospheric budget, using the model-calculated pH the HNCO lifetime was 37days, with the split between dry deposition and heterogeneous loss being 95%:5%. Fixing the heterogeneous loss rate at pH= 7 meant that this process dominated, accounting for ∼70% of the total loss, giving a lifetime of 6days, and resulting in upper tropospheric concentrations that were essentially zero. However, changing the pH does not notably impact the high concentrations found in biomass burning regions. More observational data is needed to evaluate the model, as well as a better representation of the likely underestimated biofuel emissions, which could mean more populations exposed to elevated HNCO concentrations. © 2012.

AB  - The thermal decomposition of methyl decanoate (MD) was studied in a bench-scale pyrolysis set-up equipped with a dedicated on-line analysis section including a GC×GC-FID/(TOF-MS). This analysis section enables quantitative and qualitative on-line analyses of the entire reactor effluent with high level of detail including measurement of formaldehyde and water. The reactor temperature was varied from 873K to 1123K at a fixed pressure of 1.7bar and a fixed residence time of 0.5s, for both high (10molN2/molMD) and low (0.6molN2/molMD) nitrogen dilution. Thus covering a wide conversion range in both dilution regimes. In these experiments, significant amounts of large linear olefins and unsaturated esters were observed at lower temperatures, the amounts of which decreased at higher temperatures in favor of permanent gasses (CO, CO2, CH4) and light olefins. At the highest temperatures more than 5wt% of mono-aromatic and poly-aromatic components were observed. The acquired dataset was used to validate 3 recently published microkinetic models which were developed to model oxidation and/or pyrolysis of methyl decanoate. The results showed that these models accurately predict the product distribution, although important discrepancies were observed for some major products such as certain unsaturated esters, CO2 and H2O. Reaction path analyses and CBS-QB3 quantum-chemical calculations are presented and discussed in order to explain the observed differences. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A lumped kinetic model of methyl butanoate pyrolysis and oxidation is presented and discussed in this work. The hierarchical approach first required the development and validation of sub-mechanisms of small esters such as methyl formate, methyl acrylate and methyl crotonate. A broad-ranging validation of the whole kinetic scheme of methyl butanoate oxidation was then carried out through comparisons with experimental data obtained in shock tube devices, plug flow and jet stirred reactors, rapid compression machines and premixed laminar flames. A detailed analysis of laminar flame speeds complements and extends this kinetic study. The lumped model predicts a wide range of experiments well, thus constituting a flexible and reliable kinetic scheme despite the reduced number of species involved. Moreover, this lumped approach and the proposed model lay the foundation for an extension to biodiesel fuel modeling. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The study assesses the environmental sustainability of palm biodiesel production systems in Thailand by focusing on their energy efficiency and environmental impact potentials. The Net Energy Balance (NEB) and Renewability indicate energy gain for palm biodiesel and its co-products as compared to fossil energy inputs. In addition, life cycle assessment also reveals lower values of environmental impact potentials of biodiesel as compared to conventional diesel. For example, palm biodiesel can provide greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction of around 46-73% as compared to diesel. Nitrogen-fertilizer production and application in the plantation and the air emissions from the ponds treating palm oil mill effluent (POME) are found to be the major environmental aspects. However, the energy and environmental performances depend on various factors such as the management efficiency of empty fruit bunches (EFB) and POME and the possible land-use change in the future. Recommendations are made for improving environmental performance of palm biodiesel and for securing the long-term availability of crude palm oil supply with a view towards sustainable palm biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Experiments are carried out by using dual biodiesel blends and compared it with diesel fuel characteristics. The literatures were focused on single biodiesel and its blends. So far a very few dual biodiesel blends of oils have been tried on diesel engine leaving a lot of scope in this area. This paper investigated the performance and emission characteristics of various dual biodiesel blends (mixture of jatropha biodiesel and neem biodiesel) with diesel on a stationary single cylinder, four stroke direct injection compression ignition engine. The blends of BB 10 (combination of Diesel 90% by volume, jatropha biodiesel 5% by volume and Neem biodiesel 5% by volume) and BB 20 (combination of Diesel 80% by volume, jatropha biodiesel 10% by volume and Neem biodiesel 10% by volume) gave better brake thermal efficiency and lower brake specific fuel consumption than other dual biodiesel blends (BB 40, BB 80 and BB 100). The blends of BB 10 and BB 20 have superior emission characteristics than other blends and closer to diesel values. © Euro Journals Publishing, Inc. 2012.

AB  - We provide a quantitative assessment of the prospects for current and future biomass feedstocks for bioenergy in Australia, and associated estimates of the greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation resulting from their use for production of biofuels or bioelectricity. National statistics were used to estimate current annual production from agricultural and forest production systems. Crop residues were estimated from grain production and harvest index. Wood production statistics and spatial modelling of forest growth were used to estimate quantities of pulpwood, in-forest residues, and wood processing residues. Possible new production systems for oil from algae and the oilseed tree Pongamia pinnata, and of lignocellulosic biomass production from short-rotation coppiced eucalypt crops were also examined. The following constraints were applied to biomass production and use: avoiding clearing of native vegetation; minimizing impacts on domestic food security; retaining a portion of agricultural and forest residues to protect soil; and minimizing the impact on local processing industries by diverting only the export fraction of grains or pulpwood to bioenergy. We estimated that it would be physically possible to produce 9.6 GL yr-1 of first generation ethanol from current production systems, replacing 6.5 GL yr-1 of gasoline or 34% of current gasoline usage. Current production systems for waste oil, tallow and canola seed could produce 0.9 GL yr-1 of biodiesel, or 4% of current diesel usage. Cellulosic biomass from current agricultural and forestry production systems (including biomass from hardwood plantations maturing by 2030) could produce 9.5 GL yr-1 of ethanol, replacing 6.4 GL yr-1 of gasoline, or ca. 34% of current consumption. The same lignocellulosic sources could instead provide 35 TWh yr-1, or ca. 15% of current electricity production. New production systems using algae and P. pinnata could produce ca. 3.96 and 0.9 GL biodiesel yr-1, respectively. In combination, they could replace 4.2 GL yr-1 of fossil diesel, or 23% of current usage. Short-rotation coppiced eucalypt crops could provide 4.3 GL yr-1 of ethanol (2.9 GL yr-1 replacement, or 15% of current gasoline use) or 20.2 TWh yr-1 of electricity (9% of current generation). In total, first and second generation fuels from current and new production systems could mitigate 26 Mt CO2-e, which is 38% of road transport emissions and 5% of the national emissions. Second generation fuels from current and new production systems could mitigate 13 Mt CO2-e, which is 19% of road transport emissions and 2.4% of the national emissions lignocellulose from current and new production systems could mitigate 48 Mt CO2-e, which is 28% of electricity emissions and 9% of the national emissions. There are challenging sustainability issues to consider in the production of large amounts of feedstock for bioenergy in Australia. Bioenergy production can have either positive or negative impacts. Although only the export fraction of grains and sugar was used to estimate first generation biofuels so that domestic food security was not affected, it would have an impact on food supply elsewhere. Environmental impacts on soil, water and biodiversity can be significant because of the large land base involved, and the likely use of intensive harvest regimes. These require careful management. Social impacts could be significant if there were to be large-scale change in land use or management. In addition, although the economic considerations of feedstock production were not covered in this article, they will be the ultimate drivers of industry development. They are uncertain and are highly dependent on government policies (e.g. the price on carbon, GHG mitigation and renewable energy targets, mandates for renewable fuels), the price of fossil oil, and the scale of the industry. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This work attempts to develop a correlation to predict thermal NOx formation in compression ignition (CI) engine when fuelled with diesel and biodiesel. Attention was focussed on both the fuel properties (cetane number, density) and engine design factors (bore, stroke, compression ratio, fuel injection timing) while developing correlation, ensuring that it is suitable for all CI engine fuels tested on both constant and variable speed engines. It was observed that NOx emissions predicted through the correlation is comparable with those of the measured ones. The general trend is observed to be the same for both the predicted and measured NOx emission. At loads more than 25% of the rated load the difference is found to be within 10% while the difference is slightly higher at loads less than 25%. It was also observed that the error was in the range of 10-20% at modified fuel injection timings for all the three esters at standard injection timing. This correlation yields comparatively accurate results for all the fuels at loads greater than 25% of the rated load and at standard fuel injection timing. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Global warming, high-energy demand and availability of new technologies are among the factors catalyzing the search for alternative sources of energy. Currently, there is renewed interest in obtaining energy from wastes hitherto meant for disposal. Increased costs of disposal and their attendant problems of heavy environmental loading are some aspects making the disposal option unattractive. These wastes are sources of energy and among the several sources of generating this energy are the waste-to-energy (WTE) categories with potentials for useable fuel production. The WTE materials are mainly used domestic waste oils (UDWOs), municipal solid waste (MSW), agricultural and industrial wastes. However, the latter wastes are not attractive as they consist of innumerable hazardous contaminants. The UDWOs are arguably a safe and cost effective source of useable fuel. Their conversion offers the merits of a reduction in greenhouse gas emission (GHG), enhancing fuel diversification and a qualitatively comparable energy output to fossil diesel fuels. Thus, UDWOs could significantly contribute towards achieving the 2020 and 2030 goals of substituting approximately 20% and 30% of petro-diesel with biofuels in US and EU, respectively. Moreover, attaining the forecasted annual production rate of 227 billion liters of biofuel by most active stakeholders in the biodiesel industry could be easily achieved. This review aims to analyze the performance of biodiesel fuels obtained from UDWO and to demonstrate the suitability of applying these fuels as substitutes to mineral diesel in various industries. Benefits of UDWO as a biodiesel feedstock were as well highlighted. © 2012 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Heterogeneous basic catalysts can be used for biodiesel production. The performances of several types of such materials are described in the literature but small attention is given to its deactivation in reaction medium. This paper put in evidence that catalysts are not static identities in the reaction medium, and relates the physical characteristics of fresh and post reaction samples with deactivation mechanisms.Catalysts, tested during the methanolysis of soybean oil, were prepared by thermal activation of Ce modified Mg-Al hydrotalcites (Mg/Al = 3, Ce/Mg < 0.1 atomic ratios). Calcination at 575 °C allows to nanostructured samples with main XRD lines belonging to periclase and cerianite. Additionally, calcined samples containing 3% and 5% of Ce showed hydrotalcite patterns pointed out that cerium promotes the fast rehydration and restructuration. All the prepared samples showed contamination with sodium aluminate which masks the Ce effect on the catalysts basicity due to its strong basicity. In the tested conditions, the catalysts with Ce/Mg > 0.03 (atomic ratio) presented FAME yields higher than 90%. Thermogravimetry analysis of post reaction catalysts evidenced that cerium influences the reaction mechanism. The post reaction catalysts evidenced that surface restructuring occurs during reaction with sizeable change of the elements distribution which as beneficial effect on the catalytic performances. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The use of oxygenated bio-fuels like bio diesel and ethanol in combination with diesel is an effective measure to substitute renewable fuels and reduce particulate matter (PM) from in-use diesel vehicles. To study the fuel performance, three oxygenated blend fuel designs containing volumes of 15% ethanol with cetane improver additive, 10% ethanol with 10% bio diesel and 15% ethanol with 20% bio diesel were formed. The physical stability of ethanol diesel blend is studied and phase separation is prevented by adding co solvents like Tetrahydrafuran and bio diesel. To meet stricter emission norms, now diesel engines are fitted with after treatment devices. This paper describes the engine and emission characteristics of the above blend fuels on a 4 cylinder, naturally aspirated light duty diesel engine fitted with diesel oxidation catalyst. The engine test results show that it is feasible to use these blends in diesel engines: the thermal efficiencies of the engine fueled by the blends are comparable with that fueled by diesel, with small increase in fuel consumption, due to the lower heating value of ethanol and bio diesel. The smoke emissions from the engine fueled by the blends are lower than that fueled by diesel owing to the increased oxygen content. The reduction is more at higher loads. The HC and CO emissions are found to be higher at lower loads due to the lower cetane number of ethanol. However, NO emissions depend on load conditions and blend contents. © 2006-2012 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

AB  - What is the algal energy? What kinds of energy are there in algae? How is energy obtained from algae? Algae can be grown almost anywhere. Algae are photosynthetic organisms that can produce lipids, proteins and carbohydrates in large amounts over short periods of time. These products can be processed into both biofuels and useful chemicals. Algae can be converted to bioethanol, bio-oil, biohydrogen and biomethane via thermochemical and biochemical methods. Algal oil can be converted to biodiesel with methyl alcohol transesterification. Algal technology also covers the economic, ecological, and biotechnological applications of algae, algal biodiversity, classification systems, molecular phylogenetics. Use of biodiesel from oilgae is a promising alternative to solve air pollution problems. © Sila Science.

AB  - The European Union Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC (RED) has adopted climate change assessment as one of the environmental criteria used to evaluate the level of sustainability by indicating the impact values for every phase of the biofuel chain. This paper shows the results of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cultivation of sunflower for biodiesel production in Tuscany, Italy. In the five case studies, the GHG emissions of sunflower cultivation exceed the default value (18 g [CO2eq] MJ-1) indicated by the RED. This is mainly due to diesel consumption and emissions from nitrogen fertilisers that are on average 180% and 255% higher than the reference values, respectively. GHG emissions allocation among sunflower biodiesel and co-products was made according to energy content principle. Only the biodiesel from sunflower cultivated in the two most efficient farms achieved a GHG saving with respect to conventional diesel (36%) that made it possible to fulfil the RED's requirements. From these results, it seems that the observance of such requirements on GHG emissions for sunflower biodiesel cultivation phase in Tuscany will not be easy to satisfy without a significant revision of local farm practices, aimed primarily at reducing the use of nitrogen fertilisers and diesel consumption. In fact, the GHG emissions reported in the RED for sunflower cultivation were calculated using excessively low farm inputs compared with the typical amounts for sunflower cultivation practices in Tuscany. © 2012 IAgrE.

AB  - Combustion and emission characteristics of rapeseed plant oil (RSO) and its blends with diesel fuel have been investigated in a multi-cylinder direct injection diesel engine. Plant oils have high viscosities compared to diesel and this affects the performance and durability of automotive diesel engines when used for longer time periods. Despite these adverse effects the exhaust emissions analysis show a significant reduction in NO. x and relatively higher amount of soot for RSO compared to diesel fuel. An attempt has been made to reduce soot emissions from the combustion of RSO to exploit the advantage of its low NO. x emissions. The strategy of varying injection parameters such as injection pressures and injection timings have been used in this work to reduce the soot emissions for blends of 50% and 30% RSO in diesel fuel. Using this strategy it was possible to achieve diesel equivalent levels of soot emission for 30% RSO blend. Under diesel equivalent soot emission levels, it was also possible to achieve a further reduction in NO. x emissions by up to 22% for 30% RSO blend, this was achieved at the expense of THC, CO and BSFC. The exhaust soot particle number concentrations for 30% RSO blend reduces with an increase in injection pressure and retarded injection timing. However, when compared to diesel, the exhaust soot particle number concentration for 30% RSO blend was still higher, even after diesel equivalent level of soot emission was achieved. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesels are often marketed as being cleaner than regular diesel for emissions. Emission test results depend on the biodiesel blend, but laboratory tests suggest that biodiesels decrease particulate matter, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and air toxins when compared to regular diesel. Results for the amount of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) have been less conclusive. Tests have also not evaluated the commonly available ranges of biodiesel blends in the laboratory. Additionally, little information is available from on-road studies, so the effectiveness of using biodiesels to reduce actual emissions is unknown. A more complex relationship exists between engine operation and the rate of emission production than is typically evaluated using engine or chassis dynamometer tests. On-road emissions can vary dramatically because emissions are correlated to engine mode. Additionally, activity such as idling, acceleration, deceleration, and operation against a grade can produce higher emissions than more stable engine operating modes. Because these modes are not well captured in a laboratory environment, understanding on-road relationships is critical in evaluating the emissions reductions that may be possible with biodiesels. More tests and quantifications of the effects of different blends on engine and vehicle performance are required to promote widespread use of biodiesel. The objective of this research was to conduct on-road tests to compare the emission impacts of different blends of biodiesel to regular diesel fuel under different operating conditions. The team conducted on-road tests that utilized a portable emissions monitoring system that was used to instrument transit buses. Regular diesel and different blends of biodiesel were evaluated during on-road engine operation by instrumenting three in-use transit buses, from the CyRide system of Ames, Iowa, along anexisting transit route. Implications: This paper summarizes an evaluation of on-road emissions for regular diesel, 10% biodiesel (B-10), and 20% biodiesel (B-20) in three in-use buses. Biodiesel is attractive because it can be produced domestically and laboratory tests have suggested it can reduce HC, CO, and PM however it may contribute to increased NOx. On-road emissions however can be different from laboratory tests so results from on-road emission studies can help validate these findings. Study results show a certain amount of variability but are fairly consistent with what has been reported in the literature. Results also show that emissions are highly correlated to engine load. © 2012 A&amp;WMA.

AB  - Different nanostructured supports, based on 1-decyl-2-methyimidazolium cations covalently attached to a polystyrene divinylbenzene porous matrix, were used as carriers to immobilise Candida antarctica lipase B. The suitability of these immobilised lipase derivatives for the synthesis of biodiesel (methyl oleate) by the methanolysis of triolein has been tested in both tert-butanol and supercritical (sc)CO2 (18 MPa, 45 °C) as reaction media. The use of modified supports with low ionic-liquid loading covalently attached to the main polymeric backbone chains provide structured materials that led to the best biodiesel yields (up to 95 %) and operational stability (85 % biodiesel yield after 45 cycles of 8-4 h) in scCO2 (45 °C, 18 MPa). The presence of tert-butanol as an inert cosolvent in the scCO2 phase at the same concentration as triolein was key to avoid poisoning the biocatalyst through the blockage of its active sites by the polar byproduct (glycerol) produced in the biodiesel synthesis. © 2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH&amp;Co.

AB  - Researchers around the world are developing sustainable plant-based liquid transportation fuels (biofuels) to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Algae are attractive because they promise large yields per acre compared to grasses, grains and trees, and because they produce oils that might be converted to diesel and gasoline equivalents. It takes considerable energy to produce algal biofuels with current technology; thus, the potential benefits of algal biofuels compared to petroleum fuels must be quantified. To this end, we identified key parameters for algal biofuel production using GREET, a tool for the life-cycle analysis of energy use and emissions in transportation systems. The baseline scenario produced 55400 g CO2 equivalent per million BTU of biodiesel compared to 101000g for low-sulfur petroleum diesel. The analysis considered the potential for greenhouse gas emissions from anaerobic digestion processes commonly used in algal biofuel models. The work also studied alternative scenarios, e.g., catalytic hydrothermal gasification, that may reduce these emissions. The analysis of the nitrogen recovery step from lipid-extracted algae (residues) highlighted the importance of considering the fate of the unrecovered nitrogen fraction, especially that which produces N 2O, a potent greenhouse gas with global warming potential 298 times that of CO2. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Bio-oil from fast pyrolysis of biomass is a low-grade liquid fuel, which can be upgraded through the emulsification with diesel oil. In this study, we prepared two rice husk bio-oil samples with different solid char contents and three bio-oil/diesel-oil emulsion samples with the bio-oil content of 10 wt%, 30 wt% and 50 wt%, respectively. The lubrication properties of these oil samples were evaluated by a four-ball tester. The morphologies of the worn ball surface were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The chemical states of the elements on the worn surface and non-worn surface were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS). The results showed that the bio-oil possessed better extreme-pressure, anti-wear and friction-reducing properties than the commercial diesel oil (number zero). The solid char particles in the bio-oil could improve its lubrication performance. Moreover, the lubrication ability of the emulsions would be enhanced with the increasing of the bio-oil content in the emulsions. © 2012 by the authors.

AB  - As compared to petroleum diesel, biodiesel is more corrosive for automotive materials. Studies on the characterization of corrosion products of fuel exposed automotive materials are scarce. Automotive fuel system and engine components are made from different ferrous and non-ferrous materials. The present study aims to investigate the corrosion products of different types of automotive materials such as copper, brass, aluminum and cast iron upon exposure to diesel and palm biodiesel. Changes in fuel properties due to exposure of different materials were also examined. Degradation of metal surface was characterized by digital camera, SEM/EDS and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fuel properties were examined by measuring TAN (total acid number), density and viscosity. Among the metal investigated, copper is found to be least resistant in biodiesel and formed comparatively more corrosion products than other metals. Upon exposure of metals in biodiesel, TAN number crosses the limit given by standard while density and viscosity remain within the acceptable range of limit. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, standard diesel fuel, biodiesel (45%)-methanol (10%)-diesel (45%), biodiesel (40%)-methanol (20%)-diesel (40%), biodiesel (45%)-ethanol (10%)-diesel (45%) and biodiesel (40%)-ethanol (20%)-diesel (40%) blends are tested in a compression ignited engine under the same operating conditions. Performance and emission characteristics of the engine fueled with biodiesel-methanol-diesel (BMD) and biodiesel-ethanol-diesel (BED) are compared to standard diesel fuel as the baseline. Overall, biodiesel-alcohol-diesel blends show a higher brakespecific fuel consumption than diesel. As alcohol concentrations in blends increase, CO and HC emissions increase, while NO emissions are reduced. Also, methanol blends are more effective than ethanol blends for reducing CO and HC emissions, while NO reduction is achieved by ethanol blends. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This research presents a technical simulation and economic model of three small-scale technical alternatives supplying a typical rural homestead electricity load: a 15kVA wood gasification unit coupled to a 6kWe modified grid-connected petrol generator; the same system operating as a stand-alone system, and; a 6kWe diesel generator, all modelled against the electricity network in the southwest (SW) of Western Australia (WA). The three technical alternatives are supplemented by a further four comparative scenarios, including zero woodgas fuel and labour costs, generous capital and feed-in-tariff subsidies, and also the displacement of mineral diesel with biodiesel. The results quantify technical outputs of the systems and also the associated financial and greenhouse gas emissions of each system and scenario. The results indicate that significant mitigation is possible from each regional household using woodgas technologies or biodiesel fuels, yet the associated costs of this mitigation is extremely high when compared to the electricity network. In light of the extremely high cost of electricity and mitigation using small-scale bioenergy systems, governments may consider re-allocation of small-scale grid-connected distributed energy support mechanisms towards larger regional bioenergy projects, or risk increasing the electricity prices for private entities and governments. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels, which are produced from renewable vegetable sources are considered as a good solution to reduce the European dependence on fossil fuel sources, from a geostrategic and environmental point of view. Because of the high proportion of diesel vehicles in Europe, biodiesel still remains by far the most produced biofuel, far ahead of ethanol. Biodiesel is obtained by transesterification of vegetable oils with an alcohol, usually methanol to produce methyl esters. This paper aims to present the contribution of the French institute IFP Energies nouvelles to this issue, through the development of two processes for biodiesel production by means of homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis. More recent developments have focused on hydrotreating vegetable oils and are also detailed in this paper. Fuels from this latest technology are drop-in fuels allowing higher incorporation rates and offering excellent qualities for diesel engines and potentially for incorporation in Jet fuel.

AB  - Jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.), an important biofuel plant, is highly sensitive to cold stress, which has limited its distribution to subtropical arid regions. Seed priming technique was applied to Jatropha strain DARL-2 to improve seed germination and survival on subsequent exposure of the seedlings to cold (4 °C) stress for 10 days. Jatropha seeds were treated with various priming agents for 24 h, and the priming agents' effect was assessed on germination as well as on survival upon exposure of the seedlings to cold. Seed priming significantly (P ≤ 0.05) improved germination percentage and opening of cotyledonary leaves. Similarly, germination rate, expressed as Timson's index and the rate of emergence of true leaves, was significantly higher in all the priming treatments than those for unsoaked control (US). On exposure to cold 65 days after sowing (DAS), the plants grown from primed seeds exhibited significantly (P ≤ 0.05) lower leaf senescence, which was associated with significantly higher (62.0-66.3%) relative water content (RWC) than the plants from unsoaked seeds (47.8%). Also in response to cold stress, the membrane damage (MD) was significantly higher in the control (72.4%) than in the plants grown from primed seeds (37.6-49.4%), except thiourea (TU) treatment. Thus, the results indicate that chemical seed priming could be an effective pre-germination strategy for successful cultivation of Jatropha in cold, arid regions. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A pilot-scale microwave heating apparatus was constructed for the production of bio-oil from sewage sludge, and the effects of important microwave processing parameters and chemical additives on the quality and yield of bio-oils were investigated. It was found that bio-oil was mainly formed at the pyrolysis temperature range of 200-400 °C. A higher heating rate (faster pyrolysis) not only increased the yield of bio-oil, but also improved the quality of bio-oil according to the elemental composition and calorific values. The maximum bio-oil yield was 30.4% of organic fraction, obtained from the pyrolysis of original sewage sludge at microwave radiation power of 8.8 kW and final pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C. All of five simple additives (KOH, H2SO4, H3BO3, ZnCl2, and FeSO4) reduced the bio-oil yield, but the composition and property of bio-oil varied with the additive types greatly. KOH, H2SO 4, H3BO3 and FeSO4 were found to improve the quality of bio-oils remarkably according to the calorific value, density, viscosity and carbon content of bio-oils, but ZnCl2 treatment went against that. GC-MS analysis of the bio-oils showed that, alkali treatment promoted the formation of alkanes and monoaromatics, while acid treatment favored the formation of heterocyclics, ketones, alcohols and nitriles. Compared with sulfate slat FeSO4, chloride salt ZnCl 2 was a better catalyst for selective catalytic pyrolysis of sewage sludge. The addition of ZnCl2 only promoted the formation reactions of a few kinds of nitriles and ketones remarkably. It is technologically feasible to produce bio-oil form microwave-induced pyrolysis of sewage sludge by optimizing pyrolysis conditions and selecting appropriate additives. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study tests the assumptions that justified the establishment of the Brazilian Biodiesel Production Program (PNPB), to see whether this program has achieved its promised results. Given the connection between socioeconomic, political, technological and environmental issues, the study performs an analysis covering these different dimensions. From the socioeconomic standpoint, findings of the study show that the generation of jobs in the agricultural sector has been much lower than the expected 1.3-million-job creation figure. From the standpoint of reducing the outflow of foreign exchange because of potentially lower demand for imported diesel, the option for the methanol instead of ethanol production route has led to an increased net outflow, as the greater need to import methanol to produce biodiesel more than offsets the lesser need to import mineral diesel. Nevertheless, even though the "Promised Land" has not been reached, particularly from a socioeconomic standpoint, the premises of energy efficiency and the potential to mitigate GHG emissions appear to be on solid ground. In this respect, the input/output energy ratio of producing soy-based biodiesel and the GHG mitigation potential of pure biodiesel justify the continuing effort to improve the PNPB to achieve more promising results in relation to the other indicators. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pure butanol as well as methane-assisted butanol non-premixed flames were studied in a counter-flow burner configuration in view of the emergence of butanol production from agricultural sources. Major combustion species were measured across the flame using line Raman imaging and temperature measurements were obtained with K-type thermocouples. Of particular importance was the comparison of flames of the same heating value and equivalence ratio, as well as flames of the same overall equivalence ratio but varying reactant flow rates. Extinction strain rates were measured for a wide range of conditions. It was shown that there was a decrease of extinction strain rate with increasing overall equivalence ratio for both constant fuel flow rates and constant heat release of combustion and that butanol flames were more vulnerable to extinction compared to methane. Species concentration measurements indicated that N2 concentrations anti-correlate with temperature across the non-premixed flame, in agreement with non-premixed flame theory. Finally, the possibility of estimating the scalar dissipation rate at the stoichiometric surface χstoich was investigated through a measurement of the mixing layer thickness δ, performed with an intensified CCD camera and a modest-power laser. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel and more often its blends have been extensively used to mitigate the dependence on fossil fuel and the greenhouse gas emissions. However, a good understanding of the impact of the difference in the thermophysical properties of biodiesel and its blends from those of petroleum diesel is required to reap the benefits of biodiesel utilization. In this study a multicomponent evaporation model has been developed for pure and blended biodiesel droplets to investigate their evaporation characteristics in high temperature convective environment as encountered in practical combustion systems; and it is validated through a comparison with experimental results. The vaporization characteristics of pure diesel, pure biodiesel fuel droplets as well as the effect of mixing them in different proportions (B20 and B50) are presented. The results reveal that biodiesel droplets evaporate at a slower rate than the diesel droplets because of biodiesel's relatively low vapor pressure. Consequently, the blending of diesel fuel with small proportions of biodiesel results in an increase in the evaporation timescale of the blended fuel droplets. Diffusion in the liquid phase is observed to be the rate controlling factor for blended droplet vaporization. The possibility of internal gasification for blended droplets is also investigated. A droplet with higher quantity of diesel is more prone to undergo internal gasification but micro-explosion is not likely to occur at atmospheric pressure. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study deals with estimation of toxic phorbol esters in Jatropha curcas oil, cake and biodiesel and performance emission of different blends of biodiesel in diesel engine. The jatropha seed was collected from Chattishgarh, India and oil content of the seed kernel was 56.5%, determined by soxhlet apparatus. The oil was subjected to biodiesel preparation by twin step method of acid esterification followed by alkali transesterification. The total conversion of jatropha oil methyl ester (JOME) after reaction was 96.05% from proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) studies. The phorbol esters content of oil, cake and biodiesel was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Waters). The phorbol esters content of the oil was more (2.26±0.01mg/g) than the cake (0.6±0.01mg/g) but no phorbol esters peak was detected in biodiesel. The performance and emission study of the fuel blends (JB2, JB5 and JB10) with conventional diesel were tested for their use as substitute fuel for a single cylinder direct injection diesel engine at constant speed (1500rpm). The emissions such as CO, HC and smoke opacity decreased whereas NOx and BSCF increased with biodiesel blends. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Using energy systems analysis, we examine the potential to reduce CO2 emissions and oil use by integrating motor biofuel production with pulp mills. BLG-DME (black liquor gasification with di-methyl ether production) is compared with solid biomass gasification with BIG-FT (solid biomass gasification with Fischer-Tropsch fuel production). The studied systems are expanded with stand-alone production of biomass-based electricity and motor fuel so that they yield the same functional unit in terms of motor fuel and electricity as well as pulp or paper product, in order to facilitate comparison. More motor biofuel can be produced in integration with the studied mills with BLG-DME than with BIG-FT because the black liquor flow is large compared with other fuel streams in the mill and the integration potential for BIG-FT is limited by the mill's heat demand. When both systems are required to produce the same functional unit, the BLG-DME system achieves higher system efficiency and larger reductions in CO2 emissions and oil use per unit of biomass consumed. In general, integration of motor biofuel production with a pulp mill is more efficient than stand-alone motor biofuel production. Larger reductions in CO2 emissions or oil use can, however, be achieved if biomass replaces coal or oil in stationary applications. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study is to investigate the emission reduction characteristics of bioethanol blended diesel fuel at early injection condition including spray, atomization and evaporation characteristics. The spray atomization and evaporation characteristics were investigated using spray visualization system and KIVA-3V code, respectively. In this work, the effect of ethanol blending on the spray behavior is more evident at early injection condition. In the calculation results, the droplet size of bioethanol blended fuel was smaller than that of diesel, and bioethanol blended diesel droplets firstly evaporated by its volatility and superior atomization characteristics. In early injection condition, the bioethanol blending caused an increase in indicated mean effective pressure with an extension of the ignition delay. The cooling effect of the bioethanol fuel reduced NOx. The HC emission increased and the CO emission decreased because of the ethanol blending. The geometry mean diameter and total number density increased as a result of ethanol blending, the particle number in the nuclei mode decreased, and the particle number in the accumulation mode increased in early injection condition. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, regulated and unregulated exhaust emissions with petroleum diesel fuel and Jatropha-based biodiesel blends at proportions of 5%, 10%, 20%, 50% and 100% (v/v) have been investigated. This study examines four regulated emissions: nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbon and smoke, and four typical unregulated emissions: formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone and toluene. The biodiesel shows no obvious NOx emission difference from the pure diesel fuel at low and medium engine loads. Biodiesel blend ratios have little effect on the NO/NOx ratio at medium and high engine loads. The CO emission of biodiesel increases at low engine loads. The HC emissions show a continuous reduction with increasing biodiesel blend ratios. There is a good correlation between smoke reduction and the ratio of the biodiesel blends. The addition of biodiesel fuel increases formaldehyde emission. Compared to the pure diesel fuel, the acetaldehyde emission of B5 fuel is higher. The acetaldehyde emission of the B100 fuel is lower than the pure diesel fuel at low and middle engine loads. The acetone emission of biodiesel, from B5 to B100, is higher than the pure diesel fuel. The higher biodiesel blend ratio the fuel has, the lower toluene emission the engine has. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ethanol blended petrol and biodiesel blended diesel are being introduced in many countries to meet the increasing demand of hydrocarbon fuels. However, technological limitations of current vehicle engine do not allow ethanol and biodiesel percentages in the blended fuel to be increased beyond a certain level. As a result quantification of ethanol in blended petrol and biodiesel in blended diesel becomes an important issue. In this work, calibration models for the quantification of ethanol in the ethanolpetrol and biodiesel in the biodiesel-diesel blends of a particular batch were made using the combination of synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS) with principal component regression (PCR) and partial least square (PLS) and excitation emission matrix fluorescence (EEMF) with N-way Partial least square (N-PLS) and unfolded-PLS. The PCR, PLS, N-PLS and unfolded-PLS calibration models were evaluated through measures like root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV), root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) and square of the correlation coefficient (R 2). The prediction abilities of the models were tested using a testing set of ethanol-petrol and biodiesel-diesel blends of known ethanol and biodiesel concentrations, error in the predictions made by the models were found to be less than 2%. The obtained calibration models are highly robust and capable of estimating low as well as high concentrations of ethanol and biodiesel. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The current energy crisis greatly affects worldwide economic development. Therefore, identifying for new energy resources is critically important. In this study, we introduce a potential biodiesel source: Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius) larvae (CML), which are proliferative and can be fed with a variety of low cost materials, such as manure, wheat bran, rotted meat and decayed vegetation. The potential of C. megacephala (Fabricius) larvae oil (CMLO) for biodiesel applications was explored. Oil was extracted from the CML raised by feeding on restaurant garbage for five days. The oil content obtained from the dehydrated CML ranged from 24.40% to 26.29% since restaurant garbage varies in composition day to day. The acid value of the CMLO was tested to be 1.10. mg. KOH/g. Four factors were subsequently considered to optimize the transesterification of CMLO to biodiesel. The optimized conditions included a 6:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, 1.6% KOH catalyst, a reaction temperature of 55 °C and a reaction time of 30. min. Under these conditions, the maximum yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from CMLO was 87.71%. Finally, properties of the FAME were within the specifications of ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 biodiesel standards. Therefore, we concluded that C. megacephala (Fabricius) larvae represent a potential alternative feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels is currently driving the interest in bioenergy sector. The recently issued Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC) confirms the 10% target, set by the EC, for energy from renewable sources in transport. The European Union is the largest producer of biodiesel in the world and biodiesel is also the most important biofuel used in the EU. The aim of this paper is to investigate the biomass feedstock requirement, under different scenarios, with a focus on vegetable oils. The European production potential is compared with the amount of biomass required to meet the target on biofuels. Next generation biofuels and alternative feedstock for first generation pathways are considered as well as the share of biomass import. The scenario proposed allows to estimate the land required to meet the target at 2020 on biodiesel. Assuming different contribution of the next generation biofuels, from the 10% to the 30% is possible to estimate the contribution of first generation biodiesel. The results showed that, considering the total European arable land, this production will utilise 9-13%. © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The growth of energy demand and limited fossil fuel resources lead to renewable energy development such as vegetable oils and animal fats or their derivatives. In the present work, the valuation of waste fish fat by the pyrolysis technique with the presence of catalyst to produce biofuel for diesel engines. As a result, fuel undergoes good combustion and hence there is a significant improvement in performance and reduction in emissions. The brake thermal efficiency of neat biofuel is 32.4% at 80% load which is very high compared to neat diesel (29.98%). The combustion duration and ignition delay are decreased with neat biofuel due to high oxygen content and high cetane number of biofuel. The main problem with the use of neat biofuel in diesel engine is high NO. x emissions at all loads. Addition of diesel with biofuel reduces the NO. x emissions significantly from 917. ppm to 889. ppm at 80% load with an optimum blend of B80D20. There is a slight decrease in brake thermal efficiency and increase in particulate emission with this blend. The overall results show that by adding small quantity of diesel with biofuel decreases the NO. x emissions significantly and approaches the performance of neat biofuel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - For many decades, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used to determine the composition of animal feedstuffs and grains. More recently, mid-infrared spectroscopy (mid-IR) has also been examined for similar determinations. These spectroscopic methods offer the potential for rapid and accurate determination of organic constituents, such as fiber components and protein, of forages, by-products, and grains at reduced cost and greatly increased speed (minutes instead of hours or days). Because they are nonchemical in nature, they result in a large reduction (90% or more) in the chemical wastes associated with standard chemical-based assay methods. The same components of interest for biofuel production (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, starch, protein, oil, etc.) are those that have already been determined by NIRS/mid-IR for evaluating grains and animal feedstuffs. Therefore, these techniques would appear to be a natural match for evaluating feedstocks for biofuels, and the literature shows that efforts in this direction are being successfully tested and instituted. For this discussion, an overview of where such efforts are and the potential for NIRS/mid-IR in producing biofuels will be covered. For example, while there are similarities between the needs of the biofuels industry and the analysis of animal feedstuffs, there are also both practical and technical differences between the two that will likely impact how NIRS/mid-IR is developed for biofuels. As an example, grain analysis for protein is performed on a large scale by government agencies such as the Canadian Grain Commission and U.S. Grain Inspection Service, while at least in the United States, animal feedstuff analysis is performed by state or independent laboratories for individual farmers. For biofuels, this might well result in most analysis being performed by the large corporations converting the feedstocks to biofuels, as opposed to the individual producer having analysis performed at an independent laboratory. Similarly for animal feedstuffs, measurements of fiber (neutral detergent fiber or NDF, acid detergent fiber or ADF, and lignin) and protein are carried out. These fiber measurements often consist of more than one type of fiber component with some being computed by difference (hemicellulose = NDF - ADF) and are empirical at best. Whether such empirical estimates will be sufficient for assessing biofuels or whether new spectroscopic methods for directly measuring the components of interest (cellulose, etc.) will need to be developed is a question to be answered when components other than starch for ethanol or oil for biodiesel become common. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Brazil is one of the major producers of ethanol and sugar in the world. Ethanol has been used as a renewable fuel in passenger vehicles, decreasing the levels of pollution in big cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. On the other hand, sugarcane ethanol plants produce a waste of vinasse, which is used as organic fertilizer in cane plantations which causes soil and water contamination. The anaerobic digestion treatment can be used to reduce the pollution vinasse and, concomitantly, to increase the production of biogas. This essay intended to reflect/discuss about the potential of biogas production from the anaerobic digestion of vinasse in Brazil, and the availability of its use in urban buses as gas fuel. Brazilian urban buses are using natural gas as fuel in big cities like Rio de Janeiro, but diesel prevails in most of the cities, and biogas can be important to reduce the dependence of a nonrenewable fuel in the country. The national potential for biogas production from vinasse could replace 50% of the urban bus fleet in Brazil. A big ethanol production plant has autonomy to supply 788 buses per day.

AB  - Southern Africa has been identified globally as one of the areas with high potential for extensive biofuel production. Unlike most commodities, biofuel is not market-limited. Instead, access to feedstock-and more particularly the land on which to grow the feedstock-is the main constraint for biofuel production, and hence the greatest competition in the industry is to acquire land. Countries in southern Africa have taken very different policy stances on biofuel. South Africa is taking a conservative approach; concerns about potential invasiveness of Jatropha curcas have led to a moratorium on planting, and maize-based bioethanol is banned due to possible food security impacts. On the contrary, Mozambique sees biofuel production as one of the key strategies to obtain foreign investment in the agricultural sector, which it is actively trying to revive. What remains unclear is to what extent primary and secondary forest and woodland will be cleared to enable this biofuel expansion. Although early indications suggested that extensive deforestation would occur, more recently companies seem to be taking more conservative approaches to deforestation due to concerns over certification requirements. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Non-catalytic transesterification of camelina sativa oil under supercritical ethanol (SCE) conditions with hexane as a co-solvent was investigated to study the fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) yields. This process enables simultaneous transesterification of triglycerides and ethyl esterification of fatty acids in a shorter reaction of time and may reduce the energy consumption due to simplified separation and purification steps. It was found that the co-solvent plays a vital role in reducing the severity of critical operational parameters and maximizes the biodiesel yield. The important variables affecting the ethyl ester yield during the transesterification reaction are the molar ratio of alcohol/oil, reaction time, reaction temperature and co-solvent to oil ratio. Camelina biodiesel samples were analyzed using FT-IR, GC-MS and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) methods. The fuel properties of camelina biodiesel produced were compared with those of the regular diesel and found to be conforming to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTMs) standards. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The major obstacle to biodiesel commercialization is the high cost of biodiesel. Biodiesel made from waste cooking oil is an economical source that can effectively reduce raw material cost. Although using a microwave heating system to improve the yields of waste-cooking-oil biodiesel has received little attention in the literature, experimental results indicate that it outperforms conventional heating, with the best performances found with 0.75wt% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 0.75wt% sodium methoxide (CH3ONa) catalysts, respectively. The biodiesel yields produced with CH3ONa catalyst are higher than those produced with NaOH catalyst. An increase in the reaction time from 1 to 3min significantly increases the yield, which decreases with a further increase to 6min. A methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 6 is suitable for the synthesis of biodiesel. The biodiesel yields increase with increasing reaction power. However, the microwave output must not be too high as it may damage the organic molecules. The optimal reaction conditions are 0.75wt% CH3ONa catalyst, a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 6, a reaction time of 3min, and a microwave power of 750W. © 2011.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L., a multipurpose shrub, has acquired significant economic importance for its seed oil which can be converted to biodiesel an emerging alternative to petro-diesel. In addition to the commercial value, it is also having medicinal and even high nutritional value to use as animal fodder which is limited due to the toxicity. Development of molecular marker will enable to differentiate non-toxic from toxic variety of J. curcas in a mixed population and also for quality control since the toxic components of J. curcas has deleterious effect on animals. In the present study, the efforts were made to generate the specific SCAR marker for toxic and/or non-toxic J. curcas from RAPD markers. Among the markers specific for toxic and non-toxic varieties, four were selected, purified, cloned, sequenced, and designed primers out of which one set of primers NT-JC/SCAR I/OPQ15-F and R could able to discriminate the non-toxic with toxic Jatropha by giving expected 430 bp size amplification in non-toxic variety. Furthermore, novel multiplex PCR was designed using the nrDNA ITS primers to overcome the false negatives. Present work also demonstrates utility of the conserved regions of nrDNA coding genes in ruling out the artifacts in PCR-like false negatives frequently occur in SCAR due to various reasons. The specific SCAR markers generated in the present investigation will help to distinguish non-toxic from toxic varieties of J. curcas or vice versa, and isolated marker along with designed multiplex protocol has applications in quality control for selective cultivation of non-toxic variety and will also assist in breeding and molecular mapping studies. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The formulation of motor vehicle fuels can alter the magnitude and composition of evaporative and exhaust emissions occurring throughout the fuel cycle. Information regarding the volatile organic compound (VOC) composition of motor fuels other than gasoline is scarce, especially for bioethanol and biodiesel blends. This study examines the liquid and vapor (headspace) composition of four contemporary and commercially available fuels: gasoline (&lt;10% ethanol), E85 (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline), ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD), and B20 (20% soy-biodiesel and 80% ULSD). The composition of gasoline and E85 in both neat fuel and headspace vapor was dominated by aromatics and n-heptane. Despite its low gasoline content, E85 vapor contained higher concentrations of several VOCs than those in gasoline vapor, likely due to adjustments in its formulation. Temperature changes produced greater changes in the partial pressures of 17 VOCs in E85 than in gasoline, and large shifts in the VOC composition. B20 and ULSD were dominated by C9 to C16 n-alkanes and low levels of the aromatics, and the two fuels had similar headspace vapor composition and concentrations. While the headspace composition predicted using vapor-liquid equilibrium theory was closely correlated to measurements, E85 vapor concentrations were underpredicted. Based on variance decomposition analyses, gasoline and diesel fuels and their vapors VOC were distinct, but B20 and ULSD fuels and vapors were highly collinear. These results can be used to estimate fuel related emissions and exposures, particularly in receptor models that apportion emission sources, and the collinearity analysis suggests that gasoline- and diesel-related emissions can be distinguished. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel production generates significant amounts of low-value residues and wastes. This results in concern over the sustainability of the biofuel industry and its impact on the environment. Bioconversion offers opportunities for the economic utilization of biofuel residues and wastes with concomitant remediation of wastes. Due to their characteristics, these residues/wastes can serve as low-cost substrates for bioconversion to high-value products. Attempts have been made to produce several bio-based products, such as single-cell proteins, single-cell oil, enzymes, bioplastics, and organic acids. The authors review biofuel residues/wastes generation and their use in value-added processing. In addition, special attention is given to economic analyses of value-added processing of biofuel residues. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We examine the effect of biofuels mandates and climate policy on the European vehicle fleet, in particular the prospects for diesel and gasoline vehicles. Our analysis is based on a dynamic computable general equilibrium model of the world economy which explicitly incorporates current generation biofuels, accounts for stock turnover of the vehicle fleets, disaggregates gasoline and diesel cars, and represents an advanced E85 vehicle. We find that the European vehicle fleet is robust to proposed biofuels mandates owing to an existing fuel tax and tariffs structure that favours diesel vehicles. Harmonising excise duties on diesel and gasoline or lowering tariffs on biofuel imports, however, is shown to reverse the trend toward more diesel vehicles and significantly alters the efficiency costs and environmental effectiveness of renewable fuel policies.

AB  - Since the fatty acid ester profile of a given biofuel is relatively consistent with the source's fatty acid profile, the properties of the biodiesel produced from a particular feedstock exhibit predictable quality. Thus, lipid fractions and the fatty acid composition of stationary growth-phase cultures of the local strains of the diatoms Skeletonema costatum and Navicula gregaria were analysed to evaluate their suitability as biodiesel feedstock. Total lipid content was 20.83 pg cell -1 in S. costatum and 19.17 pg cell -1 in N. gregaria. Neutral lipids were the main fraction of total lipids in both species, accounting for ca. 65% and 76%, respectively. S. costatum was predominant in saturated fatty acids (SFAs; 43.48 %) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs; 40.11%), while N. gregaria was predominant in MUFAs (54.85%), followed by SFAs (33.42%). In S. costatum, the main fatty acids in neutral lipid fraction were myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic and oleic acids, while the main ones in N. gregaria were palmitic and palmitoleic acids. The oils extracted from these species presented linolenic acid contents within biodiesel's quality specifications. However, in neutral lipid fraction both species showed eicosapentaenoic acid levels higher than the required limit. The lipid quality analysed in both species suggests that a biodiesel derived from these oils may present an acceptable cetane number, but likely poor cold-flow properties. This baseline information is useful for future research tending to find more suitable conditions in order to improve oil yield. In addition, both estuarine species neither compete with agriculture for food nor require farmland nor fresh water. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The perennial political and social upheavals in major oil-producing regions, the increasing energy demand from emerging economies, the global economic crisis and even environmental disasters, like the recent major oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, all contribute to price fluctuations and escalations. Usually price instability affects the least-developed countries with the most fragile economies, like Ghana, the most. This paper gives a brief overview of the Ghanaian energy situation, describes the liquid biofuel production processes and examines the possibility of replacing some of the fossil fuels consumed annually, with locally produced renewable biofuels. Various scenarios for substituting different portions of petrol and diesel with biofuels derived from cassava and palm oil are examined. Based on 2009 crop production and fuel consumption data, replacement of 5% of both petrol and diesel with biofuels would require 1.96% and 17.3% of the cassava and palm oil produced in that year, respectively; while replacement of 10% of both fossil fuels would need 3.91% and 34.6% of the corresponding biofuels. Thus while petrol replacement could be initiated with little difficulty, regarding raw material availability, biodiesel would require enhanced palm oil production and/or oil supplement from other sources, including, potentially, jatropha. An implementation strategy is proposed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Connecting (small) family farmers to the emerging biodiesel industry requires careful design of the institutional arrangements between the producers of oil crops and the processing companies. According to institutional economics theory, the design of effective and efficient arrangements depends on production and transaction characteristics, the institutional environment, and the organizational environment supporting the transaction between producers and the industry. This paper presents a comparative study on two cases in the feedstock-for-biodiesel industry in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The two case studies represent the production and transaction system of soybeans (Glycine max L. Merrill)andcastor beans (Ricinus communis L.). Important elements of effective and efficient institutional arrangements are farmer collective action, availability of technical and financial support, and farmer experience with particular crops. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We have engineered Escherichia coli to overproduce saturated and monounsaturated aliphatic methyl ketones in the C11 to C15 (diesel) range; this group of methyl ketones includes 2-undecanone and 2-tridecanone, which are of importance to the flavor and fragrance industry and also have favorable cetane numbers (as we report here). We describe specific improvements that resulted in a 700-fold enhancement in methyl ketone titer relative to that of a fatty acid-overproducing E. coli strain, including the following: (i) overproduction of β-ketoacyl coenzyme A (CoA) thioesters achieved by modification of the β-oxidation pathway (specifically, overexpression of a heterologous acyl-CoA oxidase and native FadB and chromosomal deletion of fadA) and (ii) overexpression of a native thioesterase (FadM). FadM was previously associated with oleic acid degradation, not methyl ketone synthesis, but outperformed a recently identified methyl ketone synthase (Solanum habrochaites MKS2 [ShMKS2], a thioesterase from wild tomato) in β-ketoacyl-CoA-overproducing strains tested. Whole-genome transcriptional (microarray) studies led to the discovery that FadM is a valuable catalyst for enhancing methyl ketone production.

AB  - An accurate understanding of the factors that influence farmers' adoption of a crop is critical for effective policy promotion and technical support. Agroforestry crop adoption is a complex topic involving many factors not often addressed by tradition crop adoption models. This complexity, when applied to Jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.), an often widely promoted yet poorly understood biofuel feedstock crop, requires a detailed analysis across diverse topics. Such an analysis was carried out through applying rigorous statistical tools to the data acquired from an interview-based household survey among Malian farmers and was combined with relevant geospatial datasets. The results showed that though farmers' adoption is based on a wide variety of factors from household preferences, resource endowments, bio-physical factors, and market incentives, factors related to risk and uncertainty appear to provide the strongest correlation. Specifically, the number of visits that an agriculture extension agent makes with a farmer was found to be the most significant factor influencing adoption. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel either in neat form or as a mixture with diesel fuel is widely investigated to solve the twin problem of depletion of fossil fuels and environmental degradation. The main objective of the present study is to compare performance, emission and combustion characteristics of biodiesel derived from non edible Jatropha oil in a dual fuel diesel engine with base line results of diesel fuel. The performance parameters evaluated were: brake thermal efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption, power output. As a part of combustion study, in-cylinder pressure, rate of pressure rise and heat release rates were evaluated. The emission parameters such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, un-burnt hydrocarbon, oxides of nitrogen and smoke opacity with the different fuels were also measured and compared with base line results. The different properties of Jatropha oil after transestrification were within acceptable limits of standards as set by many countries. The brake thermal efficiency of Jatropha methyl ester and its blends with diesel were lower than diesel and brake specific energy consumption was found to be higher. However, HC, CO and CO2 and smoke were found to be lower with Jatropha biodiesel fuel. NOx emissions on Jatropha biodiesel and its blend were higher than Diesel. The results from the experiments suggest that biodiesel derived from non edible oil like Jatropha could be a good substitute to diesel fuel in diesel engine in the near future as far as decentralized energy production is concerned. In view of comparable engine performance and reduction in most of the engine emissions, it can be concluded and biodiesel derived from Jatropha and its blends could be used in a conventional diesel engine without any modification. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study presents performance behaviors of a commercial diesel engine fueled with diesel and Jatropha based biodiesel (B100) at various loads (up to 100%) using standard (conventional) and three new face profile designs (I, II & III) of piston rings. Face profiles of piston rings had considerable impact on engine's brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), and mass flow rate, irrespective of fuels used. BTE of engine fueled with diesel increases 2-8% with new face profile design (III) of piston rings in comparison to standard (conventional) piston rings. BTE enhances 8-16% when engine is fueled with biodiesel using face profile design (III) on piston rings. Corresponding to increase in BTE, recorded reduction in BSFC (biodiesel) is 28-34%. Industrial application of the results of present study may be useful in saving of fuels.

AB  - This study presents effect of engine performance, exhaust emissions and combustion characteristics of a single cylinder laboratory based four stroke cycle direct injection (DI) diesel engine fueled by neat coconut oil methyl ester (COME) injected through conventional nozzle (injection pressure 200 bar) and a separate electronic injector is used as retrofit to inject methanol (injection pressure 3 bar) at an appropriate time at suction end after complete opening of suction valve. Tests were conducted at five different loads at rated speed of 1500 rpm. With increase in methanol%, pressure variation increases per degree of crank revolution with progressively increasing delay periods. Biodiesel with 5% methanol injection produced better diffused combustion and a good share of heat release was observed in premixed and diffused combustion zones, besides HC and NO emissions are lower and consistent with minimum change in its value as load is increasing. Smoke emission decreased at individual loading of engine with more methanol (up to 7%) and there is a rise in smoke at 10% methanol injection. Thus a mixture of 5% methanol injection with biodiesel operation is the most economical fuel combination in improving engine performance and decreasing emissions.

AB  - This study presents effect of injection timing on performance, combustion and emission characteristics of mahua biodiesel (Madhuca indica) and its blends with pure diesel on a 4 stroke tangentially vertical single cylinder (TV 1) direct injection diesel engine. Standard injection pressure (220 bar) is maintained throughout the experiment. Injection timings (22°, 23° and 24° bTDC) were considered under steady state conditions at maximum load condition of the engine. At injection timing of 22° bTDC, blend B25 (25% mahua biodiesel and 75% pure diesel, by vol) gave optimum performance, which is very close to pure diesel. Thus B25 fuel can be effectively used in a diesel engine as an alternative fuel without any modification in the engine. Diesel (25%) thus saved will greatly help the interests of railways in meeting the demand for fuel, as diesel trains are operated at maximum load condition.

AB  - This paper reports an artificial neural networks (ANN) modelling programme for a light-duty diesel engine powered using blends of various biodiesel fuels with conventional fossil diesel. ANN was used here to predict nine different engine-out responses, namely carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen monoxide (NO), unburned hydrocarbon (UHC), maximum pressure (Pmax), location of maximum pressure (CAD Pmax), maximum heat release rate (HRRmax), location of maximum HRR (CAD HRRmax) and cumulative HRR (CuHRR). Four pertinent engine operating parameters, engine speed, output torque, fuel mass flow rate and biodiesel fuel types and blends, were used as the input parameters for this modelling work. The feasibility of using ANN in predicting the relationships between these inputs and outputs were assessed. Simulated results were first validated against data from parallel engine test-bed study. Key effects of ANN "model" and "model parameter" such as type of transfer function, training algorithm and number of neurons, along with the methods of optimising the network settings were also presented in this paper. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The addition of a biorefinery to an organic farm was investigated, where ethanol was produced from germinated rye grains and whey, and the effluent was separated into two streams: the protein-rich solid fraction, to be used as animal feed, and the liquid fraction, which can be co-digested with clover grass silage to produce biogas. A method for ethanol production from rye was applied by utilizing inherent amylase activity from germination of the seed. Biogas potential of ethanol fermentation effluent was measured through anaerobic digestion trials. The effluent from the trials was assumed to serve as natural fertilizer. A technoeconomic analysis was also performed; total capital investment was estimated to be approximately 4MUSD. Setting a methane selling price according to available incentives for "green electricity" (0.72USD/m 3) led to a minimum ethanol selling price of 1.89USD/L (project lifetime 25yr, at a discount rate 10%). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study identifies the potential greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions, which can be achieved by optimizing the use of residues in the life cycle of palm oil derived biodiesel. This is done through compilation of data on existing and prospective treatment technologies as well as practical experiments on methane potentials from empty fruit bunches. Methane capture from the anaerobic digestion of palm oil mill effluent was found to result in the highest GHG reductions. Among the solid residues, energy extraction from shells was found to constitute the biggest GHG savings per ton of residue, whereas energy extraction from empty fruit bunches was found to be the most significant in the biodiesel production life cycle. All the studied waste treatment technologies performed significantly better than the conventional practices and with dedicated efforts of optimized use in the palm oil industry, the production of palm oil derived biodiesel can be almost carbon neutral. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A meta-analysis of several published life cycle assessments of algae-to-energy systems was developed to better understand the environmental implications of deploying this technology at large scales. Taken together, results from these six studies seemed largely inconclusive because of differences in modeling assumptions and system boundaries. To overcome this, the models were normalized using a generic pathway for cultivating algae in open ponds, converting it into biodiesel, and processing the nonlipid fraction using anaerobic digestion. Meta-analysis results suggest that algae-based biodiesel would result in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions on par with terrestrial alternatives such as corn ethanol and soy biodiesel. Net energy ratio and normalized greenhouse gas emissions were 1.4MJ produced/MJ consumed and 0.19kgCO 2-equivalent/km traveled, respectively. A scenario analysis underscores the extent to which breakthroughs in key technologies are needed before algae-derived fuels become an attractive alternative to conventional biofuels. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The optimization of biomass and oil productivities in heterotrophic cultures of Auxenochlorella protothecoides was achieved using a non-linear model-based approach. A 10-fold increase in the average biomass productivity, and a 16-fold increase in the maximum productivity, was observed with respect to batch cultures as a result of the proposed optimization strategy. Final cell density in the optimized culture was 144. g/L (dry weight), with 49.4%w/w oil content. Maximum lipid productivity was 20.16. g/L. d, achieved during the exponential growth phase at an average cell density of 86. g/L. Lipid productivity in the optimized microalgal culture was higher than previously reported values for other oleaginous microorganisms. Oil composition analysis showed that the oil has a high quality as biodiesel precursor. The higher productivity and excellent lipid profile of the optimized microalgal culture make A. protothecoides an exceptional source for biodiesel production and a potential source of single cell oil for other applications. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The state of research on developing fuel options for next-generation chemical propulsion is reviewed for aviation fuels and energetic fuels. For aviation fuels, the development is based on considerations of cost, energy security, and climate change, with Fischer-Tropsch synthetic fuels and biofuels hold potential as alternative aviation fuels. The need for basic research to develop predictive capability for the oxidative chemistry of evolving fuels in evolving engine designs is emphasized, illustrated by the intricate reaction pathways and the enormity of the reaction mechanisms involved. Recent research activities toward achieving the goal of fuel design are discussed through the development of detailed mechanisms, reduced mechanisms, and surrogate fuels. For the development of highenergy-density propellants, advances in several classes of materials are discussed, including metallized and hypergolic propellants and propellants with strained and functionalized molecules, as well as nanoparticle addition. The impact of the recent progress in chemical synthesis, materials science, and nano science on these advances is noted. Copyright © 2011 by the author.

AB  - This research studied the moisture sorption behaviour of jatropha seed allowing the development of a model correlating the equilibrium moisture content (EMC) and the free fatty acids (FFA) content as a function of water activity and EMC, respectively. Two sets of sorption-isotherm experiment were performed to describe the relationship between EMC and FFA content with water activity, for both fresh and dried seeds. The seeds were conditioned in series of saturated salts having certain water activity and stored at different temperatures (20, 30, 40 °C). The nested experimental design and ANOVA (F-test at p  0.05) were applied to study the effects of temperature and water activity on the EMC of jatropha seed. EMC increased generally with the increase in water activity and with the decrease in temperature at either desorption or adsorption. The EMC was significantly affected by water activity, but the temperature did not significantly affect the EMC. The hysteresis effect was more pronounced at lower temperatures. The FFA content of seed was relatively constant at low water activity (a w &lt; 0.8), but it was high at higher water activity. The moisture sorption behaviour of jatropha seed revealed that like most product, it exhibited the sigmoid pattern. The BET, GAB, Harkins-Jura, Halsey and Henderson models were recommended as adequate models in predicting the amount of moisture adsorbed or desorbed at known humidity. The relationship between EMC and FFA content of jatropha seed showed that the polynomial equation was the best fitting for either fresh or dried seed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Today, in Turkey, the most commonly used renewable resources are classical biomass energy and hydraulic energy. Although geothermal energy ranks third, its usage is limited. The usage of solar energy is at a symbolic level, that of wind energy is in its initial stages and the idea of tidal energy is out of concern. In spite of the important potential of modern biomass energy, agriculture of energy plants is not widely recognized, and the establishment of energy forests is realized in a limited fashion. This study is based on two essential considerations about biofuels: agricultural potential of Turkey for biofuels production and governmental policies about environmental friendly alternative fuels in Turkey. A policy to increase biodiesel production in Turkey by importing biofuels or shifting to oilseed- biomass production from another plant does not seem reliable or practical. As far as environmental pollution is concerned, the utilization of all fuels produces air pollutants, causing local, trans-boundary air pollution, and acid rain problems. Biofuel is a clean renewable fuel due to its properties, which is similar to diesel but generated from renewable resources such as vegetable oils, animal fats and energy crops. Although researchers developed the technology of biofuel some two to three decades ago, its use is not widespread, mainly due to the higher production cost involved. Due to the increasing concern on environmental protection, the number of research studies conducted on the usage of this fuel has increased especially in recent years. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel fuel, produced by transesterification of vegetable oils or animal fats with methanol, is a promising alternative diesel fuel due to the limited resources of fossil fuels and the environmental concerns. An environmentally benign process for the transesterification reaction using immobilized lipase has attracted considerable attention for biodiesel production. In the work, magnetic chitosan microspheres were prepared by the chemical co-precipitation approach using glutaraldehyde as cross-linking reagent for lipase immobilization. The immobilization of lipase onto the magnetic particles was confirmed by magnetic measurements, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra. Using the immobilized lipase, the conversion of soybean oil to fatty acid methyl esters reached 87% under the optimized conditions of methanol/oil amount-of-substance ratio 4:1 with the three-step addition of methanol, reaction temperature 35 °C, and reaction duration 30 h. Moreover, the immobilized lipase could be used for four times without significant decrease of the activity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel has been increasingly used due to its property similarities with diesel and several other favorable characteristics with respect to exhaust emissions and biodegradation. For better understanding of biodiesel, this study examines the effects of the biodiesel blend fuel on VOC emissions from diesel engine exhausts in comparison with those from diesel fuel. Exhaust emission tests were performed several times for each fuel under the US transient cycle protocol from mileages of 0-80,000 km. VOC samples were collected from diluted exhaust by using thermal desorption tubes, then analyzed by a GC/MS system. Twenty-two and forty-seven chemicals are identified and quantified in B20 and diesel fuels respectively. Total VOC emissions are in the range of 32.4-71.6 mg kW h -1 for B20 fuel, and 49.6-183.7 mg kW h -1 for diesel fuel. Individual VOC emissions are in the ranges of 0.1-29.8 mg kW h -1 for B20 fuel and 0.1-93.6 mg kW h -1 for diesel fuel. Individual VOC health risks in terms of hazard quotients are in the ranges of 0.01-1.13, and 0.01-22.79 for B20 and diesel fuels, respectively. B20 has much lower total VOC emissions, decreasing by 61.2% on average; correspondingly, lower total ozone potentials of VOC reduce by 64.0%. The reductions in health risks are also shown in B20 fuel. As a result, use of biodiesel in diesel engines has beneficial effects in terms of VOC emissions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A new process to produce YXY fuel components from carbohydrates is under development by Avantium. YXY fuel components are furan-based mono- and diethers with good fuel blending properties and a relatively high energy density. In this paper the engine performance of a wide range of Diesel-YXY mixtures was tested using an ESC test with a 6 cylinder PACCAR heavy duty engine. At all conditions tested (different blendings and different steps in the ESC cycle) no difference in the engine operation was observed. Ethoxymethyl Tetrahydrofuran Ether (ETE) gave the best results with substantial reductions in particulate matter (%) and smoke (%) at up to 30% (v/v) blending ratios while NO x and maximum cylinder pressure were only marginally changed. Furfuryl Ethyl Ether (FEE) also caused substantial reductions of soot however, at the cost of higher NO x formation and a stronger oscillating effect in the max cylinder pressure. Applying a 1:1 mixture of the ETE/FEE YXY molecules quenched the effect seen with FEE alone indicating the strength of producing mixtures of different YXY molecules as the ideal fuel component. Further research will address the elastomer compatibility of the different YXY molecules and if higher alcohols (e.g. n-butanol, t-butanol) for the etherification will make the fuels even better fitting the Diesel fuel range (improved energy content, higher flashpoint, boiling point). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bio-refinery concepts are currently receiving much attention due to the drive toward flexible, highly efficient systems for utilization of biomass for food, feed, fuel and bio-chemicals. One way of achieving this is through appropriate process integration, in this particular case combining enzymatic bio-ethanol production with catalytic liquefaction of the wet distillers grains with soluble, a byproduct from the bio-ethanol process. The catalytic liquefaction process is carried out at sub-critical conditions (280-370 °C and 25 MPa) in the presence of a homogeneous alkaline and a heterogeneous Zirconia catalyst, a process known as the Catliq ® process. In the current work, catalytic conversion of WDGS was performed in a continuous pilot plant with a maximum capacity of 30 dm 3 h -1 of wet biomass. In the process, WDGS was converted to bio-oil, gases and water-soluble organic compounds. The oil obtained was characterized using several analysis methods, among them elementary analysis and GC-MS. The study shows that WDGS can be converted to bio oil with high yields. The results also indicate that through the combination of bio-ethanol production and catalytic liquefaction, it is possible to significantly increase the liquid product yield and scope, opening up for a wider end use applicability. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pyrolitic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass, such as switchgrass and other agricultural residues, to bio-fuels is being considered for national energy security and for environmental advantages. Bio-oil, syn-gas and bio-char were produced and characterized from switchgrass at 400, 500 and 600°C by pyrolysis. Bio-oil yield increased from 22 to 37%, syn-gas yield increased from 8 to 26%, and bio-char yield decreased from 48 to 25% with increases of pyrolysis temperatures from 400 to 600°C. Bio-oil heating value was 36.3 MJ/kg, density was 920 kg/m3 and viscosity was 10 cST. GC-MS study indicated that the bio-oil contained 37% oxygenates that can be upgraded to transportation fuel in future research. Syn-gas compositional analysis shows that, with increasing pyrolysis temperature, CO2, CO, C 2H4 and C2H6 contents increased, whereas H2 and CH4 contents decreased. Part of the syn-gas consisting of H2, CO and CO2, when converted to syn-fuel, can be beneficial to the environment; sulfur free, presence of oxygenates results in less CO emissions and ozone to the atmosphere. Bio-char may be used as a co-product to enhance soil quality, and for carbon sequestration. Analysis of elemental composition and physical properties of bio-char show increase in carbon content, decrease in oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen content, and increase in surface area and pore volume with increases of pyrolysis temperature. The optimized pyrolysis process for bio-oil production in this study will help meet future goals of oil upgrading to produce transportation fuel. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: A major bottleneck in microalgal biodiesel production is lipid content, which is often low in microalgal species. The present study examines Chlorella vulgaris as a potential feedstock for biodiesel by identifying and evaluating the relationships between the critical variables that enhance the lipid yield, and characterizes the biodiesel produced for various properties. Results: Factors affecting lipid accumulation in a green microalga, Chlorella vulgaris were examined. Multifactor optimization raised the lipid pool to 55% dry cell weight against 9% control. When C. vulgaris cells pre-grown in glucose (0.7%)-supplemented medium were transferred to the optimized condition at the second stage, the lipid yield was boosted to 1974 mg L -1, a value almost 20-fold higher than for the control. The transesterified C. vulgaris oil showed the presence of ~82% saturated fatty acids, with palmitate and stearate as major components, thus highlighting the oxidative stability of C. vulgaris biodiesel. The fuel properties (density, viscosity, acid value, iodine value, calorific value, cetane index, ash and water contents) are comparable with the international (ASTM and EN) and Indian (IS) biodiesel standards. Conclusion: C. vulgaris biomass with 55% lipid content and adequate fuel properties is potentially a renewable feedstock for biodiesel. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - There is a global concern about adverse health effects of particulate matter (PM) originating from diesel engine exhaust. In the current study, parametric investigations were carried out using a CRDI (Common Rail Direct Injection) diesel engine operated at different loads at two different engine speeds (1800 and 2400 rpm), employing diesel and 20% biodiesel blends (B20) produced from Karanja oil. A partial flow dilution tunnel was employed to collect and measure the mass of the primary particulates from diesel and biodiesel blend collected on a 47 mm quartz substrate. The collected PM (particulate matter) was subjected to chemical analyses in order to assess the amount of Benzene Soluble Organic Fraction (BSOF) and trace metals using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES). For both diesel and biodiesel, BSOF results showed decreasing levels with increasing engine load. B20 showed higher BSOF as compared to those measured with diesel. The concentration of different trace metals analyzed also showed decreasing trends with increasing engine loads. In addition, real-time measurements for Organic Carbon (OC), Elemental Carbon (EC) and total particle-bound Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) were carried out on the primary engine exhaust coming out of the partial flow dilution tunnel. Analysis of OC/EC data suggested that the ratio of OC to EC decreases with corresponding increase in engine load for both fuels. A peak in PAH concentration was observed at 60% engine load at 1800 rpm and 20% engine load at 2400 rpm engine speeds almost identical for both kinds of fuels. Comparison of chemical components of PM emitted from this CRDI engine provides new insight in terms of PM toxicity for B20 vis-a-vis diesel. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - After transesterification reaction, biodiesel and glycerin (the resulting co-product), coupled to reaction excesses and impurities, make up two distinct phases that must be separated. The use of ethanol as a transesterificating agent impairs the above-mentioned separation due to the greater affinity of ethyl esters (biodiesel from ethanol) to glycerin. Current research provides an analysis of the influence of temperature on the rheology of biodiesel and the bio-diesel-glycerin-ethanol blend. Rheology behavior is highly important not merely in issues involving, for instance, discharging and pumping, but also as a factor that should be evaluated within the process of separation of the biodiesel-glycerin phases by decantation and centrifugation.

AB  - The present study is focused on the etherification of biodiesel-derived glycerol with anhydrous ethanol over arenesulfonic acid-functionalized mesostructured silicas to produce ethyl ethers of glycerol that can be used as gasoline or diesel fuel biocomponents. Within the studied range, the best conditions to maximize glycerol conversion and yield towards ethyl-glycerols are: T= 200. °C, ethanol/glycerol molar ratio = 15/1, and catalyst loading = 19. wt%. Under these reaction conditions, 74% glycerol conversion and 42% yield to ethyl ethers have been achieved after 4. h of reaction but with a significant presence of glycerol by-products. In contrast, lower reaction temperatures (T= 160. °C) and moderate catalyst loading (14. wt%) in presence of a high ethanol concentration (ethanol/glycerol molar ratio = 15/1) are necessary to avoid the formation of glycerol by-products and maximize ethyl-glycerols selectivity. Interestingly, a close catalytic performance to that achieved using high purity glycerol has been obtained with low-grade water-containing glycerol. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A unique method that applied a multilayer-immobilization strategy was developed to prepare nanofibrous enzymes for biosynthesis. LiCl co-electrospun with polyurethane nanofibers enabled strong physical adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA), forming the first layer of protein on the nanofibers; lipase AK was subsequently crosslinked to BSA as an outer layer of enzyme. The content of LiCl in nanofibers was found to be a sensitive factor affecting the activity and stability of the immobilized lipase. For biodiesel synthesis from soybean oil and methanol in isooctane, the reaction rate catalyzed by nanofibrious lipase carrying 5. wt% LiCl was 6.6-fold higher than fibers without LiCl, with a conversion of 91% was achieved within 2. h. LiCl also induced much improved enzyme stability. The nanofibrous lipase with 5% LiCl could be repeatedly used for 42 cycles without apparent activity loss, while the immobilized lipase without LiCl lost over 90% activity within 13 reuse cycles. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Camelina sativa (L.) is a promising crop for biodiesel production that avoids many of the potential pitfalls of traditional biofuel crops, such as land use change (LUC) and food versus fuel. In this study the environmental viability of camelina biodiesel was assessed using life cycle analysis (LCA) methodology. The LCA was conducted using the spreadsheet model dubbed KABAM. KABAM found that camelina grown as a niche filling crop (in rotation with wheat or as a double crop) reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fossil fuel use by 40-60% when compared to petroleum diesel. Furthermore, by avoiding LUC emissions, camelina biodiesel emits fewer GHGs than traditional soybean and canola biodiesel. Finally, a sensitivity analysis concluded that in order to maintain and increase the environmental viability of camelina and other niche filling biofuel crops, researchers and policy makers should focus their efforts on achieving satisfactory yields (1000-2000. kg/ha) while reducing nitrogen fertilizer inputs. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Levulinic acid (LA) has been identified as a platform chemical, which can be produced from lignocellulosic materials and transformed into liquid fuels, fuel additives and even other specialty chemicals. These conversions have been made possible through recent advances in heterogeneous catalysis. Taking advantage of novel chemistries and catalytic materials, we have developed a LA-based strategy to convert lignocellulosic biomass into liquid hydrocarbon fuels. To assess the economic potential of this approach, a process synthesis effort supported by detailed process simulation and capital/operational cost calculations has been undertaken. Furthermore, we study different feedstocks and perform sensitivity analysis studies for several process and economic parameters. Finally, we present the results of an energy efficiency analysis and discuss biomass transportation aspects. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Four different enhancing methods including mechanical stirring (MS), flat plate ultrasonic irradiation (FPUI), flat plate ultrasonic irradiation with mechanical stirring (UIMS) and probe ultrasonic irradiation (PUI) were studied to select a better one that need less catalyst, energy consumption and time to reach equilibrium for preparing biodiesel through transesterification of sunflower oil. The molar ratio of methanol to oil (3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 10:1 and 15:1), the catalyst concentration (0.5. wt.%, 1.0. wt.%, 1.5. wt.% and 2.0. wt.% of the weight of oil), the equilibrium time and energy consumption were studied. The PUI and UIMS methods reached the highest biodiesel conversion when methanol to oil ratio was 5:1 while that for MS was 6:1 and for FPUI was7:1. The suitable catalyst concentration for the reaction was 1.5. wt.%. At the same condition, the PUI and UIMS reached maximum biodiesel conversion about 25. min and that for MS and FPUI was about 50. min. The energy consumption of PUI and UIMS had no significant difference and were 0.19. kW. h, 0.18. kW. h, respectively. Results showed that under the same condition, UIMS and PUI used less catalyst, less methanol, shorter time and less energy consumption than MS and FPUI with the same biodiesel conversion. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An experimental study was conducted to evaluate the suitability of biodiesel for on-road usage based on the engine-out responses of a light-duty diesel engine. Palm methyl ester (PME) was the biodiesel fuel used in this study. The experimental programme was conducted in two separate phases. In the first phase, the effects of engine speed and load over the entire operational range on engine performance and pollutant emissions when fuelled with neat PME (B100) and a B50 PME-diesel blend were identified. Comparison was then made against that of neat fossil diesel (B0), which served as the baseline fuel. The result indicates that fossil diesel, PME and their B50 blend exhibit similar trends across the speed-load map albeit with variation in the magnitude of the responses. For the second phase, attempts were made to elucidate the on-road influence of PME content when used as blending component with diesel. This was achieved by appraising eleven fuel blends from B0 to B100 under a modified steady-state emissions test cycle, with nine intermediate blends at 10. vol.% interval in between. Conclusive reduction of tailpipe NO, UHC and smoke opacity was observed when neat PME was used, culminating in a maximum decrease of 5.0%, 26.2% and 66.7%, respectively. The influence of additional fuel-bound oxygen content in PME on CO is insignificant as diesel engine typically operates in lean mode. It can be concluded from this study that biodiesel fuels has the potential to provide part of the solution for emissions reduction in a light-duty diesel engine, both in neat and blended forms. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this experiment, argemone oil, toxic and highly viscous oil, was treated in two different processes to use this as an adulterer to petroleum diesel. Firstly oil was passed through several processes to lower it viscosity and to improve its properties. The resultant oil, refined argemone oil (RAO), was compared with traditional transesterified biodiesel (TEO) prepared from crude argemone oil. Results indicated that RAO had properties closer to those of TEO and important properties like viscosity, acid value, iodine value and pour point of RAO were also within the acceptable range. Engine testing revealed that up to 42% increment in engine runtime was recorded when only 10% RAO was added to the petroleum diesel, and this is probably the most feasible technique to convert argemone oil to biofuel additive with petroleum diesel. GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of methyl esters of several saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in both RAO and TEO. However, methyl eicosanoate was present in the highest concentration in these oils. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Storage stability is an important aspect in the commercialization of biodiesel. Due to the chemical structure of methyl ester, long-term storage may lead to the degradation of fuel properties that can make it difficult to meet the EN 14214 Standard. This paper examines the degradation of several biofuels (sunflower methyl esters, used cooking oil methyl esters and blends with commercial diesel) under different storage conditions over a 6-month period. The storage conditions simulated real-life conditions by using similar temperatures to those found in commercial tanks, with little air turnover and in the absence of light. Extreme temperature conditions were also studied to determine if this variable has an effect on storage stability. Opaque glass or stainless steel storage containers were used to check the interaction between metal and biofuel. The results show that temperature plays an important role in the degradation of methyl esters. On the other hand, stainless steel was found to be a suitable material for the commercial storage tanks as the effect of this material on stability was almost negligible. The blends with commercial diesel performed better in long-term storage. This was probably due to the effect of the ester dilution and the presence of additives in commercial diesel. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hydrous ethanol is a worldwide used biofuel. According to Brazilian regulations, the concentration of ethanol in hydrous ethanol can be accepted at a maximum concentration of 93.8% and a minimum of 92.6% by mass. The aim of this study is to identify the possible changes in hydrous ethanol fuel using ultrasonic attenuation and propagation velocity. The experiments were performed in the Laboratory of Ultrasound of the Brazilian National Institute of Metrology (Inmetro). The experiments and uncertainties in the methodology were evaluated according to the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, JCGM 100:2008. The test samples used in this study were mixtures of ethanol and water with ethanol concentrations varying from 89.84% to 93.71% by mass; and a commercial fuel ethanol bought from a local distributor. The correlation coefficient between ethanol concentrations and ultrasonic propagation velocity was 0.99 (in modulus), and the maximum combined uncertainty was 0.60 m s -1. Considering attenuation, the correlation coefficient was 0.97, and the maximum combined uncertainty was 0.085 dB cm-1. However, its signal is not stable resulting an unreliable parameter. Within the tested concentration range, the highest concentration that is statistically different (p &lt; 0.002, α = 5%) from 92.60% is 92.25%, considering propagation velocity as parameter. To validate the methodology, a commercial ethanol fuel was tested using the proposed method as well as the gas chromatography analytical method (gold standard). Result was statistically identical for propagation velocity when compared to the gold standard. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The production of synthetic fuels from alternative sources has increased in recent years as a cleaner, more sustainable source of transport fuel is now required. In response to European renewable energy targets, Ireland has committed, through the Biofuels Obligation Scheme of 2008, to producing 4% of transport fuels from biofuels by 2010 and 10% by 2020. In order to be suitable for sale in Europe, diesel fuels and biodiesels must meet certain European fuel specifications outlined in the EN 590:2004 and EN 14214:2009 standards. The aim of this project is to prepare blends of varying proportions of synthetic diesel fuel (Cyn-diesel), produced from the pyrolysis of plastic, versus regular fossil diesel. The viscosity (mm2/s) and density (kg/m3) of these blends as well as of the regular diesel fuel were analysed in relation to compliance with the European fuel standard EN 590. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nowadays, around 1.44 billion people have still no access to electricity, most of them living in rural areas in South and Southeast Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. The major residential energy consumption in these regions is for cooking. This energy demand is covered by firewood, agricultural residues and/or animal dung, implying often exhausting work for the collection and causing deforestation. Solar thermal cooking systems have been developed and promoted, although their success has been limited. This paper follows another solar cooking approach by evaluating the option of combining an off-grid PV system (PV generator+battery) with very low demand electric cooking appliances. The PV-battery system to supply the load demand for the electric cooking appliances for communities of 50 persons has been calculated. Thereby, the five countries with the highest population without access to electricity have been taken into account: India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nigeria. The levelized energy cost is around 3 c€ per meal or less and the life cycle emissions of the PV-battery system (manufacturing, transport and decommissioning) are around 7 gCO2 per meal. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study uses a site-specific life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental profile and energy and water demand of potential production options for rapeseed biodiesel in Chile. The first step is the analysis of the biodiesel supply chain in a standard scenario, associated with the most likely production conditions. The second step is the evaluation of the following alternative scenarios related to a production strategy involving low-impact or renewable resources: (1) Addition of livestock manure as organic fertilizer, (2) Use of degraded grassland, (3) Biodiesel transport by rail, and (4) Use of forest residues for industrial steam. The results show that the biodiesel in the standard scenario has less environmental impacts than fossil diesel in 4 of the 13 indicators evaluated. The rapeseed production is the stage with the highest contribution to impacts. The scenario 1 presents the best environmental profile. The scenario 2 reduces the greenhouse gas emissions of biodiesel. The scenarios 3 and 4 moderately improve the profile of the biofuel. The four situations could be implemented in the short term, but should be backed up by economic and social studies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A Green Vehicle Routing Problem (G-VRP) is formulated and solution techniques are developed to aid organizations with alternative fuel-powered vehicle fleets in overcoming difficulties that exist as a result of limited vehicle driving range in conjunction with limited refueling infrastructure. The G-VRP is formulated as a mixed integer linear program. Two construction heuristics, the Modified Clarke and Wright Savings heuristic and the Density-Based Clustering Algorithm, and a customized improvement technique, are developed. Results of numerical experiments show that the heuristics perform well. Moreover, problem feasibility depends on customer and station location configurations. Implications of technology adoption on operations are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work addition of ethanol to high viscosity jatropha methyl ester (JME) through port injection is investigated in order to determine its effect fuel viscosity reduction on diesel engine performance. In addition to viscosity alteration, the impact of ethanol addition on combustion characteristics such as combustion duration, ignition delay and emissions levels from diesel engines fuelled with blends of ethanol, diesel and JME is studied in particular. It is found that blending of oxygenated fuels with diesel modifies the chemical structure and physical properties which again alter the engine operating conditions, combustion parameters and emissions levels. However, the injection of only 5% ethanol through port injection allows for a total of 25% blending of biofuels into diesel yet keeping the fuel characteristics close to that of conventional diesel. However, both experimental and numerical results show that ethanol addition in JME blended diesel results in a slight increase in fuel consumption and thermal efficiency for the same power outputs as that of conventional diesel fuel. Also, the combustion characteristics with ethanol addition include improved maximum in-cylinder peak pressure, cumulative heat release (CHR) rate of heat release (ROHR), in-cylinder peak temperature and combustion duration. Regarding emission characteristics the experimental results show significant reduction in smoke, carbon monoxide (CO) and total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions with extended oxygen mass percentage in the fuel at higher engine loads. However, oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions are found to increase at high loads although the common tradeoff between smoke and NOx is found to be more prominent for the oxygenated fuels. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Remarkable research has been carried out in the past decade in the field of biofuels in general and, more specifically, in the feasibility of their production. A number of studies have been published that focus on the viability of the investments on biodiesel production plants from a technical-economic perspective. The common characteristic of these studies is that they refer to medium to large-scale production plants. The principal aim of this study is to investigate the viability of a small-scale biodiesel production plant investment in Greece determining the factors and figures that rule the economics of such a plant. Having in mind that a small-scale plant offers greater opportunities for rural development and decentralization as well as that rural development is a focal point in the Greek economy, the financial performance of a small-scale biodiesel plant in Crete Island is analysed in the present work. It is believed that the results obtained may prove very useful in determining the technical and financial characteristics and parameters of similar production facilities. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The energy fuels used for in the Greek transport sector are made up of gasoline consumed by automobiles, diesel oil consumed by taxis, trucks, maritime transport and railroads, and jet fuel used in the aircrafts. All these fuels are hydrocarbons that emit great amounts of CO2 which has a major impact in the global warming phenomenon. The issues relating to climate change, the soaring energy prices, and the uncertainty of future oil supplies, have created a strong interest in alternative transportation fuels. During the past decade biofuels in the form of blended gasoline and biodiesel have begun to find place in energy economy. The Greek car market shows a remarkably low rate in the penetration of biodiesel compared to the average European Union market. This work compares the environmental impacts of the use of gasoline, diesel and biodiesel in Greece using as a tool for the comparison the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. The environmental impacts taken into consideration include: organic respiratory effects, inorganic respiratory effects, fossil fuels, acidification - eutrophication, greenhouse effect, ecotoxicity and carginogenic effects. From the environmental point of view, biodiesel appears attractive since its use results in significant reductions of GHG emissions in comparison to gasoline and diesel. It also has lower well-to-wheel emissions of methane. However, the use of biodiesel as transportation fuel increases emissions of PM10, nitrous oxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx) as well as nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous; the latter are the main agents for eutrophication. This study can be considered as an opportunity for further research and evaluate the available options for a sustainable transportation system planning in Greece. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The goal of this study was to derive the possible formation pathways of the trace species detected in the tail-gas of a diesel engine. The biodiesel (SBM) used in this study was converted from soybean oil through transesterification. The converted biodiesel was then used in a four-cylinder, 2200 c.c. diesel engine, and the resulting formation of trace species in the tail gas exhaust was investigated. The major species in SBM's saturated fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were Methyl palmitate (Hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, C17H34O2, 11.85%) and Methyl stearate (Octadecanoic acid methyl ester, C19H38O2, 6.61%), with Methyl octadeca-9,12-dienoate (9,12-Octadecadienoic acid methyl ester, C19H34O2, 74.78%) as the major species in SBM's unsaturated FAMEs. The chemical classes of the observed trace compounds were hydrocarbons, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, ketones, alcohols, esters, and others. The trace species formation pathways were then derived based on the major species found in the biodiesel fuel and in its exhaust. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The production of alternative fuels from microalgae involves lengthy processing steps. Cell disruption is an integral part of the downstream pool of unit operations as it facilitates the release of intracellular products essential for biofuel production. This study investigated the use of high-pressure homogenization, ultrasonication, bead beating, and sulfuric acid treatment as laboratory-scale disruption methods for microalgal cells. The performance of each cell disruption method was evaluated in terms of two key indicators: reduction in the intact cell count and reduction in the average colony diameter. The microalgal strain, Chlorococcum sp., was used throughout the study. The most effective disruption was obtained using high-pressure homogenization (average disruption = 73.8% of initial intact cells) followed by sulfuric acid treatment (average disruption = 33.2% of initial intact cells) and bead beating (average disruption = 17.5% of initial intact cells). Even though ultrasonication failed to disrupt the microalgal cells under the investigated conditions (average disruption = 4.5% of initial intact cells), it still managed to disintegrate cellular colonies. © 2011 .

AB  - The aim of this research work is to investigate the use of straight vegetable sunflower oil (SFO), a liquid biofuel, in a Micro-Gas Turbine (MGT). Compared to conventional diesel engines, micro-gas turbines represent a very reliable, clean and performing small scale cogeneration technology. Commercial gas turbines have already been tested with unconventional fuels, such as biomass derived fuels; however, research work on using Straight Vegetable Oil (SVO) as fuel in MGTs are really scarce.The chemical and physical characteristics of SVO are different from fossil diesel oil and rather far from the common technical specifications for gas turbine liquid fuels, not only in terms of kinematic viscosity and Lower Heating Value, but also as regards other issues as contaminant levels and composition, fuel cold properties, ignition properties, etc. Therefore, particular attention has to be given to the atomization and evaporation phases, as these are the most critical steps to achieve stable and efficient long term operation.An analysis based on numerical correlations available from literature was initially adopted for the analysis of the atomization process, supported by CFD modeling to qualitatively investigate the flow pattern. Control parameters were revised and set so to produce a sunflower oil spray having evaporation time comparable to diesel, and minor adaptations to the fuel line were designed and installed on the MGT.Tests with blends and straight vegetable oil were carried out to assess the difference between the standard and the modified machine, fed by diesel, in terms of exhaust emissions, power output and performances, that were similar to the standard diesel-fed MGT. Measured exhaust emissions were as expected well below those typical of diesel engines of the same size fed with VO. The experimental campaign confirmed that it is possible to operate a MGT fed with SVO through the adoption of minor modifications and by adjusting control parameters. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Six freshwater microalgal strains in the class of Chlorophyceae, including Chlorococcum humicola, Didymocystis bicellularis, Monoraphidium contortum, Oocystis parva, Sphaerocystis sp., and Scenedesmus acutus were isolated from natural habitats in Thailand. The six strains were compared for their biomass yield, lipid content, and lipid productivity in four enriched culture media in batch mode. Significant differences were found across algal strains and culture media. The best strain was found to be C. humicola, which had the highest biomass yield of 0.113. g/l/d (in Kuhl medium), the highest lipid content of 45.94% (in BG-11 medium), and the highest lipid yield of 0.033. g/l/d (in 3NBBM medium). The 3NBBM medium, which has the lowest nitrogen concentration among the four culture media, was considered the optimal culture medium for C. humicola for lipid production. The fatty acid profile of C. humicola was also found to be affected by the culture medium. More oleic acid (C18:1) but less linolenic acid (C18:3) was accumulated in BG-11 and 3NBBM than in Kuhl and N-8 media. Lipid profiles of C. humicola were comparable to palm oil in the percentage of palmitic acid and the total amount of saturated fatty acids; however, C. humicola made more poly-unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic (C18:2) and linolenic (C18:3) acids than oil palms. Lipids from C. humicola were believed to be acceptable for biodiesel production. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study assesses, from an economic standpoint, the most suitable production, provision and conversion paths for converting biomass (straw, willow, Miscanthus) into liquid fuels in Ireland. Results showed that an intermediate conversion step increased biodiesel production costs except at transport distances greater than those expected in Ireland. At a transport distance of 240 km Fischer-Tropsch diesel can be produced from 0.39-0.54 € l-1, suggesting biomass gasification and synthesis technologies have potential to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and that Fischer-Tropsch diesel can, with governmental support, be cost competitive with its fossil diesel equivalent.

AB  - Biodiesel, which is manufactured from vegetables oils, animal fats, or algae can be an excellent alternative fuel to petroleum diesel due to its superior fuel properties and lower pollutant emissions. In contrast, fishing-boat fuel generally has much poorer fuel properties and a high sulfur content that can reach several hundred times that of the premium diesel used in land-based vehicles. Pollutant emissions from fishing boats are known to be a significant source of air pollution in the global environment. This study examines the use of biodiesel to replace fishing-boat fuel A to reduce pollutant emissions from fishing boats. The incremental cost, reduction in emissions, and cost-benefit corresponding to various weight proportions of biodiesel to replace fishing-boat fuel A are evaluated. The results show that the annual consumption of fishing-boat fuel A by Taiwanese fishing boats amounts to 649,201 kiloliters (kl) and total emissions from burning the fuel is 958.93 tons per year. If all fishing-boat fuel A were replaced with biodiesel, then pollutant emissions would be decreased by 421.94 tons, or 44.0%. However, this would also result in a USD 144.45 million or 25.85% increase in fuel cost. This study also finds that a replacing 20. wt% of fishing-boat fuel A with biodiesel has the highest cost-benefit ratio, which implies a larger reduction in emissions with a lower fuel cost increase, and is the most suitable option for fishing boats in Taiwan. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is one of the most promising renewable, alternative and environmentally friendly biofuels that can be used in diesel engine without any need for any modification in the engine. However, researchers have reported that the engines running with biodiesel emit NOx in higher concentrations. To address this problem, in the present study an experimental investigation has been carried out on the combustion, performance and emission characteristics of a compression ignition (CI) engine running with biodiesel under steady state conditions with a novel NOx reducing mechanism involving a water injections system. The experimental work has been conducted on a four-cylinder, four-stroke, direct injection (DI) as well as turbocharged diesel engine. In this investigation, biodiesel (produced from the rapeseed oil by transesterification process) has been used. During the experiments the in-cylinder pressure, specific fuel consumption, water injection flow rate, fuel flow rate and exhaust emission (NOx, CO, CO2 and THC) were measured. The experimental results clearly indicate that water injection at a rate of 3 kg/h results in the reduction of NOx emission by about 50% without causing any significant change in the specific fuel consumption. Furthermore, the water injection in the intake manifold has little effect on the in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate of the CI engine under different operating conditions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Palm olein and palm stearin are co-products of palm oil refining processes having different melting point ranges. This study compares the storage degradation characteristics of biodiesels derived from these two palm products, which are palm olein and palm stearin, in terms of chemical properties, engine performance and exhaust emission. The degradation study was carried out by keeping biodiesels in dark closed-lid containers at room temperature for up to 6 months. It was found that the oxygen present in the container led to slow degradation of biodiesels through oxidative reaction with the double bonds in biodiesel. Within 6 months, the majority of oxidative products were composed of shorter hydroperoxide compounds and other short secondary products. These changes resulted in lower heating value and higher density of biodiesels, which in turn caused reductions in fuel combustion efficiency and fuel economy. In terms of emission, the degraded biodiesel produced more complete combustion as indicated by lower emissions of black smoke and carbon monoxide but with higher emission of NOx. In terms of palm oil type, even though palm olein biodiesel possessed higher degree of unsaturation and produced higher peroxide value and acid values from the degradation, its combustion efficiency and fuel economy were still superior to the biodiesel produced from palm stearin possibly due to its higher chain lengths. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effect of biodiesel fuel made from rapeseed oil and methanol on the corrosion properties of copper, mild carbon steel, aluminum, and stainless steel was studied and compared with those of commercial diesel fuel. The results show that the metals mentioned above corroded with variable degrees as they were immersed in the biodiesel fuel at 43 °C for 60 days. Their corrosion rates were 0.02334, 0.01819, 0.00324, and 0.00087. mm/year, respectively. However, the corrosion rates of the metals immersed in commercial diesel fuel were relatively lower under the same corrosion conditions. The effects of biodiesel on the corrosion of copper and mild carbon steel were more significant than on aluminum and stainless steel. The corrosion process of metal surfaces in the biodiesel was mainly attributed to the chemical corrosion according to the experimental results with the help of SEM/EDS, AAS, and XPS. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Viscosity is an important property of fuels for internal combustion engines and has normative values in quality standards for commercial fuels used in compression ignition engines. Elaborating reliable models to estimate viscosity of biodiesel-diesel-bioethanol blends is useful to blend fuels with high biofuel content that comply with the values of viscosity imposed in quality standards and to model and simulate injection and combustion processes for such fuels. For predicting viscosity of rapeseed oil biodiesel-diesel-bioethanol blends, 15 ternary mixtures were prepared, having a maximum amount of biofuel of 30% v/v. The concentration of biodiesel and bioethanol varies between 5% and 25%, in increments of 5%. Their density and viscosity were determined in nine steps in the temperature range 273.15-343.15 K. Using experimental data, a number of models to estimate the viscosity of liquid substances were evaluated, including Kay's rule, simple and weighted semi-logarithmic model, and Refutas model. A simple additive model was proposed, named Kay's weighted rule. The models used to describe viscosity of biodiesel-diesel-ethanol blends were critically evaluated and compared on the basis of the correlation coefficient and the percent relative deviation, demonstrating that the model proposed here provides the most accurate estimates for viscosity of biodiesel- diesel-bioethanol blends. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study undertook a physicochemical characterization of particle emissions from a single compression ignition engine operated at one test mode with 3 biodiesel fuels made from 3 different feedstocks (i.e., soy, tallow, and canola) at 4 different blend percentages (20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%) to gain insights into their particle-related health effects. Particle physical properties were inferred by measuring particle number size distributions both with and without heating within a thermodenuder (TD) and also by measuring particulate matter (PM) emission factors with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (PM10). The chemical properties of particulates were investigated by measuring particle and vapor phase Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and also Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) concentrations. The particle number size distributions showed strong dependency on feedstock and blend percentage with some fuel types showing increased particle number emissions, while others showed particle number reductions. In addition, the median particle diameter decreased as the blend percentage was increased. Particle and vapor phase PAHs were generally reduced with biodiesel, with the results being relatively independent of the blend percentage. The ROS concentrations increased monotonically with biodiesel blend percentage but did not exhibit strong feedstock variability. Furthermore, the ROS concentrations correlated quite well with the organic volume percentage of particles - a quantity which increased with increasing blend percentage. At higher blend percentages, the particle surface area was significantly reduced, but the particles were internally mixed with a greater organic volume percentage (containing ROS) which has implications for using surface area as a regulatory metric for diesel particulate matter (DPM) emissions. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The modification of emissions of climate-sensitive exhaust compounds such as CO2, NOx, hydrocarbons, and particulate matter from medium-speed marine diesel engines was studied for a set of fossil and biogenic fuels. Applied fossil fuels were the reference heavy fuel oil (HFO) and the low-sulfur marine gas oil (MGO); biogenic fuels were palm oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, and animal fat. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to the production of biogenic fuels were treated by means of a fuel life cycle analysis which included land use changes associated with the growth of energy plants. Emissions of CO2 and NOx per kWh were found to be similar for fossil fuels and biogenic fuels. PM mass emission was reduced to 10-15% of HFO emissions for all low-sulfur fuels including MGO as a fossil fuel. Black carbon emissions were reduced significantly to 13-30% of HFO. Changes in emissions were predominantly related to particulate sulfate, while differences between low-sulfur fossil fuels and low-sulfur biogenic fuels were of minor significance. GHG emissions from the biogenic fuel life cycle (FLC) depend crucially on energy plant production conditions and have the potential of shifting the overall GHG budget from positive to negative compared to fossil fuels. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Rising fuel costs, an increasing desire to enhance security of energy supply, and potential environmental benefits have driven research into alternative renewable fuels for commercial aviation applications. This paper reports the results of the first measurements of particulate matter (PM) emissions from a CFM56-7B commercial jet engine burning conventional and alternative biomass- and, Fischer-Tropsch (F-T)-based fuels. PM emissions reductions are observed with all fuels and blends when compared to the emissions from a reference conventional fuel, Jet A1, and are attributed to fuel properties associated with the fuels and blends studied. Although the alternative fuel candidates studied in this campaign offer the potential for large PM emissions reductions, with the exception of the 50% blend of F-T fuel, they do not meet current standards for aviation fuel and thus cannot be considered as certified replacement fuels. Over the ICAO Landing Takeoff Cycle, which is intended to simulate aircraft engine operations that affect local air quality, the overall PM number-based emissions for the 50% blend of F-T fuel were reduced by 34 ± 7%, and the mass-based emissions were reduced by 39 ± 7%. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The deoxygenation of methyl octanoate has been investigated over Cs-containing NaX zeolite catalysts at atmospheric pressure with He carrier gas and methanol as a co-feed. By varying the preparation procedures, different amounts of extra-framework Cs were left on the catalyst. The presence of extra-framework Cs affects the acid-basic characteristics of the catalysts and consequently their activity, stability, and particularly the product selectivity. That is, when the amount of extra-framework Cs increases, the corresponding increase in basicity enhances decarbonylation activity as well as catalyst stability. In this case, the deoxygenation of methyl octanoate on CsNaX catalysts was found to yield heptenes and hexenes as main products via surface decomposition of octanoate-like species. When the amount of extra-framework Cs was reduced, the hexene yield readily increased. The enhancement in hexene production can be ascribed to both, a decreased basicity that reduces decarbonylation and to a greater space available within the zeolite cavity for formation of a rather bulky cyclic-like intermediate that leads to hexene. In addition, weakly acidic sites, generated after the excess Cs was removed, resulted in relatively higher yield of inner-olefin product. When Cs was not present in the catalyst (i.e., NaX), other products such as aromatics and coupling compounds were observed. These compounds are less desirable for transportation fuel applications. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - One approach to reducing the costs of advanced biofuel production from cellulosic biomass is to engineer a single microorganism to both digest plant biomass and produce hydrocarbons that have the properties of petrochemical fuels. Such an organism would require pathways for hydrocarbon production and the capacity to secrete sufficient enzymes to efficiently hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose. To demonstrate how one might engineer and coordinate all of the necessary components for a biomass-degrading, hydrocarbon-producing microorganism, we engineered a microorganism naïve to both processes, Escherichia coli, to grow using both the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions of several types of plant biomass pretreated with ionic liquids. Our engineered strains express cellulase, xylanase, beta-glucosidase, and xylobiosidase enzymes under control of native E. coli promoters selected to optimize growth on model cellulosic and hemicellulosic substrates. Furthermore, our strains grow using either the cellulose or hemicellulose components of ionic liquid-pretreated biomass or on both components when combined as a coculture. Both cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic strains were further engineered with three biofuel synthesis pathways to demonstrate the production of fuel substitutes or precursors suitable for gasoline, diesel, and jet engines directly from ionic liquid-treated switchgrass without externally supplied hydrolase enzymes. This demonstration represents a major advance toward realizing a consolidated bioprocess. With improvements in both biofuel synthesis pathways and biomass digestion capabilities, our approach could provide an economical route to production of advanced biofuels.

AB  - The sesquiterpene bisabolene was recently identified as a biosynthetic precursor to bisabolane, an advanced biofuel with physicochemical properties similar to those of D2 diesel. High-titer microbial bisabolene production was achieved using Abies grandis α-bisabolene synthase (AgBIS). Here, we report the structure of AgBIS, a three-domain plant sesquiterpene synthase, crystallized in its apo form and bound to five different inhibitors. Structural and biochemical characterization of the AgBIS terpene synthase Class I active site leads us to propose a catalytic mechanism for the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate into bisabolene via a bisabolyl cation intermediate. Further, we describe the nonfunctional AgBIS Class II active site whose high similarity to bifunctional diterpene synthases makes it an important link in understanding terpene synthase evolution. Practically, the AgBIS crystal structure is important in future protein engineering efforts to increase the microbial production of bisabolene. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - Two of the most common stresses in natural environments, as well as in bioreactors, that are of importance in biofuel or bioterrorism contexts are pH and temperature stresses. Superoxide generation has been suspected as a possible reason for the effects of the above stresses, and superoxide is suspected to play a role in cell signaling. But, no information is available on a direct relationship between environmental stress and intracellular superoxide levels. We hypothesize that the exposure of cells to pH stress induces superoxide radicals, which leads to oxidative cellular damage, and thus it affects cells in culture. We tested the hypothesis on a model organism, Bacillus subtilis, which is well studied, and has relevance in biofuel and bioterrorism contexts. Bacillus subtilis cells were exposed to different pH-stress conditions (pH 5, 6, 8, or 9) and temperature-stress conditions (42, 45, 48, and 55 °C). Specific superoxide levels at pH 8 and 9 were 22% and 160%, respectively, higher than that of normal growth pH (pH 7), which was 6.48 ± 0.37 mmol (1012 live cells)-1. Superoxide generation due to pH stress has not been reported thus far in the literature. Although detection of superoxide induced by temperature stress has been reported, it has not been quantified. When Bacillus subtilis cells were exposed to 42, 45, 48, and 55 °C for 1 h, the specific intracellular superoxide levels were 52%, 150%, 220%, and 314%, respectively, higher than the value at normal growth temperature, 37 °C. The extent of intracellular lipid peroxidation was higher under the stressed conditions. The mechanism for alkaline pH-stress-induced superoxide generation seems to be the continuation of metabolic activities even though the growth is arrested. The mode of temperature-stress-mediated cell death is necrosis, and the extent of cell death is correlated with the specific intracellular superoxide level. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Second-generation liquid fuels are now at the development stage that precedes their industrial implementation. They offer significant market opportunities for French lignocellulosic resources both from forests and crops. Those resources are limited and it is important to avoid competing against food crops or destabilising the sectors that already operate. It is therefore essential for the actors in research on these resources and processes to work in partnership and produce a common response to these issues. The REGIX project has provided an assessment of the suitability of various types of forests and cultivated biomass to the needs of processes for producing second-generation biofuels via biochemical and thermochemical processes. This article provides an overview of this approach for four classes of forest biomass: short and very short rotation coppice (SRC and VSRC), wood chips from hardwoods and from softwoods. The results show that these classes are very well-suited to most of the specifications for these processes, but a number of drawbacks were also noted, in particular for VSRC.

AB  - Given that biodiesel is emerging as a viable solution for some energy and environmental problems, research on raw materials appropriate for its production is a matter of growing interest. In this study we present the results of research devoted to preliminary analysis on several vegetable (biomass) species potentially useful for producing biodiesel. The bioprospection zone is a region on the Colombian Pacific coast. The candidate species collected underwent different standardized ASTM tests in order for us to define properties that facilitate their evaluation. Some of the species underwent a transesterification process. Comparisons between the thermo-physical properties of the biofuels obtained and the properties of commercial diesel were carried out. Also, performance tests for these biofuels were conducted in compression ignition engines, particularly evaluating efficiency, fuel consumption, and potency at different RPMs.

AB  - Biodiesel, a mixture of long-chain fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), is pointed out as a feasible sustainable fuel to replace fossil fuel in the transportation sector. The homogeneous basic catalysed processes, presently in use, present several drawbacks that can be minimized by replacing homogeneous catalysts with heterogeneous ones. This work presents a first stage in the development and optimization of new heterogeneous catalysts that are capable of producing biodiesel. Cheap and environmentally benign materials, such as lime and magnesia, showed promising catalytic performance even under mild reaction conditions. Additionally, data have underlined the relevance of the catalysts' stability since several tested materials showed significant FAME yield in a first reaction batch but with null behavior when reused in a second batch. © 2011 by Begell House, Inc.

AB  - The on-going adoption of biofuels is presenting problems for automotive diesel engine systems, due to the differing mixture preparation and combustion properties of the widely varying fuel blends in the vehicle tank. Diesel engine management has improved enormously, yet it still relies largely on look-up tables and 'reactive' exhaust treatment technologies. 'Intelligent Fuel Characterization' facilitates a 'proactive' engine management role by gathering, processing and making available information about the precise fuel blend which is about to be combusted in the engine. The engine management system can then use this information to optimise engine system operating points for the exact blend of fuel. This paper introduces the concept of Intelligent Fuel Characterization and presents ideas for its implementation, including promising sensor and data analysis technologies. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.

AB  - This article presents the current state of biodiesel production in Europe, with particular attention putted onto the quality requirements in different countries, and differences between methyl esters properties derived from various raw materials. The propertiesof fatty raw materials available in the domestic market, such as: apeseed, sunflower, corn, linseed, soybean, olive and castor oils, and also the lard, as well as their methyl esters were investigated. The analysis show that the methyl esters of castor oil can be extremely valuable addition to the fuels, which improves their low and high temperature properties. Thus, it is possible to improve the quality of esters derived from animal or waste, gastronomic fats. Moreover, the special attention was putted onto the possibility of an empirical analysis of the biofuels selected properties(on the basis of their chemical composition), which allows planning and improving their quality.

AB  - Environmental and economic concerns accelerated biofuels research and industrial production. Many countries have been using diesel and biodiesel blends as fuels justifying research on biofilms formation and metals corrosion. Cylinders made of AISI-1020 carbon steel with an exposed area of 1587 mm 2, water, and water associated with B3 fuel (diesel/biodiesel blend at 97: 3 v/v) were used.The formation of biofilms was detected, and biocorrosion was detected on AISI-1020. The results showed a variation in sessile microflora during the experiments. In the biofilms, a significant concentration of aerobic, anaerobic, IOB, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and sulfate-reducing bacteria was observed. The corrosion rates varied between 0.45±0.01 and 0.12±0.01 mm/year, depending on the experimental conditions. The main corrosion products identified were various forms of FeOOH, magnetite, and all forms of FexSy. In systems where there were high levels of sulfate reducing bacteria, corrosion pits were observed. In addition, the aliphatic hydrocarbons present in the fluid containing 10% B3 were totally degraded. © 2011 Ivanilda Ramos de Melo et al.

AB  - Lipase from Candida rugosa (CRL) was immobilized by covalent attachment on hydrous niobium oxide. The matrix could effectively be attached to the enzyme with high retention of activity and prevent its leakage. Following immobilization, CRL exhibited improved storage stability and performed better at higher incubation temperatures. In addition, the enzyme retained most of its catalytic efficiency after successive operational cycles. The immobilized derivative was also fully characterized with respect to its morphological properties: particle size, surface specific area, and pore size distribution. Structural integrity and conformational changes, such as surface cavities in the support, set by the lipase procedure, were observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy. Additionally, a comparative study between free and immobilized lipases was provided in terms of pH, temperature, and thermal stability. CRL derivative was evaluated for the synthesis of biodiesel employing babassu oil and short chain alcohols. The process was feasible only for oil and butanol reaction system.

AB  - Transesterified vegetable oils are being researched as alternative fuel for diesel engines. However, their higher viscosity is limiting their direct use in diesel engines. In this study, three vegetable oils (viz., mustard, karanja, and neem) were first transesterified using an alkaline catalyst. The combustion, performance and emission characteristics of vegetable oil butyl esters and blends (10:90, 15:85, 20:80, and 25:75) with diesel oil were analysed in a direct compression ignition (C.I.) engine. Studies have revealed that on blending esterified vegetable oils with diesel a remarkable improvement in their physical and chemical properties took place. For studying the combustion properties of oil blends, engine was run at different loads at a constant speed. Studies have indicated that engine can be run at all the three oils, however 20% blend of oils showed a closer performance to pure diesel more so in case of 20% blend of karanja oil as a significant ificant (p〈0.05) reduction of particulate, carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbons were observed compared to diesel. These studies have thus revealed that with the use of transesterified oils and their blends can be used to fuel diesel engine, which will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and also help to decrease to a large extent environmental pollution. © Research India Publications.

AB  - The Kyoto Protocol has initiated Clean Development Mechanism projects in developing countries as one means to offset carbon emitted in developed nations. Biofuels may be a viable solution, but we argue here that it may also compete with local smallholder farming systems and labour resources. This study assesses the integration of tree bio-diesel crop Jatropha curcas into smallholder agriculture in Tamil Nadu, India using data collected from 66 farms through surveys and interviews. Jatropha cultivation carries significant risks for the smallholders. Jatropha competes for space and harvest labour with other market and subsistence crops and does not produce any economic returns until three years after planting. If the jatropha harvests or market price fail or fluctuate, smallholders could default on their loans. This risk could lead to significant changes in the land-holding class structure. Climate change policies, non-governmental organizationss, and national and regional governments should support landholders to sustainably integrate a new crop like jatropha into current holdings, otherwise the current alternative energy revolution could create more problems than it solves. Smallholders are particularly vulnerable to economic risk and crop failure exposure even with well-planned biofuel policies. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Highly efficient synthesis of clean biofuels using the bio-syngas obtained from biomass gasification was performed over Fe 1.5Cu 1Zn 1Al 1K 0.117 catalyst. The maximum biofuel yield from the bio-syngas reaches about 1.59 kg biofuels/(kg catalh) with a contribution of 0.57 kg alcohols/(kg catalh) and 1.02 kg liquid hydrocarbons/(kg catalh). The alcohol products in the resulting biofuels were dominated by the C2 + alcohols (mainly C2 - C6 alcohols) with a content of 73.55%-89.98%. The selectivity of the liquid hydrocarbons (C5 +) in the hydrocarbon products ranges from 60.37% to 70.94%. The synthesis biofuels also possess a higher heat value of 40.53-41.49 MJ/kg. The effects of the synthesis conditions, including temperature, pressure, and gas hourly space velocity, on the biofuel synthesis were investigated in detail. The catalyst features were characterized by inductively coupled plasma and atomic emission spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, temperature programmed reduction, and the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms measurements. The present biofuel synthesis with a higher biofuel yield and a higher selectivity of liquid hydrocarbons and C2 + alcohols may be a potentially useful route to produce clean biofuels and chemicals from biomass. © 2011 Chinese Physical Society.

AB  - This study investigates the size distribution of nano/ultrafine particle-bound PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and the PAH-associated carcinogenic potency/cytotoxicity of the exhaust from a generator that is fuelled with D100 (pure petroleum diesel) and S20 (v/v = 20% soy-biodiesel/80% D100) and operated at stable energy output loads (0 and 3 kW). A micro-orifice uniform deposit impactor (MOUDI) and a Nano-MOUDI (with aerodynamic diameters of 0.01- 18 μm) were used to collect PM samples. The cytotoxicity of the organic solvent extracts of PM samples to the human male monocytic cell strain (U937) was evaluated using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) method. The results indicate that at both loads, using S20 in place of D100 effectively reduced the emissions of DEPs, PAHs in the DEPs, and PAHs-associated BaP eq; furthermore, the unit mass cytotoxicity of ultrafine particles and nano-particles in the DEPs was also lowered (by an average of 52.6%). Therefore, soybean biodiesel (S20) can be used as an alternative fuel to petroleum diesel to reduce the hazards of emissions from diesel engines to human health. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.

AB  - Helsinki Region Transport, Neste Oil, Proventia Emission Control, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and Aalto University carried out a 3.5 year PPP venture "OPTIBIO" to demonstrate the use of paraffinic renewable diesel (hydrotreated vegetable oil HVO) in city buses. The project cooperated with the bus manufacturer Scania. The fleet test in Metropolitan Helsinki, involving some 300 buses at four bus operators, was the largest one in the world to demonstrate this new fuel. The fuels were a 30 % HVO blend and 100 % HVO. The field test was supplemented by a comprehensive in-laboratory research programme on fuel effects on exhaust emissions and low-temperature operability. All in all, the vehicles accumulated some 50 million kilometres between September 2007 and December 2010, of which some 1.5 million kilometres on 100 % HVO. Average distance per vehicle was some 170,000 km. The amounts of fuel used were about 22 million litres of blended fuel and 1 million litres of neat HVO. The project confirmed that HVO actually works as a drop-in fuel, meaning that HVO can replace diesel fuel 100 % without any modifications to the refuelling system or to the vehicles, without causing any operational problems. The emission testing, both the screening and the follow-up measurements, demonstrated significant and permanent emission benefits. Based on the findings of the OPTIBIO project, Scania has approved the use of 100 % HVO (NExBTL) in its city and intercity buses with DC9 engines. After the demonstration phase, the markets will determine the future of high concentration HVO fuels in Finland. Low-level blending is already used commercially to fulfil the general biofuels obligation. Copyright © VTT 2011.

AB  - Today world is facing three critical problems: (1) high fuel prices, (2) climatic changes, (3) air pollution. There are several reasons for biofuels to be considered as relevant technologies by both developing and industrialized countries. They include energy security reasons, environmental concerns, foreign exchange savings, and socioeconomic issues related to the rural sectors of all countries in the world. The main advantages of using biomass and biomass derivatives in energy production are low sulfur, nitrogen and metal content and neutral CO 2. Most traditional biofuels, such as ethanol from corn, wheat, or sugar beets, and biodiesel from oil seeds, are produced from classic agricultural food crops that require high-quality agricultural land for growth. Land use impacts were related to the area of land used, physical land use. Biofuels are oxygenated compounds. The oxygenated compounds such as ethanol, methanol and biodiesel provide more efficient combustion, and cleaner emissions. Most traditional biofuels, such as ethanol from corn, wheat, or sugar beets, and biodiesel from oil seeds, are produced from classic agricultural food crops that require high-quality agricultural land for growth. Aspect of impact category land use is an important parameter for biomass energy. This impact category describes the environmental impact resulting from land use for human activities. Results indicate that the transformations of biofuels are greater than those of fossil fuels, thus showing that a larger amount of resources is required to get the environmental friendly product. Ethanol made from biomass provides unique environmental, economic strategic benefits and can be considered as a safe and cleanest liquid fuel alternative to fossil fuels Neat biodiesel and biodiesel blends reduce particulate matter (PM), hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions and increase nitrogen oxides (NO x) emissions compared with diesel fuel used in an unmodified diesel engine. © Sila Science.

AB  - Carbon leakage in the fuel market due to alternative biofuel policies is shown to have two components: a market leakage (or 'indirect output use change') effect and an emissions savings effect. We also distinguish between domestic and international leakage and show how omitting the former can bias leakage estimates. International leakage is always positive, but domestic leakage can be negative with a biofuel mandate. We show leakage due to a tax credit is greater than that of a mandate, while the combination of a mandate and subsidy generates greater leakage than a mandate alone. In general, one gasoline-equivalent gallon of corn ethanol is estimated to replace only 0.35 to 0.50 gallons of gasoline-not one (1.00) gallon as assumed by life-cycle accounting. Taking this market leakage effect into account, we conclude that corn ethanol does not meet the US minimum carbon savings threshold, irrespective of whether the effect of indirect land use change is taken into account. © 2011 AgBioForum.

AB  - Flax is a culture that can be used fully, not only for fibre and seed, but also for other purposes. In Latvia fibre flax is grown, but in recent years emphasis is increasing on oil flax, which is used for the production of oil and seed cake for animal feed and energy. The largest areas of flax are located in the east of Latvia, where there are more suitable conditions for flax growing. The aim of this paper is to describe ten Latvian flax oil hybrids and eleven Latvian fibre flax accessions. Lithuanian variety 'Vega2' was used as a standard for fibre flax, but 'Lirina' was used as a standard for oil flax, and the trial was organized into three replications. The main objective of the research is to assess yield and quality of the oil flax hybrids. The quantity of flax fibre and seed yield depends on many factors. Several qualitative and quantitative traits, resistance to lodging, vegetation period, and yield of seeds, oil content and quality were evaluated. The highest seed yield was in 2007 - 169.2g m -2 and 2009 - 300.6g m -2 from which on average 2.1t ha -2 seed can be obtained. Seed yield obtained of seven samples of oil flax (70%) was higher than the standard. The oil content is higher in the standard sort of oil flax and it reaches 48.6%, whereas 'Vega' reaches 42.3%. Some samples of flax have a high perspective to use the surplus of oil for biofuel.

AB  - Problem statement: Diesel engine emits more pollutants to atmosphere causing air pollution. This necessitates the search of a renewable alternate fuel which is environment friendly. The objective of this research was to investigate the environmental aspects of pongamia bio-fuel in a single cylinder diesel engine with the influence of fuel injection pressure. Approach: Bio-fuel was prepared from non-edible Pongamia pinnata oil by transesterification and used as a fuel in C.I engine. The effect of fuel injection pressure on the engine emission characteristics of a single cylinder direct injection diesel engine has been experimentally investigated using pongamia pinnata methyl ester and its blends with diesel fuel from 0-30% with an increment of 5% at full load. The tests were conducted at five different injection pressures (190, 200, 210, 220 and 230 KN m -2) by means of adjusting injector spring tension. Results: Compared to diesel, blend B5 exhibits lower engine emissions of unburnt hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and carbon di oxide at full load. The High injection pressure of 220 KN m -2 shows lesser emissions of unburnt hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide while oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide are found to be slightly higher than diesel and blends at full load. Conclusion: From the test results, it was found that a high injection pressure of 220 KN m -2 causes better atomization with improved engine emission characteristics for diesel and blends at full load. Moreover blend B5 showed best results at 220 KN m -2 injection pressure. © 2011 Science Publications.

AB  - Biodiesel was produced from the underutilized seed oil of Terminalia catappa using a two-step reaction system. The first step is a pretreatment process, which involved the use of 2% sulphuric acid in methanol, and the second step is a transesterification reaction using KOH as the catalyst. The results of the applied method showed a conversion that gave an ester content of above 97% with phosphorus content below 1 ppm in the biodiesel. The biodiesel produced from the oil of T. catappa exhibited properties that are in agreement with the recommended European standards (EN 14214) and American standards (ASTM D 6751-07b). This study supports the use of crude T. catappa as a viable and valuable raw feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The aim of this work is to reduce NO x emissions in the compression ignition engine run by biofuel. In this work, single-cylinder direct-injection diesel engine was operated using diesel fuel and eucalyptus oil and diesel fuel (EOF) blends with 15% exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). The emission parameters such as NO x, smoke density and unburned hydrocarbon were measured to estimate the emissions. From the results, it is found that there is 50-60% reduction in NO x and other emissions when using EOF blends in engines operated with 15% EGR. The result reveals that there is an increase of 3-4% in brake thermal efficiency for all EOF blends when compared with diesel fuel without and with 15% EGR. The brake-specific energy consumption of EOF blends is lesser when compared with the base diesel fuel. The cylinder pressure and heat release rate are higher for EOF blends compared with diesel fuel with 15% EGR. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The economics of biodiesel production shows that the cost of raw material is the main driver of the overall production costs. Operation cost of biodiesel production does not reflect significant economy of scale because scale-dependent variable such as labour, chemical and maintenance costs are only a small part of the operating expenses. The success of the biodiesel industry is therefore reliant upon the availability of adequate supplies of reasonably priced feedstocks. The potential oil crops for use in Southern Africa countries for biodiesel production are not well-documented. This paper analyzes the potential availability of biodiesel feedstock in Southern Africa and discusses their suitability, adaptability of the various oils as precursors for biodiesel production. Potential feedstocks are identified which is by no means an all inclusive list but contains major oil crops/feedstock that can be used for biodiesel production. The current and future availability of each feedstock are evaluated and growing regions for dedicated biodiesel oil seeds is proposed using multi criteria decision analysis based on analytic hierarchy process methodology. This paper also discusses the sustainability of using non-food crops as biodiesel feedstock against the backdrop of current biofuel policies and initiatives in Southern Africa. This study provides investment information to potential investors and further set the context for biofuel discussion and development in the African continent. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biofuels like ethanol, biodiesel, have attracted attention of people worldwide and proved to be the successful fuel alternates to petroleum products. In the present investigation, the effect of supercharging is studied on the performance of a direct injection Diesel engine using ethanol diesel blends with palm stearin methyl ester as additive. The performance of the engine is evaluated in terms of brake specific fuel consumption, thermal efficiency, exhaust gas temperature, unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide emissions, and smoke opacity. The investigation results showed that the output and torque performance of the engine with supercharging was improved in comparison with naturally aspirated engine. It is observed that the brake thermal efficiency of ethanol diesel blends was higher than that of diesel. With supercharging brake thermal efficiency is further improved. Brake specific fuel consumption of ethanol, ester, and diesel blends are lower compared with diesel at full load. Further reduction in brake specific fuel consumption is observed with supercharging. Nitrous oxide formation seems to decrease with ethanol, ester, and diesel blends. Hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions are more with ethanol, ester, and diesel blends with supercharging slight reduction in those values are observed.

AB  - As fuel availability is bound to be a very important issue in the future, the study of multifuel operation is becoming a necessity. Cogeneration plants feature high overall thermal efficiency and, therefore, much lower carbon dioxide emissions. A further reduction in CO 2 emissions can be achieved by using biofuels. This fuel class, however, features specific problems and needs more or less extensive modifications to the combustion system. Given their environmental benefits, the use of biofuels in cogeneration systems is very likely to increase. A theoretical comparison is made between biogas fuelling and gasoline, diesel and natural gas use for different technologies such as internal combustion engines, gas turbines and steam generators. CO 2 emissions are calculated, taking into consideration different factors such as fuel conversion efficiency, part load operation, fuel type, etc. By using biogas, carbon neutral operation can be achieved, with very high overall thermal efficiency levels.

AB  - Energy plays an important role in the development of any nation. But with the present rate of consumption, conventional sources of energy like natural gas and petroleum will be exhausted shortly. That's why the concept of using bioenergy is giving attention worldwide. Hence, biofuels appears to be a proven renewable energy option. In this paper, we address the issue of producing vegetable oil from Jatropha Curcas seeds, using both mechanical and solvent extraction methods. We are also interested in the production of biodiesel from the raw oil obtained (i.e transesterification or alcoholysis). Results showed that solvent extraction produced high quality oil than mechanical extraction. It was also found that parameters such as oil temperature, reaction temperature, ratio of alcohol to oil and purity of reactants are factors that affect the transesterification process. The use of KOH instead of NaOH as catalyst gave better quality of biodiesel.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to quantify the particulate matter emission from ternary blends comprehending biodiesel, ethanol and vegetable oil in a Diesel cycle engine, and an identical engine working with petrol diesel as control. To compare the fuels' emissions, the particulate matter from the engine's exhaust was collected, using a fiberglass circular filter paper, which was coupled by means of a steel flange at the end of the exhaust pipe. The results with ternary blends showed expressive reduction of particulate matter level exhausted by the engine, in its maximum load. We can conclude that the utilization of ternary blends, with the methods and conditions of this experiment, was efficient to reduce the emission of particulate matter contained in the exhaust gases of Diesel cycle engine.

AB  - Use of biodiesel produces engine oil dilution because of unburned biodiesel impinging on cold walls of the combustion chamber, being scrapped to the oil pan, and leading to changes of oil friction, wear and lubricity properties. In this paper, mixtures of SAE 15W-40 oil, which were contaminated by known percentages of the biodiesels from canola oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, and chicken fat, were tested in a pin-on-disk tribometer. A contact was employed of AISI 1018 steel disk and AISI 316 stainless-steel ball for pin material, and friction force and specific wear were measured. Wear on the disk surfaces showed that any degree of mineral-oil dilution by the tested biodiesels reduces the wear protection of engine oil even at small mixture percentages. However, these reductions were not substantially different than those observed for same percentages of dilution of mineral oil by fossil diesel. The tested mixture of oil contaminated with animal fat feedstock (e.g., chicken fat) biodiesel showed the best wear behavior as compared to those for the other tested mixtures (of mineral oil with vegetable feedstock biodiesel dilutions). Obtained results are discussed as baseline for further studies in a renewable energy multidisciplinary approach on biofuels and biolubes. Copyright © 2011 S. M. Shanta et al.

AB  - Biodiesel is produced domestically from a variety of seed oils including soybeans, rapeseed and corn. Biodiesel can be used in diesel engines (cars, trucks, busses, construction equipment), in jet engines and, in heating and electricity generating systems. Use of biodiesel reduces nitrogen oxide emissions compared to fuel oil (a form of diesel fuel). This report estimates the net health benefits of using biodiesel. Biodiesel is environmentally safer than petro-diesel. It is nontoxic, produces less skin irritation, it degrades four times as fast as petro-diesel, has a flash point significantly higher than that of petrodiesel, thus making it safer to store and handle. © EM International.

AB  - A set of experiments to determine the flammability limits of pure and binary blends of fuels was carried out in a combustion tube operated at atmospheric pressure. The lowest and highest volumetric fraction of vapor fuels that allowed flame propagation when the air/fuel mixture was submitted to a high voltage spark with energy higher than the minimum ignition energy defined the lower and upper flammability limit, respectively. The obtained experimental results for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), acetone, ethylic alcohol, gasoline, diesel, and bioethanol are in close agreement with results reported in the literature. Diagrams of flammability limits of mixtures of gasoline/bioethanol and diesel/biodiesel were found within the range of composition of standard commercial blends of these fuels available formarket in Brazil. The autoignition temperature and the influence of temperature on flammability limits of pure ethanol and a commercial mixture with 4% of biodiesel and 96% of diesel were experimentally determined.

AB  - Projected growth of aviation depends on fueling where specific needs must be met. Safety is paramount, and along with political, social, environmental, and legacy transport systems requirements, alternate aviation fueling becomes an opportunity of enormous proportions. Biofuelssourced from halophytes, algae, cyanobacteria, and weeds using wastelands, waste water, and seawaterhave the capacity to be drop-in fuel replacements for petroleum fuels. Biojet fuels from such sources solve the aviation CO2 emissions issue and do not compete with food or freshwater needs. They are not detrimental to the social or environmental fabric and use the existing fuels infrastructure. Cost and sustainable supply remain the major impediments to alternate fuels. Halophytes are the near-term solution to biomass/biofuels capacity at reasonable costs; they simply involve more farming, at usual farming costs. Biofuels represent a win-win approach, proffering as they doat least the ones we are studyingmassive capacity, climate neutral-to-some sequestration, and ultimately, reasonable costs.

AB  - One major problem in the lipase-catalyzed production of biodiesel or fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) is the high acidity of the product, mainly caused by water presence, which produces parallel hydrolysis and esterification reactions instead of transesterification to FAME. Therefore, the use of reaction medium in absence of water (anhydrous medium) was investigated in a lipase-catalyzed process to improve FAME yield and final product quality. FAME production catalyzed by Novozym 435 was carried out using waste frying oil (WFO) as raw material, methanol as acyl acceptor, and 3. Å molecular sieves to extract the water. The anhydrous conditions allowed the esterification of free fatty acids (FFA) from feedstock at the initial reaction time. However, after the initial esterification process, water absence avoided the consecutives reactions of hydrolysis and esterification, producing FAME mainly by transesterification. Using this anhydrous medium, a decreasing in both the acid value and the diglycerides content in the product were observed, simultaneously improving FAME yield. Enzyme reuse in the anhydrous medium was also studied. The use of the moderate polar solvent tert-butanol as a co-solvent led to a stable catalysis using Novozym 435 even after 17 successive cycles of FAME production under anhydrous conditions. These results indicate that a lipase-catalyzed process in an anhydrous medium coupled with enzyme reuse would be suitable for biodiesel production, promoting the use of oils of different origin as raw materials. © 2011 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

AB  - Biodiesel is a fuel derived from vegetable oils or wastes. It has a lot of advantages such as less offensive exhaust, more complete combustion, reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and sulfur in addition to generating employment and wealth. This biofuel can be produced through the transesterification reaction of an alcohol with a triglyceride, with the aid of a catalyst, resulting on a biodiesel as main product, glycerol, and other byproducts. The objective of this study is to determine the optimal reaction conditions for transesterification of waste frying oil and fish, varying the reaction time, the amount of catalyst and temperature, to determine which of these variables exert a greater influence on the reaction yield, and characterize biofuels obtained. For a more accurate assessment of the influence of a given variable on the reaction yield, it was performed a statistical experimental design, the full factorial of two levels with three parameters (23) and three central points, implemented in Statistica 7.0. Regarding the transesterification of waste of the fish oil, the amount of catalyst was the variable that most influenced the reaction yield, the parameters time and temperature had negligible impact on income. Biofuels were also characterized using thermal analysis techniques and FTIR. Most reactions obtained thermogravimetric yield above 90%, a promising result. © 2011 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - The diversity of raw materials and technological routes employed in the biodiesel production has resulted in products with different chemical properties. This non-uniformity in the biodiesel composition may influence to the fuel quality. The aim of this study was to evaluate biodiesel blends of passion fruit and castor oil in different proportions and their thermal stability. Biodiesel blends of passion fruit and castor oil presented parameters in the standards of the Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels National Agency. The TG curves indicated that castor oil biodiesel was more stable. Passion fruit biodiesel has a high content of oleic and linoleic acids, which are more susceptible to oxidation. Biodiesel blend of passion fruit and castor oil 1:1 increased the thermal stability in relation to passion fruit biodiesel. Biodiesel blend of passion fruit and castor oil 1:2 presented higher thermal stability, because castor oil has a high content of ricinoleic acid. © 2011 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Global research and industrial development of liquid transportation biofuels are moving at a rapid pace. This is mainly due to the significant roles played by biofuels in decarbonising our future energy needs, since they act to mitigate the deleterious impacts of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere that are contributors of climate change. Governmental obligations and international directives that mandate the blending of biofuels in petrol and diesel are also acting as great stimuli to this expanding industrial sector. Currently, the predominant liquid biofuel is bioethanol (fuel alcohol) and its worldwide production is dominated by maize-based and sugar cane-based processes in North and South America, respectively. In Europe, fuel alcohol production employs primarily wheat and sugar beet. Potable distilled spirit production and fuel alcohol processes share many similarities in terms of starch bioconversion, fermentation, distillation and co-product utilisation, but there are some key differences. For example, in certain bioethanol fermentations, it is now possible to yield consistently high ethanol concentrations of ~20% (v/v). Emerging fuel alcohol processes exploit lignocellulosic feedstocks and scientific and technological constraints involved in depolymerising these materials and efficiently fermenting the hydrolysate sugars are being overcome. These so-called secondgeneration fuel alcohol processes are much more environmentally and ethically acceptable compared with exploitation of starch and sugar resources, especially when considering utilisation of residual agricultural biomass and biowastes. This review covers both first and second-generation bioethanol processes with a focus on current challenges and future opportunities of lignocellulose-to-ethanol as this technology moves from demonstration pilot-plants to full-scale industrial facilities. © 2011 The Institute of Brewing & Distilling.

AB  - Facing climate change and growing energy prices, the use of bioenergy is continuously increasing in order to diminish greenhouse gas emissions, secure energy supply and create employment in rural areas. Because the production of biomass or biofuels, wherever it takes place, comes along with externalities, positive or negative, the need for biomass and bioenergy sustainability criteria is more than ever felt. Research on sustainability criteria and certification systems has started through several national and international initiatives. Considering the benefits of an increased use of bioenergy but also the urge for limiting potential negative environmental and socio-economic impacts, the aim of these initiatives was to make the first move regarding bioenergy sustainability, while waiting for the European legislation to regulate this crucial issue. Land use changes, whether direct or indirect, are one of the most important consequences of bioenergy production. While direct land use changes are more easily assessed locally, indirect land use changes exceed the company level and need to be considered at a global scale. Methodologies for dealing with direct and indirect land use changes are proposed among others in the European, Dutch, British and German sustainability initiatives. This paper aims at presenting and comparing those four European initiatives, with a focus on their propositions for direct and indirect land use changes assessment. Key issues are discussed and recommendations are made for steps to overcome identified difficulties in accurately assessing the effects of indirect land use change due to bioenergy production. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With Germany as the point of energy end-use, 70 current and future modern pathways plus 4 traditional biomass pathways for heat, power and transport have been compiled and examined in one single greenhouse gas (GHG) balancing assessment. This is needed to broaden the narrow focus on biofuels for transport and identify the role of bioenergy in GHG mitigation. Sensitivity analysis for land-use changes and fossil reference systems are included. Co-firing of woody biomass and fermentation of waste biomass are the most cost-efficient and effective biomass applications for GHG emission reduction in modern pathways. Replacing traditional biomass with modern biomass applications offers an underestimated economic potential of GHG emission reduction. The range of maximum CO2 equivalent GHG reduction potential of bioenergy is identified in a range of 2.5-16 Gt a-1 in 2050 (5-33% of today's global GHG emissions), and has an economic bioenergy potential of 150 EJ a-1. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The importance and the economical production of the so-called bio gas oils from triglycerides are presented. They are second generation bio-fuels containing mainly normal and isoparaffin and have gas oil boiling range. The investigation of their producibility was carried out on a Ni(2.3%)Mo(13.7%)/Al2O3/F catalyst. Based on the results the conversion of triglycerides (sunflower oil containing dimethyl disulphide as sulphiding agent), the yield of the target product, furthermore the type and ratio of the deoxygenation reactions and the degree of the paraffin isomerization were determined as a function of the process parameters. On the investigated sulphided catalyst favourable process parameters were found, (350-370°C, 20-40bar, 1.0h-1 LHSV, 500Nm3/m3) where the conversion of triglycerides was over 90% and the yield of the high n- and isoparaffin containing (&gt;99.9%) gas oil boiling range target fraction was relatively high (73.2-75.6%). It was concluded that during the deoxygenation of triglycerides the reduction as well as the decarboxylation/decarbonylation reactions took place, namely C18 and C17 paraffins were formed, too, on the applied catalyst. But the yield of the target fractions did not achieve the theoretical values (81.4-86.5%) at the advantageous process parameters. That is why it is necessary to separate and recirculate the heavy fraction. The isoparaffin content of the target products was significantly higher than the products derived on non-fluorinated catalysts and thus their flow properties are favourable in the aspect of application. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - New sources of biomass for biofuels production had been studied in recent years. Microalgae as oil donors for biodiesel production are a very attractive alternative due to their several benefits but it still is a process that must overcome several technological barriers. Oil composition and the amount of free fatty acid (FFA) makes the microalgae oil a difficult yet promising alternative. In this paper, sequential stages of esterification and then transesterification were studied to convert the microalgae oil (MAO) in biodiesel, glycerol, and water mostly. A more realistic microalgae oil composition was simulated using 9 triglycerides (TG) and 9 FFA's in contrast with other studies were 1-5 components are used to represent the oil. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the temperature effect on the glycerol and water concentration. Finally, energy integration alternatives were analyzed to find a cost-effective way to produce biodiesel from MAO. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article presents a comparative sustainability assessment of three biorefineries that produce liquid fuels used in current infrastructure. The three options considered are biochemical production of ethanol from grain and from cellulosic feedstocks and thermochemical production of Fischer-Tropsch diesel from biomass-derived syngas. These biorefineries were compared using numerous environmental, economic, and social metrics, with numerical values derived from a thorough review of recent literature. For each of the three biorefinery options, the metrics were not determined from a specific process design, but from a variety of different designs reported in literature. Where necessary, corn was selected as the feedstock for grain ethanol and switchgrass was selected for cellulosic ethanol and Fischer-Tropsch diesel. These sustainability metrics were used in an Analytic Hierarchy Process decision analysis to compare the sustainability of the different biorefineries. Thus, a new decision-making tool has been created in which the user can assign different weights to each category and its metrics. This tool was used to explore the influence of different weights, different market conditions, and uncertainties in the values of the metrics on the relative sustainability of the different options. Based on the results of this assessment, cellulosic ethanol biorefineries are modestly more sustainable than grain ethanol and Fischer-Tropsch diesel. Grain ethanol was favorable economically whereas Fischer-Tropsch diesel had the highest score on the societal metrics. © 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Use of crude oil derivatives such as diesel and gasoline is becoming unsuitable due to their detriment to environment and to the increasing worldwide energy demand which is driving crude oil reservoirs towards exhaustion. Replacement of diesel and gasoline with biofuels (i. e. biodiesel and bioethanol, respectively) is very desirable. In fact, biofuels are not only environmentally sustainable, but also potentially inexhaustible due to the large amounts of waste biomasses from which they can be retrieved. In the present study, a model compound (micro-crystalline cellulose) was dissolved in phosphoric acid and converted at 80 °C to glucose, thereby providing the possible substrate for fermentation to bioethanol. Results revealed that after 1 h heating, the reaction had the largest glucose yield as compared to similar studies done by using other acid catalysts. In addition, the temperature applied here was from 40 to 60 °C lower than those already reported in literature for acid-driven cellulose degradations. Phosphoric acid allowed both glucose and levulinic acid achievement. The latter is usually used to synthesize fuel additives, catalysts, solvents and herbicides, thereby enhancing the added value of the conversion of cellulose to glucose in phosphoric acid. Finally, 1H T1 NMR relaxometry showed its suitability to monitor cellulose degradation. The advantages of relaxomety are its quickness since only few minutes are needed to obtain relaxograms, and the possibility to use raw mixtures without the needing of sample preparation. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The production of biofuels and other products from algae is a technology that is rapidly developing. This paper presents an overview of algae, its benefits over other biofuel sources and the technology involved in producing algal biofuel. The case study in this report looks at the potential of algal biodiesel, produced using power plant exhaust, to replace our current petrodiesel supply and consequently reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The results suggest that using 60% of all coal and gas power plants would allow this new fuel source to replace petrodiesel entirely and thus reduce greenhouse gas emissions by ~5%. The challenge at the present is to improve the efficiency of algal fuel production technology so as to lower the cost of algal biodiesel and thereby make it commercially competitive with petrodiesel. Researchers are currently developing various means of accomplishing this and successful commercialization is anticipated by 2018.

AB  - The aim of this work was to obtain biodiesel from animal fats, an inedible feedstock. Three different types of fats were used to produce biodiesel; their main characteristic was high free fatty acid content. Animal fats were transesterified with acid catalyst and basic catalyst with and without pre-esterification. Biodiesel of 89.0wt.% ester content was obtained by acid-transesterification (9wt.%H 2SO 4, 6:1 methanol:fats molar ratio, 60°C, 48h). Pre-esterification conditions were studied for different fats and acid catalysts: 0.5wt.%H 2SO 4 or 1.0wt.%p-TsOH, 6:1 methanol:fats molar ratio, 65°C and 4h made it possible to obtain fats with acid value less than 0.5% FFA. Pre-treatment was effective for fats with different FFA content. Alkali transesterification of esterified fats resulted in a product with 97.3wt.% ester content. Biodiesel quality was evaluated and most of properties were well within EN 14214. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study evaluates the potential impact of increased biofuel production on the hydrology of a small watershed, Khlong Phlo, in the eastern part of Thailand. The water footprint of biofuel energy was estimated for three crops in order to identify the most water-efficient crop. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to evaluate the impact of land use change (LUC) caused by the expansion of biofuel crops on the components of water balance and water quality in the studied watershed. Several LUC scenarios consisting of oil palm (biodiesel), cassava and sugarcane (bio-ethanol) expansion were evaluated. The water footprint results indicated that cassava is more water-efficient than the other two crops considered. Simulation results revealed that although oil palm expansion would have negligible alteration in evapotranspiration (0.5 to 1.6%) and water yield (-0.5 to -1.1%), there would be an increased nitrate loading (1.3 to 51.7%) to the surface water. On the contrary, expansion of cassava and sugarcane would decrease evapotranspiration (0.8 to 11.8%) and increase water yield (1.6 to 18.0%), which would lead to increased sediment (10.9 to 91.5%), nitrate (1.9 to 44.5%) and total phosphorus (15.0 to 165.0%) loading to surface water. Based on the results, it can be concluded that land use change for biodiesel production would affect water quality, while both the water balance components and water quality would be affected by the expansion of bio-ethanol crops. Overall, the study indicates that biofuel production would have a negative impact on the water quality of the studied watershed. Further research at large scale (e.g. basin level) and on the economic aspect is recommended, in order to contribute to developing suitable land use and energy policies. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abstract Hydrotreating catalysis is becoming a promising alternative to transesterification for the production of biofuels derived from vegetable oils. They have potential advantages with respect to both biodiesel fuels and petroleum-derived diesel fuels in terms of production costs, engine emissions and adaptability to current engine designs, but they have also some limitations which may restrict their capability to replace diesel fuels. Those fuel properties considered the most restrictive ones were measured on different blends of HVO (selected among the variety of names given to these fuels) with a winter ultra low sulfur diesel fuel (in 10, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 75 vol.%) in order to propose some blending strategies to optimize engine performance and emissions, to protect the engine components and to keep the vehicle operability. The results obtained show that the main restrictions are imposed by lubricity and cetane number, and, in case of cold regions, also by cold flow properties. A compromise between lubricity and derived cetane number would lead to a recommendation for low or medium HVO concentrations, and blends with concentrations above 50% would not be recommended. Density and viscosity would not impose direct blending restrictions, although the reductions in density could provide some economic savings and some flexibility to refineries. The loss of heating value per unit volume (and consequently the expected increase in fuel consumption) would be lower than 3% in blends up to 50% in volume. Finally, the sooting tendency of the blends is sharply reduced, indicating lower engine PM emissions and reduced need for regeneration of diesel particulate filters. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Jatrpha curcas L., a non-model woody plant belonging to Euphorbiaceae family, is a promising economic plant due to the high oil content in seed and high tolerance to drought and salt stress. The embryo and endosperm of J. curcas seed differ in morphology, function and ploidy. To characterize the protein profiles of these two tissues, we have performed proteomic analysis with the dry mature J. curcas seeds. The data showed that the 2-DE profiles of endosperm and embryo were similar to each other. There are 66 differential proteins between the two seed tissues, in which 28 proteins distributed in 9 distinct functional classes, have been identified successfully in endosperm or embryo. The major groups of differential proteins are associated with metabolism (25%) and disease/defence (18%). Our results demonstrated that in the dry mature J. curcas seeds, the proteins involved in oil mobilization, signal transduction, transcription, protein synthesis, and cell cycle which are essential for the seed germination have occurred in endosperm and embryo, reflecting the fact that proteins required for germination are already present in the dry mature seed. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Development of biofuels from renewable resources is critical to the sustainability of the world's economy and to slow down the global climate change. Currently, a significant amount of bioethanol and biodiesel are produced as biofuels to partially replace gasoline and diesel, respectively, in the transportation sector worldwide. However, these biofuels represent a tiny portion (<4%) of the total fuels consumed. Furthermore, bioethanol is produced predominantly from sugarcane and corn, and biodiesel from crop and plant oils. Production of these raw materials is competing for the limited arable land against food and feed production. It is not feasible to tremendously increase biofuel production using the current technologies. Therefore, it is critical to investigate advanced or 2nd generation biofuel production technologies. This article is trying to summarize the current status of the 2nd generation biofuel technologies including bioethanol from lignocellulosic materials and biodiesel from microalgae. The summary includes the descriptions of the technologies, their advantages and challenges, feedstocks for the 2nd generation biofuels, the key barriers to their commercial applications, and future perspectives of the advanced technologies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Castor plants are a common wild poisonous plant in Asia, and especially a weed seen across Taiwan. Due to its high viscosity and water content, straight castor oil cannot be used as a fuel for DI engine. Transesterification and emulsion technologies have been utilized to improve the spray characteristics of castor oil. Without heat, the castor biodiesel (CBD) completes the transesterification reaction under ambient temperature. Gas chromatography indicates that the CBD yield rate is 97% or above. After long-term biodiesel generator test, the emulsified castor biodiesel (EBD) leads to the problem of engine deposition. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the EBD spray characteristics on DI engine emission and deposit formation. A constant-volume bomb was established to analyze the biodiesel spray characteristics under elevated temperature. A biofuel deposit simulator was developed to solve the EBD deposit problem. Thermal gravimetric analysis, Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscope were utilized to analyze the EBD deposit formation mechanisms. The experimental results indicated that biodiesel generator operated on EBD can improve the fossil diesel emissions. The high NOX emission of CBD was solved by water-biodiesel emulsion technology. The biofuel deposit simulator provided some potential deposit control additives for EBD during the laboratory research stage. Without changing the engine structure, when the injection pressure was increased by 5-10%, the optimum combination was 82.8% of castor biodiesel, 15% of water, 2% of bioethanol, and 0.2% of composite surfactant Span-Tween. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel + diesel fuel mixtures are commonly used in the last years especially in the transport area, in order to reduce environment pollution, and the dependency on the imported fossil fuels. Some of the basic properties of these mixtures, especially density and viscosity, strongly influence spray properties, atomization and combustion processes, engine deposits formation, engine behavior in cold weather conditions, being used as input data for predictive engine combustion models. In this study pseudo-binary biodiesel + diesel fuel and biodiesel + benzene mixtures were prepared and densities, viscosities, and refractive indices of mixtures were measured at 298.15 K. The accuracy of different mixing rules and empirical equations used to estimate these properties was evaluated. The density of the studied mixtures can be predicted with a very good accuracy using Kay's mixing rule or empirical equations obtained from regression analysis. The viscosity of biodiesel + petroleum diesel fuel can be predicted with a very good accuracy using the empirical equations. The viscosities of the two types of biodiesel mixtures are predicted with lower accuracy using Grunberg-Nissan modified equation or one equation developed for petroleum fractions. Density-refractive index and viscosity-refractive index correlations have been developed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel can be used as a substitute for fossil fuels and successful studies have been carried out in different applications. The advantages with biodiesel are lower bulk, higher energy density, as well as more transportable and storable capability. We used butchery waste for the production of hydrocarbon gases and biodiesel. For this purpose we used nano catalyst and anatase form of titanium dioxide photocatalyst at room temperature. In the first experiment, butchery waste was cracked into low melting point oil, solid residue and hydrocarbon gases. In the second experiment, cracked oil was transesterified to biodiesel with NaOH at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The results yielded best quality biodiesel. The economics of this novel process is much more cost competitive due to cheap raw material (butchery waste) that contains high levels of fatty acids. Photocatalysis gave hydrocarbons of prime importance. This study reports an interesting finding that butchery waste could be used for not only the production of biodiesel but also for hydrocarbons. This technology differs from others in that it uses low energy input, cheap and reusable catalyst, with low sulphur and nitrogenous waste gases than petro-diesel and is environment friendly. © 2011 Academic Journals.

AB  - Experiments are carried out on single cylinder four-stroke diesel engine which consists of air gap insulated piston, air gap insulated liner and ceramic coated cylinder head. Vegetable oils are considered to replace diesel fuels as their properties are compatible with diesel fuel. However, the drawbacks of low volatility and high viscosity associated with vegetable oils call for hot combustion chamber, provided by low heat rejection (LHR) diesel engine. Pollution levels of smoke and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) of LHR engine with different test fuels such as jatropha oil based bio-diesel and pongamia oil based bio-diesel are compared to conventional engine with pure diesel operation. Smoke levels decreased with LHR engine with vegetable oils in comparison with conventional engine with pure diesel operation. Copyright © EM International.

AB  - Several biomass fast pyrolysis oils were characterized by 13C and DEPT (distortionless enhancement polarization transfer) NMR analysis to determine their chemical functional group compositions as related to their energy content. Pyrolysis oils were produced from a variety of feedstocks, including energy crops, woods, animal wastes, and oil seed presscakes, and were also compared with fossil fuels (gasoline and diesel). The 13C and DEPT NMR spectra of the biofuels and the two fossil fuel samples were measured, and each spectrum was divided into distinct regions according to the chemical shift ranges appropriate for various functional groups. The spectral intensities of each region were then quantified, and the carbon proton substitution numbers were determined. This approach provided helpful information on the chemical compositions of the oils, but it was found to oversimplify the information contained in the 13C NMR spectra, resulting in a substantial loss of important details. Hence, a chemometric method of analysis based on principle component analysis (PCA) was used to extract more of the useful information from the 13C NMR spectra. The intensities of the 13C NMR spectra from 15 pryolysis and two fossil fuel samples were binned in 2 ppm increments and subjected to unsupervised PCA. Comparison of the PCA scores plots with their respective loadings plots enabled a determination of the chemical shifts and, hence, the chemical functional groups that were most important in discriminating among the clusters. The clustering of the biomass samples based on PCA results were shown to track with their biological origin and their energy contents. Therefore, 13C NMR PCA analysis was shown to be a powerful and facile technique for classifying biomass fast pyrolysis oils. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A novel biodiesel named ethylene glycol monomethyl ether palm oil monoester was developed. This fuel owns one more ester group than the traditional biodiesel. The fuel was synthesized and structurally identified through FT-IR, P1PH NMR analyses and GPC. Engine test results showed that when a tested diesel engine was fueled with this biodiesel in the place of 0# diesel fuel, engine-out smoke emissions decreased by 69.0 to 89.3%, and nitric oxide (NOx) also lessened significantly, but unburned hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions generally do not change noticeably compared with pure diesel fuel. In the area of combustion performances, both engine in-cylinder pressure and its changing rate with crankshaft angle were increased to some extent for ethylene glycol monomethyl ether palm oil monoester because of the higher cetane number and shorter ignition delay. Due to certain amount of oxygen contained in the new biodiesel resulting in the low calorific value, the engine thermal efficiency dropped by 14.4% at record level when fueled with the biodiesel, which needs to be improved in the future. © 2011 Academic Journals.

AB  - Road transport is responsible for about 21% of all waste gases in the European Union. Oil is the almost exclusive source of energy in transport. Since oil reserves are rapidly diminishing in the whole world and as oil prices are changeable, a large number of countries, including the European Union, partly use biofuels instead of oil in transport. Biofuel production technologies have developed and today, besides first generation technologies, second generation technologies are already in use. The various biofuel production technologies available are thus contributing to the solving of economic and ecological problems. Croatia has 2 955 728 ha of agricultural land (of which 2 149 080 ha are arable) and 2 608 358 ha of forests. As 4 500 000 people live in Croatia, there are 0.48 ha of arable land per inhabitant. Thus, Croatia has on average more arable land than Europe (0.38 ha/capita), and much more than Africa (0.27 ha/capita) and Asia (0.14 ha/capita). Considering the 30% of total available biomass in agriculture (cutting and harvest residues of various crops), and the 40% of annual cut with biomass residue in forestry, by using the second generation technology it is possible to obtain 1 028 992 t/year of biofuels in oil equivalents. To this should be added 244 538 t/year of oil equivalents in biogas production from organic residues in animal production. Thus, Croatia is currently capable of producing 1 273 530 t/year of biofuels in oil equivalents (and potentially even more), without reallocation of arable land used for food production. Croatia, however, currently consumes 1 809 300 t/year of diesel fuel and petrol in transport. As, pursuant to the EU directive, 5.75% or 104 035 t/year of biofuel should be used by the year 2010 and 10% or 180 930 t/year by 2020, Croatia current potentials of biofuel production surpass the amounts that should be used in transport'instead of fossil fuels.

AB  - Background: Biodiesel is considered to be a promising future substitute for fossil fuels, and microalgae are one source of biodiesel. The ratios of lipid, carbohydrates and proteins are different in different microalgal species, and finding a good strain for oil production remains a difficult prospect. Strains producing valuable co-products would improve the viability of biofuel production. Results: In this study, we performed sequence analysis of the 18S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of an algal strain designated HSO-3-1, and found that it was closely related to the Mychonastes afer strain CCAP 260/6. Morphology and cellular structure observation also supported the identification of strain HSO-3-1 as M. afer. We also investigated the effects of nitrogen on the growth and lipid accumulation of the naturally occurring M. afer HSO-3-1, and its potential for biodiesel production. In total, 17 fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were identified in M. afer HSO-3-1, using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The total lipid content of M. afer HSO-3-1 was 53.9% of the dry cell weight, and we also detected nervonic acid (C24:1), which has biomedical applications, making up 3.8% of total fatty acids. The highest biomass and lipid yields achieved were 3.29 g/l and 1.62 g/l, respectively, under optimized conditions. Conclusion: The presence of octadecenoic and hexadecanoic acids as major components, with the presence of a high-value component, nervonic acid, renders M. afer HSO-3-1 biomass an economic feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2011 Yuan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Crude tall oil (CTO) soap, purified and neutralised CTO, and neutralised distilled tall oil (DTO) were pyrolysed (at 750°C for 20 s) by pyrolysis gas chromatography with mass-selective and flame ionisation detection (Py-GC/MSD and FID) to clarify their thermochemical behaviour. In each case, the pyrolysates were characteristically dependent on the feedstock, and a wide range of volatile aliphatic and aromatic compounds with some chemically bound oxygen formed. The CTO soap pyrolysate was typically composed of initial extractives-type compounds together with a significant amount of unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons and aromatics, whereas the DTO pyrolysate contained mostly just unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons and aromatics. These data are of importance when considering the suitability of various extractives-derived resources for producing bioliquids and chemicals.

AB  - Ethanol is currently an important source of renewable combustible for the automotive sector. It is known that traditional fuels such as gasoline have not caused corrosion problems due mainly to low miscibility with water. On the other hand, the alcohol based biofuels can contain a considerable amount of water, and in addition, partial oxidation of their components might be produced by exposition to the atmosphere, and this may lead to corrosion and subsequent failure of any metallic component in contact with the ethanol-gasoline blends. In consequence, all the industrial sectors related to this fuel, producing companies, logistics, dispensers and manufacturers of vehicles might be affected by this problem. This makes this topic very interesting, both from a scientific and an industrial point of view. This paper systematically reviews all aspects related to the corrosive behaviour of ethanol and ethanol-gasoline blends, with the aim of assessing the current state-of the-art as well as serving as a guide for further works that take the study of this subject matter.

AB  - Microbially produced fatty acids are potential precursors to high-energy-density biofuels, including alkanes and alkyl ethyl esters, by either catalytic conversion of free fatty acids (FFAs) or enzymatic conversion of acyl-acyl carrier protein or acyl-coenzyme A intermediates. Metabolic engineering efforts aimed at overproducing FFAs in Escherichia coli have achieved less than 30% of the maximum theoretical yield on the supplied carbon source. In this work, the viability, morphology, transcript levels, and protein levels of a strain of E. coli that overproduces medium-chain-length FFAs was compared to an engineered control strain. By early stationary phase, an 85% reduction in viable cell counts and exacerbated loss of inner membrane integrity were observed in the FFA-overproducing strain. These effects were enhanced in strains endogenously producing FFAs compared to strains exposed to exogenously fed FFAs. Under two sets of cultivation conditions, long-chain unsaturated fatty acid content greatly increased, and the expression of genes and proteins required for unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis were significantly decreased. Membrane stresses were further implicated by increased expression of genes and proteins of the phage shock response, the MarA/Rob/SoxS regulon, and the nuo and cyo operons of aerobic respiration. Gene deletion studies confirmed the importance of the phage shock proteins and Rob for maintaining cell viability; however, little to no change in FFA titer was observed after 24 h of cultivation. The results of this study serve as a baseline for future targeted attempts to improve FFA yields and titers in E. coli. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Oil production from Jatropha curcas L. seeds generates large amounts of Jatropha press cake (JPC) which can be utilized as a substrate for biogas production. The objective of this work was to investigate anaerobic mono-digestion of JPC and the effects of an iron additive (IA) on gas quality and process stability during the increase of the organic loading rate (OLR). With the increase of the OLR from 1.3 to 3.2 gVS L -1 day -1, the biogas yield in the reference reactor (RR) without IA decreased from 512 to 194 LN kgVS -1 and the CH4 concentration decreased from 69.3 to 44.4%. In the iron additive reactor (IAR), the biogas yield decreased from 530 to 462 LN kgVS -1 and the CH4 concentration decreased from 69.4 to 61.1%. The H2S concentration in the biogas was reduced by addition of the IA to values below 258 ppm in the IAR while H2S concentration in the RR increased and exceeded the detection limit of 5000 ppm. The acid capacity (AC) in the RR increased to more than 20 g L -1, indicating an accumulation of organic acids caused by process instability. AC values in the IAR remained stable at values below 5 g L -1. The results demonstrate that JPC can be used as sole substrate for anaerobic digestion up to an OLR of 2.4 gVS l -1 day -1. The addition of IA has effectively decreased the H2S content in the biogas and has improved the stability of the anaerobic process and the biogas quality. © 2011 International Solid Waste Association.

AB  - Conpared with the spark-ignition gasoline engine, the compression-ignition diesel engine has reduced fuel consumption due to its higher thermal efficiency. In addition, this reduction in the fuel consumption also leads to a reduction in CO 2 emission. Diesel engines do not require spark-ignition systems, which makes them less technically complex. Thus, diesel engines are very suitable target engines for using biofuels with high cetane numbers. In this study, the spray characteristics of biofuels such as vegetable jatropha oil and soybean oil were analyzed and compared with those of diesel oil. The injection pressures and blend ratios of jatropha oil and diesel oil (BD3, BD5, and BD20) were used as the main parameters. The injection pressures were set to 500, 1000, 1500, and 1600 bar. The injection duration was set to 500μs. Consequently, it was found that there is no significant difference in the characteristics of the spray behavior (spray angle) in response to changes in the blend ratio of the biodiesel or changes in the injection pressure. However, at higher injection pressures, the spray angle decreased slightly. © 2011 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - A method based on the combination of solid-phase extraction (SPE) with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for detailed chemical fingerprinting of biodiesel/petrodiesel blends was developed in the present study. Forensic identification, commonly referred to as chemical fingerprinting, is based on the relative distributions of individual aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, fatty acid alkyl esters, and free sterols. Fractionation of fuel samples is optimized for the separation of fatty acid esters and free sterols from petroleum hydrocarbons into four fractions: aliphatic, aromatic, fatty acid ester, and polar components. The final recoveries of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons were determined to be in the range of 65-103%, 73-105% for FAMEs, and 78-103% for free sterols in the polar fraction. Excellent separation with negligible crossover of components with different polarities between fractions was observed. Quantitative analysis of blend levels and individual chemical distribution were achieved. The method has great potential for the identification of biodiesel in diesel fuel blends and could form the basis of a method for characterization of biodiesel-contaminated environmental samples.

AB  - Considering that Brazil has a wide range of raw materials for biodiesel production, and also the possibility of small scale production, there is a demand for economic methodology studies with easy implementation. The objective of this research was to demonstrate a methodology and its application to assess the costs within the production process and the biodiesel use. The methodology was applied to biodiesels originated from soybean oil, sunflower oil, chicken oil and beef tallow, which assessed the fixed and variable costs for chemical conversion of oils and fats into methyl esters in an experimental production plant. Production costs for each of the four mentioned esters are peculiar due to the initial value of each oil per liter. Also the specific cost and specific fuel consumption were evaluated for each biodiesel to determine the difference with the commercial diesel oil. The case study showed advantages for diesel oil, both in cost and consumption. Comparing the biodiesels, the beef tallow showed the lowest production costs and lower consumption.

AB  - Recently biodiesel has been receiving increasing attention as an alternative fuel due to its environmental benefits. It is derived from renewable sources which are considered as strategic opportunities to favor environmental sustainability, to improve the population's quality of life and to promote the development of more efficient and equitable economic systems. Besides technical aspects, economics feasibility is also of great importance to access the biodiesel production viability. This paper traces the development of a software tool capable of performing economic analysis of different biodiesel plants considering the contemporary industry practices. The economic indexes considered during the analysis are the net present value (NVP), the Benefit-Costs Ratio (BCR), the Capital Return Time (CRT) and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR). Fixed capital costs, operating costs, depreciation, and auxiliary costs are also taken into account for the economic calculations. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper analyzes the characteristics of ethanol demand in the context of fuel mix diversification in Brazil. Currently, ethanol is the most important gasoline additive and alternative fuel consumed in Brazil and is responsible there for profound changes in the dynamics of fuel consumption. The diffusion of flex-fuel vehicles in Brazil symbolizes a new stage of ethanol expansion and is a central component of the increasing demand for fuel. Accordingly, we evaluate ethanol demand in Brazil following the introduction of flex-fuel vehicles using a cointegration approach and autoregressive distributed lag bounds tests over the period 2003-2010. The evidences confirm that during the last decade, ethanol has strengthened its position as both an independent fuel and a substitute for gasoline. There is also evidence that growth in the Brazilian automobile fleet based on flex-fuel technology is a major driving factor of long-run ethanol demand. Further, the dynamics of gasohol (mandatory blend of gasoline and ethanol) and ethanol prices operate in a symmetric manner over ethanol demand, thereby evidencing the increasing substitutability between these alternative fuels. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The designation of biodiesel as a green fuel has increased its commercialization and use, making its fate in the environment a matter of concern. Fuel spills constitute a major source of aquatic pollution and, like diesel spills, biodiesel can produce adverse effects on aquatic environments, animals and humans. The present study assessed cytotoxic effects of water systems contaminated with neat biodiesel and its diesel blends by means of different procedures on human T cell leukemia (Jurkat) and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells [detection of changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ m) using tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE), apoptosis recognition by Annexin V and impedance real-time cell analyzer (xCELLigence TM system)]. The data obtained showed concordance across the different bioassays, with cytotoxic effects observed as a dose-dependent response only for waters contaminated with pure diesel (D100) and B5 blend, which is characterized by a mixture of 95% diesel and 5% biodiesel. The data can also lead us to hypothesize that diesel accounts for the harmful effects observed, and that biodiesel does not worsen the impacts caused by diesel pollution. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Biocides are added to biodiesels to inhibit and remove microbial growth. The effects of 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (CMIT), a candidate biodiesel biocide, were studied using freshly isolated rat alveolar macrophages (AM) and NR8383 cell line. CMIT markedly inhibited phagocytic oxidative burst as measured by zymosan-induced chemiluminescence, and cellular cytokine secretion as measured by zymosan-induced TNF-α secretion. The 50% inhibition concentration (LC 50) for CMIT was 0.002-0.004 mM for both cellular functions. AM exposed to CMIT for as little as 2 min showed markedly inhibited functions that persisted for at least 5 h. Sodium metabisulfite was able to partially neutralize the inhibitory activity of CMIT. Cysteine and glutathione, when present at a molar ratio of 2-1 or higher against CMIT, were effective neutralizers, while serine, histidine, alanine, and albumin were without effect. When the AM testing system was used to compare the toxicity of CMIT against three other candidate biodiesel biocides, methylene dithiocyanate (MDC) was found to be of comparable toxicity to CMIT, 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (MIT) was much less toxic, and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) was non-toxic. Because AM is among the first cell-type exposed to inhaled biodiesel aerosols, the result suggested that CMIT present in biodiesel may produce respiratory effects, and further investigations including animal studies are warranted. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This study presents lipids from Oscillatoria annae BDU6, a freshwater cyanobacterium, to generate biodiesel. Efficient oil extraction from O. annae was achieved by ultrasonication in combination with organic solvents (50.9%) than homogenization (40.4%). Efficient conversion of triglycerides of O. annae into biodiesel was obtained by alkali mediated transesterification (86% w/v) when compared with lipase-mediated transesterification (76.5% w/v). RSM and CCRD were employed to optimize the growth medium to improve biomass of O. annae, which resulted in 3.2-fold increase in biomass yield (5.3 g -l dry wt/g of inoculum) compared to initial level (1.6 g -l dry wt/g of inoculum).

AB  - The objective of this paper is to reveal to what degree biobased jet fuels (biojet) can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the U.S. aviation sector. A model of the supply and demand chain of biojet involving farmers, biorefineries, airlines, and policymakers is developed by considering factors that drive the decisions of actors (i.e., decision-makers and stakeholders) in the life cycle stages. Two kinds of feedstock are considered: oil-producing feedstock (i.e., camelina and algae) and lignocellulosic biomass (i.e., corn stover, switchgrass, and short rotation woody crops). By factoring in farmer/feedstock producer and biorefinery profitability requirements and risk attitudes, land availability and suitability, as well as a time delay and technological learning factor, a more realistic estimate of the level of biojet supply and emissions reduction can be developed under different oil price assumptions. Factors that drive biojet GHG emissions and unit production costs from each feedstock are identified and quantified. Overall, this study finds that at likely adoption rates biojet alone would not be sufficient to achieve the aviation emissions reduction target. In 2050, under high oil price scenario assumption, GHG emissions can be reduced to a level ranging from 55 to 92%, with a median value of 74%, compared to the 2005 baseline level. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The dilution of biogenic fuels into lubricating engine oils often leads to a shortening of the recommended oil drains (between 30% and 60%) and an increase in wear. The large number of overlapping and influencing factors, of which dilution and polymerization of fuel components in the engine oil are emphasised, makes it difficult to find a uniform solution to prevent failures in the various applications. Insofar single solutions for the different types of biofuels are needed. The contribution of base oil chemistry and additives as well as triboactive materials is featured to deal with the adverse effects of biofuels. In the frame of the European Commission (EC)-funded project 'cleanengine', tentative engine oils based on esters with a content of renewables and polyglycols are formulated to increase the lubricant's tolerance in engines fuelled with biofuel-based blends, with the aim of ensuring required lubricating and wear protection performance while keeping oil drain intervals unchanged. The present paper focuses on four-stroke diesel applications, fuelled by biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester â FAME) as well as by rapeseed oil and Jatropha oil (pure vegetable oils, triglycerides), together with relevant blends of those biofuels and conventional diesel fuel. This paper screens the functional profile (in particular rheological, toxicological, bio-compatibility, tribological and biofuels affinity) of lube families with respect to biofuel contamination. Moreover, this is followed by the contributions of piston ring and liner materials as well as thin film coatings. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Facing global climate change and scarce petroleum supplies, the world must switch to sustainable energy systems. While historical transitions between major energy sources have occurred, most of these shifts lasted over a century or longer and were stimulated by resource scarcity, high labor costs, and technological innovations. The energy transition of the 21st century will need to be more rapid. Unfortunately, little is known about how to accelerate energy transitions. This article reviews past transitions and factors behind them, along with their time frames. Three modern case studies are discussed: Brazil, which shifted from an oil-based transportation system to one based on sugarcane-ethanol (success); France, which shifted from oil-fired electric power to nuclear power (success); and the United States, which attempted to shift from foreign oil to a mix of domestic energy resources (failure). Lessons from these attempts to govern energy transitions are discussed. Several policy instruments to accelerate a transition are identified, though even under ideal circumstances a global energy supply transition will be very slow. Given the need to simultaneously implement programs in countries with different political economies, a greater focus on energy efficiency, promotion of Smart Grids, and possibly a new treaty should yield more timely results. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Renewable biomass is considered as an important energy resource all over the world and for an agriculture based economy like that of India, the future prospects of being able to convert widely available biomass materials into various forms of fuel is most attractive. In this study, pyrolysis of groundnut de-oiled cake was investigated with an aim of studying the physical and chemical characteristics of the bio-fuel produced and to determine its feasibility as a commercial fuel. Thermal pyrolysis of groundnut de-oiled cake was done in a semi-batch reactor at a temperature range of 200-500 °C and at a heating rate of 20 °C/min. The chemical analysis of the bio-fuel showed the presence of functional groups such as alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amines, nitriles, nitro compounds and aromatics rings. The physical properties of the bio-fuel obtained were close to that of diesel and petrol. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Culturing microalgae using natural sunlight is an effective way to reduce the cost of microalgae-based biodiesel production. In order to evaluate the feasibility of culturing Chlorella zofingiensis outdoors for biodiesel production, effects of nitrogen limitation and initial cell concentration on growth and lipid accumulation of this alga were investigated in 60L flat plate photobioreactors outdoors. The highest μ max and biomass productivity obtained was 0.994day -1 and 58.4mgL -1day -1, respectively. The lipid content was much higher (54.5% of dry weight) under nitrogen limiting condition than under nitrogen sufficient condition (27.3%). With the increasing initial cell concentrations, the lipid contents declined, while lipid concentrations and productivities increased. The highest lipid content, lipid concentration, and lipid productivity obtained was 54.5%, 536mgL -1 and 22.3mgL -1day -1, respectively. This study demonstrated that it was possible to culture C. zofingiensis under outdoor conditions for producing biodiesel feedstock. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel production from palm oil with supercritical methanol (SCM) and supercritical ethanol (SCE) at 400 °C and 15. MPa were evaluated. At the optimal alcohol to oil molar ratios of 12:1 and 18:1 for the SCM and SCE processes, respectively, the biofuel samples were synthesized in a 1.2-L reactor and the resulting biofuel was analyzed for the key properties including those for the diesel and biodiesel standard specifications. Biofuel samples derived from both the SCM and SCE processes could be used as an alternative fuel after slight improvement in their acid value and free glycerol content. The remarkable advantages of this novel process were: the additional fuel yield of approximately of 5% and 10% for SCM and SCE, respectively; the lower energy consumption for alcohol preheating, pumping and recovering than the biodiesel production with supercritical alcohols that use a high alcohol to oil molar ratio of 42:1. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aims: The feasibility of the continuous production of a valuable bioplastic raw material, namely 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) from biodiesel by-product glycerol, using immobilized cells was investigated. In addition, the effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) was also analysed. Methods and Results: Ceramic balls and ceramic rings were used for the immobilization of a locally isolated strain; Klebsiella pneumoniae (GenBank no. 27F HM063413). HRT of 1h is the best one in terms of volumetric production rate (g 1,3-PDO l -1h -1). The results indicated that ceramic-based cell immobilization achieved a 2-fold higher production rate (10g 1,3-PDO l -1h -1) in comparison with suspended cell system (4·9g 1,3-PDO l -1h -1). Conclusions: Continuous cultures with immobilized cells revealed that 1,3-PDO production was more effective and more stable than suspended culture systems. Furthermore, cell immobilization had also obvious benefits especially for resistance of the production for extreme conditions (high organic loading rates, cell washouts). The results were important for understanding the significance of continuous immobilization process among other well-known 1,3-PDO fermentation processes. Significance and Impact of the Study: This work is a promising process for further studies, as the immobilized micro-organism was able to reach high volumetric production rates at short HRT, it has an important role in tolerating and converting glycerol during fermentation. Therefore, HRT is a very significant operational parameter (P value &lt;0·05) directly affecting the bioreactor performance and production rate. © 2011 The Authors. © 2011 The Society for Applied Microbiology.

AB  - Background: Microalgae have recently been considered a potential feedstock for biodiesel production, since they do not compete with agricultural lunlike oil crops. However, the production processes must be energetically and economically viable. Therefore, an in situ methanolysis process is proposed for biodiesel production directly from microalgae biomass, to avoid the need for the separation and extraction steps. Results: Biodiesel was obtained using methanol as the methylation reactant for the transesterification reaction and hydrochloric acid as the catalyst precursor, at 80 °C for 2 h of reaction. A mass return of 23.07 ± 2.76% (m/m) was obtained. Spectrometry in the infrared region showed that the product had equivalent bands of axial deformation of C=O, C-O and C-H, i.e. an ester. Tests showed the chromatographic profile of fatty acids in the sample. A process energetic efficiency value of 1.17 was obtained for microalgae derived biodiesel, which is higher than from soybean and sunflower, reportedly 1.06 and 1.12. Conclusions: Industrial sustainability results from low energetic, economic and environmental losses. The microalgae in situ methanolysis process showed greater fuel available energy than energy consumption, therefore is energetically sustainable. Economic and environmental issues should still be addressed. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - In this research the production of hydrogen by Klebsiella pneumoniae BLb01 using residual glycerol discharged from a biodiesel fuel production plant was investigated. Klebsiella pneumoniae BLb01 was isolated from a bacteria-rich sludge of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB) of a soybean processing plant. A PlackettBurman design (P-B) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) were employed to determine the optimal condition for enhanced hydrogen production. The maximal hydrogen production, whichwas 45.0mol%and with 98% of glycerol degradation,was achievedwith the optimized medium with the following composition: 30 g L 1 glycerol; 3 g L 1 yeast ex tract 3 g L 1 K 2HPO 4; 1 g L 1KH 2PO 4; temperature 39C and pH 9.0. These results show the ability of this new strain of effectively converting residual glycerol into value-added energy products. Copyright © Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Conventional agricultural life cycle assessments (LCAs) measure greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for biofuel pathways as the amount of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted per unit of energy provided by the pathway (i.e. gCO 2e/MJ). This measure of GHG emissions, as computed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is then used to determine the extent to which the corresponding biofuel pathway complies with the GHG emission standards set forth by the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007. Under current legislation, ethanol produced from corn grain is prohibited from qualifying as an advanced biofuel, even if it were to meet the GHG emission standards. This paper proposes a measure of GHG emissions based on a unit of land rather than the energy provided by a biofuel pathway utilizing only one feedstock. A hectare of corn thus provides two feedstocks for the biofuel pathway considered here; corn grain is used for production of ethanol while corn stover is subjected to fast pyrolysis for production of biochar and bio-oil. The bio-oil is then subsequently upgraded to a fuel suitable for use as a drop in fuel in internal combustion engines. A LCA of this pathway is conducted and it is found that such a pathway generates a 52.1% reduction in GHG emissions. This is a reduction that is sufficient to qualify the combined output of a hectare of corn as an advanced biofuel if the current restriction in EISA were removed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A set of 16 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) associated with particulate matter (PM), emitted by a diesel engine fueled with petroleum diesel and a 15%-vol. palm oil methyl ester blend with diesel (B15), were determined. PM was filtered from a sample of the exhaust gas with the engine running at a steady speed and under no load. PAH were extracted from the filters using the Soxhlet technique, with dichloromethane as solvent. The extracts were then analyzed by gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector (FID). No significant difference was found between PM mass collected when fueled with diesel and B15. Ten of the 16 PAH concentrations were not reduced by adding biodiesel: Benz(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, chrysene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene, fluoranthene, fluorene, indeno(1,2,3-c,d)pyrene, naphthalene and phenanthrene. The acenaphthene, acenaphthylene and anthracene concentrations were 45%-80% higher when using diesel, whereas those for benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(g,h,i)perylene and pyrene were 30%-72% higher when using the B15 blend. Even though the 16 priority-PAH cumulative concentration increased when using the B15 blend, the total toxic equivalent (TEQ) concentration was not different for both fuels. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lithium impregnated calcium oxide has been prepared by wet impregnation method in nano particle form as supported by powder X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Basic strength of the same was measured by Hammett indicators. Calcium oxide impregnated with 1.75 wt% of lithium was used as solid catalyst for the transesterification karanja and jatropha oil, containing 3.4 and 8.3 wt% of free fatty acids, respectively. The reaction parameters, viz., reaction temperature, alcohol to oil molar ratio, free fatty acid contents, amount of catalyst and amount of impregnated lithium ion in calcium oxide support, have been studied to establish the most suitable condition for the transesterification reaction. The complete transesterification of karanja and jatropha oils was achieved in 1 and 2. h, respectively, at 65 °C, utilizing 12:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil and 5 wt% (catalyst/oil, w/w) of catalyst. Few physicochemical properties of the prepared biodiesel samples have been studied and compared with standard values. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The petroleum fraction known as middle distillate that is used for transportation purposes consists of diesel, jet fuels. Many agricultural-based oils have been considered and used in petroleum fuel blends or as petroleum replacements. Soybean-derived biofuels have proven to be an excellent substitute for petroleum diesel fuel applications, such as cars, trucks, trains, and ships. However, biofuel replacements have not been studied for long-term storage tank stability. This type of storage stability would involve mixtures with not only biofuel but also water and air. The tank contents would be in constant contact with water bottoms and air because of draw down and refilling of partially empty storage tanks. The results of this study are important because the Department of Defense will be purchasing diesel fuel that contains up to 5% biodiesel. This article examines the storage tank stability, by ASTM method D-5304, of soy-derived biodiesel petroleum blended fuel in an environment of air and dissolved water. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The use of modern biofuels in mobile applications has an enormous potential to reduce greenhouse gases as well as engine pollutant emissions, such as soot or nitrogen oxides. This beneficial effect is directly related to the molecular structure of the biofuel as a product of an optimized production process. To understand the influence and emission reduction potential of the large variety of different fuel properties, this study aims to identify desirable fuel characteristics and define optimized biofuel components. In a first step, a literature survey is carried out, focusing on the impact of the cetane number, boiling characteristics, and aromatic and oxygen contents on the diesel combustion process. The incorporated investigations that analyze the combustion behavior, engine efficiency, and emission performance underline the potential of tailoring fuels to desired properties. From this foundation, a model-based analysis of desired fuel properties was conducted, using a large database with 32 different fuels (single molecules and fuel mixtures). With multiple correlation methods, different fuel properties can be used to predict the emission performance of the engine. The following fuel optimization based on emission performance and engine efficiency results in ideal fuel properties for diesel engine combustion. As it turns out, a blend of 2-methyltetrahydrofurane (2-MTHF) (which can be derived from cellulose) blended with di-n-butylether complies with the desired fuel properties, which were defined before. In combination with an improved homogeneous low-temperature combustion process and an increased ignition delay, a nearly soot-free diesel combustion over a wide load range is realized. The oxygenated fuel enables increased exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rates while maintaining the high engine efficiency of the diesel process. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The production of biodiesel using waste triglycerides as feedstock offers economic advantages over its production from edible oils. However, because of its high acidity and chemical complexity, many problems arise in the production of biodiesel. To facilitate the use of waste oils as a feedstock of biofuels, there is an alternative method to obtain pyrolytic oil by thermal-chemical conversion. In this paper, we discuss our observations on the production of biofuels by a pyrolysis reaction from high-acid-value waste oil. It was found that the pyrolytic products consisted of hydrocarbon compounds accompanied by undesired products, such as carboxylic acids. These pyrolytic oils were further reacted with an alcohol to decrease their acid value. The results showed that the acid number of the pyrolytic oil decreased dramatically from 28.8 to 2.0 mg of KOH/g after esterification. The results of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analyses indicated that the pyrolysis of waste oil generates fuels that have chemical compositions comparable to that of petroleum-based fuel. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) for use as biodiesel (BD) was produced by enzymatic transesterification of salmon skin oil (SSO), a commercial oil-fat blend of yellow grease and rendered animal fat (referred to as Rothsay composite, RC), and olive oil (OO) with Lipozyme-IM® as catalyst. The effects of temperature (25-65 °C), oil: alcohol molar ratio (1:1-1:6), alcohol type (ethanol or methanol), and reaction time (8-120 h) on the yield of FAEE were assessed. The reaction products as well as residuals were identified and quantified using an HPLC unit equipped with a size exclusion column and refractive index (RI) detector. The statistical procedures of General Linear Model (PROC GLM) and PROC MIXED of SAS® were both used to analyze the data and to develop a prediction model that provides a good description of the effects of the reaction parameters on FAEE yield. The conversion rate of the oils to FAEE was generally moderate (∼50%) at the temperatures, oil: alcohol molar ratios and reaction times studied, with ethanol as co-substrate. At 45 °C and at an oil: alcohol molar ratio of 1:1, increasing reaction time from 12 to 24 h increased FAEE yield by ∼21%; while at oil: alcohol molar ratios 1:3 and 1:4, FAEE yield increased by 16% and 14% (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. Triacylglycerol (TAG) content generally decreased with increasing FAEE yield during the course of the reaction. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The characteristics of particulate mater size distribution in the exhaust gas of an automotive diesel engine have been studied for a biodiesel blend of 30% rapeseed methyl ester (RME) and 70% ultra low sulphur diesel (ULSD) by volume (B30). The engine, a twin-turbo charged V6 equipped with a common rail fuel injection system, was operated on 16 steady-state points extracted from a corresponding New European Driving Cycle test with no engine system modification and a fast differential mobility spectrometer was used to determine the particulate number concentration and distribution. It is shown that the number-size distribution is dependent on engine operating conditions including the rate of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Compared with ULSD, B30 leads to a 41% smaller average size of the particles with EGR but gives rise to a higher number concentration under certain engine operating conditions, with the differences varying between nucleation and accumulation mode. The calculated particle total mass for B30 combustion aerosol is lower than the value with ULSD for all the engine operating conditions tested. The average B30 aerosol was 28% smaller in size on mass basis, compared to ULSD aerosol. For both fuels, the relationship between the particle total number and total mass has been found to be directly correlated and both the number and the mass of particles increase when the mean diameters of particles increase. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nowadays, natural-based oxygenated fuels, especially biodiesel and ethanol, have been considered as substitutes for fossil fuels. Because of relatively lower energy content of oxygenated fuels, it is necessary to blend them with fossil ones. In this research, authors conducted an investigation on some BED blends to determine and compare their effects on equivalence ratio, exhaust oxygen fraction and water and oil temperature in a diesel engine. For this purpose, 18 different blendes of ethanol and biodiesel with net diesel fuel were tested in a MT4-244 engine. 11Iran Motorsazan Co, Tabriz, Iran. considering two engine speeds in full load condition. In almost all samples the equivalence ratio decreased with increasing of biodiesel and ethanol percents. Exhaust oxygen fraction in all of samples increased with increasing of biodiesel and ethanol percents, whereas the engine water and oil temperatures slightly reduced. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the possible interference of anionic and cationic flocculants in the lipid extraction and fatty acid profiles of two species of marine microalgae: Nannochloropsis oculata and Thalassiosira weissflogii. Cells were grown in batch cultures (f/2 medium, salinity of 28, temperature of 20 °C, light intensity of 40 μmol photons m-2 s-1 and 12/12 h L/D photoperiod) and concentrated using sodium hydroxide (control), sodium hydroxide and the anionic polyacrylamide flocculant Magnafloc® LT-25 (APF treatment) and sodium hydroxide plus the cationic polyacrylamide flocculant Flopam® (CPF treatment). There were no statistically significant differences among treatments with respect to lipid extraction for both species. However, N. oculata which presented higher percentages of C16:0, C16:1 and C20:5 fatty acids showed an increase of C14:0 and a decrease of C20:5 with the use of anionic flocculant. Additionally, T. weissflogii which had high percentages of C16:0, C16:1, C16:3 and C20:5, showed a decrease of C18:0 and C18:1n9c when both flocculants were used and a small decrease of C16:0 in the APF treatment. The results indicate that the choice of flocculant should be based on the level of saturation desirable, i.e., if the goal is to produce more stable biodiesel, with low percentage unsaturated fatty acids, then anionic flocculants should be used. On the other hand, if the aim is to produce unsaturated fatty acids for commercial uses in the pharmacy or food industries, then anionic polymers should be avoided. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Rising petroleum costs, trade imbalances and environmental concerns have stimulated efforts to advance the microbial production of fuels from lignocellulosic biomass. Here we identify a novel biosynthetic alternative to D2 diesel fuel, bisabolane, and engineer microbial platforms for the production of its immediate precursor, bisabolene. First, we identify bisabolane as an alternative to D2 diesel by measuring the fuel properties of chemically hydrogenated commercial bisabolene. Then, via a combination of enzyme screening and metabolic engineering, we obtain a more than tenfold increase in bisabolene titers in Escherichia coli to &gt;900 mgl-1. We produce bisabolene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (&gt;900 mgl-1), a widely used platform for the production of ethanol. Finally, we chemically hydrogenate biosynthetic bisabolene into bisabolane. This work presents a framework for the identification of novel terpene-based advanced biofuels and the rapid engineering of microbial farnesyl diphosphate-overproducing platforms for the production of biofuels. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Energy contents of vegetable oils are close to petroleum based oils, which make them renewable energy sources. It is under investigation to use various vegetable oils in diesel engines as alternative fuels. Owing to high viscosity and density, perfect atomization can't be attained and injection problems appear which lead to performance drops in the engine. In this study, biodiesel was obtained from cottonseed oil and its viscosity was lowered. Biodiesel with a viscosity close to diesel fuel was mixed with 25% by volume into the diesel fuel, called here as B25 fuel, and tested at a single-cylinder, air-cooled direct injection diesel engine to assess the performance at various speeds and engine powers. It was observed that torque output of the blend is 2% and power output is 1 % lower than diesel fuel, but specific fuel consumption is 1 % higher, and exhaust emissions lower than diesel fuel. The reduction in exhaust emissions have made the biodiesel a suitable alternative fuel for diesel engines and could contribute in controlling air pollution. © Sila Science.

AB  - Manketti oil that was used as a feedstock to produce the biodiesel was extracted from manketti nut. An alkali catalyst transesterfication process was adopted. A statistical model was developed to correlate the transesterification process variables to the yield of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) using a central composite design (CCD) by a response surface methodology. The transesterification process variables were reaction temperature x1, (30°C-65°C), amount of catalyst x2, (0.5-1.5 wt%), amount of methanol in the oil x3, (10-50 wt%), and reaction time (30-90 min). The essential fuel properties such as density, flash point, viscosity, and acid number were measured and compared with other types of biodiesel produced from wild nuts and American Society for Testing and Material (ASTM) standards for biodiesel. From the results, the optimum conditions for the production of FAME obtained were as follows: reaction temperature 55C, reaction time 53 min, amount of catalyst 1.02 wt%, and amount of methanol in the oil of 32 wt%. The optimum yield of FAME that can be produced was 98.3%. The results show that the important fuel properties of the biodiesel produced in optimum conditions met the biodiesel ASTM standard. © 2011 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Vegetable oils are being considered as a renewable energy alternative for diesel. The high viscosity of vegetable oils causes injector fouling and durability problems in compression-ignition engines. Microemulsification can be used to reduce vegetable oil viscosity without complex chemical transformation processes. The goal of our work is to formulate reverse micellar microemulsions of vegetable oils and No. 2 diesel fuel blended with ethanol using different combinations of surfactants and co-surfactants. Ethanol, also a renewable fuel, was used as a viscosity modifier. We studied three vegetable oils (canola, palm, and algae oils) to blend with diesel fuel. The microemulsion fuels were tested for temperature stability, viscosity, water tolerance, and their combustion performance in terms of flame radiation and pollutant (CO, NOx) emissions. With appropriate surfactant and co-surfactant systems, we successfully formulated canola and algae/diesel microemulsions with cloud points and points that satisfy the ASTM standards. Among all formulations, palm/diesel microemulsion fuels solidified at 6-6.5°C due to high saturated triglyceride content. While the formulated microemulsion fuels had approximately 10% lower heating value than diesel fuel, their CO emission and flame radiation were superior to those of diesel fuel. NOx emissions were also lower with the blends containing no nitrate additives, but were higher than with diesel fuel in the presence of nitrate additives. Thus, these results show that microemulsification can produce biofuels with desirable viscosity, fuel properties can be adjusted via formulation variables, and microemulsions can replace chemical processes for producing biofuels. © 2011 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this study, a strategy to reduce enzyme dosage is evaluated by applying two post-treatments, oxygen delignification and mechanical refining. The sugar conversion for GL12 substrates was increased from 51.5% to 77.9% with post-treatments at the enzyme dosage of 10 FPU. When the amount of enzyme was reduced to 5 FPU with post-treatments, the conversion of 71.8% was obtained, which was significant higher than the conversion without any post-treatment using 10 FPU (51.5%). This clearly demonstrates the benefit of post-treatments that allows more than 50% of enzyme reduction at the same level of enzymatic conversion. Enzyme-accessible surface area and pore volume were evaluated by Simons' staining and DSC thermoporometry methods, and strong correlations were found with the sugar conversion. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - India has set a GDP growth target of 8-9% in order to transform itself from a developing into a developed world. This level of growth will most likely lead to an increased demand on crude oil imports. It is expected that India will need to increase its imports from 80% to around 90% by 2020 to meet its targeted growth objectives. High crude oil imports make Indian economy vulnerable to volatility in crude oil prices. Another key concern associated with increased crude oil demand is the increase in the green house gases (GHGs) emissions and its negative impact on the climate. At the Copenhagen Summit, participating nations have failed to reach a legally binding agreement. However, India has declared that even with its social and economic development it will not allow per capita GHGs emissions to be more than that of the developed countries (most probably Annex I non-economies in transition countries representing industrialized nations). Jatropha biodiesel is an alternative fuel that can be a potential source of energy for rural and remote areas in India. It can also be viable replacement for diesel, the largest consumed fossil fuel in India. India's National Biofuel Policy targets 20% blending of Jatropha based biodiesel with fossil-fuel based diesel by 2017. There are other significant benefits of Jatropha afforestation apart from the reduction of GHGs such as employment generation, waste land reclamation and additional earnings under clean development mechanism (CDM). Major constraints in meeting National Biofuel Policy targets are land availability without threatening food security and its cost competitiveness as compared to the fossil fuels. The objective of this study is to draw attention on the possible use of Jatropha biodiesel for attaining a sustainable energy regime in post Copenhagen Summit scenario.

AB  - Syngas production based on biomass gasification is an attractive, feasible alternative to fossil fuel feedstock for the production of transportation fuels. However, the product gas from biomass gasification must be cleaned and tailored to comply with strict syngas quality requirements, as it consists of a wide variety of major and minor components and impurities. The characterization of such species is important to determine downstream gas treatment steps, and to assess the efficiency of the gasification process.This paper gives an overview of the results obtained during experiments on steam-oxygen gasification of biomass using 100. kW maximal thermal input circulating fluidized bed gasifier (CFBG) that have been performed at Delft University of Technology during the CHRISGAS project. The unit is also equipped with a high-temperature ceramic gas filter and downstream reactors for upgrading of the gas.In the experiments biomass types of both woody and agricultural origin have been used. They were represented by clean wood, demolition wood, an energy crop species (miscanthus) and a true residue (Dutch straw), respectively. Moreover, different bed materials have been applied, namely quartz sand, treated and untreated olivine and magnesite. During the experiments extensive measurements of gas composition have been carried out throughout the integrated test rig. The gas characterization included major gas components as well as certain minor species and tar.The results show that with the use of magnesite as bed material, remarkable increases of hydrogen yield were attained, as compared to sand or olivine; up to a volume fraction of almost 40% (dry, nitrogen-free basis). Also the H2:CO ratio increased from values near or lower than 1 to 2.3-2.6. This is near the values needed, for e.g., Fischer-Tropsch diesel production, indicating a potential for simplification of the gas upgrading. Furthermore, by using magnesite tar content of the raw gas was reduced to values near 2gm-3 (STP). Moreover, magnesite complied with the expectation to have a positive impact on agglomeration prevention for the agricultural fuels containing alkali and chlorine in the ash. The kind of olivine applied during the experiments did not yield the expected tar reduction; the measured tar concentration was even higher than when quartz sand was used as bed material. Finally kaolin proved to be an effective additive to counteract the agglomeration when fuels with high alkali content in the ash are gasified using bed material that is rich in silica, as it is the case with quartz sand and olivine. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lesquerella, Physaria fendleri (A. Gray) S. Watson, is a mustard native to the western United States and is currently being developed as a commercial source of valuable hydroxy fatty acids that can be used in a number of industrial applications, including biolubricants, biofuel additives, motor oils, resins, waxes, nylons, plastics, corrosion inhibitors, cosmetics, and coatings. The plant is cultivated as a winter-spring annual and in the desert southwest it harbors large populations of arthropods, several of which could be significant pests once production expands. Lygus spp. (Hemiptera: Miridae) are common in lesquerella and are known pests of a number of agronomic and horticultural crops where they feed primarily on reproductive tissues. A 4-yr replicated plot study was undertaken to evaluate the probable impact of Lygus spp. on production of this potential new crop. Plant damage and subsequent seed yield and quality were examined relative to variable and representative densities of Lygus spp. (0.34.9 insects per sweep net) resulting from variable frequency and timing of insecticide applications. Increasing damage to various fruiting structures (flowers [0.913.9%], buds [1.27.1%], and seed pods [19.442.5%]) was significantly associated with increasing pest abundance, particularly the abundance o nymphs, in all years. This damage, however, did not consistently translate into reductions in seed yield (4811,336 kg/ha), individual seed weight (0.50.7 g per 1,000 seed), or seed oil content (21.830.4%), and pest abundance generally explained relatively little of the variation in crop yield and quality. Negative effects on yield were not sensitive to the timing of pest damage (early versus late season) but were more pronounced during years when potential yields were lower due to weed competition and other agronomic factors. Results suggest that if the crop is established and managed in a more optimal fashion, Lygus spp. may not significantly limit yield. Nonetheless, additional work will be needed once more uniform cultivars become available and yield effects can be more precisely measured. Densities of Lygus spp. in unsprayed lesquerella are on par with those in other known agroecosystem level sources of this pest (e.g., forage and seed alfalfa, Medicago sativa L.). Thus, lesquerella production may introduce new challenges to pest management in crops such as cotton. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.

AB  - Our aim was to compare hazards of particles from combustion of biodiesel blends and conventional diesel (D 100) in old and improved engines. We determined DNA damage in A549 cells, mRNA levels of CCL2 and IL8 in THP-1 cells, and expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVECs). Viability and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were investigated in all cell types. We collected particles from combustion of D 100 and 20% (w/w) blends of animal fat or rapeseed oil methyl esters in light-duty vehicle engines complying with Euro2 or Euro4 standards. Particles emitted from the Euro4 engine were smaller in size and more potent than particles emitted from the Euro2 engine with respect to ROS production and DNA damage, but similarly potent concerning cytokine mRNA expression. Particles emitted from combustion of biodiesel blends were larger in size, and less or equally potent than particles emitted from combustion of D 100 concerning ROS production, DNA damage and mRNA of CCL2 and IL8. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in HUVECs was only increased by D 100 particles from the Euro4 engine. This suggests that particle emissions from biodiesel in equal mass concentration are less toxic than conventional diesel. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The search for alternative fuels to alleviate our dependency on fossil-based transport fuels is driven by depleting conventional oil resources and looming climate change induced by anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Through a lifecycle approach, we evaluate whether algal biodiesel production can be a viable fuel source once the energy and carbon intensity of the process is managed accordingly. Currently, algae biodiesel production is 2.5 times as energy intensive as conventional diesel and nearly equivalent to the high fuel-cycle energy use of oil shale diesel. Biodiesel from advanced biomass can realise its inherent environmental advantages of GHG emissions reduction once every step of the production chain is fully optimized and decarbonised. This includes smart co-product utilization, decarbonisation of the electricity and heat grids as well as indirect energy requirements for fertilizer, transport and building material. Only if all these factors are taken into account is the cost of heat and electricity reduced, and GHG emissions fully mitigated. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Cow dung (Kanda) is a major source of energy in rural and urban population of developing countries and is burnt in traditional open stoves in confined space of kitchen without proper ventilation. In epidemiological studies, biomass fuel smoke has been reported to be responsible for several respiratory disorders in exposed population. In a laboratory experiment, female wistar rats were exposed to kanda smoke for 60. min/day over a period of 12 weeks. Chemical analysis of smoke showed the presence of PAHs. The increase in CYP1A1, GST-ya, GST-yc expression was found in 12 week exposed lung tissues as compared with controls. The exposure to smoke resulted in significant alteration in the BALF cells in the form of clustering of alveolar macrophages and giant cell formation with vacuolated cytoplasm. The macrophages also showed thickness and villi like projections on the cell surface thus reducing their phagocytic activities. Histopathological changes in lung tissue were manifested in the form of damage to bronchiolar epithelium, edema and thickening of alveolar septa and emphysema after 4 and 8 week of exposure. These findings suggest that exposure to kanda smoke increases pulmonary tissue damage and may result in various forms of respiratory infections in the exposed popultion. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Microalgal lipids may be a more sustainable biodiesel feedstock than crop oils. We have investigated the potential for using the crude glycerol as a carbon substrate. In batch mode, the biomass and lipid concentration of Chlorella protothecoides cultivated in a crude glycerol medium were, respectively, 23.5 and 14.6 g/l in a 6-day cultivation. In the fed-batch mode, the biomass and lipid concentration improved to 45.2 and 24.6 g/l after 8.2 days of cultivation, respectively. The maximum lipid productivity of 3 g/l day in the fed-batch mode was higher than that produced by batch cultivation. This work demonstrates the feasibility of crude biodiesel glycerol as an alternative carbon substrate to glucose for microalgal cultivation and a cost reduction of carbon substrate feed in microalgal lipid production may be expected. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Different lipidic wastes and low-grade oils and fats have been characterized and evaluated as feedstocks for the acid-catalyzed production of FAME. The characterization of these materials has revealed significant contents of free fatty acids, Na, K, Ca, Mg, P, unsaponifiable matter and humidity. Arenesulfonic acid-functionalized SBA-15 silica catalyst has provided yields to FAME close to 80% in the simultaneous esterification-transesterification of the different feedstocks, regardless of their nature and properties, using methanol under the following reaction conditions: 160°C, 2. h, methanol to oil molar ratio of 30, 8 wt.% catalyst loading, and 2000. rpm stirring rate. Nevertheless, reutilization of the catalyst is compromised by high levels of impurities, especially because of deactivation by strong interaction of unsaponifiable matter with the catalytic sites. The conditioning of these materials by aqueous washing in the presence of cationic-exchange resin Amberlyst-15, followed by a drying step, resulted in a lower deactivation of the catalyst. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Several Latin American countries are setting up biofuel programmes to establish alternative markets for agricultural commodities. This is mainly triggered by the current success of Brazilian bioethanol production for the domestic market and for export. Furthermore, the global biofuel market is expected to increase due to ambitious biofuel programmes in the EU and in the USA. Colombia, Venezuela, Costa Rica and Guatemala are focusing on bioethanol production from sugarcane whereas biofuel production in Argentina is based on soy biodiesel. Recent developments of the biofuel sector take place extremely rapid especially in Argentina, which became one of the five largest biodiesel producers in the world in 2008. Till date no specific biofuel sustainability certification systems have been implemented in Latin American, as well as on global level. This fact and the predominant use of food crops for biofuel production raise concerns about the sustainability of biofuel production related to environmental and social aspects. This paper provides an overview of the hotspots of conflicts in biofuel production in Latin America. It investigates presently available sustainability tools and initiatives to ensure sustainable biofuel production in Latin America. Finally, it provides an outlook on how to integrate sustainability in the Latin American biofuel sector. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Endophytic fungi belonging to the genus Gliocladium are able to degrade plant cellulose and synthesize complex hydrocarbons under microaerophilic conditions. These fungi could thus be used to produce biofuels from cellulosics without the need for hydrolytic pretreatments. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase micro-extraction (GC-MS-SPME) of head space gases from Gliocladium cultures demonstrated the production of C 6-C 19 hydrocarbons including hexane, benzene, heptane, 3,4-dimethyl hexane, 1-octene, m-xylene, 3-methyl nonane, dodecane, tridecane, hexadecane and nonadecane directly from the cellulosic biomass. Hydrocarbon production was 100-fold higher in co-cultures of Gliocladium and Escherichia coli than in pure Gliocladium cultures. The dry mycelia weight is stable at stationary period in co-culture condition which may lead to synthesize more hydrocarbons. These fungi could potentially be developed into cost-effective biocatalysts for production of biofuels. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Five non-edible vegetable oils (nerium, jatropha, pongamia, mahua & neem) were selected as alternate fuels and comparison analysis of performance and emission were done. A comparative analysis was done for methyl esters of different oils in blends with diesel of different proportions. It was observed that a diesel engine runs successfully on a blend of 20% biodiesel and 80% diesel fuel without affecting engine performance. Methyl ester from Nerium oil, with properties close to diesel, showed better performance and emission characteristics, followed by esters of jatropha, Pongamia, Mahua and Neem oils. Hence Nerium blend can be used in existing diesel engines without compromising the engine performance.

AB  - The paper investigates greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land use change associated with the introduction of large-scale Jatropha curcas cultivation on Miombo Woodland, using data from extant forestry and ecology studies about this ecosystem. Its results support the notion that Jatropha can help sequester atmospheric carbon when grown on complete wastelands and in severely degraded conditions. Conversely, when introduced on tropical woodlands with substantial biomass and medium/high organic soil carbon content, Jatropha will induce significant emissions that offset any GHG savings from the rest of the biofuel production chain. A carbon debt of more than 30 years is projected. On semi-degraded Miombo the overall GHG balance of Jatropha is found to hinge a lot on the extent of carbon depletion of the soil, more than on the state of the biomass. This finding points to the urgent need for detailed measurements of soil carbon in a range of Miombo sub-regions and similar tropical dryland ecosystems in Asia and Latin America. Efforts should be made to clarify concepts such as 'degraded lands' and 'wastelands' and to refine land allocation criteria and official GHG calculation methodologies for biofuels on that basis. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Rice hull hydrolysate was used as feedstock for microbial lipids production using the oleaginous fungus Mortierella isabellina. Kinetic experiments were conducted in C/N ratios 35, 44 and 57 and the oil accumulation into fungal biomass was 36%, 51.2% and 64.3%, respectively. A detailed mathematical model was used in order to describe the lipid accumulation process. This model was able to predict reducing sugar and nitrogen consumption, fat-free biomass synthesis and lipid accumulation. Neutral lipids constitute the predominant lipid fraction, while the major fatty acids were oleic, palmitic and linoleic acid. Fatty acids of long aliphatic chain were not detected, thus the microbial oil produced is a promising feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An industrial grade acidic crude palm oil (ACPO) pre-treatment process was carried out using ethanesulfonic acid (ESA) as a catalyst in the esterification reaction. ESA was used in different dosages to reduce free fatty acid (FFA) to a minimum level for the second stage of biodiesel production via alkaline transesterification reaction. Different process operating conditions were optimized such as ESA dosage (0.25-3.5% wt/wt), methanol to ACPO molar ratio (1:1-20:1), reaction temperature (40-70°C), and reaction time (3-150. min). This study revealed the potential use of abundant quantities of ACPO from oil palm mills for biodiesel production. The lab scale results showed the effectiveness of the pre-treatment process using ESA catalyst. Three consecutive catalyst recycling runs were achieved without significant degradation in its performance. Second and third reuse runs needed more reaction time to achieve the target level of FFA content. Esterification and transesterification using ESA and KOH respectively is proposed for biodiesel industrial scale production. The produced biodiesel meets the international standards specifications for biodiesel fuel (EN 14214 and ASTM D6751). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A new fuel additive, namely solketal tert-butyl ether (STBE), was developed and optimized under continuous flow conditions using a Corning® Advanced-Flow™ glass reactor. STBE was obtained in two steps from glycerol, a renewable building-block produced in large amount in the processing of biodiesel. The advantages of the highly engineered Corning glass reactor included high mixing and heat-exchange efficiency, chemical resistance under corrosive flow conditions and a small hold-up. A robust, continuous, green and safe industrial-scale process is described. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, the upgrading reactions of high-boiling fraction (HBF) of bio-oil were carried out over a series of supported mono- and bi-metallic catalysts under the supercritical methanol condition. During these reactions, esterification and cracking (alcoholysis and hydrocracking) were the two dominant processes. PtNi/MgO exhibited good performance, and gave a high yield (72.4. wt.%) of refined oil. The acid-base properties of the supports have an important effect on the coke deposition on the catalyst surface. The acidic catalysts gave the somewhat lower product yields, but tended to inhibit coking reaction. This would improve the life of the catalysts in the practical applications. The refined oil is believed to be a potential substitute or partial substitute for the fossil transportation fuel. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigates the energy and environmental aspects of producing biohydrogen for bitumen upgrading from a life cycle perspective. Three technologies are studied for biohydrogen production; these include the Battelle Columbus Laboratory (BCL) gasifier, the Gas Technology Institute (GTI) gasifier, and fast pyrolysis. Three different biomass feedstocks are considered including forest residue (FR), whole forest (WF), and agricultural residue (AR). The fast pyrolysis pathway includes two cases: truck transport of bio-oil and pipeline transport of bio-oil. The net energy ratios (NERs) for nine biohydrogen pathways lie in the range of 1.3-9.3. The maximum NER (9.3) is for the FR-based pathway using GTI technology. The GHG emissions lie in the range of 1.20-8.1kgCO 2eq/kg H 2. The lowest limit corresponds to the FR-based biohydrogen production pathway using GTI technology. This study also analyzes the intensities for acid rain precursor and ground level ozone precursor. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Oxygenated fuel additives can be produced by acetylation of glycerol. A 91% glycerol conversion with a selectivity of 38%, 28% and 34% for mono-, di- and triacetyl glyceride, respectively, was achieved at 120 °C and 3. h of reaction time in the presence of a catalyst derived from activated carbon (AC) treated with sulfuric acid at 85 °C for 4. h to introduce acidic functionalities to its surface. The unique catalytic activity of the catalyst, AC-SA5, was attributed to the presence of sulfur containing functional groups on the AC surface, which enhanced the surface interaction between the glycerol molecule and acyl group of the acetic acid. The catalyst was reused in up to four consecutive batch runs and no significant decline of its initial activity was observed. The conversion and selectivity variation during the acetylation is attributed to the reaction time, reaction temperature, catalyst loading and glycerol to acetic acid molar ratio. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Steam reforming of two kinds of bio-oil from rice husks fast pyrolysis was conducted for hydrogen production at three temperatures (650, 750 and 850°C) with Ni-based catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor. The gas composition and organic compounds in liquid condensate were detected by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. In addition, the carbon deposition was also investigated. The results showed that the mole fraction range of hydrogen was within 55.8-61.3% at all temperatures and more hydrogen was produced at the higher temperature. The highest H 2 efficiency of bio-oil steam reforming was 45.33% when extra water was added. The bio-oil with lower content of chemical compounds has a higher H 2 efficiency, but its hydrogen volume was less. Analysis of the liquid condensate showed that most of the organic compounds were circularity compounds. The carbon deposition can decrease the bio-oil conversion, and it was easier to form at the temperature of 750°C. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The study documented the potential of isolated filamentous fungus Aspergillus sp. as whole cell biocatalyst for biodiesel production using Sabourauds dextrose broth medium (SDBM) and corncob waste liquor (CWL) as substrates. SDBM showed improvement in both biomass production (13.6g dry weight/1000ml) and lipid productivity (23.3%) with time. Lipid extraction was performed by direct (DTE) and indirect (IDTE) transesterification methods. DTE showed higher transesterification efficiency with broad spectrum of fatty acids profile over IDTE. CWL as substrate showed good lipid productivity (22.1%; 2g dry biomass; 48h) along with efficient substrate degradation. Lipids derived from both substrates depicted high fraction of saturated fatty acids than unsaturated ones. Physical characteristics of fungal based biodiesel correlated well with prescribed standards. CWL derived biodiesel showed relatively good fuel properties (acid number, 0.40mg KOH/g of acid; iodine value, 11g I 2/100g oil; density, 0.8342g/cm 3) than SDBM derived biodiesel. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) is gaining global popularity as a potential feed stock of biodiesel and a candidate species for waste land reclamation. Although the oil yield of this species is better than any other non-edible oil yielding plants, the lack of agronomic practices defame this species for further exploitation. Furthermore, there is paucity of data on the growth performances and yield of JCL plantations. In this context, a systematic study on passport data and yield performance of JCL germplasms (including their indigenous collection number (IC No.), morphological characterization of seeds and seed oil content) growing in a large scale plantation site at Solar Energy Center, Gurgaon, India were carried out during 2007-2008. Ten elite accessions of JCL were screened from this site based on their growth performance and biomass characterization and were deposited at National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources, New Delhi for registration. The oil content of the 10 registered accessions was ranged from 17% to 34%. Cluster analysis was performed to find out promising germplasms. Cluster analysis formed two prominent groups, each one with two sub-clusters. The promising accessions can be further explored for crop improvement programs. Furthermore, multi-locational trials are essential for optimizing the agropractices for maximum yield for a sustainable biodiesel production. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Possibilities for using straight vegetable oil (SVO) from Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz (camelina or false flax) and its mixtures with Brassica napus (rape) SVO as fuel in adapted diesel engines are described with chemical parameters, measurements in a test engine and a field test in a tractor. Camelina as a crop is attracting attention in organic farming and is often used in mixed cropping systems with low competition to food production area. Camelina SVO has low oxidation stability. Its polymerization affinity limits the storage time and increase the risk of coking at hot motor components and of thickening processes in the lubricant oil of the engine. In mixtures with rape and camelina SVO, threshold limits for Conradson Carbon Residues and for oxidation resistance were exceeded. The oxidation resistance could be prolonged by the addition of commercial antioxidants. Camelina and rape SVO showed very similar burning characteristics at full-to-medium partial engine loads. Under low partial loads and idle load, the burning function of the various fuels was increasingly delayed, beginning with diesel fuel over pure rape SVO, then a mixture containing 700 dm3 m-3 rape SVO, and 300 dm3 m-3 camelina SVO, through to pure camelina SVO. The exhaust emissions of NOx-, CO-, particles and HC of rape SVO, camelina SVO and their described mixture were not significantly different. The typically higher NOx- and lower HC-emissions of SVO compared to diesel fuel were apparent. The results principally reveal the usability of a cold pressed, non-refined camelina-rape SVO mixture in adapted diesel engines. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There is a need to seek non-conventional seed oil sources for biodiesel production due to issues such as supply and availability as well as food versus fuel. In this context, Milo (Thespesia populnea L.) seed oil was investigated for the first time as a potential non-conventional feedstock for preparation of biodiesel. This is also the first report of a biodiesel fuel produced from a feedstock containing cyclic fatty acids as T. populnea contains 8,9-methylene-8-heptadecenoic (malvalic) and smaller amounts of two cyclopropane fatty acids besides greater amounts of linoleic, oleic and palmitic acids. The crude oil extracted from T. populnea seed was transesterified under standard conditions with sodium methoxide as catalyst. Biodiesel derived from T. populnea seed oil exhibited fuel properties of density 880 kg m-3, kinematic viscosity 4.25 mm2/s; cetane number 59.8; flash point 176 °C; cloud point 9 °C; pour point 8 °C; cold filter plugging point 9 °C; sulfur content 11 mg kg-1; water content 150 mg kg-1; ash content 15 mg kg-1; and acid value as KOH 250 mg kg-1. The oxidative stability of 2.91 h would require the use of antioxidants to meet specifications in standards. Generally, most results compared well with ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 specifications. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The scope of this work is to evaluate some properties of the oils and derived fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) from two different Jatropha Curcas species planted in Cuba. The properties that were determined include the acid value, peroxide value, p-anisidine value and fatty acid ethyl esters composition. In order to study the influence of the genus species and geographic conditions on the fuel properties, the oils from Jatropha Curcas planted in two regions of Cuba and their derived FAEE were analyzed and compared. The two plantations were in San José (SJ) and Guantanamo (Gt) representing respectively the western and eastern part of the island.The analyses indicated that the FAEE obtained from Guantanamo has a higher acid value and peroxide value compared with the FAEE from San José. The p-anisidine values did not show a clear trend and the results of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry indicated a similar FAEE composition. The results obtained by gas chromatography are in good agreements with previous reports. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present paper reports the results of the study of the effect of metal contaminants on the storage stability of Jatropha curcas biodiesel (JCB) with and without antioxidants. Taking 1,2,3 -Trihydroxybenzene/Pyrogallol (PY) as the most effective antioxidant based on the earlier work of the authors, JCB was mixed with different transition metals - Fe, Ni, Mn, Co and Cu in different concentrations. Induction period (IP) was measured using Rancimat method (EN 14112) as the stability parameter. Based on results, several correlations were developed for assessing the storage stability in terms of IP as a function of antioxidant, metal concentration and storage time. For the purpose of design of experiment, response surface methodology (RSM) has been used. From the experiments it is found that if metal concentration is 0 then, 200 g m-3 of PY is sufficient to make biodiesel stable for 6 months. If metal (Fe) concentration is 2 g m-3 or more, then 800 g m-3 PY is sufficient to make biodiesel stable for 5.5 months. The value of storage time for Ni, Mn, Co and Cu contaminated JCB is found as 3.62, 3.24, 2.76 and 2.07 months respectively if metal and antioxidants concentration is same in all the cases.The models developed by RSM shall be highly useful for predicting the optimum antioxidant concentration to achieve maximum storage stability of JCB as well as biodiesel from other resources under the conditions set for 3 factors (antioxidant concentration, metal concentration and time). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, the behavior of the internal nozzle flow of a standard diesel fuel has been compared against a biodiesel fuel (soybean oil) at cavitating and non-cavitating conditions, using a homogeneous equilibrium model. The model takes into account the compressibility of both phases (liquid and vapour) and use a barotropic equation of state which relates pressure and density to calculate the growth of cavitation. Furthermore, turbulence effects have been introduced using a RNG k- ε model.The comparison of both fuels in a real diesel injector nozzle has been performed in terms of mass flow, momentum flux, effective velocity at the outlet and cavitation appearance. The decrease of injection velocity and cavitation intensity for the biodiesel noticed by numerical simulation at different injection conditions, predict a worse air-fuel mixing process. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Vegetable oils and animal fats are applicable as fuels in standard diesel engines after having adapted the fuel system for electronically controlled dual fuel regime oil/fat-fossil diesel. In this contribution, performance and emission characteristics of the engines running on rapeseed oil, lard, or chicken fat are given and compared to those of fossil diesel and fatty acid methyl esters. The results of engine tests of these fuels show a decrease in maximum power and maximum torque in comparison to fossil diesel due to a lower energy content of triacylglycerols. These values are influenced also by a type of the engine used at testing. When compared to fossil diesel, the opacity of oil/fat based fuels is higher for an engine with lower injection pressures while it is lower for an engine with higher injection pressures. The level of both controlled and uncontrolled emissions is low for all tested biofuels and is low also for the reference fossil diesel. The results of performance and emission tests for rapeseed oil containing 3 and 6 vol.% of anhydrous ethanol are comparable to those obtained for pure oil. In this paper, practical experiences based on long-term operation of adapted vehicle fleet fuelled with oil/fat-fossil diesel are mentioned. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rh, Pt, and Pt-Rh catalysts on modified commercial zirconia support (m-ZrO2) were screened for the clean-up of gasification gas from tar, methane, and ammonia both in the absence and presence of H2S while varying the Rh metal content from 0.5 to 5 w-%. Our goal was to optimize the composition of the Rh/m-ZrO2 catalyst in view of the production of ultra clean gas applicable for liquid biofuels synthesis. In the presence of 100 ppm sulfur, increasing Rh concentration from 0.5 to 5 w-% did not greatly improve the activity of the catalyst. The bimetallic Pt/Rh/m-ZrO2 catalyst was also less active than the 0.5 w-% Rh/m-ZrO2 catalyst. Furthermore, the Rh/m-ZrO2 catalyst regained its performance at the set point of 800 °C when the sulfur feed was turned off even after exposures to 500-1000 ppm sulfur. Our data allow us to suggest that in the presence of sulfur, the active sites responsible for the reforming reactions are poisoned, but less impact occurs on sites responsible for oxidation reactions. Furthermore, the screening experiments allow to suggest that the Rh/m-ZrO 2 catalyst could be applicable to hot gas cleaning in the presence of sulfur (&gt; 50 ppm) at above 800 °C using a moderate gas hourly space velocity of approximately 3400 1/h. Since biomass gasification gas generally contains sulfur, the 0.5 w-% Rh/m-ZrO2 catalyst could be a promising option for gasification gas clean-up applications at temperatures above 800 °C where it reduces tar to very low levels. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The chemical and physical properties of raw biooils prevent their direct use in combustion engines. We processed raw pyrolytic biooil derived from chicken manure to yield a colorless refined biooil with diesel qualities. Chemical characterization of the refined biooil involved elemental and several spectroscopic analyses. The physical measurements employed were viscosity, density and heat of combustion. The elemental composition (% wt/wt) of the refined biooil was 82.7 % C, 15.3 % H, 0.2 % N and 1.8 % O, no S. Its viscosity was 0.006 Pa.s and a heat of combustion of 43 MJ kg -1. The refined biooil fraction contains n-alkanes, ranging from n-C 14 to n-C 27, alkenes varying from C 10:1 to C 22:1, and long-chain alcohols. The refined biooil makes a good diesel fuel due to its chemical and physical properties. © 2011 Crown Copyright.

AB  - This study was performed to investigate the effect of biogas-biodiesel fuel combustion on the emissions reduction and nanoparticle characteristics in a direct injection (DI) diesel engine. In order to apply the two biofuels, biogas was injected into a premixed chamber during the intake process by using two electronically controlled gas injectors, and biodiesel fuel was directly injected into combustion chamber by a high-pressure injection system. The in-cylinder pressure and rate of heat release (ROHR) were investigated under various fuel conditions for single-fuel (biodiesel) and dual-fuel (biogas-biodiesel) combustions. To evaluate the engine performances and exhaust emissions characteristics, the indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and exhaust emissions were also investigated under various test conditions. Furthermore, the particle number concentration and the size distribution of nanoparticles were analyzed by using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). In the case of dual-fuels, the peak combustion pressure and ROHR were gradually decreased with the increase of the biogas fraction in the dual-fuels. As the premixed ratios increased, ignition delay and combustion durations were prolonged compared to single-fuel mode. The dual-fuels combustion showed that the IMEP decreased slightly and maintained similar levels up to 20° BTDC due to the retarded combustion phase. The concentrations of NOx emissions were decreased for all injection timings as the premixed ratio ( rp) increased. The soot emissions in dual-fuel operations were significantly lower than those in the single-fuel mode (rp = 0), and decreased gradually as the premixed ratio increased, regardless of injection timing. A lower nanoparticle size distribution was observed at all premixed ratios for dual-fuel combustion compared to those of the single fuel mode. The number distribution of both nuclei and accumulation modes also decreased with an increase in the biogas fraction. A slight reduction in the total particle number and total volume for all premixed ratios was observed as the injection timing increased from TDC up to 20° BTDC. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work investigates the feasibility of ultra-deep hydrodesulfurization (i.e. ≤1 ppm of sulfur content) of several diesel feedstocks, viz., regular (R), premium (P) and hydrotreated straight-run (HSR) at low pressures, i.e. 10 bar, to lower significantly the operation costs. The premium and regular diesel contain additive packages with several components such as cetane boosters, antioxidants that show to negatively affect the sulfur conversion at low pressures. In the hydrotreated straight-run diesel fuel, which does not contain an additive package, total desulfurization can be obtained at 10 bar, T = 340 °C and LHSV = 1 h-1. As a model for the additive package, FAME (fatty acid methyl ester), an ingredient that encounters the demands of a sustainable future, was added to the hydrotreated straight-run diesel (HSR + FAME) in order to check its influence on the total sulfur conversion. Results show that this biofuel component hindered tremendously the sulfur removal process by lowering the sulfur removal from 98% to zero at 10 bar, probably by competitive adsorption. At higher pressures, e.g. 30 bar, when FAME was present, new sulfur compounds were formed during the HDS process and the effective sulfur removal was very low. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass is an abundant and carbon-neutral renewable energy resource for the production of biofuels, moving the market dependence away from fossil-based energy sources. The main problem is how to efficiently remove the abundant oxygen content from biomass-derived products and convert it into a hydrophobic molecule with the appropriate combustion or chemical properties. Many efforts have been devoted to the search of heterogeneous catalytic systems, more selective, safe and environmentally friendly. In this scenario zeolites and mesoporous compounds may help chemists to develop new biofuel generation processes. The development of new catalysts in the field of conversion of biomass to biofuels requires knowledge of the complex nature of the substrates to be converted. Starting from the main chemical aspects of the different biomass platforms, an overview of some of the zeolite and mesoporous materials technologies currently used commercially or tested at pilot and laboratory scale, is presented in this paper. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The oil crisis and the global effort to control the greenhouse effect have forced the researchers to think of various alternative energy sources. This decade has seen increasing importance of chemically treated vegetable oil biodiesel fuels for various applications in heat engines. Post-Kyoto negotiations refer to high level talks attempting to address global warming by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. During Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen the potential topics discussed were carbon capture and storage, biofuels, adaptation financing, technology transfer, sustainable agriculture, emissions targets, tropical forests and rural and transport electrification. Our area of interest is biofuels under which nonedible Jatropha oil due to its properties which are very close to diesel fuel is being explored as an alternative fuel. A lot of research is underway in the use of different biodiesel fuels in Internal Combustion engines, but very limited work has been reported in its use in gas turbines. This paper describes the results of an ongoing development program aimed at determining the technical feasibility of utilizing biodiesel in IS/60 Rovers gas turbine. The test rig is equipped with a dynamometer for turbine loading and AVL exhaust gas analyzer has been used to record emissions. The test results of 2 blends have been reported in this paper. Analyzing the results compared with the base line performance using diesel fuel under normal conditions show encouraging outcomes. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - After the year 2037, it is believed that the Otto and Diesel engines will replace the electric motors. Electric vehicles will work with hydrogen and fuel cells. The vehicles running on batteries and fuels are called hybrid electric vehicles. The cars with hybrid engines promise great hope for the future. The use of foodstuffs as raw materials for energy production, such as ethanol from corn, increases the prices of meat and milk. The drought and soil infertility increases the risk of human and animal nutrition. The rise in the production of biofuels based on food grains has contributed to global food price increases since 2006. The global food crisis is hitting with alarming speed and force, challenging the USA, other nations. The root causes of the global food crisis are complex, fluid, persistent, and multidimensional. This is not a simple problem. For this purpose a food using protocol must be organized with broad participation. © Sila Science.

AB  - Understanding the relationship between black carbon (BC) and carbon monoxide (CO) will help improve BC emission inventories and the evaluation of global/regional climate forcing effects. In the present work, the BC (PM 1) mass concentration and CO mixing ratio were continuously measured at a high-altitude background station on the summit of Mt. Huang (30.16° N, 118.26° E, 1840 m a.s.l.). Annual mean BC mass concentration was 1004.5 ± 895.5 ng mĝ̂'3 with maxima in spring and autumn, and annual mean CO mixing ratio was 424.1 ± 159.2 ppbv. A large increase of CO was observed in the cold season, implying the contribution from the large-scale domestic coal/biofuel combustion for heating. The BC-CO relationship was found to show different seasonal features but strong positive correlation (R&gt;0.8). In Mt. Huang area, the ΔBC/ΔCO ratio showed unimodal diurnal variations and had a maximum during the day (09:00-17:00 LST) and minimum at night (21:00-04:00 LST) in all seasons, indicating the impact of planetary boundary layer and the intrusion of clean air masses from the high troposphere. Back trajectory cluster analysis showed that the ΔBC/ΔCO ratio of plumes from the Eastern China (Jiangsu, Zhejiang provinces and Shanghai) was 8.8 ± 0.9 ng mg-3 ppbv-1. Transportation and industry were deemed as controlling factors of the BC-CO relationship in this region. The ΔBC/ΔCO ratios for air masses from Northern China (Anhui, Henan, Shanxi and Shandong provinces) and southern China (Jiangxi, Fujian and Hunan provinces) were quite similar with mean values of 6.5 ± 0.4 and 6.5 ± 0.2 ng m-3 ppb-1 respectively. The case studies combined with satellite observations demonstrated that the ΔCO ratio for biomass burning (BB) plumes were 10.3 ± 0.3 and 11.6 ± 0.5ng m-3 ppbv-1, significantly higher than those during non-BB impacted periods. The loss of BC during transport was also investigated on the basis of the ΔBC/ΔCO-RH (relative humidity) relationship along air mass pathways. The results showed that BC particles from Eastern China area was much more easily removed from atmosphere than other inland regions due to the higher RH along transport pathway, implying the importance of chemical compositions and mixing states on BC residence time in the atmosphere. © 2011 Author(s).

AB  - Demand of renewable and clean energy to replace diesel world is big and urgent. However, edible crop oil as raw material is limited and its price is expensive and unstable. We want to look for new suppliers of raw materials, which should be cheap and supply stable to replace edible oil such as rapeseed and euphorbia extract. This study shows, the best candid for this purpose is Euphorbia tirucalli. It can be feasible and efficient to produce biodiesel in plant as stocks which contains terpenoids. Based on economic situation of oriental (Iran, UAE, Oman), several suggestions have been listed for development and promotion of biodiesel from E. tirucalli. These lands can be used to grow biodiesel feed stocks plant and to produce non-food biodiesel feedstocks for the domestic energy market to diminish imports. Biodiesel is non toxic and environmental friendly as it produces substantially less carbon monoxide and 100% less sulfur dioxide emissions with no unhurt hydrocarbons and consequently it is ideal fuel for heavily polluted cities. Biodiesel reduces serious air pollutants such as particulates and air toxicity. This material can be used directly by a diesel-powered car. Also, biodiesel extends the life of diesel engines. © 2011 Academic Journals.

AB  - Developing counties are often believed to have excellent conditions for biofuel production, however studies aimed at assessing the sustainability of large scale biofuel programs have generally focused on a few variables related to one scientific domain and one scale. Contrary to this approach, this paper analyzes soybean biodiesel in Brazil using a parallel biophysical and economic assessment at different scales. A Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM) approach is applied as a scenario analysis tool. A soybean biodiesel energy balance for the specific conditions of Brazil is included and the energy ratio turns out to be 1.09. This means that the energy delivered is higher than the energy invested, however the net energy is very low. The economic impacts are analyzed through input-output analysis. The results show that soybean biodiesel increases energy consumption per hour of work without a corresponding increase in economic labor productivity. Consequently the already low energy efficiency of Brazilian production could get worse. Although Brazil has large expanses of land, the substitution of 20% fossil diesel (i.e. just 3.3% of the country's primary energy consumption) with fully renewable biodiesel might destroy protected areas and forests and increase the GHGs emitted. © 2011.

AB  - Castor has tremendous potential as a feedstock for biodiesel production. The oil content and fatty acid composition in castor seed are important factors determining the price for production and affecting the key fuel properties of biodiesel. There are 1033 available castor accessions collected or donated from 48 countries worldwide in the USDA germplasm collection. The entire castor collection was screened for oil content and fatty acid composition by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography (GC), respectively. Castor seeds on the average contain 48.2% oil with significant variability ranging from 37.2 to 60.6%. Methyl esters were prepared from castor seed by alkaline transmethylation. GC analysis of methyl esters confirmed that castor oil was composed primarily of eight fatty acids: 1.48% palmitic (C16:0), 1.58% stearic (C18:0), 4.41% oleic (C18:1), 6.42% linoleic (C18:2), 0.68% linolenic (C18:3), 0.45% gadoleic (C20:1), 84.51% ricinoleic (C18:1-1OH), and 0.47% dihydroxystearic (C18:0-2OH) acids. Significant variability in fatty acid composition was detected among castor accessions. Ricinoleic acid (RA) was positively correlated with dihydroxystearic acid (DHSA) but highly negatively correlated with the five other fatty acids except linolenic acid. The results for oil content and fatty acid composition obtained from this study will be useful for end-users to explore castor germplasm for biodiesel production. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Among the alternatives to meet the increasing of world demand for energy, the use of biomass as energy source is one of the most promising as it contributes to reducing emissions of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Gasification is a technological process of biomass energy production of a gaseous biofuel. The fuel gas has a low calorific value that can be used in Diesel engine in dual mode for power generation in isolated communities. This study aimed to evaluate the reduction in the consumption of oil Diesel an engine generator, using gas from gasification of wood. The engine generator brand used was a BRANCO, with direct injection power of 7.36 kW (10 HP) coupled to an electric generator 5.5 kW. Diesel oil mixed with intake air was injected, as the oil was injected via an injector of the engine (dual mode). The fuel gas was produced in a downdraft gasifier. The engine generator was put on load system from 0.5 kW to 3.5 kW through a set of electrical resistances. Diesel oil consumption was measured with a precision scale. It was concluded that the engine converted to dual mode when using the gas for the gasification of wood decreased Diesel consumption by up to 57%.

AB  - SVO (Straight Vegetable oil) of Jatropha was de-waxed and de-gummed as per the standard procedure, and was tested in irrigation pump set, kerosene cook stove and kerosene lamp. It was found that Jatropha oil could be successfully used as irrigation pump fuel, however at interval of every 25 - 30 hours of operation, fuel injection nozzle and head needs to be cleaned in spite of maintaining the Jatropha oil temperature between 80 to 90 °C. Out put of the irrigation pump is almost similar to diesel fuelled irrigation pump set, however fuel consumption rate in case of Jatropha oil was more compared to diesel. Recorded air pollutants were found to be higher in case of Jatropha oil as compared to diesel, except NOx. No significant, wear and tear in the engine component such as liner, piston, and piston rings, except bore gauge was observed. Trials taken with kerosene stove and kerosene lamp also reveals that Jatropha oil could be used as cooking fuel in pressurized stoves with a blend of 30% Jatropha oil and 70% kerosene without any problems. However for kerosene lamp it can be used with a blending of 10% Jatropha oil and 90% kerosene. © IIOAB-India.

AB  - Increasing fuel demand, decreasing natural reserves and environmental consciousness have together led to testing and implementing new fuels and blending components of compression ignition engines. Biofuels are very commonly added to fossil fuels, mostly ethanol to gasoline and FAME to diesel. Harmonizing their properties with engines is a great challenge for automotive and oil industry. Increasing demand for diesel oil in Europe raised the question about the possibility of increasing the amount of bio extenders. There were and certainly there are a number of experiments aimed at substituting or blending diesel with other fuels. One group of such fuels makes bioethanol- biodiesel-diesel oil mixtures. The paper proposes a global overview on literature and presents the obtained results. The article explores the possibility of using bioethanol-biodiesel-diesel oil mixtures in vehicles and agricultural compression ignition engines. The main aspect of researches was to find blends substitutable for compression ignition engines. Investigations were made to determine the maximum volume of a renewable part thus reaching the same or similar power output with lowering emissions. The received results were used for environmental and economical investigations. The valorisation of the results shows that bioethanol-biodiesel-diesel blends fulfil the cetane number, viscosity and lubricity requirements for standard diesel. Practical measurements and engine tests show that the utilization of a new fuel decreases emissions from the engine. The results of agricultural feedstock calculation indicate that in Hungary the biofuel part of the investigated fuels can be produced from an overflow. © 2011 Copyright Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika.

AB  - The use of biofuels has been extensively developed in the last years to diversify energy resources and to participate to the transportation greenhouse gas emissions reduction effort. One of the most promising renewable fuels for large scale production is the ethanol which is nowadays mainly used for spark-ignited engines; nonetheless the European market share of Diesel vehicles is around 60%. These issues lead us to propose an innovative fuel formulation using ethanol for Diesel engine applications. The key issues to deal with the use of ethanol in a Diesel blend are the miscibility, the flashpoint, the lubricity and the cetane number. An intensive work has been done to optimise the formulation coupling the use of ethanol, with first and second generations of Diesel biofuels. The application on a Euro 4-compliant Diesel turbocharged engine with high pressure exhaust gas recirculation shows an outstanding decrease of particulate matter emissions thanks to this oxygenated fuel. Nevertheless unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions could be an issue as well as NOx emissions if the engine control settings are not updated. Combustion analysis helps understanding the fuel effect on the resulting auto-ignition delay and the pilot injection combustion behaviour, which leads to modified engine output compared to Diesel fuel. Therefore, the optimisation of the fuel/engine matching is performed using advanced calibration methodologies combined with design of experiments at the engine test bed. First of all, global and mixed approaches are proposed and compared in warm operating conditions. Finally it permits to simultaneously drop nitrogen oxides emissions and particulate matter emissions. Global CO2 emissions reduction and noise decrease are also expected. To further investigate engine emissions potential reduction, the engine is set up on a dynamic test bed facility, allowing to reproduce cold New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Several innovative calibration methods, based on the simultaneous optimisation of engine basic settings and cold correction maps, are introduced in order to better suit to the new formulation impact on combustion and catalyst light-off and to drop off engine-out unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions. This stage allows pushing forward the work on test bed facilities in order to reduce the amount of vehicle tests. Tests on a chassis dynamometer are only used to validate the engine test bed results and to perform final tuning of cold correction maps. This alternative blend shows potential to achieve Euro 5 standard with Euro 4 Diesel vehicle configuration, without any hardware modification and without a Diesel particulate filter in the exhaust line. Such an innovative fuel formulation seems to be an interesting answer to the trade-off in the forthcoming years between cost and emissions reduction to achieve sustainable mobility. The presented calibration methods and tools allow to fully take advantage of this alternative fuel in a reduced time scale. © 2011, IFP Energies nouvelles.

AB  - Food waste and municipal wastewater are promising feedstocks for microbial lipid biofuel production, and corresponding production process is to be developed. In this study, different oleaginous yeast strains were tested to grow in hydrolyzed food waste, and growths of Cryptococcus curvatus, Yarrowia lipolytica, and Rhodotorula glutinis in this condition were at same level as in glucose culture as control. These strains were further tested to grow in municipal primary wastewater. C. curvatus and R. glutinis had higher production than Y. lipolytica in media made from primary wastewater, both with and without glucose supplemented. Finally, a process was tested to grow C. curvatus and R. glutinis in media made from food waste and municipal wastewater, and the effluents from these processes were further treated with yeast culture and phototrophic algae culture; 1.1 g/L C. curvatus and 1.5 g/L R. glutinis biomass were further produced in second-step yeast cultures, as well as 1.53 and 0.58 g/L Chlorella sorokiniana biomass in phototrophic cultures. The residual nitrogen concentrations in final effluents were 33 mg/L and 34 mg/L, respectively, and the residual phosphorus concentrations were 1.5 and 0.6 mg/L, respectively. The lipid contents in the produced biomass were from 18.7% to 28.6%. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

AB  - Mixed cropping is frequently used in organic farming and recommended worldwide in low external input areas to increase productivity, yield security and product diversity. In trials with different oil crops camelina (false flax, Camelina sativa L.), linseed (Linum ustitatissivum L.), rape (Brassica napus L.), safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) or white mustard (Sinapis alba L.) grown together with grain legumes or cereals on German sites the potential of renewable fuel production parallel to food production was evaluated in organic farming. Depending on the crop-combination between 10 to 900 kg/ha vegetable oil could be produced. This could cover the fuel demand of agricultural machinery for 0.1 to 9 ha farmland. The food crops combined with oil plants in mixed cropping mostly had relative yields higher as 0.5, showing that also yield increases in food production are possible parallel to the production of renewable fuel. As example for an introduction of a non-common oil crop in farm cycles, research results on the use of straight vegetable oil as fuel in tractors and of oil-cake as feedstuff for livestock from camelina are summarised. Based on the results the importance for the GHG emissions of organic farms is discussed. When mixed cropping systems with oil crops and the use of all products are consequently introduced, improvements in the GHG balance of farms can be expected by savings in production and yield stabilisation in mixed cropping as well as by direct substitution of diesel fuel in agricultural machinery and by substitution of imported feed components for livestock.

AB  - Global biofuel production has risen substantially in recent years, driven primarily by government support for biofuel industries. The stated motivations for these initiatives are numerous and have varied over time. Soybeans are the only field crop produced in sufficient quantities in the province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) that the South African industrial biofuel strategy identifies as a potential biodiesel feedstock. Results from a mixed integer linear programming model suggest that significant government support is required to stimulate biodiesel production, and support the notion of Funke et al. (2009), who contend that the incentives and commitments outlined by the industrial biofuel strategy are inadequate to both establish and sustain a domestic biodiesel industry. Under baseline assumptions, a minimum implicit subsidy of R4.37 per litre is required to draw soybean-based biodiesel production into the optimum solution. Results also show that the implicit subsidy is sensitive to changes in the soybean oilcake (by-product) price and the soybean (input) price. © Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.

AB  - Purpose: In order to provide more sustainable fuels and address the depletion of oil as a feedstock, the automotive industry must adapt to a growing market share of alternative fuels. The environmental impacts of the automotive industry to date would suggest that these alternatives will be more environmentally friendly than petroleum-based fuels. This is nonetheless an assumption that cannot be confirmed without a systematic life cycle assessment (LCA). This article explores the feasibility of USEtox to provide information needed for automotive-fuel LCA. Materials and methods: USEtox is tested on three energy pathways: gasoline, diesel fuel and hard coal electricity. The studied emissions are mainly volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and heavy metals. USEtox being dependent on the physicochemical and toxic properties of the studied species, a speciation of all VOCs emitted was performed. Moreover, since USEtox allows a distinction between rural and urban emissions, a geographical information system was developed in order to distinguish these emissions. Finally, because crude oil comes from various countries, characterization factors have been calculated for new regional compartments. Results and discussion: Human health issues are caused by aldehydes and heavy metals while ecotoxicity is caused by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aldehydes and heavy metals. For organic compounds, a clear distinction is observed between urban and rural emissions while inorganic mechanisms are independent of this distinction. Among the three energy pathways, urban diesel is the more impacting. Conclusions: USEtox can be used for the assessment of automotive fuels, though it only addresses specific aspects of human health and ecotoxicity. The LCA practitioner must keep in mind that USEtox has to be used in conjunction with other indicators, such as ReCiPe or CML, to comprehensively cover the toxic and ecotoxic impacts of fuels. The level of analysis is dependent on the accuracy of the inventory, aldehydes and PAH playing a crucial role. Inorganic impacts are highly uncertain, contrary to organic compounds. The distinction between rural and urban emissions allows a better assessment of internal combustion engine-powered cars compared with electric and hybrid cars, which is especially useful for the automotive industry now that these technologies are clearly being developed. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The substitution of petroleum-based fuels with those from renewable sources has gained momentum worldwide. A UV - vis experiment for the quantitative analysis of biofuels (bioethanol or biodiesel) in (petroleum-based) diesel oil has been developed. Before the experiment, students were given a quiz on biofuels, and then they were asked to suggest a suitable UV - vis experiment for the quantification of biofuels in diesel oil. After discussing the results of the quiz, the experiment was conducted. This included the determination of λmax of the medium-dependent, that is, solvatochromic, visible absorption band of the probe 2,6-bis[4-(fert-butyl)phenyl]-4-{2,4,6-tris[4- (tertbutyl)phenyl]pyridinium-l-yl}phenolate as a function of fuel composition. The students appreciated that the subject was linked to a daily situation and that they were asked to suggest the experiment. This experiment served to introduce the phenomena of solvation and solvatochromism. Copyright © 2011 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.

AB  - Technical and economic analysis was done for the biomass to dimethyl ether (DME) technology to promote the gasification/synthesis route for biofuel production and its application as a fossil fuel substitute. The technology of biomass gasification/synthesis has obvious advantages, including production flexibility, environmental friendliness, economic feasibility, and application versatility. Biomass gasification/synthesis technology integrates bio-DME synthesis, fertilizer production, electricity generation, and waste heat utilization to convert waste biomass residues to DME for use as liquid petroleum gas, transportation fuel substitute, and chemical intermediates, which has been proven to be one of the most effective and clean biomass utilization routes. The 1000 t/a-scale demonstration plant has a bio-DME production rate of 6 to 7tbiomass/tDME, biomass gasification efficiency of ≥82%, once-through CO conversion of ≥70%, DME selectivity (DME/DME + other organic products) of ≥90%, and a total system efficiency of ≥38%. The demonstration plant also has self-sufficient steam and electricity supply. The 10,000tons/a-scale bio-DME production cost with or without feedstock subsidy is estimated to be 1968 Yuan/t and 2868 Yuan/t, respectively in China. Because of the limitation in biomass feedstock collection cost, massive and disperse commercial plants with a capacity of 10000 t/a bio-DME are more suitable for rural areas. © 2010 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - There is a lack of information regarding the impact of temperature on yield-related traits for lesquerella [Physaria fendleri (Gray)], a new crop with potential as a biofuel or bioproduct because of the high content of seed hydroxyl fatty acids. Here we determined the effect of four temperature regimes on plant branching, dry matter production, and reproductive growth in two controlled-environment experiments. The night/day temperature treatments were (1) 4.4/12.8°C, (2) 12.8/21.1°C, (3) 21.1/29.4°C, and (4) 29.4/37.8°C. Plant branch number, biomass, and reproductive development were greatly suppressed by the coolest and warmest temperature treatments. Biomass and branch production were similar for Treatments 2 and 3, but reproductive development and was increased in Treatment 2. Treatment 2 led to more branches with reproductive structures and more buds and flowers than Treatment 3. Plants moved from the coolest treatment (1) to Treatment 2 temperature at 45 days after planting exhibited accelerated branching and production of dry matter, buds, and flowers, whereas transfer from Treatment 1 to Treatment 3 led to enhanced silique production. These results suggest that moving from a cold to a warmer temperature enhanced both biomass production and reproductive development. In addition to documenting the temperature impact on growth and reproductive development of lesquerella, the results provide evidence pertinent to defining growing regions suitable for cultivation of this new crop. © Crop Science Society of America.

AB  - Transesterification of vegetable oils (from soybeans and rice bran) into methyl and ethyl esters using a batch microwave system was investigated in this study. A critical comparison between the two alcohols was performed in terms of yields, quality, and reaction kinetics. Parameters tested were temperature (60, 70 and 80°C) and time (5, 10, 15 and 20. min). At all tested conditions, more than 96% conversion rates were obtained for both ethanol and methanol. Use of microwave technology to assist the transesterification process resulted in faster reaction times and reduced catalyst requirement (about ten-fold decrease). Methanol required lower alcohol:oil ratios than normally used in conventional heating, whereas ethanol required higher molar ratios. All esters produced using this method met ASTM biodiesel quality specifications. Methanol performed better in terms of performance and costs, while ethanol may have some environmental and safety benefits. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Catalytic pyrolysis was used to generate gasoline-compatible fuel from peanut oil soap stock (PSS), a high free fatty acid feedstock, using a fixed-bed reactor at temperatures between 450 and 550°C with a zeolite catalyst (HZSM-5). PSS fed at 81gh -1 along with 100mLmin -1 inert gas was passed across a 15g catalyst bed (WHSV=5.4h -1, gas phase residence time=34s). Results indicate that fuel properties of PSS including viscosity, heating value, and O:C ratio were improved significantly. For PSS processed at 500°C, viscosity was reduced from 59.6 to 0.9mm 2s -1, heating value was increased from 35.8 to 39.3MJL -1, and the O:C ratio was reduced from 0.07 to 0.02. Aromatic gasoline components (e.g., BTEX), were formed in concentrations as high as 94% (v/v) in catalytically-cracked PSS with yields ranging from 22% to 35% (v/v of PSS feed). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biogas production by co-digestion of cattle manure with crude glycerin obtained from biodiesel production was studied after pre-treatment of the cattle manure or mixtures of cattle manure with different amounts of added glycerin with ultrasound. Batch experiments with 1750. mL of medium containing 1760. g of screened cattle manure or mixtures of cattle manure (screened or ground) and 70-140. mL or crude glycerin were incubated under mesophilic and thermophilic condition in stirred tank reactors. Under mesophilic conditions, the addition of 4% glycerin to screened manure increased biogas production by up to 400%. Application of sonication (20. kHz, 0.1. kW, and 4. min) to a mixture of manure. +. 4% glycerin increased production of biogas by up to 800% compared to untreated manure. The best results were obtained under thermophilic conditions using sonicated mixtures of ground cattle manure with 6% added glycerin (348. L methane/kg COD removed were obtained). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Anaerobic co-digestion of residues from the cold pressing and trans-esterification of oilseed rape (OSR) with other farm wastes was considered as a means of enhancing the sustainability of on-farm biodiesel production. The study verified the process energy yields using biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests and semi-continuous digestion trials. The results indicated that high proportions of OSR cake in the feedstock led to a decrease in volatile solids destruction and instability of the digestion process. Co-digestion with cattle slurry or with vegetable waste led to acceptable specific and volumetric methane productions, and a digestate low in potentially toxic elements (PTE). The results were used to evaluate energy balances and greenhouse gas emissions of the integrated process compared with biodiesel production alone. Co-digestion was shown to provide energy self-sufficiency and security of supply to farms, with sufficient surplus for export as fuel and electricity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The distillate produced by deodorization of palm oil (DDPO) is a waste that corresponds to 4% of the product formed in this process. DDPO is 83% free of fatty acids (FFA), making it a good material for biodiesel production. In this paper, a catalyst prepared from a waste material, Amazon flint kaolin, was used for the esterification of DDPO with methanol. Leached metakaolin treated at 950°C and activated with 4 M sulfuric acid (labeled as MF9S4) offered maximum esterification activity (92.8%) at 160°C with a DDPO:methanol molar ratio of 1:60 and a 4-h reaction time. The influences of reaction parameters, such as the molar ratio of the reactants, alcohol chain length, temperature, time and the presence of glycerides and unsaponifiable matter, have also been investigated. Based on the catalytic results, esterification of DDPO using MF9S4 can be a cheaper alternative for production of sustainable fuels. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Reducing CO2 emissions from vehicles in China is crucial and will significantly alleviate the environmental burden of the Earth. Some promising technologies that make possible low-carbon vehicles are reviewed in this work, including electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, hybrid vehicles, biofuels vehicles, other alternative fuel vehicles, and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles with improvement. In the short term, expanding the use of mature technologies in conventional gasoline or diesel vehicles is the most realistic, effective, and timely solution for China to meeting the urgent challenges of energy saving and greenhouse gas reduction; while in the long run biofuel is a promising candidate due to their renewability and carbon neutrality. The blueprint of low-carbon vehicles for China depends on three aspects: breakthroughs in technology, awareness of public, and government guidance. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study is the further characterisation of PM2.5 emissions from the residential wood combustion of common woods grown in Portugal. This new research extends to eight the number of biomass fuels studied and tries to understand the differences that the burning appliance (fireplace versus woodstove) and the combustion temperature (cold and hot start) have on emissions. Pinus pinaster (Maritime pine), Eucalyptus globulus (eucalypt), Quercus suber (cork oak), Acacia longifolia (Golden wattle), Quercus faginea (Portuguese oak), Olea europea (Olive), Quercus ilex rotundifolia (Holm oak) and briquettes produced from forest biomass waste were used in the combustion tests. Determinations included fine particle emission factors, carbonaceous content (OC and EC) by a thermal-optical transmission technique and detailed identification and quantification of organic compounds by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Fine particle emission factors from the woodstove were lower than those from the fireplace. For both combustion appliances, the OC/EC ratio was higher in "cold start" tests (1.56 ± 0.95 for woodstove and 2.03 ± 1.34 for fireplace). These "cold start" OC/EC values were, respectively, for the woodstove and the fireplace, 51% and 69% higher than those obtained in "hot start" experiments. The chromatographically resolved organics included n-alkanes, n-alkenes, PAHs, n-alkanals, ketones, n-alkanols, terpenoids, triterpenoids, phenolic compounds, phytosterols, alcohols, n-alkanoic acids, n-di-acids, unsaturated acids and alkyl esters of acids. The smoke emission rate and composition varied widely depending on fuel type, burning appliance and combustion temperature. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study has been motivated by the need to understand and predict fuel-nitrogen conversion in the combustion of biomass-derived fuels. Within that broader context, an earlier related publication (Lucassen et al., Proc. Combust. Inst. 32 (2009) 1269-1276) has investigated morpholine (C4H9NO, 1-oxa-4-aza-cyclohexane) as a model oxygen- and nitrogen-containing biofuel, and species identification was presented for a slightly fuel-rich Φ=1.3 (C/O=0.41) laminar premixed morpholine-oxygen-argon flame at 40mbar. To attempt a more detailed insight into the flame structure and combustion mechanism, the present contribution has now combined photoionization (PI) and electron ionization (EI) molecular-beam mass spectrometry (MBMS) to determine absolute mole-fraction profiles of numerous major and intermediate species with up to 6 heavy atoms. In general, PI-MBMS and EI-MBMS results were found in good agreement. The results reveal formation of a number of intermediates that may contribute to harmful emissions, including aldehydes and several nitrogen-containing compounds in percent-level concentrations. Both NH3 and HCN pathways are seen to contribute to NO formation.To identify reaction pathways for this detailed experimental analysis, development of a flame model was started, considering a combustion mechanism for cyclohexane and analogous fuel-breakdown reactions for morpholine by addition of necessary thermodynamic, transport and kinetic parameters. The present model captures relevant features of the morpholine flame quite well, including HCN, N2, and NO, and it can serve as a nucleus for further development of detailed combustion models for fuel-nitrogen conversion from model biofuel compounds. © 2011 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - Numerical simulation of the vaporization of multi-component liquid fuels under high-pressure conditions is conducted in this study. A high-pressure drop vaporization model is developed by considering the high-pressure phase equilibrium which equates the fugacity of each component in both liquid and vapor phases. Peng-Robinson equation of state is used for the calculation of fugacity. To model the vaporization of diesel fuel under high-pressure conditions, continuous thermodynamics based on a gamma distribution is coupled with phase equilibrium by correlating the parameters of the equation of state with the molecular weights of the continuous components. The high-pressure vaporization model is validated using the experimental data of n-heptane drops under different ambient pressures and temperatures. Good levels of agreement are obtained in drop size history. Predicted results of the vaporization of diesel fuel drops show that increasing ambient pressure leads to a shorter drop lifetime under high temperature conditions (e.g., 900. K). On the other hand, at a slightly lower temperature of 700. K, the drop lifetime increases as the ambient pressure increases. It is found that the net affects of high ambient pressure on drop vaporization are determined by two competing factors, namely, reduced mass transfer number and reduced enthalpy of vaporization. The model was further applied to biodiesel and its blends with diesel fuel. The fuel blend is modeled based on a method that continuous thermodynamics is used to model diesel fuel and biodiesel is modeled as a mixture of its five representative components. Results of single drop vaporization history show that drop lifetime increases as the volume fraction of biodiesel in the fuel blend increases. This phenomenon reveals the low vaporization rate of biodiesel that has a higher critical temperature than diesel fuel. It is also observed that the volume fraction of biodiesel in the fuel blend increases during vaporization and its vapor concentrates near the tip of the liquid spray while diesel fuel vapor is around the entire liquid spray. © 2011 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa L.) was introduced for the first time in Chile in 2008 as a potential feedstock for biodiesel and also as high omega-3-containing seed oil for the salmon feed industry. The objective of this study was to determine the optimum seeding date to maximize camelina seed yield in South Central Chile. The experiment was conducted under dryland conditions in Chillán, El Carmen, Los Angeles, Gorbea, and Osorno in 2008 and in Chillán and Los Angeles in 2009. The experimental design was a RCB with a split-plot arrangement with four replicates, where the main plot was the seeding date (five dates) and the sub-plot the spring type cultivars (Gold of Pleasure, Suneson, and Blaine Creek). Seeding dates at each environment were targeted to 30 April, 15 May, 30 May, 30 June, and 30 July of 2008 and 2009. The combined analysis of variance indicated no cultivar main effect or interactions with cultivar. The date by environment interaction was significant for seed yield. There were no seed yield differences among seeding dates in Chillán and El Carmen. The first three seeding dates were the highest yielding in Los Angeles and Osorno, and only the first seeding date was significantly higher in seed yield in Gorbea. Highest seed yield at Los Angeles, Gorbea, and Osorno were 1995, 1310, and 2314kgha-1. Seed oil content was not different among seeding dates in Chillán and El Carmen. Highest seed oil content occurred at Osorno and Gorbea on the first three seeding dates and ranged from 420 to 457gkg-1. Spring camelina cultivars are well adapted to South Central Chile as a winter annual crop when seeded before 15 May except in Osorno when seeded before 30 May. No disease or insectpests were observed except for Aster Yellow infestation at Chillán and Los Angeles. Camelina has great potential as an oilseed for biodiesel and as a source of omega-3 for the pharmaceutical industry but markets for it need to be developed locally for camelina to become an option for growers. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The search for alternative triglyceride sources for biodiesel production is a widely discussed issue in Brazil because of the initiation of the Brazilian biofuel program. The viability of biodiesel production from the oil of Raphia taedigera Mart., commonly known as jupati, is studied in this work. This paper presents the obtention and characterization of biodiesel from jupati using an ethylic route with a methane sulfonic acid reaction catalyst. The alcohol:oil molar ratio was 9:1, and the catalyst concentration was 2% of the oil mass. The yield of the process was 92% by mass, and the oil conversion into jupati ethylic biodiesel was 99.6%. The physical and chemical parameters of jupati ethylic biodiesel were within the limits set by the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Potential improvement on exhaust emissions, biodegradability and the possibility to reduce dependence on fossil fuel resources has led to an increasing interest on the use of biofuels for transport application. In this work, the analysis of the spray behaviour of first and second generation biodiesel in a Euro 5, common rail transparent diesel engine has been performed. GTL, SME and RME fuels have been used in blends at 100% and 50% in volume; while reference fuel consisted of commercial diesel. Two engine operating conditions of the NEDC have been selected: 1500 rpm at 2 bar of brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) and 2000 rpm at 5 bar BMEP. The injection process has been accurately studied, and the influence of the combustion process on the spray behaviour has been taken into account. Typical jets parameters such as penetration and cone angles have been detected and a comparison with theoretical models of Hiroyasu and Siebers has been performed. A new correlation for the forecasting of the jet penetration has been obtained starting from Hiroyasu equations. An image-based method has been applied for the identification of the phenomena that control the spray behaviour during its evolution in the combustion chamber. First generation biodiesels, pure and blends, show longer penetration with respect to the reference fuel at both the engine speed analysed. Moreover, they penetrate for a longer time in the combustion chamber, because of the longer energizing time set, so impingement phenomena can be observed. On the other hand, the second generation biodiesels penetrate less than reference one, due to its lower density, but also because the combustion of the pilot injection causes an increase of pressure that obstructs the penetration in the combustion chamber. Finally, a good agreement between the breakup times computed by means of the Hiroyasu and Siebers correlations and the ones from the experimental data has been found. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Antioxidants are an alternative to prevent or retard biofuel degradation. This study assessed the oxidative stability of biodiesel B100, made from soybeans, in the presence of three synthetic antioxidants, butylhydroxyanisole (BHA), terbutylhydroquinone (TBHQ) and butylhydroxytoluene (BHT), pure or in mixture, from the simplex-centroid design. Results revealed that when the three oxidants were employed separately, as well as the ternary mixture, they presented induction period over 6 h, at 110 °C, being in accordance with specifications of the norm EN1412. Besides that, depending on the temperature, the BHA, TBHQ and BHT oxidants act in different ways, highlighting that BHA and TBHQ presented higher efficiency in the prevention of the oxidative process of the biofuel B100. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Indicators are needed to assess environmental sustainability of bioenergy systems. Effective indicators will help in the quantification of benefits and costs of bioenergy options and resource uses. We identify 19 measurable indicators for soil quality, water quality and quantity, greenhouse gases, biodiversity, air quality, and productivity, building on existing knowledge and on national and international programs that are seeking ways to assess sustainable bioenergy. Together, this suite of indicators is hypothesized to reflect major environmental effects of diverse feedstocks, management practices, and post-production processes. The importance of each indicator is identified. Future research relating to this indicator suite is discussed, including field testing, target establishment, and application to particular bioenergy systems. Coupled with such efforts, we envision that this indicator suite can serve as a basis for the practical evaluation of environmental sustainability in a variety of bioenergy systems. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Semi-volatile and reactive primary organic aerosols are modeled on a global scale using the GISS GCM II' "unified" climate model. We employ the volatility basis set framework to simulate emissions, chemical reactions and phase partitioning of primary and secondary organic aerosol (POA and SOA). The model also incorporates the emissions and reactions of intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) as a source of organic aerosol (OA), one that has been missing in most prior work. Model predictions are evaluated against a broad set of observational constraints including mass concentrations, degree of oxygenation, volatility and isotopic composition. A traditional model that treats POA as non-volatile and non-reactive is also compared to the same set of observations to highlight the progress made in this effort. The revised model predicts a global dominance of SOA and brings the POA/SOA split into better agreement with ambient measurements. This change is due to traditionally defined POA evaporating and the evaporated vapors oxidizing to form non-traditional SOA. IVOCs (traditionally not included in chemical transport models) oxidize to form condensable products that account for a third of total OA, suggesting that global models have been missing a large source of OA. Predictions of the revised model for the SOA fraction at 17 different locations compared much better to observations than predictions from the traditional model. Model-predicted volatility is compared with thermodenuder data collected at three different different field campaigns: FAME-2008, MILAGRO-2006 and SOAR-2005. The revised model predicts the OA volatility much more closely than the traditional model. When compared against monthly averaged OA mass concentrations measured by the IMPROVE network, predictions of the revised model lie within a factor of two in summer and mostly within a factor of five during winter. A sensitivity analysis indicates that the winter comparison can be improved either by increasing POA emissions or lowering the volatility of those emissions. Model predictions of the isotopic composition of OA are compared against those computed via a radiocarbon isotope analysis of field samples. The contemporary fraction, on average, is slightly under-predicted (20 %) during the summer months but is a factor of two lower during the winter months. We hypothesize that the large wintertime under-prediction of surface OA mass concentrations and the contemporary fraction is due to an under-representation of biofuel (particularly, residential wood burning) emissions in the emissions inventory. Overall, the model evaluation highlights the importance of treating POA as semi-volatile and reactive in order to predict accurately the sources, composition and properties of ambient OA. © 2011 Author(s).

AB  - Performance of a single-cylinder, water-cooled, direct-injection diesel engine on dual-fuel operation with Jatropha oil (JO) as pilot fuel and orange oil as primary fuel was evaluated. Constant load test at different power outputs was conducted at the rated speed of 1500 r/min with varying orange oil quantities. The loads were fixed as 20 per cent, 40 per cent, 60 per cent, 80 per cent, and 100 per cent. In dual-fuel operation with orange oil induction, the thermal efficiency of JO was increased mainly at high power outputs. Maximum thermal efficiency with JO was found as 29 per cent at 31 per cent of orange oil induction at 100 per cent load. Smoke was reduced significantly with all orange oil induction rates at all power outputs in dual-fuel operation with JO. It was reduced from 4.4 to 3.3 BSU (Bosch Smoke Units) with JO at the maximum efficiency point at 100 per cent load. HC emissions were increased further at all power outputs in the dual-fuel mode with all rates of orange oil induction. Dual-fuel operation increased the ignition delay of JO. However, peak pressure and energy release rates were improved in the dual-fuel operation with orange oil induction. In general, dual-fuel operation with orange oil as inducted fuel with JO as pilot fuel showed inferior performance and emissions at part loads. It is concluded that the JO as pilots fuel and orange oil as the inducted fuel could be used in diesel engines with reduced smoke levels and improved thermal efficiencies with no major detoriation in performance. © 2011 Authors.

AB  - The emergence of biofuel as a renewable energy source offers opportunities for climate change mitigation and greater energy security for many countries. At the same time, biofuel represents the possibility of substitution between energy and food. For developing countries like India, which imports over 75% of its crude oil, fossil fuels pose two risks-global warming pollution and negative economic impacts of oil price hikes. This paper examines India's options for managing energy price risk in three ways: biofuel development, energy effciency promotion, and food productivity improvements. The overall results suggest that biodiesel shows promise as a transport fuel substitute that can be produced in ways that fully utilize marginal agricultural resources and hence promote rural livelihoods. First-generation bioethanol, by contrast, appears to have a limited ability to offset the impacts of oil price hikes. Combining the biodiesel expansion policy with energy effciency improvements and food productivity increases proved to be a more effective strategy to enhance both energy and food security, help mitigate climate change, and cushion the economy against oil price shocks. © 2011 by Asian Development Bank.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of the green microalga Chlorella saccharophila as a source of oil for biodiesel production. We evaluated for the firsttime, the effect of salinity and/or nitrogen depletion (ND) on cell growth, lipid accumulation and lipid profile in this microalga. The fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) identifiedfor C. saccharophila in this study consisted of C-16:0, C-18:0, C-18:1 cis, and C-18:1 trans. Among these, C-18:1 (indicator of biodiesel quality) was the main FAME found, representing approximately 76 and 80% of total FAME under normal and ND growing conditions, respectively. Under a normal growing condition this microalga showed 154.63 mg l-1 d-1, 63.33 mg l-1 d-1, and 103.73 mg l-1 of biomass productivity, lipid productivity, andFAME yield, respectively. The higher biomass productivity (159.58 mg l-1 d-1), lipid productivity(99.33 mg l-1 d-1), and FAME yield (315.53 mg l-1) were obtained under the ND treatment. In comparison to other related studies, our results suggest that C. saccharophila can be considered as a suitable source of oil for biodiesel production. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

AB  - India, is the fifth largest and one of the fastest growing petroleum consumers in the world, needing to import over 72% of its requirement of crude oil and petroleum products. Price volatility and high crude oil prices has created an opportunity for integration of biofuels in the energy portfolio which may help to counter the security threat of energy supply to India with proper policy interventions. But there are certain issues that plague the growth of Indian biofuel sector. This paper discusses National Biofuel Policy with particular reference to feedstock supply, processing, marketing and distribution of biofuels, financing, fiscal incentives and research and development. The paper concludes that the availability of feedstock along with proper pricing of feedstock especially in case of nonedible oilseed is critical. Contract farming as well as wasteland usage can be a solution, but land misappropriation needs to be guarded. The minimum purchase price of the biofuels should be sufficient to cover the cost of production. Combination of support for the research and development in biofuels, availability of funding and providing appropriate incentives for biofuels producers is likely to facilitate the expansion of the sector.

AB  - A zero dimensional model has been used to investigate the combustion performance of a single cylinder direct injection diesel engine fueled by biofuels with options like supercharging and exhaust gas recirculation. The numerical simulation was performed at constant speed. The indicated pressure, temperature diagrams are plotted and compared for different fuels. The emissions of soot and nitrous oxide are computed with phenomenological models. The experimental work was also carried out with biodiesel (palm stearin methyl ester) diesel blends, ethanol diesel blends to validate simulation results with experimental results, and observed that the present model is successful in predicting the engine performance with biofuels.

AB  - With the strong emergence of the bioeconomy in the US, there is growing interest in the ability of biomass production systems to meet the legislated demand for cellulosic biofuels. While corn grain will continue to comprise the primary feedstock for biofuel in the Cornbelt, it is unlikely that a single biomass feedstock will suit all the needs of an evolving bioenergy market; thus, the potential contribution of woody biomass should be considered. To meet informational needs, we conducted structured interviews with state-employed professional foresters along the Mississippi River corridor in five Corn Belt states (Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin). Foresters were queried regarding the types of woody materials available, ecological considerations, the likely silvicultural systems that might support a biomass market, and their experiences with landowner management decisions as related to removing currently low-value material. Results suggest noteworthy interest in expanded woody biomass market systems within our study area. Furthermore, substantial opportunities exist to capture trimmings, small-diameter, and low-quality material in conjunction with on-going intermediate stand treatments or sawtimber harvests that are common in the region; capturing social and economic value while potentially contributing to long-term forest health. Costs for removing this material are estimated to range between $185-494/ha ($75-200/ac) depending on site conditions and accessibility. Such a wide range in costs (and therefore break-even biomass prices) suggests that some properties throughout the study region may be priced out of the market, at least in the initial stages of market development. Markets are distinctly lacking at present, however, and our interviewees suggested that market-pull will be required to organize a well-rounded infrastructure to harvest, process, store, and transport woody materials. This and future studies will be significant because they inform the enhancement of agricultural prosperity on small-to-medium farms and contribute to regional and national energy goals in ways that ideally improve, rather than diminish, the ecosystem services provided by woodlands in rowcrop-dominated landscapes. © 2010 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.

AB  - This paper describes the association of two bioreactors: one photoautotrophic and the other heterotrophic, connected by the gas phase and allowing an exchange of O 2 and CO 2 gases between them, benefiting from a symbiotic effect. The association of two bioreactors was proposed with the aim of improving the microalgae oil productivity for biodiesel production. The outlet gas flow from the autotrophic (O 2 enriched) bioreactor was used as the inlet gas flow for the heterotrophic bioreactor. In parallel, the outlet gas flow from another heterotrophic (CO 2 enriched) bioreactor was used as the inlet gas flow for the autotrophic bioreactor. Aside from using the air supplied from the auto- and hetero-trophic bioreactors as controls, one mixotrophic bioreactor was also studied and used as a model, for its claimed advantage of CO 2 and organic carbon being simultaneously assimilated. The microalga Chlorella protothecoides was chosen as a model due to its ability to grow under different nutritional modes (auto, hetero, and mixotrophic), and its ability to attain a high biomass productivity and lipid content, suitable for biodiesel production. The comparison between heterotrophic, autotrophic, and mixotrophic Chlorella protothecoides growth for lipid production revealed that heterotrophic growth achieved the highest biomass productivity and lipid content (&gt;22%), and furthermore showed that these lipids had the most suitable fatty acid profile in order to produce high quality biodiesel. Both associations showed a higher biomass productivity (10-20%), when comparing the two separately operated bioreactors (controls) which occurred on the fourth day. A more remarkable result would have been seen if in actuality the two bioreactors had been inter-connected in a closed loop. The biomass productivity gain would have been 30% and the lipid productivity gain would have been 100%, as seen by comparing the productivities of the symbiotic assemblage with the sum of the two bioreactors operating separately (controls). These results show an advantage of the symbiotic bioreactors association towards a cost-effective microalgal biodiesel production. © 2010 Society for Industrial Microbiology.

AB  - This study presents extraction of oil by mechanical expeller and solvent extraction technique from jatropha and karanja seeds. Physico-chemical properties of extracted oil, jatropha oil methyl ester (JOME) and karanja oil methyl ester (KOME) were tested for their suitability in diesel engine. Mechanical extraction efficiency with expeller developed by IIT Delhi was found to be better (jatropha, 87%; karanja, 86%) as compared to traditional expeller (67-69%). Induction periods (oxidation stability) at 110°C were found to be: JOME, 1.76; and KOME, 2.24 h. Calorific value of JOME (38.65 MJ/kg) and KOME (40.75 MJ/kg) was comparatively lower to base diesel (44.50 MJ/kg). Comparative performance (brake thermal efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption) and emission (CO, THC, NO x and smoke opacity) characteristics were tested in 4.4 kW, single cylinder, compression ignition engine with constant speed (1500 rpm).

AB  - This study presents performance of a 5 kW diesel generator (DG) set using 100% oil of karanj (Pongamia pinnata). Tests were carried out by preheating karanj oil at 50-200°C to determine on-load performance of DG set. Significant improvement was observed in energy conversion (50-80%) under different load conditions, leading to lower pollution level of exhaust. This system can create local employment, save foreign exchange and generate electricity at a lower price. It can promote local electricity generation without costly transmission-distribution systems.

AB  - The EU target to replace 10 percent of transport fuels by renewables by 2020 requires additional water. This study calculates water footprints (WFs) of transport modes using first generation bio-ethanol, biodiesel or bio-electricity and of European transport if 10 percent of transport fuels is bio-ethanol. Results are compared with similar goals for other regions. It is more efficient to use bio-electricity and bio-ethanol than biodiesel. Transport by train or car using bio-electricity (8-19 and 11-13 litres per passenger km) is more water efficient than transport by car (36-212) or airplane (65-136) using bio-ethanol. For cars, there is a factor of ten between water-efficient cars using bio-ethanol and water-inefficient cars using biodiesel. Biofuel-based freight transport is most water-efficient by ship or train; airplanes are least efficient. Based on first generation biofuels, the EU goal for renewable transport energy results in a WF of 62 Gm 3 per year, 10 percent of the current WF. Differences in transport energy use and in production systems result in a broad range of annual transport-related WFs: from 60 m 3 per capita in Bulgaria to 500 m 3 in Finland. If similar targets are applied in other regions, the additional WF of North America and Australia will be 52 percent of the present regions WFs. The global WF for biofuel-based transport in this scenario will be 9 percent of the current global WF. Trends towards increased biofuel application enhance the competition for freshwater resources. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Biodiesel fuels, made from renewable resources, have emerged as viable alternatives to conventional diesel fuel, but their impact on emissions is not fully understood. This study examines elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emissions from cottonseed oil biodiesel (CSO-B100). Relative to normal diesel fuel, CSO-B100 reduced EC emissions by 64% (±16%). The bulk of EC emitted from CSO-B100 was in the fine particle mode (&lt;1.4 μm), which is similar to normal diesel. OC was found in all size ranges, whereas emissions of OC 1.4-2.5 were proportionately higher in OC 2.5 from CSO-B100 than from diesel. The CSO-B100 emission factors derived from this study are significantly lower, even without aftertreatment, than the China-4 emission standards established in Beijing and Euro-IV diesel engine standards. The toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) for CSO-B100 was half the TEFs of diesel, which suggests that PAHs emitted from CSO-B100 may be less toxic. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A potential application of KOH/bentonite as a catalyst for biodiesel production was studied. A series of KOH/bentonite catalysts was prepared by impregnation of bentonite from Pacitan with potassium hydroxide. The ratios between KOH and bentonite were 1:20, 1:10, 1:5, 1:4, 1:3, and 1:2. The characterization of KOH/bentonite and natural bentonite was conducted by nitrogen adsorption and XRD analysis. The effects of various reaction variables on the yield of biodiesel were investigated. The highest yield of biodiesel over KOH/bentonite catalyst was 90.70 ± 2.47%. It was obtained at KOH/bentonite 1:4, reaction time of 3. h, 3% catalyst, methanol to oil ratio of 6, and the reaction temperature at 60 °C. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nannochloropsis oculata CCMP 525, Dunaliella salina FACHB 435, and Chlorella sorokiniana CCTCC M209220 were compared in mixotrophic and photoautotrophic cultures in terms of growth rate, protein, and lipid content. Growth improved in glucose, and the biomass productivities of N. oculata, D. salina, and C. sorokiniana were found to be 1.4-, 2.2- and 4.2-fold that observed photoautotrophically. However, biomass and lipid production decreased at the highest glucose concentrations. Meanwhile, the content of protein and lipid were significantly augmented for mixotrophic conditions at least for some species. C. sorokiniana was found to be well suited for lipid production based on its high biomass production rate and lipid content reaching 51% during mixotrophy. Expression levels of accD (heteromeric acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta subunit), acc1 (homomeric acetyl-CoA carboxylase), rbcL (ribulose 1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit) genes in C. sorokiniana were studied by real-time PCR. Increased expression levels of accD reflect the increased lipid content in stationary phase of mixotrophic growth, but expression of the acc1 gene remains low, suggesting that this gene may not be critical to lipid accumulation. Additionally, reduction of expression of the rbcL gene during mixotrophy indicated that utilization of glucose was found to reduce the role of this gene and photosynthesis. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The biofuel ethanol, a viable and cost-effective gasoline substitute, is being blended at increasingly higher concentrations in gasoline, heightening the need to investigate its effects on current automotive engine lubricants in terms of fuel economy and engine durability. The friction at the piston ring/cylinder wall interface with a fully formulated gasoline engine lubricant contaminated with ethanol and water was investigated using a Plint TE77 reciprocating tribometer and reported in a previous paper by the authors. This research takes this one stage further by studying the friction in the same tribometer configuration when lubricated with the separated phases the same contaminated lubricant forms when left undisturbed, as would happen when a vehicle is parked or garaged. The lubricant mixture separated into two distinct phases, an oil phase and a water and ethanol based 'white sludge' phase, both phases characterised by FTIR spectroscopy and viscosity. Significant reductions in friction were obtained when the piston ring-cylinder wall interface was lubricated with the separated phases compared to the formulated reference lubricant. When lubricated with the separated oil phase, temperature was shown to be the dominant contributor to the frictional response. When lubricated with the separated sludge phase, ethanol independently contributed to the frictional response whilst the interactions between ethanol and temperature, water and temperature and water and speed were also important. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The use of straight vegetable oil (SVO) as biofuel has been recognized as a valid substitute of diesel fuel in the agricultural sector under specific circumstances. Its direct use reduces most of the chemical processes involved when converting it into biodiesel, thus lowering harmful emissions. This study presents the economic analysis of a self-supply farming model that uses rapeseed as its fuel base. This model addresses agricultural environmental concerns and can even minimize dependence on the fluctuating costs of diesel fuel. The use of SVO in agriculture can help reduce farmers' vulnerability to fossil fuel prices. The economic evaluation of the model proposed in this study shows clear economic benefits of introducing rapeseed to the traditional crop rotation of wheat and barley. The key factors analyzed in this model are diesel fuel price, diesel fuel grants and crop aids. The current situation in Spain favors the use of diesel fuel in agriculture rather than rapeseed SVO due to an 8% profit difference. However, results show that changes in key factors slightly affect the profit margin, calculating a difference of only 3.7% for particular factor combinations. Combined environmental-friendly agriculture supporting policies are necessary to cover this slight profit difference to promote this biofuel. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Variation in oil content and fatty acid profiles of a native Australian biodiesel feedstock species Calophyllum inophyllum were studied in two different fruiting periods (winter 2008 and autumn 2009) and in three different northern Queensland provenances (Cardwell, Townsville, Yeppoon). Oils were extracted by standard n-hexane double extraction and fatty acid profiles were determined by ISO 5508 and 5509 methods using gas chromatography. C. inophyllum provenances have demonstrated a significant periodic variation in oil content and fatty acid profile, and as a result alter the quality of fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel). FAP of majority of kernel oil sources were found to vary significantly (P < 0.05) with seasonal variation in temperature and longterm average rainfall. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Al(HSO4)3 heterogeneous acid catalyst was prepared by the sulfonation of anhydrous AlCl3. This catalyst was employed to catalyze transesterification reaction to synthesis methyl ester when a mixed waste vegetable oil was used as feedstock. The physical and chemical properties of aluminum hydrogen sulphate catalyst were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements, energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX) analysis and titration method. The maximum conversion of triglyceride was achieved as 81wt.% with 50min reaction time at 220°C, 16:1molar ratio of methanol to oil and 0.5wt.% of catalyst. The high catalytic activity and stability of this catalyst was related to its high acid site density (-OH, Brönsted acid sites), hydrophobicity that prevented the hydration of -OH group, hydrophilic functional groups (-SO3H) that gave improved accessibility of methanol to the triglyceride. The fuel properties of methyl ester were analyzed. The fuel properties were found to be observed within the limits of ASTM D6751. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Despite considerable interest in butanol as a potential biofuel candidate, its ignition behaviour at elevated pressures still remains largely unexplored. The present study investigates the oxidation of n-butanol in air at pressures near 80. bar. Ignition delays were determined experimentally in the temperature range of 795-1200. K between 61 and 92. bar. The time of ignition was determined by recording pressure and CH-emission time histories throughout the course of the experiments. The results display the first evidence of the influence of negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behaviour which was not observed in earlier ignition studies. The high-pressure measurements show that NTC behaviour is enhanced as pressures are increased. The experimental results were modelled using an improved chemical kinetic mechanism which includes a simplified sub-mechanism for butyl-peroxy formation and isomerisation reactions currently incompletely accounted for in n-butanol kinetic models. The detailed mechanism validated with the high-pressure ignition results for realistic engine in-cylinder conditions can have significant impact on future advanced low-temperature combustion engines. © 2011 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - The effect of fatty acids chain length (LC) and its interaction with unsaturation degree (UD) on important biodiesel quality parameters was studied. Low calorific value, kinematic viscosity, flash point, cetane number and cold filter plugging point of biodiesel blends covering a wide range of fatty acids were analyzed. Analytical results were processed with statistical regression to obtain a prediction model for each property, combining LC and UD. Due to the antagonistic effects of the chemical composition over quality properties, the Derringer desirability function was proposed to allow the most suitable fatty acid composition. This target was achieved considering an average of 1.26 double bounds and 17 carbon atoms. A set of combinations of LC and UD values that provides a biodiesel that fits the European standard EN 14214 was proposed. It was found that a reduction of FAME LC allows a lower UD while keeping biodiesel specifications under the standard limits. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to produce biodiesel from mixtures of cooking oil and provide a possible environmental solution for the region of Campinas (state of São Paulo, Brazil) based on the theory of environmental cost accounting (ECA). Cooking oil collected from homes in Campinas was mixed with ethanol at a ratio of 7:1 and transesterified at 60 °C for one hour for the obtainment of biodiesel using NaOH as a catalyst. The results of the physicochemical analyses demonstrated that the biodiesel possessed characteristics close to those required by Brazilian standards. A recent survey carried out in the city of Campinas revealed that residents are not concerned with the increased of environmental impact and ecological costs in the region caused by the disposal of used cooking oil, which is discarded in sewers and soil. Urgent action is recommended, beginning with raising awareness among the population and the implementation of a policy to determine the storage, periodic collection and use of cooking oil for the production of biodiesel. This fuel could be used for buses, trucks and machines or sold to fuel distributors, offering a savings of US$ 0.8 to 4.5 millions. Campinas could then gain environmental credits and become a sustainable city. Moreover, used cooking oil constitutes low-cost biodiesel with no consumption of raw materials and will reduce worldwide criticism directed at Brazil regarding the use of oleaginous plants for biodiesel production. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The performance of Rh, Ru, Pt, and Pd on modified commercial zirconia support (m-ZrO2) was compared to a benchmark Ni/m-ZrO2 catalyst in the presence of H2S in the clean-up of gasification gas from tar, methane, and ammonia. The aim was to produce ultra clean gas applicable for liquid biofuel production. In general, the activity towards the decomposition decreased in the order of aromatic hydrocarbons, ethylene &gt; methane &gt; ammonia. Hydrocarbon decomposition on m-ZrO2 supported Rh, Ni, and Ru catalysts mainly occurred at 800-900 °C through reforming and/or dealkylation reactions. Aromatic hydrocarbon decomposition reactions proceeded on Pt/m-ZrO2 and Pd/m-ZrO2 via oxidation reactions at temperatures of 600-800 °C, while at 900 °C, the reforming and/or dealkylation reactions were dominating also on Pt/m-ZrO2 and Pd/m-ZrO2 catalysts. During longer test runs of ten hours at 800 °C, the activity of the Rh/m-ZrO2 catalyst declined in the presence of 100 ppm H2S due to the sulfur poisoning effects, coke formation, and the particle size growth. Although the performance of Rh/m-ZrO2 declined, it still remained better than Ni/m-ZrO 2 both towards naphthalene and total aromatic hydrocarbon, while only Ni/m-ZrO2 and Ru/m-ZrO2 decomposed ammonia in the presence of sulfur. Nevertheless, the most promising catalyst for clean gas production was Rh/m-ZrO2. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of MgO impregnated with KOH as heterogeneous catalysts for the transesterification of mutton fat with methanol has been evaluated. The mutton fat (fat) with methanol (1:22 M ratio) at 65 °C showed &gt; 98% conversion to biodiesel with 4 wt% of MgO-KOH-20. 11MgO-KOH-X (X = wt% of KOH impregnation over MgO). (MgO impregnated with 20 wt% of KOH) in 20 min. The reaction conditions optimized were; the amount of KOH impregnation (5-20 wt%), the amount of catalyst (1.5-4 wt%, catalyst/fat), the reaction temperature (45-65 °C), fat to methanol molar ratio (1:11-1:22) and the effect of addition of water/oleic acid/palmitic acid (upto 1 wt%). Although, transesterification of fresh fat (moisture content 0.02 wt% and free fatty acids 0.002 wt%) with methanol in the presence of KOH (homogenous catalyst) resulted in the complete conversion to biodiesel, but in the presence of additional 1 wt% of either free fatty acid or moisture content, formation of soap was observed. The MgO-KOH-20 catalyst was found to tolerate additional 1 wt% of either the moisture or FFAs in the fat. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel from non-grain feedstock has been considered as one of the proper substitutes for fossil fuels associated with a series of activities emerging in China in order to meet the resource shortage and develop the energy crops. This paper presents an ecological accounting framework based on embodied energy, emergy, and CO2 emission for the whole production chain of biodiesel made from Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) oil. The energy and materials invested in and CO2 emission from the whole process, including cropping, transportation, extraction, and production, are accounted and calculated. Also, EmCO2, the ratio of real CO2 released to the emergy-based sustainability indicator per joule biodiesel, is proposed in this paper to present a new goal function for low-carbon system optimization. Finally, the results are compared with those of the bioethanol (wheat) production in Henan Province, China, and bioethanol (corn) production in Italy in view of the indices of embodied energy, emergy and CO2 emissions and EmCO2. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Problem statement: The aim of this research was to investigate the effect of using Prickly poppy methyl ester as a fuel blend on Diesel engine (CI engine) performance and exhaust emission. Approach: Short-term engine performance tests were conducted to evaluate and compare the use of various diesel fuel supplements at blend rations of 60/40, 70/30, 80/20, 90/10, in a standard, fully instrumented, four stroke, Direct Injection (DI), Kirlosker comet Diesel engine located at the authors' laboratory. The prickly poppy oil with high free fatty acid is not used as edible oil, it can be considered as a potential source of non edible oil for utilization as a feed stock vegetable oil for bio diesel production. The prickly poppy oil was subjected to esterification and transesterification processes and the Prickly Poppy Methyl Ester (PPME) obtained was tested as supplement. Results: The test showed that PPME blends with diesel could be conveniently used as a diesel substitute in a diesel engine. The test further showed increase in break thermal efficiency, brake power and reduction of specific fuel consumption for PPME and its blends with diesel generally, but the most significant conclusion from the study is that the 80 % Diesel / 20% PPME blend produced maximum values of the brake power, brake thermal efficiency and minimum values of the specific fuel consumption and also yielded minimum values of NOx, CO and HC emission. Conclusion: Using Prickly Poppy Methyl Ester (PPME) as a bio fuel blend with Diesel shows an improvement in performance and significant reduction in exhaust emission for the generation of cleaner environment. © 2010 Science Publications.

AB  - Background: Energy efficiency analysis for different biomass-utilization scenarios would help make more informed decisions for developing future biomass-based transportation systems. Diverse biofuels produced from biomass include cellulosic ethanol, butanol, fatty acid ethyl esters, methane, hydrogen, methanol, dimethyether, Fischer-Tropsch diesel, and bioelectricity; the respective powertrain systems include internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles based on gasoline or diesel ICEs, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, sugar fuel cell vehicles (SFCV), and battery electric vehicles (BEV). Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a simple, straightforward, and transparent biomass-to-wheel (BTW) analysis including three separate conversion elements - biomass-to-fuel conversion, fuel transport and distribution, and respective powertrain systems. BTW efficiency is a ratio of the kinetic energy of an automobile's wheels to the chemical energy of delivered biomass just before entering biorefineries. Up to 13 scenarios were analyzed and compared to a base line case - corn ethanol/ICE. This analysis suggests that BEV, whose electricity is generated from stationary fuel cells, and SFCV, based on a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle with an on-board sugar-to-hydrogen bioreformer, would have the highest BTW efficiencies, nearly four times that of ethanol-ICE. Significance: In the long term, a small fraction of the annual US biomass (e.g., 7.1%, or 700 million tons of biomass) would be sufficient to meet 100% of light-duty passenger vehicle fuel needs (i.e., 150 billion gallons of gasoline/ethanol per year), through up to four-fold enhanced BTW efficiencies by using SFCV or BEV. SFCV would have several advantages over BEV: much higher energy storage densities, faster refilling rates, better safety, and less environmental burdens. © 2011 Huang, Zhang.

AB  - Systems with CO2 capture and storage (CCS) that coproduce transportation fuels and electricity from coal plus biomass can address simultaneously challenges of climate change from fossil energy and dependence on imported oil. Under a strong carbon policy, such systems can provide competitively clean low-carbon energy from secure domestic feedstocks by exploiting the negative emissions benefit of underground storage of biomass-derived CO2, the low cost of coal, the scale economies of coal energy conversion, the inherently low cost of CO2 capture, the thermodynamic advantages of coproduction, and expected high oil prices. Such systems require much less biomass to make low-carbon fuels than do biofuels processes. The economics are especially attractive when these coproduction systems are deployed as alternatives to CCS for stand-alone fossil fuel power plants. If CCS proves to be viable as a major carbon mitigation option, the main obstacles to deployment of coproduction systems as power generators would be institutional. © Copyright 2011 by Annual Reviews.

AB  - Melamine (2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-triazine) is a nitrogen-rich chemical implicated in the pet and human food recalls and in the global food safety scares involving milk products. Due to the serious health concerns associated with melamine consumption and the extensive scope of affected products, rapid and sensitive methods to detect melamine's presence are essential. We propose the use of spectroscopy data-produced by near-infrared (near-IR/NIR) and mid-infrared (mid-IR/MIR) spectroscopies, in particular - for melamine detection in complex dairy matrixes. None of the up-to-date reported IR-based methods for melamine detection has unambiguously shown its wide applicability to different dairy products as well as limit of detection (LOD) below 1 ppm on independent sample set. It was found that infrared spectroscopy is an effective tool to detect melamine in dairy products, such as infant formula, milk powder, or liquid milk. ALOD below 1 ppm (0.76 ± 0.11 ppm) can be reached if a correct spectrum preprocessing (pretreatment) technique and a correct multivariate (MDA) algorithm - partial least squares regression (PLS), polynomial PLS (Poly-PLS), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), or least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) - are used for spectrum analysis. The relationship between MIR/NIR spectrum of milk products and melamine content is nonlinear. Thus, nonlinear regression methods are needed to correctly predict the triazine-derivative content of milk products. It can be concluded that mid- and near-infrared spectroscopy can be regarded as a quick, sensitive, robust, and low-cost method for liquid milk, infant formula, and milk powder analysis. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The contribution of agrobiomasses, as a source of energy, to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions was confirmed by several studies. Biomass from agriculture represents one of the larger and more diverse sources to exploit and in particular ethanol and diesel have the potential to be a sustainable replacement for fossil fuels, mainly for transport purposes. However, the cultivation of energy crops dedicated to the production of biofuels presents some potential problems, e.g., competitiveness with food crops, water needs, use of fertilizers, etc., and the economic, energy, and environmental convenience of such activity depends on accurate evaluations about the global efficiency of the production system. In this study, the processes related to the cultivation of energy crops were analyzed from an energy and water cost perspective. The crops studied, maize (Zea mais) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus), were identified for their different water requirements and cultivation management, which in turns induces different energy costs. A 50-year climatic series of meteorological data from 19 weather stations scattered in the Tuscany region was used to feed the crop model CropSyst for the simulation of crop production, water requirement, and cultivation techniques. Obtained results were analyzed to define the real costs of energy crop cultivation, depending on energy and water balances. In the energy crop cultivation, the only positive energy balance was obtained with the more efficient system of irrigation whereas all the other cases provided negative balances. Concerning water, the results demonstrated that more than 1.000 liters of water are required for producing 1 liter of bioethanol. As a consequence, the cultivation of energy crops in the reserved areas of the region will almost double the actual water requirement of the agricultural sector in Tuscany. © 2011 by the author(s).

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative to petroleum-based fuels derived from vegetable oils, animal fats, and used waste cooking oil including triglycerides. At present, the high cost of biofuels is the major obstacle to their commercialization. Biodiesel production costs are highly dependent on feedstock prices, with feedstock representing approximately 70% to 95% of the finished product cost. One major problem with biodiesel production is the availability of raw materials for the production. More than 95% of global biodiesel production is made from edible vegetable oils. However, extensive use of vegetable oils may cause other significant problems such as starvation in developing countries. © Sila Science.

AB  - Most of the biodiesel that is currently made uses soybean oil, methanol, and an alkaline catalyst. Biodiesel use has resulted in a significant rise in soybean prices. The use of soybeans as a potential biofuel source is cropland competition with food production. On the other hand, extensive use of vegetable oils in the biodiesel production may cause other significant problems such as starvation in developing countries.

AB  - Microalgae are unique photosynthetic organisms given that they accumulate storage lipids in substantial quantities and thrive in high salinity water. Algae cultivation is flexible on water quality. Many species of algae thrive in seawater, water from saline aquifers, or even wastewater from treatment plants. Photosynthesis, algae use solar energy to fix carbon dioxide (CO 2) into algal biomass, so the water used to cultivate algae must be enriched with CO 2. Microalgae can potentially be employed for the production of biofuels in an economically effective and environmentally sustainable manner. Microalgae have been investigated for the production of a number of different biofuels including biodiesel, bio-oil, bio-syngas, and bio-hydrogen. The production of these biofuels can be coupled with flue gas CO 2 mitigation, wastewater treatment, and the production of high-value chemicals. © Sila Science.

AB  - One of the primary functions of a lubricant is to preserve the cleanliness of a combustion engine's mechanical parts. The cleanliness of the mechanical parts is facilitated by the introduction of "detergency" and "dispersancy" additives to the engine oil. This last property, dispersancy, is the property that allows the oil to suspend and carry away "pollutants" of diverse sources, such as soot from combustion, metallic particles from wear, corrosion of mechanical parts, and insoluble products resulting from the aging of the oil, etc. Recently, with the arrival of new fuels (e.g., biodiesel, ethanol blends, etc.) we notice that the existing or traditional lubricants present an important variability in terms of durability and resistance to pollutants, such as the fuel or the biofuel. Our studies show that the dispersancy capacity of certain types of lubricants is significantly degraded by the presence of specific pollutants, and in particular fatty acid methyl esters of the biofuels, which have a significant impact. It is therefore important to quantify the degradation of the oil inservice (engines or transmission oils) and to monitor the evolution of the oil's dispersancy properties during use to be able to determine steps and intervals for maintenance. Additionally, for the development of new lubricants it is necessary to define a criterion of acceptance of the oil by its dispersancy capacity. This new method will define and quantify this criterion. The writers will present the results of these studies with particular emphasis on the impact of biofuels on the dispersancy capacity of both gasoline and diesel engine oils. They will describe a method of analysis using an automated instrument providing precise, objective measurement of this important parameter. This method will therefore be able to estimate the dispersancy capacity of lubricants, as well as the implication of various pollutants on this parameter. © 2011 by ASTM International.

AB  - The yeast Yarrowia lipolytica accumulates oils and is able to produce extracellular lipases when growing in different carbon sources including glycerol, the principal by-product of the biodiesel industry. In this study, biomass production of a novel mutant strain of Y. lipolytica was statistically optimized by Response Surface Methodology in media containing biodiesel-derived glycerol as main carbon source. This strain exhibited distinctive morphological and fatty acid profile characteristics, and showed an increased extracellular lipase activity. An organic source of nitrogen and the addition of 1.0 g/l olive oil were necessary for significant lipase production. Plackett-Burman and Central Composite Statistical Designs were employed for screening and optimization of fermentation in shaken flasks cultures, and the maximum values obtained were 16.1 g/l for biomass and 12.2 Units/ml for lipase, respectively. Optimized batch bioprocess was thereafter scaled in aerated bioreactors and the values reached for lipase specific activity after 95 % of the glycerol had been consumed, were three-fold higher than those obtained in shaken flasks cultures. A sustainable bioprocess to obtain biomass and extracellular lipase activity was attained by maximizing the use of the by-products of biodiesel industry.

AB  - Vegetable oils and animal fats are major components of food products and are used extensively for cooking. Recently, attention has been focused on their uses for making fuels for engines and heating. Vegetable oils and animal fats comprise mixtures of fatty acids in proportions that depend on the source materials. These fatty acids vary with respect to carbon chain length and degree of saturation. Fatty acid composition has been shown to have impacts on the properties of oils and fats and thus on both food and fuel quality. Some of these source materials also contain natural antioxidants that are beneficial for both food and fuel applications. The objectives of this article are to highlight the different requirements in the properties of vegetable oils and animal fats for health and for fuel, and to provide an assessment of the suitability of different materials as sources for food and/or fuel. © 2011 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - This paper presents the results of investigations carried out on a three-cylinder, fourstroke, and direct-injection CI engine operated with terebinth (pistacia terebinthus) oil biodiesel. Terebinth oil was squized using the extraction method and therefore terebinth oil biodiesel was produced via the transesterification method. Terebinth oil biodiesel (B)-diesel fuel (D) blends were tested in a direct injection diesel engine at full load condition. Power values showed a trend of decreasing with all biodiesel fuels at high engine speeds. Specific fuel consumption (SFC) values increased depending on the amount of biodiesel in the test fuels. In general, exhaust emission profile of biodiesel fuels improved. CO and CO2 emissions decreased up to 34.54% and 10.69% respectively. However, NOx emissions increased up to 32.97%.

AB  - This article examines the potential of fish waste for liquid and gaseous biofuels, with focus on Norway but also some consideration of other markets. Fish production and processing wastes are a significant source of material for bioenergy production. Norway is a country of high fish production, but currently low development of the bioenergy sector due to the ample availability of hydropower. World fish consumption per capita nearly doubled over the last 45 years. The resulting increase in fish processing wastes and the expansion of the renewable energy market imply that fish processing wastes could play a part in the future of biofuels. Fish processing wastes rich in fat may be used for biodiesel, although blending with other diesels may be necessary to meet biodiesel specification standards. Fish processing wastes are also suitable for biogas production, although these materials will have to be added as a co-substrate to boost the biogas production of plants treating agricultural or municipal wastes, due to the inhibitory effects of long chain fatty acids and high protein concentrations. A sustainable use of biogas in Norway would be as fuel for vehicles, as is the preferred future utilization in neighboring Sweden. In other countries with better developed gas grids, an increasing proportion of biogas will likely be used for grid injection to replace natural gas. © Future Science Ltd.

AB  - The predominant strategy for using algae to produce biofuels relies on the overproduction of lipids in microalgae with subsequent conversion to biodiesel (methyl-esters) or green diesel (alkanes). Conditions that both optimize algal growth and lipid accumulation rarely overlap, and differences in growth rates can lead to wild species outcompeting the desired lipid-rich strains. Here, we demonstrate an alternative strategy in which cellulose contained in the cell walls of multicellular algae is used as a feedstock for cultivating biofuel-producing microorganisms. Cellulose was extracted from an environmental sample of Cladophora glomerata-dominated periphyton that was collected from Lake Mendota, WI, USA. The resulting cellulose cake was hydrolyzed by commercial enzymes to release fermentable glucose. The hydrolysis mixture was used to formulate an undefined medium that was able to support the growth, without supplementation, of a free fatty acid (FFA)-overproducing strain of Escherichia coli (Lennen et. al 2010). To maximize free fatty acid production from glucose, an isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible vector was constructed to express the Umbellularia californica acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterase. Thioesterase expression was optimized by inducing cultures with 50 μM IPTG. Cell density and FFA titers from cultures grown on algae-based media reached 50% of those (∼90 μg/mL FFA) cultures grown on rich Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with 0.2% glucose. In comparison, cultures grown in two media based on AFEX-pretreated corn stover generated tenfold less FFA than cultures grown in algae-based media. This study demonstrates that macroalgal cellulose is a potential carbon source for the production of biofuels or other microbially synthesized compounds. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were measured by glass fiber filter and XAD-2 collector, ultrasonic extraction, soxhlet extraction and GC-MS analysis equipment. The exhaust emission of the DI single cylinder diesel engine fueled with pure diesel, biodiesel and biodiesel blends of 50% (B50) were measured. The results indicate that the particle-phase PAHs emissions of diesel engine decrease with the increasing of load. The gas-phase PAHs emissions of diesel engine decrease with the increasing of load in the beginning and it turns to going up with further increasing of load. The particle-phase and gas-phase PAHs emissions of biodiesel decrease and mean concentration are lower than that of diesel. The total PAHs emission concentration of biodisesl is 41.1-70.1μg/m 3. Total PAHs mean concentration emissions of biodiesel is decreased 33.3% than that of diesel. The mass proportion of three-ring PAHs emissions of those 3 kinds tested fuels is about 44% in the total PAHs. Biodiesel can increase the proportion of three-ring PAHs. Toxic equivalence of PAHs emissions of biodiesel are greatly lower than that of diesel. It is less harmful to human than diesel fuel.

AB  - Worldwide, the demand for energy has grown rapidly over the past decade, resulting in oil prices peaking during 2008 and again in 2011. Utilizing the potential for the production of fuels from alternative sources has been a priority for many countries, particularly the developed countries of Europe and America. The production of ethanol and diesel from vegetable biomass and oils, (i.e. biofuels) has been promoted as an environmentally friendly alternative to oil-based fuels. However, many have warned against the rush to plant large areas of land for bioenergy production, warning against, inter alia, potential consequences for loss of food production, questions about the sustainability of many initiatives and, very importantly, queries about the water use of bioenergy production, from the crop growth to the final synthesis of the liquid fuel and the inputs required. Many analyses of biofuel feedstock production potential are undertaken at macro levels, based on average conditions. However, the reality is that in many developing countries, particularly those of Africa, consideration of biofuel production and its sustainability requires specific consideration of the high natural variability of climatic and other factors governing its production and impact. In this paper, perspectives on the water resources aspects of large-scale biofuel feedstock production in sub-Saharan Africa are provided and the approach taken by South Africa in this regard is described. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd Copyright © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel production from feedstocks grown on wastelands is considered a means of addressing concerns about climate change and improving energy security while at the same time providing an additional source of income for the land users. The establishment of biomass plantations on wastelands is likely to affect local livelihoods and can affect surrounding ecosystems by influencing hydrologic flows and processes such as erosion. We present an assessment of Jatropha plantation establishment on wastelands, using the ArcSWAT modeling tool. The assessment was made for a wasteland located in the Velchal watershed, Andhra Pradesh, India, which recently was converted to a biofuel plantation with Jatropha. The previous land use, in this case grazing, could continue in the Jatropha plantations. Several desirable effects occurred as a result of the land-use conversion: non-productive soil evaporation was reduced as a larger share of the rainfall was channeled to productive plant transpiration and groundwater recharge, and at the same time a more stable (less erosive) runoff resulted in reduced soil erosion and improved downstream water conditions. A win-win situation between improved land productivity and soil carbon content was observed for the Jatropha plantations. On the other hand, the results indicate that at the sub-basin scale, reductions in runoff generation as a result of large-scale conversion of wastelands to Jatropha cropping may pose problems to downstream water users and ecosystems. From a livelihoods perspective, Jatropha production was generally positive, creating a complementary source of income to the farmers, thus strengthening the resilience of the local community. In the future, the potential gain from Jatropha cropping is expected to increase as cropping systems improve and growing biofuel markets result in better conditions for biofuel producers. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd Copyright © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This study compared performance and emission characteristics of hybrid fuel blend [diesel-ethanol (anhydrous)-biodiesel (methyl esters of pungamia oil)] with diesel in a multi cylinder, naturally aspirated, direct injection diesel engine. Brake thermal efficiency of engine operated with hybrid fuel blends is found to be slightly higher than that of diesel fuel. Smoke and oxides of nitrogen (NO x) are found to be reduced simultaneously, while using hybrid fuel blends as fuel. Hydrocarbon (HC) emission is higher than diesel fuel for 10% ethanol addition, however when percentage of pungamia methyl ester (PME) increases in blends, HC emission is reduced. Carbon monoxide emission (CO) is found to be higher and a significant reduction is observed when increasing percentage of PME in blends.

AB  - Microalgae are currently considered a potential feedstock for the production of biofuels. This work addresses the energy needed to manage the water used in the mass cultivation of saline, eukaryotic algae grown in open pond systems. Estimates of both direct and upstream energy requirements for obtaining, containing, and circulating water within algae cultivation systems are developed. Potential productivities are calculated for each of the 48 states within the continental U.S. based on theoretical photosynthetic efficiencies, growing season, and total available land area. Energy output in the form of algal biodiesel and the total energy content of algal biomass are compared to energy inputs required for water management. The analysis indicates that, for current technologies, energy required for water management alone is approximately seven times greater than energy output in the form of biodiesel and more than double that contained within the entire algal biomass. While this analysis addresses only currently identified species grown in an open-pond system, the water management requirements of any algae system will be substantial; therefore, it is critical that an energy assessment of water management requirements be performed for any cultivation technology and algal type in order to fully understand the energy balance of algae-derived biofuels. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The diesel tailpipe emissions typically undergo substantial physical and chemical transformations while traveling through the tailpipe, which tend to modify the original characteristics of the diesel exhaust. Most of the health-related attention for diesel exhaust has focused on the carcinogenic potential of inhaled exhaust components, particularly the highly respirable diesel particulate matter (DPM). In the current study, parametric investigations were made using a modern automotive common rail direct injection (CRDI) sports utility vehicle (SUV) diesel engine operated at different loads at constant engine speed (2400-rpm), employing diesel and 20% biodiesel blends (B20) produced from karanja oil. A partial flow dilution tunnel was employed to measure the mass of the primary particulates from diesel and biodiesel blend on a 47-mm quartz substrate. This was followed by chemical analysis of the particulates collected on the substrate for benzene-soluble organic fraction (BSOF) (marker of toxicity). BSOF results showed decrease in its level with increasing engine load for both diesel and biodiesel. In addition, real-time measurements for organic carbon/elemental carbon (OC/EC), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (marker of toxicity) were carried out on the diluted primary exhaust coming out of the partial flow dilution tunnel. PAH concentrations were found to be the maximum at 20% rated engine load for both the fuels. The collected particulates from diesel and biodiesel-blend exhaust were also analyzed for concentration of trace metals (marker of toxicity), which revealed some interesting results. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - The objective of this study was to optimize the mechanical oil extraction of Jatropha curcas seeds by increasing the efficiency of oil recovery and decreasing oil residues in press cake. The experiments were carried out with mechanical screw press type - Komet D85-1G. Four setups were created by parameter combination of two different screws (16 and 21.5. mm choke ring size), with two different press cylinders (1 and 1.5. mm bore size), three different nozzles (8, 10 and 12. mm nozzle diameter) and three rotational speeds (low, medium and high). Oil recovery reduced when rotational speed increases for all setups; highest oil was 89.4% (m/m). The oil recovery was increasing when energy input increased and decreasing when seed material throughput increased. The relations between energy input and seed material throughput followed a strict pattern, which correlated with oil recovery. This correlation can be used for determining the optimal operation parameters. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ricinus communis seed is a source of protein and oil with a high potential to use as animal's feedstock and biodiesel production. However, the oil yield and the extraction efficiency depend on the process conditions applied, as well as on the physical, chemical and structural properties of the seed, which have not been fully investigated. Hence, the objective of this study was to evaluate some chemical and physical properties of R. communis seed as well as to describe and quantify the macro and microstructure of this raw material by microscopy techniques and image analysis. Chemical analysis confirmed the seeds' high contents of protein (28.48±0.25%) and fat (51±0.31%). On the other hand, the values of geometric mean diameter (8.95±0.05mm), bulk density (538±11kg/m3), and true density (1458±27kg/m3), among others, were higher than the ones reported about similar oils seeds. Microstructural studies showed that the endosperm cells presented an ovoid shape, as obtained from the aspect ratio results (AR=1.28±0.17), and a cell density of 570±10cell/mm2, resulting in a porous structure, while the embryo cells had a cell density of 4903±2cell/mm2, and an AR of 2.41±0.48, related to a more compact structure (rectangular form) in this part of the seed. Regarding to lipids bodies (lb), they were only visible in the endosperm cells, showing a circular shape (AR=1.16±0.1), and a mean cell density of 9.57±2.40lipidbodies/μm2, associated to protein as observed by the mineral presence (K, P, Mg and S) as determined by the energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Microscopy techniques and images analysis were efficient tools for the characterization of macro and microstructure of seeds and the data obtained integrate numerical information that could be useful for thermal and mechanical processing of R. communis seed, as well as for the design process equipment. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An experimental study was performed on spray characteristics of spray diesel (D100) and biodiesel blend (BD65) injected into an atmospheric chamber. A qualitative analysis of spray images was conducted through exploiting the image processing with common image processing software. The results showed that the posterization of the images offered more detailed qualitative information on the spray compared to the more commonly-used threshold method. The posterized images showed the existence of layers in the spray with its transition at different grey levels. At lower injection, the spray tip penetration of BD65 was slightly lower than D100, whereas at high injection pressure, spray tip penetration of BD65 was higher than D100. Although BD65 had lower maximum velocity, the higher density of biodiesel may have resulted in greater momentum that enabled BD65 to have longer spray tip penetration at higher injection pressure. At higher injection pressure, the spray angle of BD65 tended to be less than that of D100. © 2011 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the production of 1,3-propanediol (PDO) under non-sterile fermentation conditions by employing the strain Clostridium butyricum VPI 1718. A series of batch cultures were performed by utilizing biodiesel-derived crude glycerol feedstocks of different origins as the sole carbon source, in various initial concentrations. The strain presented similarities in terms of PDO production when cultivated on crude glycerol of various origins, with final concentrations ranging between 11.1 and 11.5 g/L. Moreover, PDO fermentation was successfully concluded regardless of the initial crude glycerol concentration imposed (from 20 to 80 g/L), accompanied by sufficient PDO production yields (0.52-0.55 g per gram of glycerol consumed). During fed-batch operation under non-sterile culture conditions, 67.9 g/L of PDO were finally produced, with a yield of 0.55 g/g. Additionally, the sustainability of the bioprocess during a continuous operation was tested; indeed, the system was able to run at steady state for 16 days, during which PDO effluent level was 13.9 g/L. Furthermore, possible existence of a microbial community inside the chemostat was evaluated by operating a polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis, and DGGE results revealed the presence of only one band corresponding to that of C. butyricum VPI 1718. Finally, non-sterile continuous cultures were carried out at different dilution rates (D), with inlet glycerol concentration at 80 g/L. Maximum PDO production was achieved at low D values (0.02 h -1) corresponding to 30.1 g/L, while the elaboration of kinetic data from continuous cultures revealed the stability of the bioprocess proposed, with global PDO production yield corresponding to 0.52 g/g. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - A Phoma sp. was isolated and characterized as endophytic and as a pathogen of Larrea tridentata (creosote bush) growing in the desert region of southern Utah, USA. This fungus produces a unique mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including a series of sesquiterpenoids, some alcohols and several reduced naphthalene derivatives. Trans-caryophyllene, a product in the fungal VOCs, was also noted in the VOCs of this pungent plant. The gases of Phoma sp. possess antifungal properties and is markedly similar to that of a methanolic extract of the host plant. Some of the test organisms with the greatest sensitivity to the Phoma sp. VOCs were Verticillium, Ceratocystis, Cercospora and Sclerotinia while those being the least sensitive were Trichoderma, Colletotrichum and Aspergillus. We discuss the possible involvement of VOC production by the fungus and its role in the biology/ecology of the fungus/plant/environmental relationship with implications for utilization as an energy source. © 2011 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

AB  - The development of biofuels has gained much attention in recent years. Thermodynamic analyses to obtain energy from biofuels using fuel cells were addressed in previous works for a variety of processes. In those processes, the determination of the best conditions to achieve high efficiency values in the conversion of chemical energy into electrical power is a critical issue from the net global energy efficiency point of view. In this regard, a main aspect is to address the energy integration of the whole process. In a previous paper, the authors dealt with energy integration studies for glycerin- and ethanol-based processors coupled to PEM fuel cells resorting on the "multi-stream heat exchanger" feature provided by the simulation tool HYSYS. In that work, the aim was to maximize the energy recovery from the process streams that renders the maximum achievable net global efficiency. In this paper, the aim is to synthesize and design the optimal heat exchangers network (i.e. determination of the process configuration and units sizes) while maintaining the net global efficiency of the whole system at its achievable value. Three modifications to the original SYNHEAT model developed in 1990 by Yee and Grossmann for synthesizing heat exchanger networks are proposed in this work aiming at a better problem description, and consequently searching for best problem solutions. First, a modification in computing the minimum approach temperature difference is proposed. Second, the called "operation line method" is coupled to the SYNHEAT model to built-up the network superstructure to be optimized. Finally, the SYNHEAT model's hypothesis of constant cp value for modeling heat exchange between process streams is improved by considering enthalpy variable instead of temperature variable, which is convenient when latent heat is transferred. The model variables number involved in the heat exchanger network synthesis problems solved has been reduced to less than a half by applying the operation line method. The proposed methodology and modifications made are of general application and not just for the specific cases addressed in this work. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - A new technology, the simulated moving bed membrane reactor (PermSMBR), was presented and applied for the production of the green solvent ethyl lactate and of the biofuel 1,1-diethoxyethane. Its conception was a result of process reintensification for oxygenates production, by integrating the simulated moving bed reactor with hydrophilic membranes to enhance the water removal, leading to high process performance. For ethyl lactate synthesis, the PermSMBR technology proved to have better performance than the reactive distillation (RD) and the simulated moving bed reactor (SMBR) processes; the RD and SMBR processes require more 152 and 165% of ethanol consumption than the new technology, respectively. For the 1,1-diethoxyethane production, the PermSMBR also leads to a decrease in ethanol consumption of 69% and a productivity enhancement of 53%, when comparing with the SMBR. © 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 57: 000-000, 2011 Copyright © 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).

AB  - Distillery wastewater rich in organics is an inexpensive renewable resource for making first generation biofuel. Distillery wastewaters are mostly treated via the biomethanation route; however, in this study the conditions in sequential batch reactor (SBR) are being set to develop and analyze the microbial community that opted for hydrogen production. An optimum performance condition for a bioreactor was achieved after 40 days of operation, which gave substrate degradation rate of 0.72 kg/m3-day with volumetric hydrogen production of 0.32 mol H2/m3-day. Study proposes that the dominant Delftia sp., a hydrogen oxidizing bacterium has been replaced during hydrogen production mode with dominant Anaerofilum sp., an anaerobic Firmicute and the iron dependent hydrogenases dominated as functional gene for hydrogen production. Future studies are required where process-engineering interventions could be applied to improve the hydrogen driving biochemical process. © 2011 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - A solid base catalyst was prepared by neodymium oxide loaded with potassium hydroxide and investigated for transesterification of soybean oil with methanol to biodiesel. After loading KOH of 30 wt.% on neodymium oxide followed by calcination at 600 °C, the catalyst gave the highest basicity and the best catalytic activity for this reaction. The obtained catalyst was characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), N2 adsorption-desorption measurements and the Hammett indicator method. The catalyst has longer lifetime and maintained sustained activity after being used for five times, and were noncorrosive and environmentally benign. The separate effects of the molar ratio of methanol to oil, reaction temperature, mass ratio of catalyst to oil and reaction time were investigated. The experimental results showed that a 14:1 M ratio of methanol to oil, addition of 6.0% catalyst, 60 °C reaction temperature and 1.5 h reaction time gave the best results and the biodiesel yield of 92.41% was achieved. The properties of obtained biodiesel are close to commercial diesel fuel and is rated as a realistic fuel as an alternative to diesel. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Straight vegetable oil (SVO) has been considered as a possible alternative to fossil diesel-engine fuel since the development of diesel engines. In Europe, SVOs achieved a measurable share in biofuels market reaching 4%. This study attempts to identify the impact of untreated SVO application on fuel consumption and emissions, regulated and non-regulated, on a Euro 3 common rail diesel passenger car. Three different vegetable oils (cottonseed, sunflower, and rapeseed) were blended with diesel fuel, on a 10-90% v/v ratio each. Chassis dynamometer measurements were conducted including both regulated and non-regulated pollutants. In the case of rapeseed oil-diesel blend, carbonyl compounds (10 aldehydes and ketones) were investigated. In addition to the legislated procedure (NEDC), the Artemis driving cycles were used for quantifying the fuels' impact over realistic driving conditions. Results indicate that all blends have limited effects on gaseous pollutants and vehicle performance. Statistically significant increases on CO2, CO and HC were recorded over NEDC in the order of 3, 39 and 31%. Reductions were observed on PM emissions particularly for the sunflower oil blends, while NOx remained at baseline levels. Comparison with the emission levels measured when using esterified fuels of the same feedstocks suggests that SVO presence does not affect engine exhaust in the same way as biodiesel. The vegetable oil presence in the fuel appeared to suppress the formation of nucleation mode particles. Straight rapeseed oil increased carbonyl compound emissions over all cycles tested and resulted in higher acroleine/acetone presence in the carbonyl compound composition. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article assesses the current technical and economic potential of three bioenergy production systems (cassava ethanol, jatropha oil and fuelwood) in semi-arid and arid regions of eight sub-Saharan African countries. The results indicate that the availability of land for energy production ranges from 2% (1.3 Mha) of the total semi-arid and arid area in South Africa to 21% (12 Mha) in Botswana. Land availability for bioenergy production is restricted mainly by agricultural land use, but also by steep slopes and biodiversity protection. The current total technical potential for the semi-arid and arid regions of the eight countries is calculated to be approximately 300 PJ y-1 for cassava ethanol production, 600 PJ y-1 for jatropha biodiesel or 4000 PJ y-1 for fuelwood. The analysis of economic potentials shows that in many semi-arid regions, cassava ethanol, jatropha oil and fuelwood can compete economically with the reference energy sources. However, fuelwood, jatropha oil, and cassava ethanol production costs in most arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa are often above average national market prices of gasoline, diesel, and fuelwood. Nevertheless, for example, in arid Kenya 270 PJ could be produced annually with fuelwood at production costs of less than 3 US$ GJ-1. Despite high production costs, it is important to investigate and invest in sustainable bioenergy production in semi-arid and arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa because of its potential to drive rural economic and social development. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgal lipids are the oils of the future for sustainable biodiesel production. One of the most important decisions in obtaining oil from microalgae is the choice of species. A total of 45 algal cultures were isolated from a freshwater lake at Wonju, South Korea. Five microalgal isolates were selected based on their morphology and ease of cultivation under our test conditions. These cultures were identified as strains of Scenedesmus obliquus YSL02, Chlamydomonas pitschmannii YSL03, Chlorella vulgaris YSL04, S. obliquus YSL05, and Chlamydomonas mexicana YSL07 based on microscopic examination and LSU rDNA (D1-D2) sequence analysis. S. obliquus YSL02 reached a higher biomass concentration (1.84 ± 0.30 g L-1) with a lower lipid content (29% w/w), than did Chla. pitschmannii YSL03 (maximum biomass concentration of 1.04 ± 0.09 with a 51% lipid content). Our results suggest that Chla. pitschmannii YSL03 is appropriate for producing biodiesel based on its high lipid content and oleic acid proportion. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The results of the rapeseed and palm oils transesterification with supercritical methanol and ethanol were presented. The studies were performed using the experimental setups which are working in batch and continuous regimes. The effect of reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, oil to alcohol ratio, reaction time) on the biodiesel production (conversion yield) was studied. Also the effect of preliminary ultrasonic treatment (ultrasonic irradiation, emulsification of immiscible oil and alcohol mixture) of the initial reagents (emulsion preparation) on the stage before transesterification reaction conduction on the conversion yield was studied. We found that the preliminary ultrasonic treatment of the initial reagents increases considerably the conversion yield. Optimal technological conditions were determined to be as follows: pressure within 20-30 MPa, temperature within 573-623 K. The optimal values of the oil to alcohol ratio strongly depend on preliminary treatment of the reaction mixture. The study showed that the conversion yield at the same temperature with 96 wt.% of ethanol is higher than with 100 wt.% of methanol. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The techno-economic potential of the UK poplar wood and imported oil palm empty fruit bunch derived bio-oil integrated gasification and Fischer-Tropsch (BOIG-FT) systems for the generation of transportation fuels and combined heat and power (CHP) was investigated. The bio-oil was represented in terms of main chemical constituents, i.e. acetic acid, acetol and guaiacol. The compositional model of bio-oil was validated based on its performance through a gasification process. Given the availability of large scale gasification and FT technologies and logistic constraints in transporting biomass in large quantities, distributed bio-oil generations using biomass pyrolysis and centralised bio-oil processing in BOIG-FT system are technically more feasible. Heat integration heuristics and composite curve analysis were employed for once-through and full conversion configurations, and for a range of economies of scale, 1 MW, 675 MW and 1350 MW LHV of bio-oil. The economic competitiveness increases with increasing scale. A cost of production of FT liquids of 78.7 Euro/MWh was obtained based on 80.12 Euro/MWh of electricity, 75 Euro/t of bio-oil and 116.3 million Euro/y of annualised capital cost. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Intensive production and commercialization of biodiesel from edible-grade sources have raised some critical environmental concerns. In order to mitigate these environmental consequences, alternative oilseeds are being investigated as biodiesel feedstocks. Castor (Ricinus communis L.) is one of the most promising non-edible oil crops, due to its high annual seed production and yield, and since it can be grown on marginal land and in semi-arid climate. Still, few studies are available regarding its fuel-related properties in its pure form or as a blend with petrodiesel, many of which are due to its extremely high content of ricinoleic acid. In this study, the specifications in ASTM D6751 and D7467 which are related to the fatty acid composition of pure castor methyl esters (B100) and its blend with petrodiesel in a 10% vol ratio (B10) were investigated. Kinematic viscosity and distillation temperature of B100 (15.17 mm2 s-1 and 398.7 °C respectively) were the only two properties which did not meet the appropriate standard limits. In contrast, B10 met all the specifications. Still, ASTM D7467 requires that the pure biodiesel meets the requirements of ASTM D6751. This can limit the use of a wide range of feedstocks, including castor, as alternative fuel, especially due to the fact that in practice vehicles normally use low level blends of biodiesel and petrodiesel. These issues are discussed in depth in the present study. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Oils of oleaginous microorganisms are a powerful alternative to vegetable oils for biodiesel production. In this study, the fungus Epicoccum purpurascens AUMC5615 isolated from Egypt showed a potent high lipid content (80% lipid) when grown on 4% sucrose in submerged culture under continuous illumination. Under dark submerged conditions the lipid content has drastically decreased to 12%. In light static conditions, the lipid content was 70%; however, the net lipid yield was significantly lower than that of light submerged cultures because of the decrease in growth under light static conditions in comparison to light submerged cultures. Under dark static conditions the lipid content of the fungus has declined to 30%. These results indicate that light plays a crucial role in the lipid accumulation whereas submersion enhances the growth of the fungus. Concomitantly, the highest yield of carotenoids was obtained under light submerged conditions followed respectively by light static, dark submerged and dark static. This synchronized increase in carotenoids content might be implicated in protecting the high lipid pools in the fungus from peroxidation. Growing the fungus on 4% of crude molasses resulted in a net lipid production of 26.8 g per liter under light submerged conditions. The determination of fatty acids by GC/MS revealed that the major constituents are four saturated fatty acids, hexadecanoic, n-decanoic, dodecanoic and octadecanoic acids. These saturated fatty acids would give valuable stability properties of such fungal biodiesel. The current investigation opens the scope for the possible use of this promising fungal isolate in biodiesel production. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel production from microalgae lipids is increasingly regarded as a more sustainable and feasible alternative to conventional biodiesel feedstocks derived from terrestrial bioenergy crops. A total of ninety-six strains of marine microalgae, with an elevated biomass productivity and intracellular lipid content, were isolated from the coastal waters of Singapore using an automated flow cytometric cell-sorting technique. Cell sorting was based on the two-dimensional distribution of algal cells for red fluorescence (representing chlorophyll auto-fluorescence) against forward-light scatter (representing cell size) and red vs. green fluorescence. Twenty-one of the strains were further characterized with respect to cell growth rate, biomass concentration, lipid content (total and neutral lipid) and fatty acid profile. The growth rates of Skeletonema costatum, Chaetoceros and Thalassiosira species were greatest among the entire strains, but in terms of absolute lipid yield Nannochloropsis strains predominated. Nannochloropsis strains had a lipid content ranging from 39.4% to 44.9% of dry weight biomass. Transesterification of the lipids yielded 25-51% of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) i.e. biodiesel, where total FAME content ranged between 11 and 21% of dry weight biomass. This study describes the microalgae screening process and demonstrates that Nannochloropsis is a promising species for biodiesel feedstock. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pongamia pinnata has received much attention in recent years as a source of seed oil that can provide a substitute for diesel fuel. Very little molecular work has been reported on this species. This paper reports our studies on the diversity amongst the CPTs (candidate plus trees) of P. pinnata previously identified on the basis of morphometric traits, particularly pod and seed traits. For this RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) markers were used to determine the genetic diversity among 10 genotypes of P. pinnata CPTs selected for suitability for energy production. For further investigation, 18 primers generating stable band patterns from 40 tested arbitrary primers were selected. A total of 210 amplification products were obtained of which 10.48% were polymorphic. The genetic similarity index ranged from 0.11 to 0.87. Genetic distance values were used to generate a dendrogram (UPGMA) between the genotypes. The Mantel method used for comparing the similarity matrixes produced correlation coefficients that were statistically significant for the RAPD marker. This genomic analysis allows a cost effective characterization of CPTs of P. pinnata. The present investigation supports in future the development of genetic map in Pongamia which are a highly useful tool in breeding and may provide information on the inheritance of features crucial for increase seed yield, oil content and the resistance to key insects and pests. Thus this study warrants Pongamia producers to realize its full potential and contributes for its sustainable production and improvement. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel, defined as mono-alkyl esters of long-chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils or animal fats, is an attractive renewable fuel alternative to conventional petroleum diesel fuel. Biodiesel produced from oils such as cottonseed oil and poultry fats suffer from extremely poor cold flow properties because of their high saturated fatty acid content. In the current study, Ethyl Levulinate (ethyl 4-oxopentanoate) was investigated as a novel, bio-based cold flow improver for use in biodiesel fuels. The cloud (CP), pour (PP), and cold filter plugging points (CFPP) of biodiesel fuels prepared from cottonseed oil and poultry fat were improved upon addition of ethyl levulinate at 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0% (vol). Reductions of 4-5 °C in CP, 3-4 °C in PP and 3 °C in CFPP were observed at 20 vol % ethyl levulinate. The influence of ethyl levulinate on acid value, induction period, kinematic viscosity and flash point was determined. The kinematic viscosities and flash points decreased with increasing content of ethyl levulinate. All samples (≤15 vol % ethyl levulinate) satisfied the ASTM D6751 limit with respect to flash point, but none of the 20 vol % blends were acceptable when compared to the higher EN 14214 specification. Acid value and oxidative stability were essentially unchanged upon addition of ethyl levulinate. In summary, ethyl levulinate appears acceptable as a diluent for biodiesel fuels with high saturated fatty acid content. © 2011.

AB  - This paper aimed to study the genetic variability within different types of Cynara cardunculus L., domestic and wild types, for their grain oil amount and oil fatty acid composition.The grain oils were extracted from 8 domestic cardoons and 4 wild cardoons, by Soxhlet method, and obtained oils were characterized for palmitic, stearic, oleic and linoleic acids by gas chromatography.The oil amount, resulted on average of accessions 216 g kg-1 DM with a good range of variability (CV = 11.7%). Unsaturated acids (oleic and linoleic) predominated over saturated ones (stearic and palmitic acids), the chemical characterization of extracted oil, showed the main compound (as % of analysed fatty acids), averaged for all populations, was linoleic acid (44.5%), followed by oleic acid (42.6%), palmitic acid (9.8%) and stearic acid (3.1%). In particular referring the oleic acid wild cardoon populations showed a mean value of 289 g kg-1 oil, against a mean value of 472 g kg-1 oil showed by domestic cardoon accessions. Three of the studied domestic cardoon ('DC1', 'DC3' and 'DC7') showed values higher than 795 g kg-1 oil, while all the other accessions had concentration lower than 370 g kg-1 oil.The three types of domestic cardoon 'DC1', 'DC3' and 'DC7' showed a fatty acids profile similar to genetic modified sunflower oil, representing new genetic material that potentially could be used for high quality biodiesel production, characterised by a low Iodine Number. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Due to issues relating to the sustainability of biofuel production, second generation biofuel has attracted much attention. As a promising feedstock of second generation biodiesel, Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) is being massively planted on marginal land in China, but its viability as a biofuel source has not been systematically assessed. This paper performed a lifecycle assessment of the economic, environmental and energy (3E) performance of the JCL biodiesel, assuming JCL oil is either used for direct blending with diesel or further processed into JCL methyl ester (JME). The results show that, at the current technical levels, the production of JCL biodiesel is financially infeasible, but has positive environmental and energy performance. Despite the additional cost incurred in the transesterification process, the net present value of JME is slightly higher than that of JCL oil when a part of the cost is allocated to the co-product, i.e., glycerin. As compared with that of diesel, the production and consumption of per liter JCL oil and JME can reduce 7.34kg and 8.04kg CO2 equivalent, respectively. The energy balances of both JCL oil and JME are 1.57 and 1.47, respectively, in terms of the ratio of the heat value of biodiesel and that of energy input. The main factors affecting the 3E performance of JCL biodiesel are seed yield, co-product output, and farm energy input. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study reviews economics of production of second generation biofuels from various feedstocks, including crop and wood/forestry residues, lignocellulosic energy crops, jatropha, and algae. The study indicates that while second generation biofuels could significantly contribute to the future energy supply mix, cost is a major barrier to its commercial production in the near to medium term. Depending upon type of biofuels, feedstock prices and conversion costs, the cost of cellulosic ethanol is found to be two to three times higher than the current price of gasoline on an energy equivalent basis. The median cost (across the studies reviewed) of biodiesel produced from microalgae, a prospective feedstock, is seven times higher than the current price of diesel, although much higher cost estimates have been reported. As compared with the case of first generation biofuels, in which feedstock can account for over two-thirds of the total costs, the share of feedstock in the total costs is relatively lower (30-50%) in the case of second generation biofuels. While significant cost reductions are needed for both types of second generation biofuels, the critical barriers are at different steps of the production process. For cellulosic ethanol, the biomass conversion costs needs to be reduced. On the other hand, feedstock cost is the main issue for biodiesel. At present, policy instruments, such as fiscal incentives and consumption mandates have in general not differentiated between the first and second generation biofuels except in the cases of the US and EU. The policy regime should be revised to account for the relative merits of different types of biofuels. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel and lactic acid from rapeseed oil was produced using sodium silicate as catalyst. The transesterification in the presence of the catalyst proceeded with a maximum yield of 99.6% under optimized conditions [3% (w/w) sodium silicate, methanol/oil molar ratio 9/1, reaction time 60 min, reaction temperature 60. °C, and stirring rate 250 rpm]. After six consecutive transesterification reactions, the catalyst was collected and used for catalysis of the conversion of glycerol to lactic acid. A maximum yield of 80.5% was achieved when the reaction was carried out at a temperature of 300 °C for 90 min. Thus, sodium silicate is an effective catalyst for transesterification and lactic acid production from the biodiesel by-product, glycerol. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Catalytic reactive distillation (RD) offers novel opportunities for manufacturing fatty acid alkyl esters involved in specialty chemicals and at a larger scale in biodiesel. The integration of reaction and separation into one RD unit, corroborated with the use of a heterogeneous catalyst, provides major benefits such as low capital investment and operating costs. This work presents a novel heat-integrated process based on reactive distillation that aims to reduce furthermore the energy requirements for biodiesel production, leading to competitive operating costs. Despite the high degree of integration, the process is well controllable using an efficient control structure proposed in this work. Rigorous simulations embedding experimental results were performed using computer aided process engineering tools, such as AspenTech Aspen Plus and Aspen Dynamics. The RD column was simulated using the rigorous RADFRAC unit with RateSep (rate-based) model, and explicitly considering three phase balances. Steady-state and dynamic simulation results are given for a plant producing 10 ktpy fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from methanol and waste vegetable oil with high free fatty acids (FFA) content, using sulfated zirconia as green catalyst. The heat-integrated RD process eliminates all conventional catalyst related operations, efficiently uses the raw materials and the reactor volume offering complete conversion of the fatty acids and allowing significant energy savings. Remarkably, compared to previously reported RD processes, the energy requirements of this process are about 45% lower - only 108.8 kW h/ton biodiesel - while the capital investment cost remains the same as no additional equipment is required. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A kind of solid catalyst of Fe(II)-Zn double-metal cyanide (DMC) complexes was prepared through co-reaction of potassium ferrocyanide, zinc chloride and complexing agent of tert-butanol. This catalyst was characterized by using several techniques such as XRD, TG/FT-IR, EA, BET and SEM. And it proved to be highly active for the simultaneous transesterification of triglycerides and esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs). Results show that the catalyst has a hybrid-structure comprised of both crystal and amorphous species. Its good water-resistance depends on the amorphous state, which has surface hydrophobicity. Zn2+ may be the active site of catalysis. The effect of various factors on the reaction was also studied, including different co-complexing agents, DMC concentration, reaction temperature, methanol/oil molar ratio, reaction time, water and fatty acid content and so on. The yield rate reached 98% under the optimum conditions, and the recovery rate maintained more than 90% after 10 batches. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A simple, fast, and complete route for the production of methylic and ethylic biodiesel from tucum oil is described. Aliquots of the oil obtained directly from pressed tucum (pulp and almonds) were treated with potassium methoxide or ethoxide at 40()C for 40min. The biodiesel form was removed from the reactor and washed with 0.1MHCl aqueous solution. A simple distillation at 100()C was carried out in order to remove water and alcohol species from the biodiesel. The oxidative stability index was obtained for the tucum oil as well as the methylic and ethylic biodiesel at 6.13, 2.90, and 2.80h, for storage times higher than 8 days. Quality control of the original oil and of the methylic and ethylic biodiesels, such as the amount of glycerin produced during the transesterification process, was accomplished by the TLC, GC-MS, and FT-IR techniques. The results obtained in this study indicate a potential biofuel production by simple treatment of tucum, an important Amazonian fruit. Copyright 2011 Marcelo Firmino de Oliveira et al.

AB  - Canola methyl ester (CME) is a biofuel that is a renewable alternative energy resource and is produced by the transesterification of canola oil. The objective of this study was to document the effects of turbulence on the combustion characteristics of blends of CME and No 2 diesel fuel in a partially-premixed flame environment. The experiments were conducted with mixtures of pre-vaporized fuel and air at an initial equivalence ratio of 7 and three burner exit Reynolds numbers, 2700, 3600, and 4500. Three blends with 25, 50, and 75% volume concentration of CME were studied. The soot volume fraction was highest for the pure diesel flames and did not change significantly with Reynolds number due to the mutually compensating effects of increased carbon input rate and increased air entrainment as the Reynolds number was increased. The global NOx emission index was highest and the CO emission index was the lowest for the pure CME flame, and varied non-monotonically with biofuel content in the blend The mean temperature and the NOx concentration at three-quarter flame height were generally correlated, indicating that the thermal mechanism of NOx formation was dominant in the turbulent biofuel flames also.

AB  - This study quantifies the green, blue and grey water footprint of global crop production in a spatially-explicit way for the period 1996-2005. The assessment improves upon earlier research by taking a high-resolution approach, estimating the water footprint of 126 crops at a 5 by 5 arc minute grid. We have used a grid-based dynamic water balance model to calculate crop water use over time, with a time step of one day. The model takes into account the daily soil water balance and climatic conditions for each grid cell. In addition, the water pollution associated with the use of nitrogen fertilizer in crop production is estimated for each grid cell. The crop evapotranspiration of additional 20 minor crops is calculated with the CROPWAT model. In addition, we have calculated the water footprint of more than two hundred derived crop products, including various flours, beverages, fibres and biofuels. We have used the water footprint assessment framework as in the guideline of the Water Footprint Network. Considering the water footprints of primary crops, we see that the global average water footprint per ton of crop increases from sugar crops (roughly 200 m3 ton-1), vegetables (300 m3 ton -1), roots and tubers (400 m3 ton-1), fruits (1000 m3 ton-1), cereals (1600 m3 ton -1), oil crops (2400 m3 ton-1) to pulses (4000 m3 ton-1). The water footprint varies, however, across different crops per crop category and per production region as well. Besides, if one considers the water footprint per kcal, the picture changes as well. When considered per ton of product, commodities with relatively large water footprints are: coffee, tea, cocoa, tobacco, spices, nuts, rubber and fibres. The analysis of water footprints of different biofuels shows that bio-ethanol has a lower water footprint (in m3 GJ-1) than biodiesel, which supports earlier analyses. The crop used matters significantly as well: the global average water footprint of bio-ethanol based on sugar beet amounts to 51 m3 GJ-1, while this is 121 m3 GJ -1 for maize. The global water footprint related to crop production in the period 1996-2005 was 7404 billion cubic meters per year (78 % green, 12 % blue, 10 % grey). A large total water footprint was calculated for wheat (1087 Gm3 yr-1), rice (992 Gm3 yr-1) and maize (770 Gm3 yr-1). Wheat and rice have the largest blue water footprints, together accounting for 45 % of the global blue water footprint. At country level, the total water footprint was largest for India (1047 Gm3 yr-1), China (967 Gm3 yr -1) and the USA (826 Gm3 yr-1). A relatively large total blue water footprint as a result of crop production is observed in the Indus river basin (117 Gm3 yr-1) and the Ganges river basin (108 Gm3 yr-1). The two basins together account for 25 % of the blue water footprint related to global crop production. Globally, rain-fed agriculture has a water footprint of 5173 Gm3 yr -1 (91 % green, 9 % grey); irrigated agriculture has a water footprint of 2230 Gm3 yr-1 (48 % green, 40 % blue, 12 % grey). © Author(s) 2011.

AB  - In addition to available country or site-specific life cycle studies on Jatropha biodiesel we present a generic, location-independent life cycle assessment and provide a general but in-depth analysis of the environmental performance of Jatropha biodiesel for transportation. Additionally, we assess the influence of changes in byproduct use and production chain. In our assessments, we went beyond the impact on energy requirement and global warming by including impacts on ozone layer and terrestrial acidification and eutrophication. The basic Jatropha biodiesel system consumes eight times less nonrenewable energy than conventional diesel and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 51%. This result coincides with the lower limit of the range of reduction percentages available in literature for this system and for other liquid biofuels. The impact on the ozone layer is also lower than that provoked by fossil diesel, although eutrophication and acidification increase eight times. This study investigates the general impact trends of the Jatropha system, although not considering land-use change. The results are useful as a benchmark against which other biodiesel systems can be evaluated, to calculate repayment times for land-use change induced carbon loss or as guideline with default values for assessing the environmental performance of specific variants of the system. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study presents the physical characteristics of fine particulate matter (PM) collected inside the urban-public transit buses in Toledo, OH. These buses run on 20% biodiesel blended with ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) (B20). For risk analysis, it is crucial to know the modality of the size distribution and the shape factor of PM collected inside the bus. The number-size distribution, microstructure, and aspect ratio of fine PM filter samples collected in the urban-public transit buses were measured for three years (2007-2009), using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX). Only the reproducible results from repeated experiments on ESEM and size distribution obtained by the GRIMM dust monitor were used in this study. The size distribution was found bi-modal in the winter and fall months and was primarily uni-modal during spring and summer. The aspect ratio for different filter samples collected inside the bus range from 2.4 to 3.6 in average value, with standard deviation ranging from 0.9 to 7.4. The square-shaped and oblong-shaped particles represent the single inhalable particle's morphology characteristics in the air of the Toledo transit buses. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - From the viewpoint of process engineering in enzymatic biodiesel production, this paper provides a practical basis for development of the packed-bed reactor (PBR) on a bench scale. A key component of this work is the separation of glycerol byproduct in continuous operation. To facilitate measuring and separating the byproduct, we constructed the PBR integrated with a glycerol-separating system. Methyl ester content in the effluent increased with increasing pass number of the reaction mixture, whereas the efficiency of glycerol removal was affected significantly by the flow rate in PBR. Further optimization revealed that the PBR could be operated over a long period realizing both a high methyl ester content and an efficient glycerol removal, obtaining a product that meets the biodiesel standard for residual glycerides. To remove soluble glycerol present in the biodiesel, adsorptive purification using ion-exchange resin was applied to the PBR system. The initial glycerol content of approximately 0.053. wt% was reduced to less than 0.003. wt%, which was maintained for more than 140 bed volumes and repeated after regeneration of the resin using methanol. Therefore, this developed model incorporating the enzymatic PBR and glycerol-separating system is promising for practical biodiesel production, in which no wastewater treatment is necessary. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - According to the European Standard EN 14214, biodiesel fuels must have significant purity values; therefore, a post transesterification purification process is required to produce the fuel that fulfills the standard. Until recently, water washing was conventionally preferred as a biodiesel purification method.this study, upon completion of the two parallel transesterification reactions, one of the reaction mixtures was washed with water and the other one with polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG 300), a flocculation agent, under several concentration conditions in order to compare two different purification methods, and which of them obtains better results. The features of biodiesel washed with PEG 300 were found to be similar to those of the other. Moreover, washing with PEG 300 was found to provide less glycerol precipitation time than conventional glycerol decantation. This process provided easy production of fatty acid alkyl esters without acid neutralization and deionized water-washing procedures that were necessary to produce a high-purity product onto the conventional transesterification process. The new washing process enabled low-cost production of the biodiesel from refined vegetables. © by PSP.

AB  - Methyl and ethyl esters of vegetable oils have become an important source of renewable energy with convenient applications in compression-ignition (CI) engines. While the use of biofuels results in a reduction of CO, particulate matter, and unburned hydrocarbons in the emissions, the main disadvantage is the increase of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. The increase in NO x emissions is attributed to differences in chemical composition and physical properties of the biofuel, which in turn affect engine operational parameters such as injection delay and ignition characteristics. The effects of fuel injection timing, which can compensate for these changes, on the performance and emissions in a single cylinder air-cooled diesel engine at partial loads using canola methyl ester and its blends with diesel are presented in this study. The engine is a single cylinder, four stroke, naturally aspirated, CI engine with a displacement volume of 280 cm3 rated at 5 HP at 3600 rpm under a dynamometer load. It was equipped with a pressure sensor in the combustion chamber, a needle lift sensor in the fuel injector, and a crank angle sensor attached to the crankshaft. Additionally, the temperature of the exhaust gases was monitored using a thermocouple inside the exhaust pipe. Pollutant emissions were measured using an automotive exhaust gas analyzer. Advanced, manufacturer-specified standard, and delayed injection settings were applied by placing shims of different thicknesses under the injection pump, thus, altering the time at which the high-pressure fuel reached the combustion chamber. The start of injection was found to be insensitive to the use of biofuels in the engine. The late injection timing of the engine provided advantages in the CO and NO emissions with a small penalty in fuel consumption and thermal efficiency. © 2011 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - The use of syngas derived on board a vehicle as a supplement to the main fuel fed to engines ensures engine operation using dilute fuel mixtures. This leads to a decrease in emission toxicity and an increase in the fuel efficiency of the engine. The preparation of new types of efficient catalysts for the conversion of hydrocarbon and synthetic fuels for onboard syngas generators requires the use of new approaches to the design of catalysts not only as catalytically active material, but also as a structural component of a chemical reactor. We prepared and tested a set of catalysts for the conversion of hydrocarbons, i.e., natural gas, diesel and biodiesel fuels, biofuels, and alcohols (ethanol, methanol) to syngas. Primary supports for the catalysts were metals grids and porous tapes; secondary supports were oxides of aluminum and magnesium deposited on or sintered to a primary support. The catalysts exhibited high thermal stability and mechanical strength, and were characterized by the conformity of the coefficients of thermal expansion of the support material and the catalytically active bed. The catalysts can be used as structural components of reactors and as a basis for the preparation of monolithic blocks and planar components of radial and planar reactors. The developed catalysts were subjected to laboratory and bench tests and examined as components of onboard generators of vehicles. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2011.

AB  - The potential groundwater impacts of biodiesel releases have received limited attention despite the increasing probability of such events. In this work, microcosms were prepared with unacclimated sediment and groundwater from the Ressacada Experimental Site (Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil) and spiked with 54.8 mg/L of pure soybean or castor oil biodiesel (B100). Oxygen was purged from the microcosms to mimic commonly anoxic and hypoxic conditions at fuel-impacted sites; low background concentrations of nitrate (1.2 to 2.5 mg/L) and sulfate (2.2 to 3.0 mg/L) were present. Biodegradation was assessed by the removal of fatty acid methyl esters and hydrocarbon components relative to sterile controls. Approximately 80% of soybean biodiesel was biotransformed in 41 d, compared to only 40% of castor oil biodiesel removed in 90 d. The higher persistence of castor biodiesel was attributed to its higher viscosity and lower bioavailability. Additional microcosms were prepared similarly to assess the impact of biodiesel on hydrocarbon degradation. These microcosms were spiked with benzene (2.9 mg/L) and toluene (0.8 mg/L) with or without soybean biodiesel (54.8 mg/L). The biodiesel had an inhibitory effect, increasing the time required to remove toluene from 25 to 34 d. Similarly, 45% of benzene was removed in the presence of biodiesel within 34 d, compared to 90% in the absence of biodiesel. Overall, we postulate that the relatively high viscosity of biodiesel is conducive to limited migration potential and a smaller but longer lasting inhibitory region of influence, compared to that exerted by more soluble, more mobile, and readily degradable biofuels such as ethanol. However, controlled release studies are needed to test this hypothesis and characterize the complex dynamics of such releases. © 2011, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose As new alternative automotive fuels are being developed, life cycle assessment (LCA) is being used to assess the sustainability of these new options. A fuel LCA is commonly referred as a &Well To Wheels& analysis and calculates the environmental impacts of producing the fuel (the &Well To Tank& stage) and using it to move a car (the &Tank To Wheels& stage, TTW). The TTW environmental impacts are the main topic of this article. Materials and methods Renault's cars pollutant emissions are measured on the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) to comply with Euro regulations. The results have been used to show the variability of the emissions in the TTW stage. Five E85 flex-fuel vehicles were also tested to check their compliance with Euro standards, enabling to show the effect of an alternative fuel such as ethanol on pollutant emissions. Finally, Euro standard emission thresholds were transposed into environmental impacts to see how they affect TTW results. Results and discussion The TTW stage is very significant for the environmental impacts selected. The results show the unpredictable variability of the impacts between vehicles and when switching from gasoline to ethanol (E85). However, this variability is inferior compared with the differences between cars complying with different Euro standards. Conclusions Measured emissions on a car on NEDC cycle may not be suitable as the input data for TTW calculations. Euro standards associated with average fuel consumptions may be used as the basis for TTW impacts and should be chosen carefully in order to be relevant with the scope of the study. This leads to a functional unit, which is defined as the quantity of fuel needed to move a car that is representative of the average fleet that uses the fuel on 1 km. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

AB  - Since early times, the human kind has been using the biomass for energy purposes. However, the current increasing energy demand can endanger the energy security of the nations and, as well, could put in risk the planet's environmental quality and human health. Thus, by the issues concern about the fossil fuels utilization, the importance of renewable energy sources is being rescued. In this scenario, the biomass energy planning becomes very important to tropical countries, like Brazil, because it would allow stimulating the production of biomass for energy where it is required, but in a sustainable way, considering the social and environmental aspects. Thus, this study aims to present important aspects related with regional energy planning as a contribution for proposing better solutions to energy demands and to think about better public policies related to energy production from biomass. Besides, a contribution of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System in order to assess areas for biomass energy production and a conceptual model are presented as framework which demonstrates how these techniques can constitute support tools to strategic decision making process in bioenergy issues. Some difficult and constraints to territorial and agro-energy planning in Brazil was also presented.

AB  - Due to the increase in price of petroleum and environmental concerns, the search for alternative fuels has gained importance. In this work, biodiesel production by transesterification of palm oil with methanol has been studied in a heterogeneous system using sodium hydroxide loaded on alumina (NaOH/Al 2O3). NaOH/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by impregnation of alumina with different amount of an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide followed by calcination in air for 3 h. The prepared catalysts were then characterized by using x-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR), Brunner-Emmett-Teller surface area measurement (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD). Moreover, the dependence of the conversion of palm oil on the reactions variables such as the molar ratio of methanolloil, the amount of catalysts used, reaction temperatures and reaction times were performed. The conversion of 99% was achieved under the optimum reaction conditions. The biodiesel obtained was characterized by FT-IR and the pour point was measured.

AB  - The biofuelmix in transport in the U.K. must be increased from currently exploited 3.33%to the EU targetmix of 10% by 2020. Under the face of this huge challenge, the most viable way forward is to process infrastructure-compatible intermediate, such as bio-oil from fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, into biofuels. New facilities may integrate multiple distributed pyrolysis units producing bio-oil from locally available biomass and centralized biofuel production platforms, such as methanol or Fischer-Tropsch liquid synthesis utilizing syngas derived from gasification of bio-oil. An alternative to bio-oil gasification is hydrotreating and hydrocracking (upgrading) of bio-oil into stable oil with reduced oxygen content. The stable oil can then be coprocessed into targeted transportation fuel mix within refinery in exchange of refinery hydrogen to the upgrader. This Article focuses on the evaluation of economic and environmental sustainability of industrial scale biofuel production systems from bio-oils. An overview of bio-oil gasification-based system evaluation is presented, while comprehensive process reaction modeling (with 40 overall bio-oil hydrocracking and hydrotreating reaction steps), simulation, integration, and value analysis frameworks are illustrated for bio-oil upgrading and refinery coprocessing systems. The environmental analysis shows that the former technologies are able to meet the minimum greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction target of 60%, to be eligible for the European Union (EU) Directive's 2020 target of 10% renewable energy in transport, while at least 20% renewable energy mix from an upgrader is required for meeting the EUGHGemission reduction target. Increases in the price of biodiesel and hydrogen make coprocessing of stable oils from bio-oil upgrader using refinery facilities economically more favorable than final biofuel blending from refineries and create win-win economic scenarios between the bio-oil upgrader and the refinery. The range of the cost of production (COP) of stable oil (328MWor 0.424 t/t bio-oil), steam (49.5MWor 0.926 t/t bio-oil), and off-gas or fuel gas (72.3MWor 0.142 t/t bio-oil) from a bio-oil (LHV of 23.3 MJ/kg) upgrader process is evaluated on the basis of individual product energy values and global warming potential (GWP) impacts. The minimum and the maximum annualized capital charges predicted by the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis correspond to 25 operating years and 10% IRR, and 10 operating years and 20% IRR, respectively. On the basis of this DCF strategy and 1200 $/t of hydrogen and 540 $/t of biodiesel market prices, the selling prices of 259.32 $/t, 34.85 $/t, and 174.27 $/t of the stable oil, steam, and fuel gas, respectively, from the upgrader to the refinery were obtained to create win-win marginal incentive for the upgrader and refinery systems, individually. If stable oil from a bio-oil upgrader can be launched as a product potentially to be used in refinery hydrocracker (at a competitive price of 490 $/t), for the production of renewable diesel, upgrader can be operated independently, such as purchase hydrogen from vendors at competitive price, with comparative marginal incentives. The bio-oil upgraders, either stand-alone or integrated, were designed to meet desired product specifications, diesel with specific gravity 0.825 and cetane number 57 and stable oil with API 30.1 and cetane number 28.7, for coprocessing through the refinery hydrocracker, respectively. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis is a promising technology for the production advanced cellulosic biofuels. Fast pyrolysis is a liquefaction process that takes place at mild temperatures and atmospheric pressure. This thermal process employs fast heating rates with residence times of a few seconds. During fast pyrolysis, biomass is fed into an oxygen-free environment to encourage formation of liquids rather than gaseous products. Bio-oil contains more than 300 different compounds including aldehydes, carboxylic acids, anhydrosugars, and pyrolytic lignin. Research laboratories are developing processes that convert bio-oil compounds into hydrocarbons. Results indicate that corn stover biorefineries could produce naphtha and diesel range stock fuel for the hydrogen purchase and production scenarios, respectively.

AB  - This study examines fuel properties and performance characteristics of diesel engine fueled with three different biodiesel mixtures (soybean, canola and palm oils) and their blends with diesel fuel according to ASTM and EN standards. Viscosity and pour point of soybean-canola-palm (S-C-P) biodiesel blends were found out of standard ranges. Blend with soybean (25%) - canola (25%) - palm (25%) - diesel (25%) reached acceptable fuel properties (kinematic viscosity 4.3 mm2/s, cetane number 53, pour point -4°C). It performed 3% power loss with 8% higher specific fuel consumption. While CO and CO2 emissions were reduced, NOx emissions were increased with increasing biodiesel contents in blends. As a result, diesel usage was minimized to 25% by blending it with S-C-P biodiesels together.

AB  - The complementary blending of cold-pressed meadowfoam seed oil methyl esters (MFME) with soybean and waste cooking oil methyl esters (SME and WCME) was investigated. MFME prepared from cold-pressed meadowfoam oil exhibited an exceptionally high induction period (IP) of 66.2 h whereas SME and WCME yielded considerably lower values of 5.9 and 4.5 h, respectively. The kinematic viscosities (KVs) of SME and WCME were within the prescribed ranges in the biodiesel standards (ASTM D6751 and EN 14214) but MFME was not due to its content of unique longer-chain fatty acids. Furthermore, the iodine value (IV) of SME was in excess of the maximum limit specified in EN 14214 whereas MFME and WCME were not. Lastly, the cold flow properties of MFME were superior to those of SME and WCME. Complementary blends of MFME-SME and MFME-WCME ameliorated deficiencies of the individual fuels. Blends containing 20-30 vol % MFME in WCME provided IPs, KVs and IVs within the limits prescribed in both ASTM D6751 and EN 14214. With respect to MFME-SME blends, those containing 30-50% MFME complied with the specifications of both biodiesel standards. In addition, highly linear correlations between percentage of MFME and fuel properties were established. Furthermore, the influence of storage for 90 days on fuel properties of the blends was determined. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In commodity chemicals, cost drives everything. A working class family of four drives up to the gas pumps and faces a choice of a renewable diesel or petroleum diesel. Renewable diesel costs $0.50 more per gallon. Which fuel do they pick? Petroleum diesel will be the winner every time, unless the renewable fuel can achieve cost and performance parity with petrol. Nascent producers of advanced biofuels, including Amyris, LS9, Neste and Solazyme, aim to deliver renewable diesel fuels that not only meet the cost challenge, but also exceed the storage, transport, engine performance and emissions properties of petroleum diesel. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Summary Interest in exploiting algae as a biofuel source and the role of inorganic nutrient deficiency in inducing triacylglyceride (TAG) accumulation in cells necessitates a strategy to efficiently formulate species-specific culture media that can easily be manipulated. Using the reference organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we tested the hypothesis that modeling trace element supplements after the cellular ionome would result in optimized cell growth. We determined the trace metal content of several commonly used Chlamydomonas strains in various culture conditions and developed a revised trace element solution to parallel these measurements. Comparison of cells growing in the revised supplement versus a traditional trace element solution revealed faster growth rates and higher maximum cell densities with the revised recipe. RNA-seq analysis of cultures growing in the traditional versus revised medium suggest that the variation in transcriptomes was smaller than that found between different wild-type strains grown in traditional Hutner's supplement. Visual observation did not reveal defects in cell motility or mating efficiency in the new supplement. Ni2+-inducible expression from the CYC6 promoter remained a useful tool, albeit with an increased requirement for Ni2+ because of the introduction of an EDTA buffer system in the revised medium. Other advantages include more facile preparation of trace element stock solutions, a reduction in total chemical use, a more consistent batch-to-batch formulation and long-term stability (tested up to 5 years). Under the new growth regime, we analyzed cells growing under different macro- and micronutrient deficiencies. TAG accumulation in N deficiency is comparable in the new medium. Fe and Zn deficiency also induced TAG accumulation, as suggested by Nile Red staining. This approach can be used to efficiently optimize culture conditions for other algal species to improve growth and to assay cell physiology. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - India's growing population and economy generate an increasing demand for energy. Facing the decline of global fossil fuel resources, the Indian government and energy industry are considering the long-term expansion of biofuel production in order to increase energy security. This development leads to a strong competition of energy crops versus food crops for land and may result in an increasing pressure on natural resources. In a pilot scenario study, the LandSHIFT model is applied to assess the impact of biofuel production on land-use change in India up to the year 2030. The model aims at the spatially explicit simulation of land-use change and its relation to other global change processes on the national up to the global scale. It explicitly addresses competition between land-use activities such as human settlement, biofuel production and food production as well as the resulting effects on the spatial extent of natural land. Baseline of the study is a simulation with drivers from the " Order from Strength" scenario of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. To illustrate the consequences of expanded biofuel production for the extent of natural land, we calculate three scenarios of bioethanol production to substitute 5%, 10% and 20% of the expected petrol demand in 2030. In the simulations shown, a comprehensive linkage is made between driving forces (such as population change) and policies (such as biofuel usage) that will affect land-use change over the coming decades. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to evaluate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions impacts of the use of different alternative biofuels in passenger vehicles in Spain in order to meet EU biofuel goals. Different crop production alternatives are analysed, including the possible import of some raw materials. Availability of land for national production of the raw materials is analysed and indirect land use changes and associated GHG emissions are quantified.There are important differences in GHG emissions of biofuels depending on the raw material used and whether this is domestically produced or imported. Ethanol production using imported cereals and FAME production using domestic rapeseed have the highest GHG emissions per kilometre driven. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) production from sunflower has shown the lowest emissions. When taking into account the results of GHG emissions savings per hectare, these findings are somehow reversed. Production of ethanol and around 12% of FAME can be done domestically. The rest will need to be imported and will cause indirect land use change (ILUC). Therefore, ethanol production will not displace any land, whereas FAME production will displace some amounts of land. Calculated ILUC factors are 29%-34%. The additional GHG emissions due to these indirect land use changes are significant (67%-344% of life cycle GHG emissions).Standalone, the EU biofuel targets can have important benefits for Spain in terms of global warming emissions avoided. However, when considering the impact of land use change effects, these benefits are significantly reduced and can even be negative. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel promoters have advocated techno-scientific research for more efficiently converting non-food renewable resources into biofuels. The latter systems may have more efficient input-output ratios for their specific purpose, but this depends on uniform inputs and imposes great environmental burdens. Greater efficiency has been a long-standing incentive and pretext to extend agro-industrial systems that enclose commons of many kinds. Biofuels can be understood as a global integrated network linking current markets with potential future ones. Industrial strategies integrate states and natural resources in networks of commodity flows. Eco-efficient technological solutions often have been expected to avoid future harm by reducing pressure on natural resources. A more fundamental feature is the private colonization of resources facilitating their greater usage. Techno-scientific innovations have been celebrated for greater efficiency, yet this depends on plunder of human and natural resources, especially in the agricultural sector.

AB  - Biodiesel has recently reemerged as a common fuel. However, emissions from biodiesel combustion have been studied in much less detail than those from traditional petroleum-based diesel. In this experiment, emissions from the combustion of different fuel blends (B00, B02, B20, B99, where the number after B indicates the percentage, by volume, of biodiesel in the fuel) in a VW TDi engine were analyzed by aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometers (ATOFMS) for single-particle composition and vacuum aerodynamic size. The ATOFMS results show that the PAH molecular weight distribution is not significantly affected by the fuel composition, and that sulfates are reduced by increased biodiesel content. Octanedioic acid (a carbonyl species) is increased with increased biodiesel concentration. Clustering results from the single-particle spectra show that the particles fall in five main types by chemical composition. The aerodynamic size distribution of these individual clusters was also determined. These results also show that methods used to identify diesel particle emissions for source apportionment are not applicable when significant concentrations of biodiesel are used in fuels. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Governments around the world see biofuels as a common solution to the multiple policy challenges posed by energy insecurity, climate change and falling farmer incomes. The Indian government has enthusiastically adopted a second-generation feedstock - the oilseed-bearing shrub, Jatropha curcas - for an ambitious national biodiesel program. Studies estimating the production capacity and potential land use implications of this program have typically assumed that the 'waste land' slated for Jatropha production has no economic value and that no activities of note will be displaced by plantation development. Here we examine the specific local impacts of rapid Jatropha plantation development on rural livelihoods and land use in Rajasthan, India. We find that in Jhadol Tehsil, Jatropha is planted on both government and private land, and has typically displaced grazing and forage collection. For those at the socioeconomic margins, these unconsidered impacts counteract the very benefits that the biofuel programs aim to create. The Rajasthan case demonstrates that local land-use impacts need to be integrated into decision-making for national targets and global biofuel promotion efforts. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study is focused on hydrocarbon production through changing carrier gas and using zeolite catalysts during pyrolysis. A large reduction in high molecular weight, oxygenated compounds was noticed when the carrier gas was changed from helium to hydrogen during pyrolysis. A catalytic pyrolysis was conducted using two different methods based on how the biomass and catalysts were contacted together. For both methods, there was no significant change in the carbon yield with the change in pyrolysis environment. However, the mixing-method produced higher aromatic hydrocarbons than the bed-method. In addition, two methods were also tested using two ratios of biomass to catalyst. Nonetheless, there was no significant increase in hydrocarbon yield as the catalyst loading was increased from two to five times of biomass in the catalyst-bed method. In contrast to this, a significant increase was noticed for the catalytic-mixing method when the biomass to catalyst loading was increased from 1:4 to 1:9. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An Aspergillus oryzae whole-cell biocatalyst which coexpresses Fusarium heterosporum lipase (FHL) and mono- and di-acylglycerol lipase B (mdlB) in the same cell has been developed to improve biodiesel production. By screening a number of transformants, the best strain was obtained when FHL gene was integrated into A. oryzae chromosome using sC selection marker while mdlB was integrated using niaD selection marker. The reaction system using the lipase-coexpressing whole-cells was found to be superior in biodiesel production to others such as lipase-mixing and two-step reactions, affording the highest reaction rate and the highest ME content (98%). Moreover, an ME content of more than 90% was maintained during 10 repeated batch cycles. The whole-cell biocatalyst developed in this work would be promising biocatalysts for efficient biodiesel production. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many analytical procedures have been developed to determine the composition of reaction mixtures during transesterification of vegetable oils with alcohols. However, despite their accuracy, these methods are time consuming and cannot be easily used for on-line monitoring. In this work, a fast analytical method was developed to on-line monitor the transesterification reaction of high oleic sunflower oil with ethanol using Near InfraRed spectroscopy and a multivariate approach. The reactions were monitored through sequential scans of the reaction medium with a probe in a one-liter batch reactor without collecting and preparing samples. To calibrate the NIR analytical method, gas chromatography-flame ionization detection was used as a reference method. The method was validated by studying the kinetics of the EtONa-catalyzed transesterification reaction. Activation energy (51.0. kJ/mol) was also determined by considering a pseudo second order kinetics model. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Worldwide biofuel products have rapidly entered the market and consequently so did the availability of their by-products for feed production. A pro-active emerging risk system for biofuel by-products is essential in order to prevent the occurrence of emerging hazards in feed and livestock production. In the current study, two biofuel by-products were elaborated upon, namely Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles (DDGS) resulting from bioethanol production and microalgae slurry resulting from biodiesel production. A holistic approach was used in which both factors from within the feed chain as well as outside the feed chain were incorporated. A list of critical factors linking dynamics in the biofuel production chain with possible feed safety risks was established after consultation of experts in in-depth interviews. Subsequently, a workshop was organized to determine the most important critical factors. Indicators (signals that indicate a change in critical factors) and information sources were linked to these factors for the individual cases. Based on expert judgment, the most important critical factors identified for the two selected cases were: chain complexity, composition of the feed product, origin of raw materials and climate change. Ranking of the indicators showed that in both cases the number of chain stages was the most important general indicator for feed safety risks.The study showed that following this approach resulted in the selection of critical factors and indicators for emerging feed safety risks related to the use of biofuel by-products. Once critical values (upper and/or lower limits) are assigned to the indicators, the system can support decisions to take actions in an early stage in order to prevent emerging risks in feed due to the use of DDGS or microalgae slurry. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, the process for ethyl ester production is studied using refined sunflower oil, and NaOH, KOH, CH3ONa, and CH3OK, as catalysts. In all cases, the reaction is carried out in a single reaction step. The best conversion is obtained when the catalyst is either sodium methoxide or potassium methoxide. We found that during the transesterification with ethanol, soap formation is more important than in the case of methanol. The saponification reaction consumes an important fraction of the catalyst. The amount of catalyst consumed by this reaction is 100% in the case of using hydroxides as catalyst (KOH or NaOH), and 25%, and 28% when using CH3ONa and CH3OK as catalysts, respectively. Ethanol increases the catalyst solubility in the oil-ethyl ester phase, thus accelerating the saponification reaction. It is possible to obtain high conversions in a one-step reaction, with a total glycerine concentration close to 0.25%. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The synthesis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) as a substitute to petroleum diesel was investigated in this study from crude jatropha oil (CJO), a non-edible, low-cost alternative feedstock, using aluminium modified heterogeneous basic oxide (Mg-Zn) catalyst. The transesterification reaction with methanol to methyl esters yielded 94% in 6. h with methanol-oil ratio of 11:1, catalyst loading of 8.68 wt.% at 182 °C and the properties of CJO fuel produced were determine and found to be comparable to the standards according to ASTM. In the range of experimental parameters investigated, it showed that the catalyst is selective to production of methyl esters from oil with high free fatty acid (FFA) and water content of 7.23% and 3.28%, respectively in a single stage process. Thus, jatropha oil is a promising feedstock for methyl ester production and large scale cultivation will help to reduce the product cost. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The by-product of sugar refinery-waste molasses was explored as alternative to glucose-based medium of Chlorella protothecoides in this study. Enzymatic hydrolysis is required for waste molasses suitable for algal growth. Waste molasses hydrolysate was confirmed as a sole source of full nutrients to totally replace glucose-based medium in support of rapid growth and high oil yield from algae. Under optimized conditions, the maximum algal cell density, oil content, and oil yield were respectively 70.9. g/L, 57.6%, and 40.8. g/L. The scalability of the waste molasses-fed algal system was confirmed from 0.5. L flasks to 5. L fermenters. The quality of biodiesel from waste molasses-fed algae was probably comparable to that from glucose-fed ones. Economic analysis indicated the cost of oil production from waste molasses-fed algae reduced by 50%. Significant cost reduction of algal biodiesel production through fermentation engineering based on the approach is expected. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The enzymatic transesterification of oils with an alcohol, using recombinant cutinase of Fusarium solani pisi microencapsulated in sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT)/isooctane reversed micelles, was performed in a membrane bioreactor (MBR). A tubular ceramic membrane with a nominal molecular weight cut off of 15,000Da was used to retain the enzyme, and characterized in terms of rejection coefficients of the reaction components by transmission experiments. The performance of the MBR in a total recirculation-batch mode was compared with results obtained in a stirred batch tank reactor. The continuous operation of the MBR was also evaluated and the influence of the alcohol type and permeate flow rate on conversion degree and productivity (up to 500gproduct/day/genzyme was attained) were analyzed. Cutinase wild type and mutant T179C were tested for this process and the high long-term operational stability of the cutinase mutant demonstrated its potential as biocatalyst for the enzymatic continuous production of biodiesel. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The increase in crude petroleum prices, limited resources of fossil fuels and environmental concerns have led to the search of alternative fuels, which promise a harmonious correlation with sustainable development, energy conservation, efficiency and environmental preservation. Biodiesel is well positioned to replace petroleum-based diesel. Biodiesel is a non-toxic, biodegradable and renewable biofuel. But the outstanding technical problem with biodiesel is that, it is more susceptible to oxidation owing to its exposure to oxygen present in the air and high temperature. This happens mainly due to the presence of varying numbers of double bonds in the free fatty acid molecules. This study evaluates oxidation stability of biodiesel produced from Croton megalocarpus oil. Thermal and Oxidation stability of Croton Oil Methyl Ester (COME) were determined by Rancimat and Thermogravimetry Analysis methods respectively. It was found that oxidation stability of COME did not meet the specifications of EN 14214 (6 h). This study also investigated the effectiveness of three antioxidants: 1,2,3 tri-hydroxy benzene (Pyrogallol, PY), 3,4,5-tri hydroxy benzoic acid (Propyl Gallate, PG) and 2-tert butyl-4-methoxy phenol (Butylated Hydroxyanisole, BHA) on oxidation stability of COME. The result showed that the effectiveness of these antioxidants was in the order of PY > PG > BHA. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A trigeneration system (simultaneous production of heating, cooling and electricity) using a heat engine and a vapour compression chiller, running on biofuel, is studied. A system configuration, capable of meeting the three energy demands in a realistic situation, was devised. It consisted of a compression ignition internal combustion engine driving an electric generator, an electrically driven vapour compression heat pump and a peak boiler. Part of the heating demand was met by recovering waste heat from the engine and the heat pump condenser, thus reducing the overall fuel consumption. New criteria parameters, based on the relative magnitudes of the three energy demands, were defined to evaluate thermal performance and CO2 emissions. A comparative analysis between the biofuel trigeneration and conventional fossil fuel with no waste heat recovery was carried out, showing that, depending on the relative values of energy demands and on component characteristics, significant reduction on primary energy consumption (up to 50%) and on CO2 emissions (up to 5% of the original emissions) can be attained with the biofuel-trigeneration combination. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper describes a methodology to explore the (future) spatial distribution of biofuel crops in Europe. Two main types of biofuel crops are distinguished: biofuel crops used for the production of biodiesel or bioethanol, and second-generation biofuel crops. A multi-scale, multi-model approach is used in which biofuel crops are allocated over the period 2000-2030. The area of biofuel crops at the national level is determined by a macro-economic model. A spatially explicit land use model is used to allocate the biofuel crops within the countries. Four scenarios have been prepared based on storylines influencing the extent and spatial distribution of biofuel crop cultivation. The allocation algorithm consists of two steps. In the first step, processing plants are allocated based on location factors that are dependent on the type of biofuel crop processed and scenario conditions. In the second step, biofuel crops are allocated accounting for the transportation costs to the processing plants. Both types of biofuel crops are allocated separately based on different location factors. Despite differences between the scenarios, mostly the same areas are showing growth in biofuel crop cultivation in all scenarios. These areas stand out because they have a combination of well-developed infrastructural and industrial facilities and large areas of suitable arable land. The spatially explicit results allow an assessment of the potential consequences of large-scale biofuel crop cultivation for ecology and environment. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Continuous gas phase deoxygenation of oleic acid in the presence of hydrogen employing a granular 2 wt% Pd/C catalyst was investigated under solvent free conditions. Conversion of oleic acid and selectivity to the desired diesel-like C17 hydrocarbons heptadecane and heptadecenes was studied at different reaction conditions such as temperature, gas flow and catalyst amount. The best hydrocarbon yield was achieved with low reaction temperatures, high catalyst amounts and high hydrogen flows. To further decrease the reaction temperature but yet maintain a pure gas phase reaction, reactions were conducted in vacuum. Furthermore, water was added in varying amounts to support desorption and to determine if catalyst deactivation could be overcome. The deoxygenation catalyst was characterized by nitrogen adsorption isotherms (BET; Brunauer-Emmet-Teller method), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable alternative to petroleum diesel fuel that can contribute to carbon dioxide emission reduction and energy supply. Biodiesel is composed of fatty acid alkyl esters, including fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), and is currently produced through the transesterification reaction of methanol (or ethanol) and triacylglycerols (TAGs). TAGs are mainly obtained from oilseed plants and microalgae. A sustainable supply of TAGs is a major bottleneck for current biodiesel production. Here we report the de novo biosynthesis of FAEEs from glucose, which can be derived from lignocellulosic biomass, in genetically engineered Escherichia coli by introduction of the ethanol-producing pathway from Zymomonas mobilis, genetic manipulation to increase the pool of fatty acyl-CoA, and heterologous expression of acyl-coenzyme A: diacylglycerol acyltransferase from Acinetobacter baylyi. An optimized fed-batch microbial fermentation of the modified E. coli strain yielded a titer of 922 mg L-1 FAEEs that consisted primarily of ethyl palmitate, -oleate, -myristate and -palmitoleate. © 2011 Duan et al.

AB  - Thermochemical conversion processes play a crucial role in all routes from fossil and renewable resources to base chemicals, fuels and energy. Hence, a fundamental understanding of these chemical processes can help to resolve the upcoming challenges of our society. A bench scale pyrolysis set-up has been used to study the thermochemical conversion of rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME), i.e. a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters. A GC×GC, equipped with both a flame ionization detector (FID) and a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS), allows quantitative and qualitative characterization of the reactor feed and product. Analysis of the latter is accomplished using a dedicated high temperature on-line sampling system. Temperature programmed analysis, starting at -40°C, permits effluent characterization from methane up to lignoceric acid methyl ester (C25H50O2), in a single run of the GC×GC. The latter combines a 100% dimethylpolysiloxane primary column with a 50% phenyl polysilphenylene-siloxane secondary column. Modulation is started when the oven temperature reaches 40°C, thus dividing the chromatogram in a conventional 1D and a comprehensive 2D part. The proposed quantification approach allows to combine the quantitative GC×GC analysis with 2 other on-line 1D GC analyses, resulting in a complete and detailed product composition including the measurement of CO, CO2, formaldehyde and water. The GC×GC reveals that the product stream contains a huge variety of valuable products, such as linear alpha olefins, unsaturated esters and aromatics, that could not have been identified and quantified accurately with conventional 1D GC because of peak overlap. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pyrolysis oils have attracted a lot of interest, as they are liquid energy carriers and general sources of chemicals. In this work, gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-TOFMS) techniques were used to provide both qualitative and quantitative results of the analysis of three different pyrolysis oils. The chromatographic methods and parameters were optimized and solvent choice and separation restrictions are discussed. Pyrolysis oil samples were diluted in suitable organic solvent and were analyzed by GC × GC-TOFMS. An average of 300 compounds were detected and identified in all three samples using the ChromaToF (Leco) software. The deconvoluted spectra were compared with the NIST software library for correct matching. Group type classification was performed by use of the ChromaToF software. The quantification of 11 selected compounds was performed by means of a multiple-point external calibration curve. Afterwards, the pyrolysis oils were extracted with water, and the aqueous phase was analyzed both by GC-FID and, after proper change of solvent, by GC × GC-TOFMS. As previously, the selected compounds were quantified by both techniques, by means of multiple point external calibration curves. The parameters of the calibration curves were calculated by weighted linear regression analysis. The limit of detection, limit of quantitation and linearity range for each standard compound with each method are presented. The potency of GC × GC-TOFMS for an efficient mapping of the pyrolysis oil is undisputable, and the possibility of using it for quantification as well has been demonstrated. On the other hand, the GC-FID analysis provides reliable results that allow for a rapid screening of the pyrolysis oil. To the best of our knowledge, very few papers have been reported with quantification attempts on pyrolysis oil samples using GC × GC-TOFMS most of which make use of the internal standard method. This work provides the ground for further analysis of pyrolysis oils of diverse sources for a rational design of both their production and utilization process. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The presence of variability in life cycle analysis (LCA) is inherent due to both inexact LCA procedures and variation of numerical inputs. Variability in LCA needs to be clearly distinguished from uncertainty. This paper uses specific examples from the production of diesel and jet fuels from 14 different feedstocks to demonstrate general trends in the types and magnitudes of variability present in life cycle greenhouse gas (LC-GHG) inventories of middle distillate fuels. Sources of variability have been categorized as pathway specific, coproduct usage and allocation, and land use change. The results of this research demonstrate that subjective choices such as coproduct usage and allocation methodology can be more important sources of variability in the LC-GHG inventory of a fuel option than the process and energy use of fuel production. Through the application of a consistent analysis methodology across all fuel options, the influence of these subjective biases is minimized, and the LC-GHG inventories for each feedstock-to-fuel option can be effectively compared and discussed. By considering the types and magnitudes of variability across multiple fuel pathways, it is evident that LCA results should be presented as a range instead of a point value. The policy implications of this are discussed. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel and diesel-like have been obtained from soybean oil by transesterification and thermal cracking process, respectively. These biofuels were characterized as according to ANP standards by using specific ASTM methods. Ethanol, gasoline, and diesel were purchased from a gas station. Deacetylation degree of chitosan was determined by three distinct methods (conductimetry, FTIR and NMR), and the average degree was 78.95%. The chitosan microspheres were prepared from chitosan by split-coating and these spheres were crosslinked using glutaraldehyde. The surface area of microspheres was determined by BET method, and the surface area of crosslinked microspheres was 9.2 m2 g -1. The adsorption isotherms of cooper, nickel and zinc on microspheres of chitosan were determined in petroleum derivatives (gasoline and diesel oil), as well as in biofuels (alcohol, biodiesel and diesel-like). The adsorption order in all fuels was: Cu &gt; Ni &gt; Zn. The elution tests presented the following preconcentration degrees: &gt;4.5 to ethanol, &gt;4.4 to gasoline, &gt;4.0 to diesel, &gt;3.8 to biodiesel and &gt;3.6 to diesel-like. The application of chitosan microspheres in the metal ions preconcentration showed the potential of this biopolymer to enrich fuel sample in order to be analyzed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Model simulations and experimental measurements were used to investigate the applicability of infrared thermography for the estimation of stomatal conductance and drought stress under sub-optimal meteorological conditions. The study focused on the stomatal conductance index Ig, calculated from the leaf temperature and the temperature of a dry and wet reference leaf. The simulations revealed that Ig is influenced by leaf dimension, wind speed and air temperature and not or hardly by leaf angle, albedo, relative humidity or insolation. In addition, Ig was found to be very sensitive to differences in wind speed, air temperature, insolation, leaf dimension and leaf angle between the measured and the reference leaves. In the experimental part, we evaluated if infrared thermography can be used to improve the knowledge on the water use of Jatropha curcas L., a tropical biofuel crop. Thermal images from Jatropha seedlings grown under three different drought treatments were made on a day with very variable insolation and a day with very low insolation. Smaller newly formed leaves and the active control of the leaf angle proved efficient ways of Jatropha to protect leaves under drought stress from overheating. Ig, assessed in four different ways, and four simplified drought stress indices were derived and related to the measured stomatal conductance (gs) of the seedlings. The strongest correlation with gs and the highest discriminative power between the different water treatments were achieved when Ig was calculated by taking the average leaf temperature per plant and the temperature of the dry and wet reference leaves of this plant, rather than the average temperature of several reference leaves. Using the difference between the dry reference and the measured leaf (Tdry-Tl) as a simplified index gave similar results, although correlations were weaker. Other simplified thermal indices were not well correlated with leaf stomatal conductance or with water treatment. Recommendations were formulated for the measurement of Ig and (Tdry-Tl). © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel is one of the promising renewable, alternative and environmentally friendly biofuels that can be used in diesel engine with little or no modification in the engine. In the present study an experimental investigation has been carried out on the combustion and performance characteristics of a CI engine running with biodiesel under steady state operating conditions. The experimental work has been conducted on a four-cylinder, four-stroke, direct injection (DI) and turbocharged diesel engine. In this investigation, biodiesel (produced from the waste oil by transesterfication process) and normal diesel have been used. During the experiment the in-cylinder pressure and the specific fuel consumption were measured. The experimental results of this study can be summarised as follows. The tests on engine running with different fuels (biodiesel and diesel) have resulted in almost overlapping P-V diagrams. The power output values at 1300rpm and at 105, 210, 315 and 420 Nm torque values for both the diesel and biodiesel fuels are almost the same. The engine running with biodiesel has produced slightly higher in-cylinder pressure and peak heat release rate than the engine running with normal diesel at all operating conditions. Furthermore, the brake specific fuel consumption values for the engine running with biodiesel are higher than the engine running with normal diesel by a maximum of 14%. However, the thermal efficiency of the engine running with biodiesel is lower than engine running by diesel by 10%. © 2011, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

AB  - High-frequency, shore-based radars (HFR) collect hourly, real-time surface current data over broad areas of the coastal ocean and yield insights on time-varying circulation, predict oil spill trajectories, evaluate circulation models, and, in case of a spill, provide responders with real-time data on spill evolution. HFR requires 7.5 kWh/day of power, but the lack of power availability inhibits HFR use in Alaska. We developed a modular, autonomous remote power module (RPM) for Arctic environments. The RPM design facilitates setup and transport to remote sites using small vehicles, and it contains subsystems for power generation, satellite communications, and power performance monitoring. The subsystems are powered by a battery bank (with a 5-day power reserve) charged primarily by wind and solar and secondarily by a biodiesel generator. The RPM is a stand-alone device for long-term deployments. It minimizes permit issues associated with diesel generators and logistics costs associated with refueling and maintenance. Performance data from a prototype RPM setup in Barrow, Alaska, in fall 2010 is provided. The system is designed for high latitudes but can be modified for remote coasts elsewhere.

AB  - Vegetable energy has become the essence fuel of farming diesel engine. On the basis of burning tea seed oil in the S195-diesel engine for burning performance, exhaust experiments burning degreased tea seed oil were taken on the smoke, HC, NOx, and CO. Electronic microscope was employed to determine the microstructure of carbon particle. Results showed that it was feasible to combust the preprocessed tea seed oil, or mixture of tea seed oil with diesel oil on the diesel engine. The burning performance was good, which the exhaust was less than that of diesel oil, and the carbon accumulated on the fuel jet reduced. So the combustion was more qualified.

AB  - The first comprehensive life-cycle assessment (LCA) for soybean biodiesel produced in the U.S. was completed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in 1998, and the energy inventory for this analysis was updated in 2009 using 2002 data. The continual adoption of new technologies in farming, soybean processing, and for biodiesel conversion affects the life-cycle energy use over time, requiring that LCA practitioners update their models as often as possible. This study uses the most recently available data to update the energy life-cycle of soybean biodiesel and makes comparisons with the two past studies. The updated analysis showed that the fossil energy ratio (FER) of soybean biodiesel was 5.54 using 2006 agricultural data. This is a major improvement over the FER of 3.2 reported in the 1998 NREL study that used 1990 agricultural data and significantly better than the FER of 4.56 reported using 2002 data. The improvements are primarily due to improved soybean yields and more energy-efficient soybean crushing and conversion facilities. The energy input in soybean agriculture was reduced by 52%, in soybean crushing by 58% and in transesterification by 33% per unit volume of biodiesel produced. Overall, the energy input reduction was 42% for the same amount of biodiesel produced. The addition of secondary inputs, such as farm machinery and building materials, did not have a significant effect on the FER. The FER of soybean biodiesel is likely to continue to improve over time because of increases in soybean yields and the development of increasingly energy-efficient technologies. © 2011 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Recently, research on internal combustion engines has focused on reducing CO2 emission in response to strict regulations and increasing fuel economy because of depletion of fossil fuel. To this end, various alternative energy sources have been studied in many countries. Among these, the biodiesel has received wide attention as one of those. Biodiesel has several advantages. As a typical example, we can use the existing facilities such as internal combustion engines, fuel supply systems, and gas stations. Furthermore, although biodiesel has similar structure to diesel, vehicle using biodiesel emit less emission gases than conventional diesel because of oxygen content. Also, we can obtain biodiesel from many sources. However, biodiesel has physical and chemical differences according to each kind of source. In addition, it has several problems such as corrosiveness, saturation of fuel hose and viscosity at low temperature. In this study, we analyzed engine performance and emission characteristics by different biodiesel fuel. Then we compared the results with that of diesel fuel.

AB  - The Government of India launched National Biofuel Mission in 2003, primarily with a view to explore the potential of biofuels as a cleaner source of energy and to partially offset the growing burden of crude oil import bills. This paper analyzed the economic viability and long-term sustainability of bioethanol production from sugarcane molasses and commercial feasibility of biodiesel produced from tree-borne oilseeds like jatropha. Based on the analysis the paper indicated that given the slow growth in area and yield of sugarcane on the one hand and rising demand for sugar, potable and industrial demand of ethanol on the other, it is highly unlikely that the blending targets of ethanol with petrol would be met as planned by the Government. To ensure long-term sustainability and economic viability of bioethanol production, it is imperative to diversify the feed-stock basket by including more crops like sweet sorghum and tropical sugar beet and encourage research on industrial production of second generation biofuels. The commercial feasibility of jatropha-based biodiesel largely depends on development of a proper supply chain by augmenting marketing of jatropha seeds, upgrading processing infrastructure and up-scaling biodiesel distribution.

AB  - In this work we report the purification of a crude acetin mixture into mono-, di- and triacetin by countercurrent chromatography. The process was initially tested on a small, semi-preparative scale (0.5 g) to determine its efficiency. The process was then scaled up to accommodate 2.5 g of crude reaction products containing a mixture of the acetins. The solvent system ethyl acetate/n-butanol/water 1:0.2:1 was used in all separation procedures. Mono-, di- and triacetins were separated similarly in the semi-preparative and preparative runs.

AB  - 2-methylpropan-1-ol (isobutanol) is a leading candidate biofuel for the replacement or supplementation of current fossil fuels. Recent work has demonstrated glucose to isobutanol conversion through a modified amino acid pathway in a recombinant organism. Although anaerobic conditions are required for an economically competitive process, only aerobic isobutanol production has been feasible due to an imbalance in cofactor utilization. Two of the pathway enzymes, ketol-acid reductoisomerase and alcohol dehydrogenase, require nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH); glycolysis, however, produces only nicotinamide dinucleotide (NADH). Here, we compare two solutions to this imbalance problem: (1) over-expression of pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase PntAB and (2) construction of an NADH-dependent pathway, using engineered enzymes. We demonstrate that an NADH-dependent pathway enables anaerobic isobutanol production at 100% theoretical yield and at higher titer and productivity than both the NADPH-dependent pathway and transhydrogenase over-expressing strain. Our results show how engineering cofactor dependence can overcome a critical obstacle to next-generation biofuel commercialization. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Kaolin has many industrial uses, especially in the manufacture of paper, ceramics and porcelain. The commercial value of this raw material largely depends on its brightness. However, owing to the natural impurities (primarily iron oxides), much of the kaolin is not applicable for industrial uses. In this work, the process of kaolin bleaching involved an oxalic-acid-enriched, fermented medium from the cultivation of Aspergillus niger XP, the carbon and energy source being biodiesel-derived waste composed of glycerol and fatty acids. This is a novel method of utilizing a waste by-product of the biofuel industry. Oxalic acid was produced during submerged batch culture in a bioreactor. Obtained via this route, the oxalic acid was used as the leaching agent. The central composite rotatable experimental design was used to optimize the process conditions for kaolin bleaching with the aim of achieving the highest possible brightness index and the highest possible iron oxide removal. The study had produced the following major findings: unpurified waste composed of glycerol and fatty acids from a biodiesel manufacturing plant is an effective substrate for oxalic acid biosynthesis; under the conditions optimized via the route shown above, bleaching in the oxalic-acid-enriched culture liquid improves the brightness index and consequently adds value to the kaolin. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To produce high quality bio-oil from biomass using fast pyrolysis, rice husks were pyrolyzed in a 1-5. kg/h bench-scale fluidized-bed reactor. The effect of hot vapor filtration (HVF) was investigated to filter the solid particles and bio-char. The results showed that the total bio-oil yield decreased from 41.7% to 39.5% by weight and the bio-oil had a higher water content, higher pH, and lower alkali metal content when using HVF. One hundred and twelve different chemical compounds were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The molecular weight of the chemical compounds from the condenser and the EP when the cyclone was coupled with HVF in the separation system decreased compared with those from the condenser and EP when only cyclone was used. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Seeking appropriate approaches to utilize the crude glycerol produced in biodiesel production is very important for the economic viability and environmental impacts of biodiesel industry. Gasification may be one of options for addressing this issue. Co-gasification of hardwood chips blending with crude glycerol in various loading levels was undertaken in the study involving a pilot scale fixed-bed downdraft gasifier. The results indicated that crude glycerol loading levels affected the gasifier's performance and the quality of syngas produced. When crude glycerol loading level increased, the CO, CH4, and tar concentrations of the syngas also increased but particle concentration decreased. Though further testing is suggested, downdraft gasifiers could be run well with hardwood chips blending with liquid crude glycerol up to 20 (wt%). The syngas produced had relatively good quality for fueling internal combustion engines. This study provides a considerable way to utilize crude glycerol. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lipid accumulation abilities of two endophytic fungal isolates - Colletotrichum sp. and Alternaria sp. grown under optimum and nutrient-stress conditions were investigated and compared. Significant variations in lipid contents, ranging from 30% to 58% of their dry biomass were found in liquid culture using various carbon sources. Since, >50% of the total lipid was estimated to be neutral lipid for both the fungal species, predicted biodiesel properties were theoretically calculated based upon the determined fatty acid profiles; and the values were found to be comparable to those of commonly used plant oils for biodiesel production. The two endophytes grew successfully on the combined rice straw and wheat bran as substrate that was degraded by their secretory enzymes including cellulase [1.21-2.51. FPU/g dry substrate (gds)] in solid state fermentation and produced substantial amount of lipid (60.32-84.30. mg/gds). Our study highlights the potential utilities of these two novel endophytic fungi as biodiesel feedstock. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Algae are interesting potential sources of biodiesel, although research is still needed to develop efficient large scale productions. One major factor affecting productivity is light use efficiency. The effect of different light regimes on the seawater alga Nannochloropsis gaditana was accessed monitoring growth rate and photosynthetic performances. N. gaditana showed the capacity of acclimating to different light intensities, optimizing its photosynthetic apparatus to illumination. Thanks to this response, N. gaditana maintained similar growth rates under a wide range of irradiances, suggesting that this organism is a valuable candidate for outdoor productions in variable conditions. In the conditions tested here, without external CO2 supply, light intensity alone was not found to be a major signal affecting lipids accumulation showing the absence of a direct regulatory link between the light stress and lipids accumulation. Strong illumination can nevertheless indirectly influences lipid accumulation if combined with other stresses or in the presence of excess CO2. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, the time varying characteristics of microalgal cultures are investigated. Microalgae are a promising source of biofuels and other valuable chemicals; a better understanding of their dynamic behavior is, however, required to facilitate process scale-up, optimization and control. Growth and oil production rates are evaluated as a function of carbon and nitrogen sources concentration. It is found that nitrogen has a major role in controlling the productivity of microalgae. Moreover, it is shown that there exists a nitrogen source concentration at which biomass and oil production can be maximized. A mathematical model that describes the effect of nitrogen and carbon source on growth and oil production is proposed. The model considers the uncoupling between nutrient uptake and growth, a characteristic of algal cells. Validity of the proposed model is tested on fed-batch cultures. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study examined the potential of producing an edible fungus, Rhizopus microsporus var. oligosporus, on biodiesel-derived crude glycerol. Prolific fungal growth was observed with a fungal biomass yield of 0.83 ± 0.02 (g biomass increase/g. initial biomass) under optimal cultivation conditions (e.g. nonsterile crude glycerol at a concentration of 75% (w/v) with nutrient supplementation and without pH control). The potential of utilizing front-end processed banagrass (Pennisetum purpureum) juice as a source of nutrients for crude glycerol fermentation was evaluated with a 2.3-fold improvement in the fungal biomass yield. The glycerol-derived fungal biomass showed high amounts of threonine, one of the main limiting amino acids in non-ruminant feeds. An inexpensive fungal protein has the potential to reduce meat product prices by lowering the production costs of animal feeds. The application of fungal technology thus provides a unique sustainable option for biodiesel refineries by providing an additional source of revenue from fungal products. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the present study, a system with high lipase expression in Aspergillus oryzae was developed using an improved enolase promoter (P-enoA124) and the 5′ untranslated region of a heat-shock protein (Hsp-UTR). P-enoA142 enhanced the transcriptional level of a heterologous lipase gene and Hsp-UTR improved its translational efficiency. Fusarium heterosporum lipase (FHL) was inserted into a pSENSU-FHL expression vector harboring P-enoA142 and Hsp-UTR and was transformed into an A. oryzae NS4 strain. Transformants possessing pSENSU-FHL in single (pSENSU-FHL#1) and double copies (pSENSU-FHL#2) were selected to evaluate the lipase activity of the whole-cell biocatalyst. The two strains, pSENSU-FHL#1 and #2, showed excellent lipase activity in hydrolysis compared with the strain transformed with conventional expression vector pNAN8142-FHL. Furthermore, by using pSENSU-FHL#2, methanolysis could proceed much more effectively without deactivation, which allowed a swift addition of methanol to the reaction mixture, thereby reducing reaction time. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Biodiesel from animal fats appears as an alternative for conventional diesel in automotive consumption. Animal fats are classified into three categories, although only one of them can be used for biodiesel production, according to regulation. Due to its novelty, researchers testing animal-fat biodiesel on diesel engines focus only on regulated emissions. In this paper, the experiments carried out analyze carbonyl compounds emissions, due to its highly atmospheric reactivity, to complete the characterization of the total emissions in this kind of biofuel. Two fuels, a reference petro-diesel and a pure animal-fat biodiesel, were tested in a 4-cylinder, direct injection, diesel engine Nissan Euro 5 M1D-Bk. Samples were collected in 4 different operating modes and 3 points along the exhaust line. The analyses of samples were made in a high performance liquid chromatography, following the method recommended by the CARB to analyze air quality. Results show, on the one hand, a significant rise in carbonyl emissions, almost three times at the mode with highest hydrocarbon emissions, when biodiesel is used. On the other hand, on average, a reduction of 90% of carbonyl emissions when exhaust gases go through the different post-treatment systems installed. Despite this reduction, specific reactivity does not decrease substantially. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of a new, straw-based fibre manufacturing technology integrated to bioenergy and biofuels production. The process is based on a novel hot water treatment and subsequent mechanical refining, both of which are performed at a high temperature. Soda process, ethanol production, and chemical defibration based on hot water treatment and subsequent alkaline peroxide bleaching were selected as references. The idea is to utilise the fibre fraction for packaging and the dissolved solids and the formed fines for energy. The investment costs of this process are significantly lower than those of a soda process. Additionally, a chemicals recovery process is unnecessary. Furthermore, the process offers an attractive alternative for biogas production. However, the assessment showed that the process could only be economical in some terms. Subsidies for investment would probably be needed to promote the acceptance of this environmentally safe process.

AB  - There is increasing interest in Zimbabwe in developing a biofuels industry based on the production of biodiesel using Jatropha as the main feedstock. This has led to the introduction of Jatropha as a commercial energy crop in the country. There are plans to grow 1220 km2 of Jatropha which will supply about 365,000 t of seed. This will provide about 110 dam3 of biodiesel required to achieve a blending level of 10% with petro-diesel. The availability and suitability of land for the production of Jatropha cannot be taken for granted, particularly given the fact that the concept and practice of production of feedstocks for biofuels remain contested on the threat they pose to food security. Determining the land that is potentially available for biofuels is a non-trivial task. A multiplicity of factors needs to be considered. It is important to determine the spatial extent of areas with suitable growth conditions for Jatropha. The interaction of soil type and land use is an important interface in agriculture. Added to this is the need to balance food, fodder and fuel supply in land use planning. This paper attempts to assess the availability and suitability of various land types as well as agro-ecological conditions for the production of Jatropha in Zimbabwe. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Performance and emission characteristics of two compression ignited engines of different compression ratios, number of cylinders, cooling system, and power output are studied. Waste vegetable oil-derived biofuel is used. Engines are fueled with B0, B20 and B100 mixtures. Thermal efficiency, brake specific consumption and engine emissions (CO, Unburned HC, O2 and NO) are reported and comparisons are made for fuel mixtures running on both engines. Trends of emissions and performance curves are compared to the literature of the available data. It is noted that the biofuel certainly affects unburned HC emissions regardless of engine specifications and/or operating conditions. However, the type of fuel or adding biofuel to diesel may not affect parameters such as exhaust gas temperature and emissions (CO, Unburned HC, O2, NO). These parameters may change as functions of engine specifications and operating conditions regardless of biofuel or diesel being used. These findings are supported by separate investigations using different biofuels in literature. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - One necessary criterion for a biofuel to be a sustainable alternative to the petroleum fuels it displaces is a positive net energy balance. This study estimated the net energy ratio (NER), net energy balance (NEB), and net energy yield (NEY) of small-scale on-farm production of canola [Brassica napus (L.)] and soybean [Glycine max (L.)] biodiesel in the upper Midwest. Direct and embodied energy inputs based on well-defined system boundaries and contemporary data were used to estimate the energy requirement of crop production, oil extraction, and biofuel processing. The NER of canola biodiesel was 1.78 compared with 2.05 for soybean biodiesel. Canola biodiesel had a NEB of 0.66 MJ MJ-1 of biofuel compared with 0.81 MJ MJ-1 for soybean biodiesel. The NEY of soybean biodiesel was 10,951 MJ ha-1, less than canola biodiesel which had a NEY of 11,353 MJ ha-1. Use of soybean as a biodiesel feedstock was more energetically efficient than canola primarily due to reduced nitrogen fertilizer requirement. In terms of energetic productivity, canola was a more productive biodiesel feedstock than soybean due to its higher oil content. A best-case scenario based on optimal feedstock yields, reduced fertilizer input, and advanced biofuel processing equipment suggested that potential gains in energetic efficiency was greater for canola than soybean. According to our results, small-scale on-farm biodiesel production using canola and soybean can be an energetically efficient way to produce energy for on-farm use. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sediments from eutrophic reservoir Bugach (Siberia, Russia) were tested for possibility to produce biodiesel. We supposed that the sediments could be a promising biodiesel producer. The major reason of high price of biodiesel fuel is cost of a raw material. The use of dredging sediments for biodiesel production reduces production costs, because the dredging sediments are by-products which originated during lake restoration actions, and are free of cost raw materials. Lipid content in sediments was 0.24% of dry weight. To assess the potential of from sediments as a substitute of diesel fuel, the properties of the biodiesel such as cetane number, iodine number and heat of combustion were calculated. All of this parameters complied with limits established by EN 14214 and EN 14213 related to biodiesel quality. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, a simple and solvent-free method was used to prepare sulfated zirconia-alumina (SZA) catalyst. Its catalytic activity was subsequently investigated for the transesterification of Jatropha curcas L. oil to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). The effects of catalyst preparation parameters on the yield of FAME were investigated using Design of Experiment (DOE). Results revealed that calcination temperature has a quadratic effect while calcination duration has a linear effect on the yield of FAME. Apart from that, interaction between both variables was also found to significantly affect the yield of FAME. At optimum condition; calcination temperature and calcination duration at 490 °C and 4 h, respectively, an optimum FAME yield of 78.2 wt% was obtained. Characterization with XRD, IR and BET were then used to verify the characteristic of SZA catalyst with those prepared using well established method and also to describe the catalyst characteristic with its activity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microbial lipid accumulation to provide alternative oil resources is an exciting research area, obtaining increasing attentions recently for the biodiesel production due to its high production efficiency and less demand of agricultural land. The aim of this study is to optimize the lipid accumulation of Chlorella vulgaris by using various carbon sources in heterotrophic and mixotrophic cultures. Different cultivation factors were studied on their influences to the cell growth and oil accumulation. Our results revealed that C. vulgaris could grow on autotrophic, mixotrophic and heterotrophic modes; and the mixotrophic cultivation especially could produce more cell biomass than the autotrophic or heterotrophic cultures individually or combined. The substrate concentration significantly influenced the final cell yield of the mixotrophic cultivations while the cell lipid content remained relatively constant. Glycerol was inhibitive to the cell growth while the microalgae strain could actively utilize acetate as the carbon source. This provides a promising niche in reducing the overall cost of biofuel production since this substrate can be obtained from some waste processes such as anaerobic digestion. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the present study, reduced pressure distillation was performed to obtain distilled bio-oil from fast pyrolysis bio-oil. The experiments were completed at temperature 80 °C with a residual pressure of 15 mmHg. The distilled bio-oil yields of 61 wt% from reduced pressure distillation of fast pyrolysis bio-oil were obtained. The oxygen contents of the distilled bio-oil is 9.2 wt% and the distilled bio-oil has lower content of oxygen than the fast pyrolysis bio-oil. For this reason, compared with the fast pyrolysis bio-oil, the distilled bio-oil has higher heating value, lower corrosivity and better stability. The heating value of distilled bio-oil is 34.2 MJ/kg, which is about 2 times of that of fast pyrolysis bio-oil. It is found that the distilled bio-oil stored at 60 °C results in a weight loss of about 0.3% for mild steel and the distilled bio-oil's viscosity hardly increases during storage. These properties of distilled bio-oil make it more suitable for fuel oil use or as a source of chemicals than fast pyrolysis bio-oil. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study reports the results of an experimental investigation of the performance of an IC engine fueled with a Karanja biodiesel blends, followed by multi-objective optimization with respect to engine emissions and fuel economy, in order to determine the optimum biodiesel blend and injection timings complying with Bharat Stage II emission norms. Nonlinear regression has been used to regress the experimentally obtained data to predict the brake thermal efficiency, NOx, HC and smoke emissions based on injection timing, blend ratio and power output. To acquire the data, experimental studies have been conducted on a single cylinder, constant speed (1500 rpm), direct injection diesel engine under variable load conditions and injection timings for neat diesel and various Karanja biodiesel blends (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 50% and 100%). Retarding the injection timing for neat Karanja biodiesel resulted in an improved efficiency and lower HC emissions. A tradeoff relationship between the NOx and smoke emissions is observed, which makes it difficult to determine the optimum blend ratio. The functional relationship developed between the correlating variables using nonlinear regression is able to predict the performance and emission characteristics with a correlation coefficient (R) in the range of 0.95-0.99 and very low root mean square errors. The outputs obtained using these functions are used to evaluate the multi-objective function of optimization process in the 0-20% blend range. The overall optimum is found to be 13% biodiesel-diesel blend with an injection timing of 24°bTDC, when equal weightage is given to emissions and efficiency. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Use of ethanol as a transportation fuel in the United States has grown from 76 dam3 in 1980 to over 40.1 hm3 in 2009 - and virtually all of it has been produced from corn. It has been debated whether using corn ethanol results in any energy and greenhouse gas benefits. This issue has been especially critical in the past several years, when indirect effects, such as indirect land use changes, associated with U.S. corn ethanol production are considered in evaluation. In the past three years, modeling of direct and indirect land use changes related to the production of corn ethanol has advanced significantly. Meanwhile, technology improvements in key stages of the ethanol life cycle (such as corn farming and ethanol production) have been made. With updated simulation results of direct and indirect land use changes and observed technology improvements in the past several years, we conducted a life-cycle analysis of ethanol and show that at present and in the near future, using corn ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emission by more than 20%, relative to those of petroleum gasoline. On the other hand, second-generation ethanol could achieve much higher reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. In a broader sense, sound evaluation of U.S. biofuel policies should account for both unanticipated consequences and technology potentials. We maintain that the usefulness of such evaluations is to provide insight into how to prevent unanticipated consequences and how to promote efficient technologies with policy intervention. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines some of the economic tradeoffs in the joint production of biochar and bio-oil from cellulosic biomass. The pyrolysis process can be performed at different final temperatures, and with different heating rates. While most carbonization technologies operating at low heating rates (large biomass particles) result in higher yields of charcoal, fast pyrolysis (which processes small biomass particles) is the preferred technology to produce bio-oils. Varying operational and design parameters can change the relative quantity and quality of biochar and bio-oil produced for a given feedstock. These changes in quantity and quality of both products affect the potential revenue from their production and sale. We estimate quadratic production functions for biochar and bio-oil. The results are then used to calculate a product transformation curve that characterizes the yields of bio-oil and biochar that can be produced for a given amount of feedstock, movement along the curve corresponds to changes in temperatures, and it can be used to infer optimal pyrolysis temperature settings for a given ratio of biochar and bio-oil prices. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel production has recently attracted much attention. Some anticipate substantial social and environmental benefits, while at the same time expecting sound profitability for investors. Others are doubtful, envisaging large trade-offs between the pursuit of social, environmental and economic objectives, particularly in poor countries in the tropics. The paper explores these issues in Tanzania, which has been an African forerunner in the cultivation of a bio-oil shrub called Jatropha curcas L. We trace how isolated Jatropha biofuel experiments developed since early 2005 towards a sectoral production and innovation system, and we investigate to what extent that system has been capable of developing and maintaining sustainable practices and producing sustainable outcomes. The application of evolutionary innovation theory allows us to view the developments in the sector as a result of evolutionary variation and selection on the one hand, and revolutionary contestation between different coalitions of stakeholders on the other. Both these processes constitute significant engines of change. While variation and selection are driven predominantly by localised technical and agronomic learning, the conflict-driven dynamics are highly globalised and occur primarily as a result of reflexive learning about problematic sustainability impacts. The sector is found to have moved some way towards a full sectoral innovation and production system, but it is impossible to predict whether a viable sector with a strong "triple bottom line" orientation will ultimate emerge, since many issues surrounding the social, environmental and financial sustainability still remain unresolved, especially relating to local and global governance. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Variation in oil content and fatty acid profile (FAP) of Calophyllum inophyllum; a potential biodiesel feedstock species were studied at different maturity stages and biodiesel quality parameters were estimated based on the FAP. A steady increase in oil content was observed with maturity. Variation in palmitic (16:0) and linoleic (18:2) acids followed exactly opposite trends where palmitic acid content has decreased and linoleic acid content has increased 77 days after anthesis. Oleic acid (18:1) content has shown a steady increase. Stearic acid (18:0) content remained steady up to 68 days after anthesis and then felt slightly in 77 days after anthesis. Linoleic and eicosanoic acids were found to exist in low concentrations demonstrated very little compositional variation with fruit maturity. Estimated biodiesel parameters of all maturity stages were found to comply with industrial standards. Even though 48 days after anthesis had the most ideal FAP for biodiesel production, ∼77 days after anthesis is preferred point to harvest due to higher oil content. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel is a biodegradable, renewable, non-toxic and environmentally friendly alternative fuel. The cost of raw materials comprises 60-88% of the production cost in commercial biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters, FAMEs) production. Therefore, the use of low-cost raw material as a substrate and an in situ process for biodiesel production are being preferred. In this case, rice bran, which contains 13.5% oil, was an interesting substrate. In situ esterification of high-acidity rice bran with methanol and sulfuric acid catalyst was investigated. The individual and interaction effects of methanol to rice bran ratio, sulfuric acid catalyst concentration and reaction time on purity and recovery of biodiesel were discussed. Our results suggest that under the following operation conditions: methanol to rice bran ratio of 5. mL/g, sulfuric acid concentration in methanol of 1.5. vol.%, and reaction time of 60. min, an in situ esterification operated on rice bran could yield FAMEs with a high purity and recovery. By applying an in situ esterification with n-hexane/water extractions, Indonesia will be succesfull in obtaining biodiesel from rice bran up to 96,000. ton per year. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of ethanol and biodiesel, which are alternative fuels or biofuels, has increased in the last few years. Modern official standards list 25 parameters that must be determined to certify biodiesel quality, and these analyses are expensive and time-consuming. Near infrared (NIR/NIRS) spectroscopy (4000-12,820 cm-1) is a cheap and fast alternative to analyse biodiesel quality, when compared with infrared, Raman, or NMR methods, and quality control can be done in realtime (on-line).We compared the performance of linear and non-linear calibration techniques - namely, multiple linear regression (MLR), principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLS), polynomial and Spline-PLS versions, and artificial neural networks (ANN) - for prediction of biodiesel properties from near infrared spectra. The model was created for four important biodiesel properties: density (at 15 °C), kinematic viscosity (at 40 °C), water content, and methanol content. We also investigated the influence of different pre-processing methods (Savitzky-Golay derivatives, orthogonal signal correction) on the model prediction capability. The lowest root mean squared errors of prediction (RMSEP) of ANN for density, viscosity, water percentage, and methanol content were 0.42 kg m-3, 0.068 mm2 s-1, 45 ppm, and 51 ppm, respectively. The artificial neural network (ANN) approach was superior to the linear (MLR, PCR, PLS) and "quasi"-non-linear (Poly-PLS, Spline-PLS) calibration methods. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is a biofuel expected to become a substitute for petroleum diesel. One of the most promising technologies for production of biodiesel is enzymatic catalysis. However, low catalytic performance of most of the enzymes employed makes such processes expensive and time-consuming. This work describes a kinetic study of the enzymatic production of biodiesel at different temperatures using either methanolysis or ethanolysis, using immobilized lipase from Candida antarctica (Novozym 435) as catalyst. Reactions kinetics were followed by GC, and data were used to perform thermodynamic analysis of the transition state using Arrhenius equation. We found that methanolysis is faster than ethanolysis at temperatures above 13 °C. Thermodynamic analysis of the kinetics of reactions showed that methanol is favored as acyl acceptor due to the positive activation entropy change of reaction. These data may be useful in the development of new enzymes and new processes for enzymatic production of biodiesel. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As a substitute for diesel and considered a renewable energy, rapeseed-based biodiesel has attracted increasing attention in China. The present work to estimate energy cost of rapeseed-based biodiesel in China is based on embodied energy intensities for various inputs out of a recent extended input-output analysis for Chinese economy, and the accounted life-cycle process of biodiesel production includes four main stages as agricultural crop production, transportation, industrial conversion characterized by alkali-catalyzed transesterification and wastewater treatment. Due to the low rapeseed yield and intensive chemical fertilizer use in China, the overall energy cost of rapeseed-based biodiesel is estimated at 1.1 times of its biodiesel energy output, corresponding to a negative energy return, with essential policy-making implications, in contrast to the positive ones usually reported in previous researches. © 2010.

AB  - During the past several years, near-infrared (near-IR/NIR) spectroscopy has increasingly been adopted as an analytical tool in various fields from petroleum to biomedical sectors. The NIR spectrum (above 4000cm-1) of a sample is typically measured by modern instruments at a few hundred of wavelengths. Recently, considerable effort has been directed towards developing procedures to identify variables (wavelengths) that contribute useful information. Variable selection (VS) or feature selection, also called frequency selection or wavelength selection, is a critical step in data analysis for vibrational spectroscopy (infrared, Raman, or NIRS). In this paper, we compare the performance of 16 different feature selection methods for the prediction of properties of biodiesel fuel, including density, viscosity, methanol content, and water concentration. The feature selection algorithms tested include stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR-step), interval partial least squares regression (iPLS), backward iPLS (BiPLS), forward iPLS (FiPLS), moving window partial least squares regression (MWPLS), (modified) changeable size moving window partial least squares (CSMWPLS/MCSMWPLSR), searching combination moving window partial least squares (SCMWPLS), successive projections algorithm (SPA), uninformative variable elimination (UVE, including UVE-SPA), simulated annealing (SA), back-propagation artificial neural networks (BP-ANN), Kohonen artificial neural network (K-ANN), and genetic algorithms (GAs, including GA-iPLS). Two linear techniques for calibration model building, namely multiple linear regression (MLR) and partial least squares regression/projection to latent structures (PLS/PLSR), are used for the evaluation of biofuel properties. A comparison with a non-linear calibration model, artificial neural networks (ANN-MLP), is also provided. Discussion of gasoline, ethanol-gasoline (bioethanol), and diesel fuel data is presented. The results of other spectroscopic techniques application, such as Raman, ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis), or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies, can be greatly improved by an appropriate feature selection choice. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Besides the second generations bio fuels, one of the most promising products is the bio gas oil, which is a high iso-paraffin containing fuel, which could be produced by the catalytic hydrogenation of different triglycerides. To broaden the feedstock of the bio gas oil the catalytic hydrogenation of waste lard over sulphided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst, and as the second step, the isomerization of the produced normal paraffin rich mixture (intermediate product) over Pt/SAPO-11 catalyst was investigated. It was found that both the hydrogenation and the decarboxylation/decarbonylation oxygen removing reactions took place but their ratio depended on the process parameters (T = 280-380()C, P = 20-80 bar, LHSV = 0.75-3.0h-1 and H2/lard ratio: 600Nm3/m3). In case of the isomerization at the favourable process parameters (T = 360-370()C, P = 40 -50 bar, LHSV = 1.0h-1 and H2/hydrocarbon ratio: 400Nm3/m3) mainly mono-branching isoparaffins were obtained. The obtained products are excellent Diesel fuel blending components, which are practically free of heteroatoms. Copyright 2011 Jen Hancsk et al.

AB  - As the stock of fossil fuels diminishing throughout the world and demands for energy based comforts and mobility ever increasing, so there is a need to increase biodiesel production. Bio diesel is an alternative diesel fuel prepared from renewable resources and is most popular as an alternative energy sources because it is non toxic and biodegradable. India has great potential for production of biodiesel from non-edible oil seeds. From about 100 varieties of oil seeds, only 10-12 varieties have been tapped so far. The promising non-edible sources in India are Madhuca Indica (Mahua),Jatropha curcas(Ratan Jyot), Pongamia pinnata (Karanja) and Melia azadirachta (Neem). This review paper assesses and integrates the biological, chemical and genetic attributes of the plant and describes about the different tree borne oilseeds in India, Extraction of oil from tree borne oilseeds, properties,composition and future potential of bio diesel If the developed process is scaled up to commercial levels then excellent business opportunity will be offered by the biodiesel and it could be a major step towards the creation of an eco-friendly transportation fuel that is relatively clean on combustion and provides farmers with substantial income.

AB  - In this study, we make a general comparison of the accuracy and robustness of five multivariate calibration models: partial least squares (PLS) regression or projection to latent structures, polynomial partial least squares (Poly-PLS) regression, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and two novel techniques based on support vector machines (SVMs) for multivariate data analysis: support vector regression (SVR) and least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs). The comparison is based on fourteen (14) different datasets: seven sets of gasoline data (density, benzene content, and fractional composition/boiling points), two sets of ethanol gasoline fuel data (density and ethanol content), one set of diesel fuel data (total sulfur content), three sets of petroleum (crude oil) macromolecules data (weight percentages of asphaltenes, resins, and paraffins), and one set of petroleum resins data (resins content). Vibrational (near-infrared, NIR) spectroscopic data are used to predict the properties and quality coefficients of gasoline, biofuel/biodiesel, diesel fuel, and other samples of interest. The four systems presented here range greatly in composition, properties, strength of intermolecular interactions (e.g., van der Waals forces, H-bonds), colloid structure, and phase behavior. Due to the high diversity of chemical systems studied, general conclusions about SVM regression methods can be made. We try to answer the following question: to what extent can SVM-based techniques replace ANN-based approaches in real-world (industrial/scientific) applications? The results show that both SVR and LS-SVM methods are comparable to ANNs in accuracy. Due to the much higher robustness of the former, the SVM-based approaches are recommended for practical (industrial) application. This has been shown to be especially true for complicated, highly nonlinear objects. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - We report herein on the conversion of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids to alkanes over Pt/C in high-temperature water. The reactions were done with no added H2. The saturated fatty acids (stearic, palmitic, and lauric acid) gave the corresponding decarboxylation products (n-alkanes) with greater than 90% selectivity, and the formation rates were independent of the fatty acid carbon number. The unsaturated fatty acids (oleic and linoleic acid) exhibited low selectivities to the decarboxylation product. Rather, the main pathway was hydrogenation to from stearic acid, the corresponding saturated fatty acid. This compound then underwent decarboxylation to form heptadecane. On the basis of these results, it appears that this reaction system promotes in situ H 2 formation. This hydrothermal decarboxylation route represents a new path for using renewable resources to make molecules with value as liquid transportation fuels. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

AB  - In order to use Synechocystis PCC 6803 as feedstock of nonpetroleum-based diesel fuel, pulsed electric field (PEF) technology was used for cell disruption prior to extraction of intracellular lipids. Severe cell disruption was evident after PEF treatment, especially with treatment intensity (TI) &gt; 35 kWh/m3. Temperature increase during the treatment brought about most of the destruction of autofluorescence compounds, as well as a fraction of inactivation and the destruction of the plasma and thylakoid membranes. However, the forces associated with the pulsing electric field caused significant damage to the plasma membrane, cell wall, and thylakoid membrane, and it even led to complete disruption of some cells into fragments, which resulted in biomass loss. Treatment by PEF enhanced the potential for the low-toxicity solvent isopropanol to access lipid molecules during subsequent solvent extraction, leading to lower usage of isopropanol for the same extraction efficiency. Thus, PEF shows promise for lowering the costs and environmental effects of the lipid-extraction step. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Aerosol emissions from international shipping are recognized to have a large impact on the Earth's radiation budget, directly by scattering and absorbing solar radiation and indirectly by altering cloud properties. New regulations have recently been approved by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) aiming at progressive reductions of the maximum sulfur content allowed in marine fuels from current 4.5% by mass down to 0.5% in 2020, with more restrictive limits already applied in some coastal regions. In this context, we use a global bottom-up algorithm to calculate geographically resolved emission inventories of gaseous (NOx, CO, SO2) and aerosol (black carbon, organic matter, sulfate) species for different kinds of low-sulfur fuels in shipping. We apply these inventories to study the resulting changes in radiative forcing, attributed to particles from shipping, with the global aerosol-climate model EMAC-MADE. The emission factors for the different fuels are based on measurements at a test bed of a large diesel engine. We consider both fossil fuel (marine gas oil) and biofuels (palm and soy bean oil) as a substitute for heavy fuel oil in the current (2006) fleet and compare their climate impact to that resulting from heavy fuel oil use. Our simulations suggest that ship-induced surface level concentrations of sulfate aerosol are strongly reduced, up to about 40-60% in the high-traffic regions. This clearly has positive consequences for pollution reduction in the vicinity of major harbors. Additionally, such reductions in the aerosol loading lead to a decrease of a factor of 3-4 in the indirect global aerosol effect induced by emissions from international shipping. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel-fueled engine simulations were performed using the KIVA3v-Release 2 code coupled with Chemkin-II for detailed chemistry. The model incorporates a reduced mechanism that was created from a methyl decanoate/methyl-9-decenoate mechanism developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. A combination of Directed Relation Graph, chemical lumping, and limited reaction rate tuning was used to reduce the detailed mechanism from 3299 species and 10806 reactions to 77 species and 209 reactions. The mechanism was validated against its detailed counterpart and predicted accurate ignition delay times over a range of relevant operating conditions. The mechanism was then combined with the ERC PRF mechanism to include n-heptane as an additional fuel component. The biodiesel mechanism was applied in KIVA using a discrete multi-component model with accurate physical properties for the five common components of real biodiesel fuel. A mixture of methyl decanoate and methyl-9-decenoate was used as the biodiesel surrogate to account for both the saturated and unsaturated components found in real biodiesel fuels. Non-reacting biodiesel spray experiments were reproduced using the KIVA model, and the KH-RT spray model constants were adjusted to improve the liquid penetration trend under varying density and temperature conditions. The complete biodiesel engine model was shown to adequately reproduce the pressure and heat release rate predictions of diesel engine combustion experiments fueled with a soy methyl ester biodiesel. These results show that the model gives accurate predictions of biofuel spray vaporization and combustion for these conditions. The current biodiesel model was also compared to a previous model and found to improve the magnitude of the NOx prediction, as well as the trend of decreasing NOx with increasing load. © 2011 SAE International.

AB  - In the Diesel sector the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME's) - in Europe mostly RME *) (rapeseed methyl ester) and in US mostly SME (soja oil methyl ester) - are used as a various share, % volume blends with the Diesel fuel (B5, B7, B10, B20, Bxx). The present joint project focuses on RME being the most important representative of the biofuels of 1st generation in Europe. The influences of RME blend fuels on emissions and on lube oil deterioration are emphasised. Emissions were investigated on a modern engine with exhaust gas aftertreatment devices like SCR and (DPF+ SCR). Beside the legally limited exhaust emission components some non-legislated like NO2, N2O, NH3 and nanoparticles were measured at stationary and dynamic engine operation. The most important findings are: the increased percentage of RME w/o aftertreatment causes an increase of NOx by higher engine load and reduction of CO &amp; HC; at transient operation (ETC) these tendencies are less pronounced and only B100 shows an increase of NOx,. with SCR alone there are no differences of NOx and of NOx reduction rate (KNOX) with increasing RME portion; there is lowering of CO &amp; HC,. with DPF+SCR KNOX-values are slightly higher, than with SCR alone, due to the production of NO2 in the catalytic DPF (upstream of SCR),. there is excellent count filtration efficiency of DPF, up to 99.9%; with SCR alone there is usually a small reduction of nanoparticles concentrations (in the range of 10-20%, similar like an usual oxidation catalyst). The paper describes as well significant problems related to the influences of biofuels on engine lube oils deterioration demonstrated by monitoring the engine lube oil aging during its operation in heavy duty (HD) and modern high speed direct injection (HSDI) light duty (LD) engine through the bench tests. Subject to the long run durability engine tests were both: mineral and synthetic engine lube oils with different improved additives packages and viscosity ranges and with different RME-blending ratios in fuel. The research methodology used: standard analysis as well as in house developed innovative methods, extensive analysis of engine lubricants oxidation stability - thin lubricant film oxidation tests and bulk lubricant oxidation tests. It can be stated that: the presence of bio-components in the fuel has significant impact on multidirectional hastening of engine lube oil destruction processes, kind of base lube oil, lube oil additives components and RME-portion, as well as engine design and its operating conditions are very essential factors influencing the engine lube oil performance, the processes taking place in an engine lubricant, influence adversely the limited possibilities of bio-components evaporation from engine lube oil and contribute to initiation of accelerated, deeper engine lube oil oxidation and degradation. © 2011 SAE International.

AB  - Rising world prices, the growing demand for energy, and the need to mitigate the greenhouse effect are the driving force behind the renewed interest in the use of biofuels. Among the biofuels, biodiesel is one of the best available resources for diesel fuels in diesel engines. Chemically biodiesel is mono alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from renewable feed stock. This article provides in depth and systematic data (reviews from 1944-2010) on technical aspects of biodiesel which will be useful for research and commercial utilization of such promising fuel in a global scenario. This article focused on identification of biodiesel sources, production processes including, pyrolysis, dilution, microemulsion, the transesterification process, biodiesel fuel properties; technical aspects including engine emissions, combustion characteristics and engine performance, and the economic feasibility of biodiesel. This study concludes that biodiesel fuel is needed at this time and an option for the future to overcome the energy crisis and environmental hazards by adapting systematic approaches.

AB  - There is increasing interest in using microalgae as a lipid feedstock for the production of biofuels. Lipids used for these purposes are triacylglycerols that can be converted to fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel) or decarboxylated to "green diesel." Lipid accumulation in most microalgal species is dependent on environmental stress and culturing conditions, and these conditions are currently optimized using slow, labor-intensive screening processes. Increasing the screening throughput would help reduce the development cost and time to commercial production. Here, we demonstrated an initial step towards this goal in the development of a glass/poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic device capable of screening microalgal culturing and stress conditions. The device contained power-free valves to isolate microalgae in a microfluidic growth chamber for culturing and stress experiments. Initial experiments involved determining the biocompatibility and culturing capability of the device using the microalga Tetraselmis chuii. With this device, T. chuii could be successfully cultured for up to 3 weeks on-chip. Following these experiments, the device was used to investigate lipid accumulation in the microalga Neochloris oleabundans. It was shown that this microalga could be stressed to accumulate cytosolic lipids in a microfluidic environment, as evidenced with fluorescence lipid staining. This work represents the first example of microalgal culturing in a microfluidic device and signifies an important expansion of microfluidics into the biofuels research arena. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In this study, optical and thermal properties of normal grade and winter grade palm oil biodiesel were investigated. Surface Plasmon Resonance and Photopyroelectric technique were used to evaluate the samples. The dispersion curve and thermal diffusivity were obtained. Consequently, the variation of refractive index, as a function of wavelength in normal grade biodiesel is faster than winter grade palm oil biodiesel, and the thermal diffusivity of winter grade biodiesel is higher than the thermal diffusivity of normal grade biodiesel. This is attributed to the higher palmitic acid C 16:0 content in normal grade than in winter grade palm oil biodiesel. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - While the use of biodiesel appears to be a promising alternative to petroleum fuel, the replacement of fossil fuel by biofuel may not bring about the intended climate cooling because of the increased soil N2O emissions due to N-fertilizer applications. Using a life cycle assessment approach, we assessed the influence of soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions on the life cycle global warming potential of the production and combustion of biodiesel from canola oil produced in a semiarid climate. Utilizing locally measured soil N2O emissions, rather than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default values, decreased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the production and combustion of 1 GJ biodiesel from 63 to 37 carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e)/GJ. GHG were 1.1 to 2.1 times lower than those from petroleum or petroleum-based diesel depending on which soil N2O emission factors were included in the analysis. The advantages of utilizing biodiesel rapidly declined when blended with petroleum diesel. Mitigation strategies that decrease emissions from the production and application of N fertilizers may further decrease the life cycle GHG emissions in the production and combustion of biodiesel. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The oil and fatty acid composition of thirty-seven Madhuca longifolia genotypes growing in 13 districts of Tamil Nadu, India was determined. Considerable variations between genotypes were found for oil content, fatty acid profile, iodine value, saponification value, cetane number and O/L ratio. The total oil content of mahua ranged from 44.4% to 61.5%. The palmitic acid (11.7-25.9%), stearic acid (19.1-32.2%), oleic acid (32.9-48.6%) and linoleic acid (9.4-15.4%) are the major fatty acids found in mahua seeds. Saponification value, iodine value and cetane number ranged from 198.3-202.8, 52.0-68.6 and 58.0-61.6 respectively. The large variability was observed for all the measured parameters. In consideration of potential utilization, detailed study of this kind would help in exploring the potential of mahua for nutritional and industrial purposes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Introduction of biofuels to the fuel matrix poses new questions and challenges. The present study investigates the microbiological stability of biodiesel blends in small scale microcosms. The study presents results from incubations of diesel-biodiesel blends with contaminated inoculation water collected from diesel storage tanks to ensure the presence of relevant fuel degrading bacteria. DAPI and qPCR analyses has subsequently shown an increased bacterial growth and activity in the microcosms containing biodiesel blends as the carbon source compared to those microcosms where neat fossil diesel made up the carbon source. Several anaerobic microorganisms have been identified after incubation. Presence of methanogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria and nitrate reducing bacteria has furthermore been confirmed by chemical analyses, supplemented by observations of methane formation in biodiesel incubations. The findings will contribute to the knowledge base for a safer introduction of biodiesel in the fuel matrix by employment of proper house-keeping and monitoring methods. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel (e.g. biodiesel) has attracted increasing attention worldwide as blending component or direct replacement for fossil fuel in fuel energized engines. The substitution of petroleum-based diesel with biodiesel has already attained commercial value in many of the developed countries around the world. However, the use of biodiesel has not expanded in developing countries mostly due to the high production cost which is associated with the expensive high-quality virgin oil feedstocks. This research focuses on producing of biodiesel from low cost feedstocks such as used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fat (AF) via alkaline catalyzed transesterification process investigating the effects of process parameters, for example (i) molar ratio of feedstock to methanol (ii) catalyst concentration (iii) reaction temperature and (iv) reaction period on the biodiesel yield. The biodiesel was successfully produced via transesterification process from low cost feedstocks. It was also observed that the process parameters directly influenced the biodiesel yield. The optimum parameters for maximum biodiesel yields were found to be methanol/oil molar ratio of 6:1, catalyst concentration of 1.25 wt% of oil, reaction temperature of 65 °C, reaction period of 2 h and stirring speed of 150 rpm. The maximum biodiesel yields at the optimum conditions were 87.4%, 89% and 88.3% for beef fat, chicken fat and UCO, respectively. The results demonstrate high potential of producing economically viable biodiesel from low cost feedstocks with proper optimization of the process parameters. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recently, the international trade of various bioenergy commodities has grown rapidly, yet this growth is also hampered by some barriers. The aim of this paper is to obtain an overview of what market actors currently perceive as major opportunities and barriers for the development of international bioenergy trade. The work focuses on three bioenergy commodities: bioethanol, biodiesel and wood pellets. Data were collected through an internet-based questionnaire. The majority of the 141 respondents had an industrial background. Geographically, two-thirds were from (mainly Western) Europe, with other minor contributions from all other continents. Results show that import tariffs and the implementation of sustainability certification systems are perceived as (potentially) major barriers for the trade of bioethanol and biodiesel, while logistics are seen mainly as an obstacle for wood pellets. Development of technical standards was deemed more as an opportunity than a barrier for all commodities. Most important drivers were high fossil fuel prices and climate change mitigation policies. Concluding, to overcome some of the barriers, specific actions will be required by market parties and policy makers. Import tariffs for biofuels could be reduced or abolished, linked to multinational trade agreements and harmonization (including provisions on technical standards and sustainability requirements). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Concerns over the sustained availability of fossil fuels and their impact on global warming and pollution have led to the search for fuels from renewable sources to address worldwide rising energy demands. Biodiesel is emerging as one of the possible solutions for the transport sector. It shows comparable engine performance to that of conventional diesel fuel, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the toxicity of products and effluents from the biodiesel industry has not yet been sufficiently investigated. Brazil has a very high potential as a biodiesel producer, in view of its climatic conditions and vast areas for cropland, with consequent environmental risks because of possible accidental biodiesel spillages into water bodies and runoff to coastal areas. This research determined the toxicity to two marine organisms of the water-soluble fractions (WSF) of three different biodiesel fuels obtained by methanol transesterification of castor oil (CO), palm oil (PO), and waste cooking oil (WCO). Microalgae and sea urchins were used as the test organisms, respectively, for culture-growth-inhibition and early-life-stage-toxicity tests. The toxicity levels of the analyzed biodiesel WSF showed the highest toxicity for the CO, followed by WCO and the PO. Methanol was the most prominent contaminant; concentrations increased over time in WSF samples stored up to 120 d. © 2010 SETAC © 2010 SETAC.

AB  - A detailed chemical kinetic reaction mechanism is developed for the five major components of soy biodiesel and rapeseed biodiesel fuels. These components, methyl stearate, methyl oleate, methyl linoleate, methyl linolenate, and methyl palmitate, are large methyl ester molecules, some with carbon. carbon double bonds, and kinetic mechanisms for them as a family of fuels have not previously been available. Of particular importance in these mechanisms are models for alkylperoxy radical isomerization reactions in which a C. C double bond is embedded in the transition state ring. The resulting kinetic model is validated through comparisons between predicted results and a relatively small experimental literature. The model is also used in simulations of biodiesel oxidation in jet-stirred reactor and intermediate shock tube ignition and oxidation conditions to demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of these mechanisms. Differences in combustion properties between the two biodiesel fuels, derived from soy and rapeseed oils, are traced to the differences in the relative amounts of the same five methyl ester components. © 2010 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - This paper presents the regulated emissions profile of a Euro 4 compliant common rail passenger car, fuelled with low concentration biodiesel blends. Four biodiesels of different origin and quality blended with a typical automotive diesel fuel at proportions of 10, 20, and 30% v/v. Emission and fuel consumption measurements were conducted on a chassis dynamometer with constant volume sampling (CVS) technique, over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the real traffic-based Artemis driving cycles. Limited effects were observed on CO2 emissions, while fuel consumption marginally increased with biodiesel. PM, HC and CO emissions improved with the addition of biodiesel, with some exceptions. Some increases with biodiesel were observed over the NEDC, as a consequence of biodiesel characteristics and engine conditions. NOx emissions were increased with the use of biodiesel blends and positively correlated with fuel unsaturation levels. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable and environmentally friendly liquid fuel. However, the feedstock, predominantly crop oil, is a limited and expensive food resource which prevents large scale application of biodiesel. Development of non-food feedstocks are therefore, needed to fully utilize biodiesel's potential. In this study, the larvae of a high fat containing insect, black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) (BSFL), was evaluated for biodiesel production. Specifically, the BSFL was grown on organic wastes for 10 days and used for crude fat extraction by petroleum ether. The extracted crude fat was then converted into biodiesel by acid-catalyzed (1% H2SO4) esterification and alkaline-catalyzed (0.8% NaOH) transesterification, resulting in 35.5 g, 57.8 g and 91.4 g of biodiesel being produced from 1000 BSFL growing on 1 kg of cattle manure, pig manure and chicken manure, respectively. The major ester components of the resulting biodiesel were lauric acid methyl ester (35.5%), oleinic acid methyl ester (23.6%) and palmitic acid methyl ester (14.8%). Fuel properties of the BSFL fat-based biodiesel, such as density (885 kg/m3), viscosity (5.8 mm2/s), ester content (97.2%), flash point (123 °C), and cetane number (53) were comparable to those of rapeseed-oil-based biodiesel. These results demonstrated that the organic waste-grown BSFL could be a feasible non-food feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - The pyrolysis of Chlorella sp. was carried out in a microwave oven with char as microwave reception enhancer. The results indicated that the maximum bio-oil yield of 28.6% was achieved under the microwave power of 750. W. The bio-oil properties were characterized with elemental, GC-MS, GPC, FTIR, and thermogravimetric analysis. The algal bio-oil had a density of 0.98. kg/L, a viscosity of 61.2 cSt, and a higher heating value (HHV) of 30.7. MJ/kg. The GC-MS results showed that the bio-oils were mainly composed of aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, long chain fatty acids and nitrogenated compounds, among which aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons (account for 22.18% of the total GC-MS spectrum area) are highly desirable compounds as those in crude oil, gasoline and diesel. The results in this study indicate that fast growing algae are a promising source of feedstock for advanced renewable fuel production via microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A dual modification procedure composed of cross-linking and protein coating with K2SO4 was employed to modify Geotrichum sp. lipase for catalyzing biodiesel production from waste cooking oil. Compared to single modification of protein coating with K2SO4, the dual modification of cross-linking and lipase coating improved catalytic properties in terms of thermostable stability, organic solvent tolerance, pH stability and operational stability in biodiesel production process, although biodiesel yield and initial reaction rate for CLPCMCs were not improved. After five successive batch reactions, CLPCMCs could still maintain 80% of relative biodiesel yield. CLPCMCs retained 64% of relative biodiesel yield after incubation in a pH range of 4-6 for 4h, and 85% of relative biodiesel yield after incubation in a range of 45-50°C for 4h. CLPCMCs still maintained 83% of relative biodiesel yield after both treated in polar organic solvent and non-polar organic solvent for 4h. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - At present, the notion is generally accepted that societies have to combat climate change. The reduction of CO2-emissions, an important cause for global warming, has become a priority, and consequently there is increasing pressure on governments and industries to come forward with initiatives to reduce CO2-emissions. This is highly relevant for the transport sector, as the share of transportation is still increasing, while other sectors are reducing their CO2-footprint. The main purpose of this paper is to present a methodology to analyse the CO2-emissions from container terminals, illustrated by the Port of Rotterdam. The objective of this paper is twofold. Firstly, the development of a methodology to analyse and gain a better understanding of the CO2-emissions by container terminals in port areas is described. Secondly, the most effective solutions to reduce CO 2-emissions by container terminals in port areas are identified. The study provides insight into the processes of container transshipment at the terminals and the contribution of these processes to the CO2- emissions of the container terminals. Using these insights, potential solutions to reduce the CO2 at the terminals are identified and policy proposals are made for the operators of existing terminals and for governments. The most effective measure for CO2 reduction is undoubtedly the adaptation of the terminal layout as in the example of the Rotterdam Shortsea Terminal. This makes it possible to reduce the CO2-emissions of the current terminals by nearly 70 per cent. The other perspective is the incorporation of mixing 30 per cent biofuels with the presently used diesel. This results in a reduction of CO2-emissions by between 13 and 26 per cent per terminal and a reduction of the emissions of the total container sector by 21 per cent. On the basis of these findings, concrete recommendations are made to reducing CO2-emissions at container terminals. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a steadily increasing in the amount of solid waste due to the increasing human population and urbanization. Waste materials are generated from manufacturing processes, industries and municipal solid wastes (MSW). Waste-to-energy (WTE) technologies convert waste matter into various forms of fuel that can be used to supply energy. Today, a new generation of WTE technologies is emerging which hold the potential to create renewable energy from waste matter, including MSW, industrial waste, agricultural waste, and waste byproducts. There are four major methods for conversion of organic wastes to synthetic fuels: (1) hydrogenation, (2) pyrolysis, (3) gasification, and (4) bioconversion. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fatty acid methyl esters prepared from canola, palm, soybean, and sunflower oils by homogenous base-catalyzed methanolysis were stored for 12 months at three constant temperatures (- 15, 22, and 40 °C) and properties such as oxidative stability, acid value, kinematic viscosity, low temperature operability, and iodine value were periodically measured. Oxidative stability was significantly reduced upon extended storage and acid value as well as kinematic viscosity were increased by only small increments, with these effects more pronounced at elevated temperatures. Iodine value and low temperature operability were essentially unaffected by extended storage. Based on these findings, it is not recommended that acid value or kinematic viscosity be used as indicators of storage stability of biodiesel, nor is it recommended that iodine value be used as a predictor of oxidative stability or indicator of oxidative degradation. © 2010.

AB  - An experimental investigation is conducted to evaluate the effects of using diethyl ether and ethanol as additives to biodiesel/diesel blends on the performance, emissions and combustion characteristics of a direct injection diesel engine. The test fuels are denoted as B30 (30% biodiesel and 70% diesel in vol.), BE-1 (5% diethyl ether, 25% biodiesel and 70% diesel in vol.) and BE-2 (5% ethanol, 25% biodiesel and 70% diesel in vol.) respectively. The results indicate that, compared with B30, there is slightly lower brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) for BE-1. Drastic reduction in smoke is observed with BE-1 and BE-2 at higher engine loads. Nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions are found slightly higher for BE-2. Hydrocarbon (HC) emissions are slightly higher for BE-1 and BE-2, but carbon monoxide (CO) are slightly lower. The peak pressure, peak pressure rise rate and peak heat release rate of BE-1 are almost similar to those of B30, and higher than those of BE-2 at lower engine loads. At higher engine loads the peak pressure, peak pressure rise rate and peak heat release rate of BE-1 are the highest and those of B30 are the lowest. BE-1 reflects better engine performance and combustion characteristics than BE-2 and B30. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Because of the importance of mineral catalyzed decarboxylation reactions in both crude oil formation and, increasingly, biofuel production, we present a model study into the decarboxylation of the shortest fatty acid, propionic acid C2H5COOH, into an alkane and CO2 catalyzed by a pyrophillite-like, phyllosilicate clay. To identify the decarboxylation pathway, we searched for a transition state between the reactant, comprised of the clay plus interlayer fatty acid, and the product, comprised of the clay plus interlayer alkane and carbon dioxide. Using linear and quadratic synchronous transit mechanisms we searched for a transition state followed by vibrational analysis to verify the intermediate found as a transition state. We employed a periodic cell, planewave, ab initio density functional theory computation to examine total energy differences, Mulliken charges, vibrational frequencies, and the frontier orbitals of the reactants, intermediates, and products. The results show that interpretation of vibrational data, Mulliken charges and Fermi-level orbital occupancies is necessary for the classification of a transition state in this type of mixed bulk surface plus interlayer species, clay-organic system. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The use of biofuels, such as bioethanol or biodiesel, has rapidly increased in the last few years. Near infrared (near-IR, NIR, or NIRS) spectroscopy (&gt;4000cm-1) has previously been reported as a cheap and fast alternative for biodiesel quality control when compared with infrared, Raman, or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods; in addition, NIR can easily be done in real time (on-line). In this proof-of-principle paper, we attempt to find a correlation between the near infrared spectrum of a biodiesel sample and its base stock. This correlation is used to classify fuel samples into 10 groups according to their origin (vegetable oil): sunflower, coconut, palm, soy/soya, cottonseed, castor, Jatropha, etc. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used for outlier detection and dimensionality reduction of the NIR spectral data. Four different multivariate data analysis techniques are used to solve the classification problem, including regularized discriminant analysis (RDA), partial least squares method/projection on latent structures (PLS-DA), K-nearest neighbors (KNN) technique, and support vector machines (SVMs). Classifying biodiesel by feedstock (base stock) type can be successfully solved with modern machine learning techniques and NIR spectroscopy data. KNN and SVM methods were found to be highly effective for biodiesel classification by feedstock oil type. A classification error (E) of less than 5% can be reached using an SVM-based approach. If computational time is an important consideration, the KNN technique (E=6.2%) can be recommended for practical (industrial) implementation. Comparison with gasoline and motor oil data shows the relative simplicity of this methodology for biodiesel classification. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A fast pyrolysis process has emerged as one of the techniques to produce transportation fuels using various biomass types that are regionally important. It is well understood that high heating rates, very small particles with low mass transfer limitations, and moderate operating temperatures are essential for obtaining high yield of liquid from the fast pyrolysis process. However, how the heating rates and operating temperatures would influence individual compounds in the liquid obtained from the fast pyrolysis process has not been studied in detail. Therefore, a microscale pyrolysis study was performed by changing different parameters (biomass type, filament heating rate, and final pyrolysis temperature) to understand the influence of these operating parameters on each compound formed during the process. Two biomass types (pine wood and switchgrass) were selected for this study: (i) pine wood was selected because of its availability in the southeastern region of the United States, and (ii) switchgrass was chosen because it has been identified as one of the bioenergy crops in the United States. Pyrolysis temperatures were changed from 450 to 750 °C in increments of 50 °C, whereas the heating rates selected were 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 2000 °C/s. Twenty-eight bio-oil compounds were quantified in each experimental condition. This study found that phenols and toluene concentrations increased with the increase in pyrolysis temperature irrespective to the biomass type. On the other hand, the change in the yield of ketones, furans, and guaiacols with the change in pyrolysis temperature depended on the type of biomass. The effect of filament heating rate on bio-oil yield was not statistically significant because the biomass heating rate was almost constant irrespective of different filament heating rates. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Emissions from harbor-craft significantly affect air quality in populated regions near ports and inland waterways. This research measured regulated and unregulated emissions from an in-use EPA Tier 2 marine propulsion engine on a ferry operating in a bay following standard methods. A special effort was made to monitor continuously both the total Particulate Mass (PM) mass emissions and the real-time Particle Size Distribution (PSD). The engine was operated following the loads in ISO 8178-4 E3 cycle for comparison with the certification standards and across biodiesel blends. Real-time measurements were also made during a typical cruise in the bay. Results showed the in-use nitrogen oxide (NOx) andPM2.5 emission factors were within the not to exceed standardfor Tier 2 marine engines. Comparing across fuels we observed the following: a) no statistically significant change in NOx emissions with biodiesel blends (B20, B50); b)~16% and~25% reduction of PM2.5 mass emissions with B20 and B50 respectively; c) a larger organic carbon (OC) to elemental carbon (EC) ratio and organic mass (OM) to OC ratio with B50 compared to B20 and B0; d) a significant number of ultrafine nuclei and a smaller mass mean diameter with increasing blend-levels of biodiesel. The real-time monitoring of gaseous and particulate emissions during a typical cruise in the San Francisco Bay (in-use cycle) revealed important effects of ocean/bay currents on emissions: NOx and CO2 increased 3-fold; PM2.5 mass increased 6-fold; and ultrafine particles disappeared due to the effect of bay currents. This finding has implications on the use of certification values instead of actual in-use emission values when developing inventories. Emission factors for some volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbonyls, and poly aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are reported as supplemental data. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In the 21st century biofuels will play an important role as alternative fuels in the transportation sector. In this paper different reforming options (steam reforming (SR) and autothermal reforming (ATR)) for the on-board conversion of bioethanol and biodiesel into a hydrogen-rich gas suitable for high temperature PEM (HTPEM) fuel cells are investigated using the simulation tool Aspen Plus. Special emphasis is placed on thermal heat integration. Methyl-oleate (C19H36O2) is chosen as reference substance for biodiesel. Bioethanol is represented by ethanol (C 2H5OH). For the steam reforming concept with heat integration a maximum fuel processing efficiency of 75.6% (76.3%) is obtained for biodiesel (bioethanol) at S/C = 3. For the autothermal reforming concept with heat integration a maximum fuel processing efficiency of 74.1% (75.1%) is obtained for biodiesel (bioethanol) at S/C = 2 and λ = 0.36 (0.35). Taking into account the better dynamic behaviour and lower system complexity of the reforming concept based on ATR, autothermal reforming in combination with a water gas shift reactor is considered as the preferred option for on-board reforming of biodiesel and bioethanol. Based on the simulation results optimum operating conditions for a novel 5 kW biofuel processor are derived. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental issues, the growing demand for energy, political concerns, increasing crude oil prices and the medium-term depletion of petroleum created the need for the development of vegetable oils as alternative fuels. Vegetable oil-based fuels (bio fuels) are promising alternative fuels for diesel engines because of their environmental and strategic advantages. To design equipment for biofuel production and an optimizing process for biodiesel production, their thermophysical properties must be known. In this work, the Jatropha curcas biodiesel was prepared, and thermophysical properties, densities (ρ12), and speed of sound (u12) for J. curcas biodiesel (1) + diesel fuel no. 2 (2) binary mixtures were measured as functions of composition at temperatures ranging from T = (288.15 to 308.15) K and atmospheric pressure. The observed data have been utilized to evaluate the excess molar volume, V12E, of this binary mixture. This binary mixture (blend) exhibits a temperature-dependent behavior, and densities decrease linearly with temperature. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Rice straw hydrolysate was used as lignocellulose-based carbon source for Chlorella pyrenoidosa cultivation and the feasibility of in situ biodiesel production was investigated. 13.7g/L sugar was obtained by enzymatic hydrolyzation of rice straw. Chlorella pyrenoidosa showed a rapid growth in the rice straw hydrolysate medium, the maximum biomass concentration of 2.83g/L was obtained in only 48 hours. The lipid content of the cells reached as high as 56.3. In situ transesterification was performed for biodiesel production. The optimized condition was 1g algal powder, 6mL n-hexane, and 4mL methanol with 0.5M sulfuric acid at the temperature of 90()C in 2-hour reaction time, under which over 99 methyl ester content and about 95 biodiesel yield were obtained. The results suggested that the method has great potential in the production of biofuels with lignocellulose as an alternative carbon source for microalgae cultivation. © 2011 Penglin Li et al.

AB  - Energy recovery potential of a mesophilic co-digester treating OFMSW and primary sludge at an integrated biomethanization plant was investigated based on feasibility study results. Since landfilling is still the main solid waste disposal method in Turkey, land scarcity will become one of the most important obstacles. Restrictions for biodegradable waste disposal to sanitary landfills in EU Landfill Directive and uncontrolled long-term contamination with gas emissions and leachate necessitate alternative management strategies due to rapid increase in MSW production. Moreover, since energy contribution from renewable resources will be required more in the future with increasing oil prices and dwindling supplies of conventional energy sources, the significance of biogas as a renewable fuel has been increased in the last decade. Results indicated that almost 93 of annual total cost can be recovered if 100 renewable energy subsidy is implemented. Besides, considering the potential revenue when replacing transport fuels, about 26 heavy good vehicles or 549 cars may be powered per year by the biogas produced from the proposed biomethanization plant (PE = 100,000; XPS = 61g TS/PEday; X SS-OFMSW =50 g TS/PEday). © 2011 M.

AB  - Biodiesel is a nontoxic, sulfur-free and biodegradable petrol-fuel replacement that can be used in unmodified diesel engines pure or as a blend. Vegetable oils are the main feedstocks employed for its preparation but used vegetable oil and animal fats are currently considered one of the most attractive feedstocks for biodiesel production due to their lower market value in comparison with virgin oils alongside the fact that the material can be recycled from other industrial sectors. In this study, biodiesel-like biofuels are prepared from waste oils containing high concentrations of fatty acids, by using a family of acidic mesoporous carbonaceous materials denoted as starbon acids under both conventional heating and microwave irradiation. The solid acids are found to catalyze both the esterification of the free fatty acids in the waste oil with methanol and the transesterification of the triglycerides in the oil to give biodiesel and glycerol. starbon, SO 3H is found to be the most active catalyst under the investigated reaction conditions from a range of solid acids including zeolites and similar sulfonated carbonaceous materials. Conversions to fatty acid methyl esters were remarkably increased under microwave irradiation compared to the conventionally heated process. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - We converted palmitic and oleic acids to fuel range hydrocarbons using two activated carbons in near- and supercritical water with no H2 added. The main products from palmitic acid were C8-C15n-alkanes. The major products from oleic acid were C12-C17n-alkanes and some C17 olefins. The pseudo-first-order rate constants displayed Arrhenius behavior. The apparent activation energy of 125 kJ/mol for palmitic acid decarboxylation is higher than that observed with a 5% Pt/C catalyst. Nevertheless, these results show that activated carbons possess catalytic activity for the hydrothermal decarboxylation of fatty acids. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Upgrading of Fischer-Tropsch (FT) biowaxes to second-generation biofuels via hydroprocessing is the final step for increasing the fuel amount of the overall biomass conversion route: gasification of lignocellulosic biomass, FT synthesis, and hydroprocessing. The typical FT product portfolio consists of high molecular weight paraffinic waxes as the main product and FT fuels in the diesel and naphtha boiling range. OMV's objective and contribution to the project focus on achieving coprocessing of FT biowaxes with fossil feedstock using existing hydrotreating plants of crude oil refineries. Various test runs have been examined with a conventional refining catalyst under mild conditions (380-390°C, 5. 8 MPa; WHSV, 0. 7-1. 3 h-1) in a pilot plant. Pure FT biowax is converted to gases, fuels, and an oil/waxy residue in a fixed-bed reactor with a porous catalyst layer technology. The presence of hydrogen in the reaction chamber reduces the fast deactivation of the catalyst caused by the formation of a coke layer around the catalyst particle surface and saturates cracked hydrocarbon fragments. Another approach is the creation of synthetic biodiesel components with excellent fuel properties for premium fuel application. Basically, premium diesel fuel differs from standard diesel quality by cetane number and cold flow properties. Hydroprocessed synthetic biodiesel (HPFT diesel) has compared to conventional diesel advantages in many aspects. Depending on the catalyst selected, premium diesel quality can be obtained by shifting cold flow operability properties of HPFT fuels to a range capable even under extreme cold conditions. In addition, a high-quality kerosene fraction is obtained to create bio jet fuels with an extremely deep freezing point, as low as -80°C. The isomerization degree, as well as the carbon number distribution of high paraffinic profile, and the branching degree have a major impact on the cold flow properties and cetane number. FT diesel has, compared to HPFT diesel, a slightly higher derived cetane number (DCN &gt; 83) and a cloud point of -9°C, whereas HPFT diesel reaches values as low as -60°C. Although the HPFT naphtha obtained consists of high amounts of isoparaffins, the RON/ MON values are comparable to fossil straight-run naphtha. The reason is that the branching degree of isoparaffins from the naphtha fraction is not sufficiently high enough to reach the typical octane number values of gasoline products delivered at filling stations. Assuming the goal of launching a premium biodiesel or biokerosene fuel to the market, these hydroprocessed synthetic biofuels from FT biowaxes are ideal blending components. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - We studied the effects of three inorganic carbon sources, Na 2CO 3, NaHCO 3 and CO 2, and their initial concentrations on lipid production of Chlorella vulgaris. Chlorella vulgaris could utilize Na 2CO 3, NaHCO 3 and CO 2 to produce lipids. After 10-day cultivation with each of the three inorganic carbon sources, lipid yield of Chlorella vulgaris reached its peak with the concentration increase of the inorganic carbon source, but dropped again by further increase of the concentration. The pH value of the culture medium for Chlorella vulgaris increased after the cultivation on inorganic carbon source. The optimal concentration of both Na 2CO 3 and NaHCO 3 was 40 mmol/L, and their corresponding biomass dry weight was 0.52 g/L and 0.67 g/L with their corresponding lipid yield 0.19 g/L and 0.22 g/L. When the concentration of CO 2 was 6%, Chlorella vulgaris grew the fastest and its biomass dry weight was 2.42 g/L with the highest lipid yield of 0.72 g/L. When the concentration of CO 2 was too low, the supply of inorganic carbon was insufficient and lipid yield was low. A too high concentration of CO 2 caused a low pH and lipid accumulation was inhibited. Na 2CO 3 and NaHCO 3 were more favorable for Chlorella vulgaris to accumulate unsaturated fatty acids than that of CO 2. © 2011 CJB, All rights reserved.

AB  - Microbial oil, as raw material for biodiesel, can be produced by Trichosporon cutaneum B3 using cassava starch hydrolysate. Batch cultures demonstrated that there was little inhibitory effect with the concentration of cassava starch hydrolysate up to 90 g/L. The favorable initial pH, C/N molar ratio, nitrogen source and its concentration were 6.0, 116, yeast extract and 3.0 g/L, respectively. Under the optimized conditions, dry biomass reached 15.2 g/L and lipid content reached 40.9% after culture for 144 h in flask. Batch cultures in a 2 L stirred-tank fermenter were run for 44 h and resulted in dry biomass, lipid content and lipid yield of 28.7 g/L, 42.8% and 12.27 g/L, respectively. The chemical compositions of biodiesel prepared from lipids of T. cutaneum B3 mainly included palmitic acid methyl ester, stearic acid methyl ester, oleic acid methyl ester and linoleic acid methyl ester etc., and its main physicochemical properties were in compliance with relevant national diesel standards. Therefore, the biodiesel prepared from lipids of T. cutaneum B3 can serve as a potential fossil fuel alternatives. © 2011 CJB, All rights reserved.

AB  - The national standards of biofuels specify the technique specification and analytical methods. A water content certified reference material based on the water saturated octanol was developed in order to satisfy the needs of the instrument calibration and the methods validation, assure the accuracy and consistency of results in water content measurements of biofuels. Three analytical methods based on different theories were employed to certify the water content of the reference material, including Karl Fischer coulometric titration, Karl Fischer volumetric titration and quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance. The consistency of coulometric and volumetric titration was achieved through the improvement of methods. The accuracy of the certified result was improved by the introduction of the new method of quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance. Finally, the certified value of reference material is 4.76% with an expanded uncertainty of 0.09%. © 2011 CJB, All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to investigate the effects of pyrolysis conditions on bio-oil production from biomass in molten salt, experiments of biomass pyrolysis were carried out in a self-designed reactor in which the molten salt ZnCl 2-KCl (with mole ratio 7/6) was selected as heat carrier, catalyst and dispersion agent. The effects of metal salt added into ZnCl 2-KCl and biomass material on biomass pyrolysis were discussed, and the main compositions of bio-oil were determined by GC-MS. Metal salt added into molten salt could affect pyrolysis production yields remarkably. Lanthanon salt could enhance bio-oil yield and decrease water content in bio-oil, when mole fraction of 5.0% LaCl 3 was added, bio-oil yield could reach up to 32.0%, and water content of bio-oil could reduce to 61.5%. The bio-oil and char yields were higher when rice straw was pyrolysed, while gas yield was higher when rice husk was used. Metal salts showed great selectivity on compositions of bio-oil. LiCl and FeCl 2 promoted biomass to pyrolyse into smaller molecular weight compounds. CrCl 3, CaCl 2 and LaCl 3 could restrain second pyrolysis of bio-oil. The research provided a scientific reference for production of bio-oil from biomass pyrolysis in molten salt. © 2011 CJB, All rights reserved.

AB  - Castor oil trans esterification has been evaluated as a source of alternative biodiesel. Three mixtures of biofuel (B5% B10% and B20%) were tested in a diesel engine. Power, fuel consumption, temperature and exhaust emissions were measured. Also, densities, viscosities, refractive indexes and combustion heats of the mixtures were determined. The use of biodiesel mixtures produces an increase of viscosity and fuel consumption, decreasing the heating and engine power, reducing the combustion gases like CO, CO2, sulfur oxides, hydrocarbons, and lowering the opacity of exhaust emissions. Additionally, a balance in the observed diesel engine performance was evidenced by the engine temperatures.

AB  - The sugarcane industry in Brazil is experiencing a rapid shift towards creating the grounds for a green and sustainable biorefinary industry. After 30 years of ProAlcool, the federal government program that boosted Brazil's sugarcane industry by creating a mandate to blend ethanol with gasoline, flex fuel engines now dominate Brazil's automobile industry. Currently, bioethanol replaces around 30% of the gasoline consumed in the country and its demand is projected to more that double in the next 10 years. On another front, the sugarcane genomics program created by FAPESP in the late 1990s paved the way for the establishment of innovative biotechnology startup companies that attracted the attention of the largest agro-biotechnology sector companies of the world. Almost all of these companies now have their sugarcane research centers surrounding the city of Campinas, São Paulo. In addition, innovative synthetic biology companies are developing technologies to produce diesel, jet fuel and other high value molecules using sugarcane juice as a carbon source. The sugarcane industry also teamed with petrochemical companies and already established operating plants to produce bioplastics. Innovations have also occurred in the field of co-generation of electricity from sugarcane bagasse. Currently sugarcane supplies 4% of the electricity needs of the country. Collectively, these innovations suggest that Brazil's sugarcane industry could supply over 30% of the country energy needs by 2021 and a significant fraction of new bioproducts produced by its nascent biorefinary plants. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Biodiesel is a proven alternative to petroleum diesel fuel. During production of biodiesel, the free fatty acids in the oil react with the sodium or potassium catalyst to form soaps. After the biodiesel and by-product glycerin are separated, trace amounts of glycerin remain in the biodiesel. These soap and glycerin impurities in the biodiesel can lead to engine operation and fuel storage problems. Traditionally, soap and glycerin are removed from the biodiesel by water washing. Water washing has several disadvantages, such as producing large amounts of waste water that requires treatment and causing plant operational problems such as emulsion formation. Recently, several alternative "waterless" purification procedures have been developed, such as ion exchange resins and solid adsorbents. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of ion exchange resins and characterize their performance so that biodiesel plant operators can use them more effectively. Four different mechanisms were identified for soap and glycerin removal. These mechanisms are filtration, physical adsorption, ion exchange, and soap removal by glycerin affinity. It was found that ion exchange resins can reduce soap levels from 1200 ppm to below 50 ppm for about 550 bed volumes (BV) of processed biodiesel. Glycerin levels can be reduced from 0.08% to below 0.02% for about 200 BV of processed biodiesel. © 2011 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative fuel made from vegetable oils and animal fats. In 2006, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency mandated a maximum sulfur content of 15 ppm in on-road diesel fuels. Processing to produce the new ultra-low-sulfur petrodiesel (ULSD) alters the specific gravity (SG) and other fuel properties. Accurate determination of SG (or density) of fuels is necessary for conversion of measured volume to volume or mass at standard temperature. Furthermore, SG is generally correlated against performance indicators such as cetane number and heating value. The present study addresses the need to develop a better understanding of how blending biodiesel with ULSD affects SG. The effects of biodiesel volumetric blend ratio (V BD) on SG were evaluated for blends of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from soybean oil (SME) from three different fuel producers and FAME from used cooking oil (UCOME) in ULSD. Regression analysis of results at 15.6°C and 40°C indicated that SG increased linearly with respect to increasing V BD. Average differences between predicted and measured values were less than 0.001. Results for blends of the three SMEs in ULSD were pooled to yield a combined linear correlation for SME/ULSD blends (R 2 = 0.999 for SG at 15.6°C). The API gravities of blends were determined from SG data at 15.6°C. Two methods were proposed to calculate API gravity of a given blend with V BD = BX (X vol% biodiesel). Method I was to determine SG from the appropriate linear correlation reported in this work and calculate API gravity accordingly. The accuracy of this method depended on the precision in calculating SG (noted above). Method II involved determining API gravities of the unblended components and taking a volumetric average at V BD = BX. Accuracy of method II was ≤0.11° based on predicted and measured values. It was concluded that both methods were capable of very precise determination of the API gravity of biodiesel/ULSD blends. © 2011 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Biofuels currently represent a potential source of renewable energy. As well as that could lead to major new markets for farmers. However, only some of the current biofuel programs are feasible, and most involve high social costs and environmental ironically. The economic, environmental and social impacts of biofuels are widely debated and needs to be carefully assessed before extending public support to programs of biofuels on a large scale. The country strategy on biofuels should be based on a thorough assessment of these opportunities and costs in the medium and long term. One factor to consider is that oil reserves will run out, experts say, in fifty years. This article presents the social and economic impact of biofuel production in industrialized countries and developing countries that are or could become, efficient producers in export markets and profitable new.© Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Facultad de Economía y Negocios.

AB  - Microalgae are microscopic unicellular species, ranging in size from a few microns to hundreds of microns, that exist individually, or in chains or flocs, in freshwater and marine systems. Microalgae contribute approximately 40-50% of the oxygen in the atmosphere and simultaneously consume carbon dioxide to grow photoautotrophically. Maximizing lipid production at the molecular level involves a thorough understanding of the metabolic pathways, especially those associated with lipid synthesis, and with packaging and secretion. Significant research has been conducted on establishing the optimal nutritional composition and culture conditions for hydrocarbon production by microalgae. The production of hydrocarbons in microalgae cells is growth-associated and usually reaches its maximum around the early stationary phase of the algal growth cycle.

AB  - Several emerging technologies are aiming to meet renewable fuel standards, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and provide viable alternatives to fossil fuels. Direct conversion of solar energy into fungible liquid fuel is a particularly attractive option, though conversion of that energy on an industrial scale depends on the efficiency of its capture and conversion. Large-scale programs have been undertaken in the recent past that used solar energy to grow innately oil-producing algae for biomass processing to biodiesel fuel. These efforts were ultimately deemed to be uneconomical because the costs of culturing, harvesting, and processing of algal biomass were not balanced by the process efficiencies for solar photon capture and conversion. This analysis addresses solar capture and conversion efficiencies and introduces a unique systems approach, enabled by advances in strain engineering, photobioreactor design, and a process that contradicts prejudicial opinions about the viability of industrial photosynthesis. We calculate efficiencies for this direct, continuous solar process based on common boundary conditions, empirical measurements and validated assumptions wherein genetically engineered cyanobacteria convert industrially sourced, high-concentration CO2 into secreted, fungible hydrocarbon products in a continuous process. These innovations are projected to operate at areal productivities far exceeding those based on accumulation and refining of plant or algal biomass or on prior assumptions of photosynthetic productivity. This concept, currently enabled for production of ethanol and alkane diesel fuel molecules, and operating at pilot scale, establishes a new paradigm for high productivity manufacturing of nonfossil-derived fuels and chemicals. © 2011 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: The Air Pollution Exposure Laboratory (APEL) was designed for the controlled inhalation of human subjects to aged and diluted diesel exhaust (DE) to mimic "real-world" occupational and environmental conditions. Methods: An EPA Tier 3-compliant, 6.0 kW diesel generator is operated under discrete cyclic loads to simulate diesel on-road emissions. The engine accepts standard ultra-low sulfur diesel or a variety of alternative fuels (such as biodiesel) via a partitioned tank. A portion of raw exhaust is drawn into the primary dilution system and is diluted 9:1 with compressed air at standard temperature (20°C) and humidity (40%) levels. The exhaust is further diluted approximately 25:1 by high efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered air (FA) and then aged for 4min before entering the 4×-6×-7-foot exposure booth. An optional HEPA filter path immediately proximal to the booth can generate a particle-reduced (gas-enriched) exposure. In-booth particulate is read by a nephelometer to provide an instantaneous light scattering coefficient for closed-loop system control. A Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer and multi-stage impactor measures particle size distribution. Filter sampling allows determination of sessional average concentrations of size-fractionated and unfractionated particulate oxidative potential, elemental carbon, organic carbon and trace elements. Results: Approximately 300μg/m3 PM2.5 is routinely achievable at APEL and is well characterized in terms of oxidative potential and elemental components. Conclusion: APEL efficiently creates fresh DE, appropriately aged and diluted for human experimentation at safe yet realistic concentrations. Description of exposure characteristics allows comparison to other international efforts to deepen the current evidence base regarding the health effects of DE. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - We describe a method for direct, quantitative, in vivo lipid profiling of oil-producing microalgae using single-cell laser-trapping Raman spectroscopy. This approach is demonstrated in the quantitative determination of the degree of unsaturation and transition temperatures of constituent lipids within microalgae. These properties are important markers for determining engine compatibility and performance metrics of algal biodiesel. We show that these factors can be directly measured from a single livingmicroalgal cell held in place with an optical trap while simultaneously collecting Raman data. Cellular response to different growth conditions is monitored in real time. Our approach circumvents the need for lipid extraction and analysis that is both slow and invasive. Furthermore, this technique yields real-time chemical information in a label-free manner, thus eliminating the limitations of impermeability, toxicity, and specificity of the fluorescent probes common in currently used protocols. Although the single-cell Raman spectroscopy demonstrated here is focused on the study of the microalgal lipidswith biofuel applications, the analytical capability and quantitation algorithms demonstrated are applicable to many different organisms and should prove useful for a diverse range of applications in lipidomics.

AB  - Cereal distillers grains, a by-product from bioethanol industry, proved to be a suitable feedstock for biogas production in laboratory scale anaerobic digesters. Five continuously stirred tank reactors were run under constant conditions and monitored for biogas production and composition along with other process parameters. Iron additives for sulfide precipitation significantly improved the process stability and efficiency, whereas aerobic pretreatment of the grains had no effect. The microbial communities in the reactors were investigated for their phylogenetic composition by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. The bacterial subcommunities were highly diverse, and their composition did not show any correlation with reactor performance. The dominant phylotypes were affiliated to the Bacteroidetes. The archaeal subcommunities were less diverse and correlated with the reactor performance. The well-performing reactors operated at lower organic loading rates and amended with iron chloride were dominated by aceticlastic methanogens of the genus Methanosaeta. The well-performing reactor operated at a high organic loading rate and supplemented with iron hydroxide was dominated by Methanosarcina ssp. The reactor without iron additives was characterized by propionate and acetate accumulation and high hydrogen sulfide content and was dominated by hydrogenotrophic methanogens of the genus Methanoculleus. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Grass biomethane surpasses the 60% greenhouse gas (GHG) savings relative to the fossil fuel replaced required by EU Directive 2009/28/EC. However, there are growing concerns that when the indirect effects of biofuels are taken into account, GHG savings may become negative. There has been no research to date into the indirect effects of grass biomethane; this paper aims to fill that knowledge gap. A causal-descriptive assessment is carried out and identifies the likely indirect effect of a grass biomethane industry in Ireland as a reduction in beef exports to the UK. Three main scenarios are then analyzed: an increase in indigenous UK beef production, an increase in beef imported to the UK from other countries (EU, New Zealand and Brazil), and a decrease in beef consumption leading to increased poultry consumption. The GHG emissions from each of these scenarios are determined and the resulting savings relative to fossil diesel vary between -636% and 102%. The significance of the findings is then discussed. It is the view of the authors that, while consideration of indirect effects is important, an Irish grass biomethane industry cannot be held accountable for the associated emissions. A global GHG accounting system is therefore proposed; however, the difficulty of implementing such a system is acknowledged, as is its probable ineffectualness. Such a system would not treat the source of the problem - rising consumption. The authors conclude that the most effective method of combating the indirect effects of biofuels is a reduction in general consumption. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Like any other manufactured product, the production of biofuels involves the consumption of several inputs along its production chain. Energy balance results are often contradictory mainly due to differences in the methodologies used for their calculation. Despite the lack of a national database, this paper is a first estimate of the energy balance of biodiesel from soybean in Brazil. Data collected from five plantations located in the state of São Paulo, with a total production of 2000 metric tonnes, along with information about the industrial production process, were taken into account for calculating the energy balance of soybean biodiesel. A renewability factor of 4.3 was found considering an input allocation factor of 18% up to the stage of soybean oil production. This result was compared to information available in the literature. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The main objective of this life cycle assessment (LCA) study is to determine the environmental consequences of the inclusion of second-generation biofuels (bioethanol from palm oil biomass) toward current palm oil biodiesel production through a 'seed-to-wheel' LCA analysis. Their energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission indicators are evaluated with consequential approach for system delimitation. Although all scenarios provide positive environmental impact, it is found that the inclusion of bioethanol production in the current palm oil processing will decrease the net energy ratio (NER) and net carbon emission ratio (NCER) values by 27.5% and 66.6%, respectively. Moreover, carbon emission savings (CES) value is also found to decrease by a total of 21.9%. This indicates that a higher amount of energy input and GHG emissions is actually required for the bioethanol processing than the amount of energy it will produce and the GHG from fossil fuels it will displace. The sensitivity analysis performed on the yields of bioethanol shows that the minimum conversion threshold should be larger than 60% in order to have a higher energy and GHG emission ratio than current palm oil biodiesel processing. Sensitivity analysis on direct land use change and waste-water treatment is also carried out which discourages the expansion of palm oil plantation to primary forest (including peatland) and emphasizes the need for a biogas harvesting system. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - We compare the production of four biofuels - ethanol, butanol, fatty acid ethyl ester (palmitate ethyl ester, PEE), and hydrogen from renewable carbohydrate (glucose) based on the energy-retaining efficiency that is greatly influenced by thermodyanimcs, bioenergetics, and product separation. Ethanol and butanol are produced in anaerobic fermentations; PEE is produced in semi-aerobic fermentation; hydrogen is produced by cell-free synthetic enzymatic pathway biotransformation (SyPaB), where enzymes are produced from carbohydrate by microbial fermentations. A decreasing order in theoretical energy efficiency determined by thermodynamics is hydrogen, ethanol, butanol, and PEE. Bioenergetics analysis suggests that a small fraction of carbohydrate (e.g., 5-15%) is allocated to the synthesis of cell mass in anaerobic fermentations (e.g., ethanol and butanol), a significant fraction (e.g., 20-30% or higher) has to be allocated to the synthesis of cell mass for semi-aerobic fermentations (e.g., PEE production), and a very small fraction (e.g., less than 1%) is used to produce the enzyme mixtures. A decreasing order in product separation energy is hydrogen, secreted PEE, ethanol, butanol, and intracellular PEE. Hydrogen production by SyPaB would be most appealing because its energy-retaining efficiency is ∼49% higher than ethanol, ∼55% higher than butanol, and ∼87% higher than PEE, even without considering higher hydrogen-fuel cell efficiency than those of biofuel-internal combustion engines. Our analysis suggests that it may be difficult to produce some advanced biofuels economically through aerobic fermentations due to low energy efficiency, as compared to ethanol, butanol, and hydrogen. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Gaseous biofuels including biomethane, which has been shown to be more environmentally beneficial than liquid biofuels, should contribute to meeting the challenging UK targets set for the supplying of biofuels to the road transport fuel market. Under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations the financial incentives for the supply of biofuels have been volatile, e.g. 2008/2009 saw Renewable Transport Fuel Certificate values fall to zero. Any shortfall from the maximum value has significant implications for all biofuels. It is demonstrated that biomethane can be produced at a cost which is competitive with liquid biofuels and fossil fuels within the UK. Technologies such as water scrubbing, pressure swing adsorption and physical and chemical absorption are available to upgrade biogas generated by anaerobic digestion of organic wastes to transport fuel quality, and technologies such as membrane separation and cryogenic distillation are being modified for such an application. The manufacture and sale of biomethane as a transport fuel is also financially competitive with Combined Heat and Power. One limiting factor may be the additional cost of purchasing and maintaining biomethane fuelled vehicles. Support in this area could lead to the rapid expansion of biomethane transport fuel infrastructure and bring significant long term environmental and economic advantages. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The first country in Southeast Asia to enact legislation on biofuels, the Republic of the Philippines is recognized as a model for its decisive mandates in this area. This article uses the Philippine case to elucidate how competition among policy coalitions plays out in the formation and change of biofuels policy. Through content analysis of newspaper articles and government documents published from 2002 to 2009, we identify four active discourse coalitions: Biofuels Proponents, Technical Viability, Food Security, and Forest Conservation. Together, these coalitions maintain the political salience of biofuel debates in the Philippines. In these debates, the Forest Conservation coalition was particularly weak, resulting in its relative inability to influence the country's biofuels policy. Its weakness may be attributed to perceptions among policy makers and the general public that forest conservation has no immediate socioeconomic relevance, and that, given their dismal state, primary forestlands across much of the archipelago lack significant environmental value. © 2011 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Biofuel production from vegetable oil is potentially a good alternative to conventional fossil derived fuels. Moreover, liquid biofuel offers many environmental benefits since it is free from nitrogen and sulfur compounds. Biofuel can be obtained from biomass (e.g. pyrolysis, gasification) and agricultural sources such as vegetable oil, vegetable oil sludge, rubber seed oil, and soybean oil. One of the most promising sources of biofuel is vegetable oil sludge. This waste is a major byproduct of vegetable oil factories. It consists of triglycerides (61%), free fatty acid (37%) and impurities (2%). The hydrocarbon chains of triglycerides and free fatty acid are mainly made up of C16 (30%) and C18 (36%) hydrocarbons. The others consist of C12-C17 hydrocarbon chains. Transesterification can help in converting vegetable oil sludge into biofuel. The disadvantage of this method is that a large amount of methanol is required. The alternative method for this conversion is catalytic cracking. The objective of this research is to evaluate and compare the pyrolysis process with cracking catalytic reaction of vegetable oil sludge by Micro-activity test MAT 5000 of Zeton-Canada. A ZSM-5/MCM-41 multiporous composite (MC-ZSM-5/MCM-41), was successfully synthesized using silica source extracted from rice husk. The material has the MCM-41 mesoporous structure, and its wall is constructed by ZSM-5 nanozeolite crystals. The porous system of the material includes pores of the following sizes: 5 (ZSM-5 zeolite), 40 (MCM-41 mesoporous material), and another porous system whose diameter is in the range of 100-500 (mesoporous system) formed by the burning of organic compounds that remain in the material during the calcination process. This pore system contributes to an increase in the catalytic performance of synthesized material. The results of vegetable oil sludge cracking reaction show that the product consists of fractions such as dry gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), gasoline, light cycle oil (LCO), and (heavy cycle oil) HCO, which are similar to those of petroleum cracking process. MC-ZSM-5/MCM-41 catalyst is efficient in the catalytic cracking reaction of vegetable oil sludge as it has higher conversion and selectivity for LPG and gasoline products in comparison to the pyrolysis process. Product distribution (% of oil feed) of cracking reaction over MC-ZSM-5/MCM-41 is coke (3.4), total dry gas (7.0), LPG (31.1), gasoline (42.4), LCO (8.9), HCO (7.2); and that of pyrolysis are coke (19.0), total dry gas (9.3), LPG (16.9), gasoline (28.8), LCO (13.7), and HCO (12.3). These results have indicated a new way to use agricultural waste such as rice husk for the production of promising catalysts and the processing of vegetable oil sludge to obtain biofuel. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The current work focuses on the study of the influence of pressure and temperature on three important thermodynamic properties: speed of sound, compressibility and density of common diesel fuels. The sample fuels studied were conventional diesel (Repsol Elite), Rape Methyl Ester (typical bio-diesel used in Spain) and a fuel used especially for winter season (Arctic). Speed of sound and densities has been determined experimentally. The third property, bulk modulus, has been calculated from the other two. Speed of sound measurements have been carried out in wide range of temperatures (298 < T/K < 343) and pressures (15 < p/MPa < 180), which represent the typical values used in injection systems for diesel engines. Hence, a particular configuration was coupled to the high-pressure injection system, obtaining accurate measurements at these extreme conditions. A detailed description of the method is presented; also, the obtained results are listed, with an uncertainty of ∼0.3%. Density measurements have been performed over a broad range of temperatures (298 < T/K < 343), using two commercial devices, obtaining an overall uncertainty of ∼0.6%. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Conventional fossil fuels are facing a global challenge which lead scientists to explore alternative fuel production from biological sources. The algae-based fuels are gaining rapid attention as it has potential to replace petroleum-based fuels. An indigenous high lipid producing microalgae was isolated from a freshwater pond in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. The isolate was later identified as Chlorella vulgaris, based on partial 28S large subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequence. The growth kinetics, pyrolytic characteristics and photosynthetic efficiency of Chlorella was evaluated in vitro. The optimized conditions for higher biomass yield of the selected strain were at 4% CO2, 0.5gl-1 NO3 and 0.04gl-1 PO4, respectively. The pulse amplitude modulation results indicated that C. vulgaris could withstand a light intensity ranging from 150 to 350-mol photons m-2s-1. Further increase in light intensity resulted in a decline of the electron transport rate. Carbon fixation rate, lipid content and calorific value of C. vulgaris was 6.17mgl-1h-1, 21% and 17.44kJg-1, respectively. The pyrolitic studies under inert atmosphere at different heating rates of 15, 30, 40 and 50°Cmin-1 from ambient temperature to 800°C showed that the overall final weight loss recorded for the four different heating rates was in the range of 78.9-81%. These studies could be useful to appraise the biofuel potential of the isolated C. vulgaris strain, which can later be taken for pilot scale production. © 2010 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

AB  - This study was designed to determine the toxicity (oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity) in extracts of combustion aerosols. A typical Euro III heavy truck engine was tested over the European Transient Cycle with three different fuels: conventional diesel EN590, biodiesel EN14214 as B100 and blends with conventional diesel (B5, B10, and B20) and pure plant oil DIN51605 (PPO). In addition application of a (wall flow) diesel particulate filter (DPF) with conventional diesel EN590 was tested. The use of B100 or PPO as a fuel or the DPF reduced particulate matter (PM) mass and numbers over 80%. Similarly, significant reduction in the emission of chemical constituents (EC 90%, (oxy)-PAH 70%) were achieved. No significant changes in nitro-PAH were observed. The use of B100 or PPO led to a NOx increase of about 30%, and no increase for DPF application. The effects of B100, PPO and the DPF on the biological test results vary strongly from positive to negative depending on the biological end point. The oxidative potential, measured via the DTT assay, of the B100 and PPO or DPF emissions is reduced by 95%. The cytotoxicity is increased for B100 by 200%. The measured mutagenicity, using the Ames assay test with TA98 and YG1024 strains of Salmonella typhimurium indicate a dose response for the nitroarene sensitive YG1024 strain for B100 and PPO (fold induction: 1.6). In summary B100 and PPO have good potential for the use as a second generation biofuel resulting in lower PM mass, similar to application of a DPF, but caution should be made due to potential increased toxicity. Besides regulation via mass, the biological reactivity of exhaust emissions of new (bio)fuels and application of new technologies, needs attention. The different responses of different biological tests as well as differences in results between test laboratories underline the need for harmonization of test methods and international cooperation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The degradation of diesel fuel, B20 blend and biodiesel in liquid cultures by a seven-member bacterial consortium was compared under conditions with full aeration or with limited aeration with nitrate added as main electron acceptor. Community dynamics was assessed employing real-time PCR and the ddCt method for relative quantification. Biodegradation rates increased with increasing biodiesel content, but were significantly reduced under conditions with nitrate. Despite large variations in biodegradation rates, magnitude changes in population numbers were typically observed only from zero to one order, regardless the type of fuel and electron acceptor. Only Comamonadaceae and Variovorax sp. distinctly preferred aerobic conditions, and during aerobic growth showed suppression as fuel contained more biodiesel. Thus, the consortium is relatively stable and most of the degraders can shift their metabolism from hydrocarbons to biodiesel. The stability of the consortium is of interest in the context of biodiesel-mediated biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Slit-channel reactors are reactors whose active surface areas are orders of magnitude higher than those of micro-reactors but have low fabrication costs relative to micro-reactors. We successfully produced biodiesel with different degrees of conversion using homogeneous catalyst in the slit-channel reactor. The reactor performance shows that percent conversion of soybean oil to biodiesel increases with channel depth, as expected, due to more efficient mixing. Shallow slit-channels require short average residence times for complete product conversion. Present results show that the slit-channel reactor provides an improved performance over traditional batch reactors using homogeneous sodium alkoxide catalyst. It is aimed to couple the reactors with solid catalysts in converting soybean oil to biodiesel and implementation method is suggested. The cost advantages resulting from the ease of fabrication of slit-channel reactors over micro-reactors and how these factors relate to the oil conversion efficiency to biodiesel are briefly noted and discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The oil price instability and the measures taken to reduce the increase in greenhouse gas emissions are the main factors promoting the development and use of environmentally friendly energies. From an energy efficiency point of view, biofuels constitute a renewable energy source and its use helps to reduce energy dependency on fossil fuels. The most used biofuels for transport worldwide are biodiesel (BD) and bioethanol. However, there are other options such as straight vegetable oil (SVO). SVO can be small-scale produced in local cooperatives through pressing, filtering and conditioning processes which are much simpler than the ones required for BD production. In this study a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) of two biofuels obtained from Spanish rapeseed, namely small-scale SVO and large-scale BD, is performed. The LCA methodology allows the two biofuels' production and their rate of consumption in a vehicle (a truck) to be compared. In this manner, it is possible to assess which is environmentally advantageous: to use SVO directly as biofuel or to convert it to BD. Moreover, LCA is used in the study to calculate the energy return on investment index (EROI) and an energy conversion ratio to evaluate which biofuel is more energy efficient. The obtained results show the environmental benefits of using SVO instead of BD by analyzing representative impact categories defined by the CML and EDIP methods. A sensitivity analysis has also been conducted. EROI indexes for SVO and BD production show a clear preference for SVO as compared to BD. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Research on vegetable oil for biofuels in Africa and Asia has focused mainly on Jatropha curcas while other potential oil bearing plants have received little attention. Vegetable oil production potential for five oil bearing plant species namely: Aleurites moluccana, Croton megalocarpus, Jatropha curcas, Moringa oleifera and Pachira glabra were investigated. Nuts and seeds of the plants were collected from the wild and their potential for vegetable oil production assessed in terms of seed/nut acreage yield, seed/nut oil content, harvesting requirement, and upstream processing before vegetable oil recovery. All five varieties were found to contain acceptable but different oil content ranging from 20 to 33% w/w, and seed/nut acreage yield of 3 t ha-1 y-1 to 12.5 t ha-1 y-1. Upstream processing was needed for A. moluccana to break open nuts to release the kernel, and dehulling for both C. megalocarpus and J. curcas to release the seeds, before extracting the vegetable oil, while the seeds of both M. oleifera and P. glabra did not need upstream processing. The Multi-criteria Decision Analysis ranked C. megalocarpus as the plant with the highest vegetable oil production potential of 1.8 t ha-1 y-1 followed by M. oleifera, J. curcas (1 t ha-1 y-1), A. moluccana, and P. glabra. The analysis underlines the need for more studies on C. megalocarpus and M. oleifera for biofuel production in Africa and other regions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present work aimed at the standardization of transesterification process parameters for the production of methyl ester of filtered neem oil and fuel characterization for engine performance. The effect of process parameters such as molar ratio, preheating temperature, catalyst concentration and reaction time was studied to standardize the transesterification process for estimating the highest recovery of ester with lowest possible viscosity. Based on the observations of the ester recovery and kinematic viscosity, it was found that filtered neem oil at 6:1 M ratio (methanol to oil) preheated at 55 °C temperature and maintaining 60 °C reaction temperature for 60 min in the presence of 2 percent KOH and then allowed to settle for 24 h in order to get lowest kinematic viscosity (2.7 cSt) with ester recovery (83.36%). Different fuel properties of the neem methyl ester and neem oil were also measured. Results show that the methyl ester of neem obtained under the optimum condition is an excellent substitute for fossil fuels. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha shrubs grow tall if left non-pruned. Pruning helps to keep the height within harvestable distances. Since, Jatropha flowers are borne on leaf axils of new growth in the season, pruning is supposed to increase fruiting because of formation of more number of lateral branches due to suppression of apical dominance. However, results of exploratory studies revealed drastic reduction of fruit yield after pruning. The results assume importance because lesser yield obtained owing to pruning would be uneconomical, both to the growers on account of diminished returns and to the biodiesel industry on account of being idle because of short seed supply. In this report, we found that paclobutrazol (PBZ) application induced flowering and fruiting in pruned shrubs and partially made up for the yield loss, besides keeping a lower plant height. With PBZ application, the yield reduction compared to non-pruned shrubs was limited to 67%, while 98% reduction in capsule yield was observed in untreated pruned shrubs. Paclobutrazol application along with pruning altered the morphology and vegetative growth of Jatropha, producing shrubs with smaller leaves with enhanced chlorophyll and nitrogen content and increased photosynthetic rate. It was found that though more secondary branching is induced in pruned plants, lesser tertiary branches on them results in no additional advantage with respect to total branches. However, the important objective of keeping the branches nearer to the ground is met. The effect of the treatments in terms of energy output from oil, de-oiled cake, capsule shell/husk has also been reported. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Energy production from two types of municipal solid waste was evaluated using life cycle assessment (LCA): (1) mixed high calorific waste suitable for production of solid recovered fuels (SRF) and (2) source separated organic waste. For SRF, co-combustion was compared with mass burn incineration. For organic waste, anaerobic digestion (AD) was compared with mass burn incineration. In the case of mass burn incineration, incineration with and without energy recovery was modelled. Biogas produced from anaerobic digestion was evaluated for use both as transportation fuel and for heat and power production. All relevant consequences for energy and resource consumptions, emissions to air, water and soil, upstream processes and downstream processes were included in the LCA. Energy substitutions were considered with respect to two different energy systems: a present-day Danish system based on fossil fuels and a potential future system based on 100% renewable energy. It was found that mass burn incineration of SRF with energy recovery provided savings in all impact categories, but co-combustion was better with respect to Global Warming (GW). If all heat from incineration could be utilized, however, the two alternatives were comparable for SRF. For organic waste, mass burn incineration with energy recovery was preferable over anaerobic digestion in most impact categories. Waste composition and flue gas cleaning at co-combustion plants were critical for the environmental performance of SRF treatment, while the impacts related to utilization of the digestate were significant for the outcome of organic waste treatment. The conclusions were robust in a present-day as well as in a future energy system. This indicated that mass burn incineration with efficient energy recovery is a very environmentally competitive solution overall. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The transesterification process variables studied were reaction temperature, reaction duration, molar ratio of methanol to oil and catalyst loading. Results from this study revealed that individual as well as interaction between variables significantly affect the yield of biodiesel. With this information, it was found that 4. h of reaction at 150 °C, methanol to oil molar ratio of 9.88. mol/mol and 7.61 wt.% for catalyst loading gave an optimum biodiesel yield of 90.32 wt.%. The fuel properties of Jatropha biodiesel were characterized and it indeed met the specification for biodiesel according to ASTM D6751. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An attractive approach to improving cold flow properties of biodiesel is to transesterify fatty acid methyl esters with higher alcohols such as n-butanol or with branched alcohols such as isopropanol. In this study, the reaction kinetics of Amberlyst-15 catalyzed transesterification of methyl stearate, a model biodiesel compound, with n-butanol have been examined. After identifying conditions to minimize both internal and external mass transfer resistances, the effects of catalyst loading, temperature, and the mole ratio of n-butanol to methyl stearate in the transesterification reaction were investigated. Experimental data were fit to a pseudo-homogeneous, activity-based kinetic model with inclusion of etherification reactions to appropriately characterize the transesterification system. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TEM photograph showed that the nanocatalyst had granular and porous structures with particle sizes of 10-40nm. The nanocatalyst had longer lifetime and maintained sustained activity after being used for five cycles. The separate effects of the molar ratio of methanol to oil, reaction temperature, nanocatalyst amount and reaction time were investigated. The experimental results showed that a 16:1M ratio of methanol to oil, 6.0% catalyst, 60°C reaction temperature and 2.0h reaction time gave the best results and the biodiesel yield of 98.03% was achieved. Production of biodiesel has positive impact on the utilization of agricultural and forestry products. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work offers an optimized method for the direct conversion of harvested Nannochloropsis algae into bio-diesel using two novel techniques. The first is a unique bio-technology-based environmental system utilizing flue gas from coal burning power stations for microalgae cultivation. This method reduces considerably the cost of algae production. The second technique is the direct transesterification (a one-stage method) of the Nannochloropsis biomass to bio-diesel production using microwave and ultrasound radiation with the aid of a SrO catalyst. These two techniques were tested and compared to identify the most effective bio-diesel production method. Based on our results, it is concluded that the microwave oven method appears to be the most simple and efficient method for the one-stage direct transesterification of the as-harvested Nannochloropsis algae. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In order for biodiesel to be commercialized as pure biofuel or blending stock for diesel fuels, it must meet a set of requirements defined in standard specifications for a safe and satisfactory engine operation, one of these specifications is the content of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). Besides, this parameter indicates the performance of the transesterification reaction for biofuel production from vegetable oils. There are several methods to determinate FAME content in biodiesel samples (chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and FTIR spectroscopy); however, they take long times and high cost for FAME content determination. From a practical point of view, in industrial biodiesel production is usually necessary to estimate the FAME value quickly. This paper presents correlations experimentally obtained from different oil feedstocks in order to estimate the biodiesel FAME content from the biodiesel dynamic viscosity, a fast determination parameter. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With increased emphasis on bio-diesel fuels, the influence of spring planting on development of brown mustard (Brassica juncea cv. Arid), canola (B. napus cv. Hyola 401) and camelina (Camelina sativa cv. Boa) has become important. Field trials were conducted at Scottsbluff, NE, in 2005 and 2006 at planting dates of 24 February, 24 March, 7 April, 21 April and 5 May, and 3 March, 3 April, 10 April, 27 April, 11 May, and 2 Jun, respectively. Emergence time was shorter with later planting. Flowering date was later with later planting but occurred within a range of degree days (P-days). Fruiting was affected by date and P-days, but seed maturity was not affected by planting date and was unrelated to P-days. Fleabeetle (Phyllotreta spp.) damage was very high in brown mustard and canola. Bird, primarily house finch (Carppodacus mexicanus), feeding was a major problem with brown mustard planted before mid April and in canola, only with the first planting. Camelina was not affected by either. Planting in April gave the best yields, and canola could yield over 2200kgha-1. Oil content of the Brassica was highest when planted from late March and later. For camelina, planting date had no effect. In brown mustard and canola, 60-65% of oil was C18:1, in camelina, about 15%. Later planting increased C18:1 content for the three crops. The second fatty acid was C18:2 with 20% in brown mustard, 18% in canola and 20% in camelina. Later planting increased C18:2 in camelina only. The major fatty acid in camelina was C18:3 at 32-37%; earlier planting increased the content of C18:3. In Camelina, C20:1 comprised about 12% of the oil and was highest with April planting. Canola and camelina seeded in April could be grown for oil successfully in western Nebraska. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Efficient biodiesel production from beef tallow was achieved with radio frequency (RF) heating. A conversion rate of 96.3 ± 0.5% was obtained with a NaOH concentration of 0.6% (based on tallow), an RF heating for 5 min, and a methanol/tallow molar ratio of 9:1. Response surface methodology was employed to evaluate the influence of NaOH dose, RF heating time, and methanol/tallow ratio. The alkaline concentration showed the largest positive impact on the conversion rate. Similar fast conversion from canola oil to biodiesel was achieved in our previous work, indicating that RF heating, as an accelerating technique for biodiesel production, had a large applying area. Viscosities of biodiesel products from beef tallow and canola oil were measured as 5.23 ± 0.01 and 4.86 ± 0.01 mm2 s-1, respectively, both meeting the specification in ASTM D6751 (1.9-6.0 mm2 s-1). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Several rapeseed oils with different degree of upgrading were used as feedstocks for deoxygenation over sulfided CoMo/γ-Al2O 3 catalyst. The rapeseed oil samples differed in the concentration of inorganic impurities, water, free fatty acids and phospholipids. The catalytic experiments were carried out in a fixed bed reactor at constant reaction conditions (310 °C, WHSV = 2 h-1, hydrogen pressure 3.5 MPa). Refined rapeseed oils were converted to hydrocarbons more efficiently than neat rapeseed oil, trap grease and waste oil. The high concentration of phospholipids in trap grease was the most likely cause of catalyst deactivation by coking. Decomposition of phospholipids as well as oligomerization of rapeseed oil by phosphoric acid at 310 °C was confirmed by separate laboratory experiments. The high concentration of alkalis in waste rapeseed oil was the main reason for increased deactivation in comparison with neat rapeseed oil. Sulfur removal from catalyst active sites affected adversely the deoxygenation of triglycerides. The catalyst deoxygenation activity was partially restored by pulse addition of dimethyldisulfide (DMDS) to the feedstock, however the degradation of active sites by loss of sulfur was not fully reversible. In contrast, continually added sulfur agent (DMDS) ensured significantly slower catalyst deactivation. Moreover, presence of H2S lowered considerably hydrodeoxygenation/ decarboxylation ratio. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We use global models to explore the microphysical effects of carbonaceous aerosols on liquid clouds. Although absorption of solar radiation by soot warms the atmosphere, soot may cause climate cooling due to its contribution to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and therefore cloud brightness. Six global models conducted three soot experiments; four of the models had detailed aerosol microphysical schemes. The average cloud radiative response to biofuel soot (black and organic carbon), including both indirect and semi-direct effects, is -0.11 Wm-2, comparable in size but opposite in sign to the respective direct effect. In a more idealized fossil fuel black carbon experiment, some models calculated a positive cloud response because soot provides a deposition sink for sulfuric and nitric acids and secondary organics, decreasing nucleation and evolution of viable CCN. Biofuel soot particles were also typically assumed to be larger and more hygroscopic than for fossil fuel soot and therefore caused more negative forcing, as also found in previous studies. Diesel soot (black and organic carbon) experiments had relatively smaller cloud impacts with five of the models &lt;±0.06 Wm-2 from clouds. The results are subject to the caveats that variability among models, and regional and interrannual variability for each model, are large. This comparison together with previously published results stresses the need to further constrain aerosol microphysical schemes. The non-linearities resulting from the competition of opposing effects on the CCN population make it difficult to extrapolate from idealized experiments to likely impacts of realistic potential emission changes. © 2011 Author(s).

AB  - Mesoporous SiO2-Al2O3 and Al 2O3 were used as supports to prepare hydrocracking (sulfided Ni-W/SiO2-Al2O3) and hydrotreating (sulfided Ni-Mo/Al2O3) catalysts. These hydroprocessing catalysts were used under typical hydroprocessing conditions to convert waste soya-oil mixtures with refinery-oil into saturated hydrocarbons. The hydrocracking catalyst was more selective for the kerosene range (140-250 °C) hydrocarbons while the less acidic hydrotreating catalyst was more selective for the diesel range (250-380 °C) hydrocarbons. The hydrodeoxygenation pathway for oxygen removal from triglycerides seems to be favored over the hydrotreating catalyst, while decarboxylation + decarbonylation pathway is favored over the hydrocracking catalyst. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A shift to utilize more renewable energy sources has been motivated by issues of energy security, environmental protection, and sustainable development. Biofuels are among the promising forms of renewable energy as they can be produced from a wide variety of feedstocks (e.g., traditional agriculture crops, energy crops, forestry products, municipal solid waste, etc.). Biorefineries are processing facilities that convert biomass into value-added products such as biofuels, specialty chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. To enhance material and energy recovery within processing facilities, an integrated biorefinery is proposed. Since the potential pathways and products in an integrated biorefinery are extensive, product allocation is a complex task. The main challenge in designing an integrated biorefinery is to synthesize a sustainable biorefinery with maximum economic performance while causing minimum environmental impact. Since such objectives are often conflicting in nature, fuzzy mathematical programming is adapted in this work to synthesize a sustainable integrated biorefinery that fulfills both considerations simultaneously. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The rapidly expanding market for biodiesel has increased the supply and reduced the cost of glycerol, making it an attractive sustainable feed stock for the fuel and chemical industry. Glycerol-based biorefinery is the microbial fermentation of crude glycerol to produce fuels and chemicals. A major challenge is to obtain microbes tolerant to inhibitors such as salts and organic solvents present in crude glycerol. Microbial screening was attempted to isolate novel strain capable of growing on crude glycerol as a sole carbon source. The newly isolated bacteria, identified as nonpathogenic Kluyvera cryocrescens S26 could convert biodiesel-derived crude glycerol to ethanol with high yield and productivity. The supplementation of nutrients such as yeast extract resulted in distinguished enhancement in cell growth as well as ethanol productivity under anaerobic condition. When glycerol fermentation is performed under microaerobic condition, there is also a remarkable improvement in cell growth, ethanol productivity and yield, compared with those under strict anaerobic condition. In batch fermentation under microaerobic condition, K. cryocrescens S26 produced 27 g/l of ethanol from crude glycerol with high molar yield of 80% and productivity of 0.61 g/l/h. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - According to the EU directives, bioethanol is added to automobile gasoline. The E85 fuel contains 85 % of bioethanol and 15 % of Natural 95 gasoline. In compressionignition engines, the use of bioethanol is distinctively lower, the E95 fuel is predominating. Double-fuel systems with separate tanks of ethanol and diesel or with their direct mixing are also used. It is envisaged that the bioethanol proportion in fuels will increase at the expense of fossil fuels. A most pronounced increase in bioethanol use can be expected after development of second-generation biofuels.

AB  - This paper reports on a method for development and validation for simultaneous characterization and determination of oxygenated polar impurities - free fatty carboxylic acids (FFAs), partial glycerides (monoacylglycerides, MGs), residual glycerol and free sterols - in various biodiesels based on the combination of solid-phase extraction (SPE), silylation and GC/MS technologies. The effects of various SPE and silylation conditions on the method recoveries were evaluated. Using this integrated SPE-GC/MS method, 38 target polar compounds (13 FFAs, 17 glycerides and 8 sterols) in 9 biodiesels derived from 4 different feedstocks were successfully separated and quantified. It was found that the carbon chain length of FFAs was ranged from C6 to C 24, with C16 and C18 being the most abundant in all biodiesels. The total FFAs concentration was consistent with the acid values (AVs) measured by standard method ASTM D974-04. MG congeners with carbon number of 18 (mono-C18) were most abundant in the biodiesel samples, followed by mono-C16 and free glycerol. β-Sitosterol and campesterol were found to be the prevailing phytosterols in all pure vegetable oil-based biodiesels, while brassicasterol and stigmasterol was only significant in the biodiesel from canola oil and soybean oil, respectively, and abundant cholesterol was only detected in animal fat-based biodiesels.

AB  - Integrated biodiesel processes based on reactive separations powered by solid acid/base catalysts are available nowadays, offering significant advantages such as minimal capital investment and operating costs, as well as no catalyst-related waste streams and no soap formation. However, the controllability of the process is just as important as the capital and operating savings. In such processes the small number of degrees of freedom is a drawback which makes it difficult to correctly set the ratio of reactant feeds and consequently to avoid impurities in the products. This work considers the process control of biodiesel production by reactive absorption, the main result being an efficient control structure that ensures the excess of methanol that is necessary for the total conversion of the fatty acids and for prevention of the difficult separations, while maintaining high purity of the water by-product. Rigorous simulations were performed - using Aspen Plus and Aspen Plus Dynamics as efficient computer-aided process engineering tools - for a plant producing 10. ktpy biodiesel from waste vegetable oil with high free fatty acids content, using solid acids as green catalysts. This reactive absorption process eliminates all conventional catalyst-related operations, and efficiently uses the raw materials and the reactor volume in an integrated setup that is well controllable in spite of the reduced number of degrees of freedom. © 2010 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Materials and methods: The levels and possible sources of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were investigated in the surface sediments of Liaodong Bay, Bohai Sea, China. Results: The sum of 16 PAHs (∑PAH16) concentrations varied from 144.5 to 291.7 ng/g, with a mean value of 184.7 ng/g, indicating low PAH levels compared with reported values for other bays and rivers in China and developed countries. High concentrations of PAHs were observed in the Luan River Estuary and in the vicinity of Qinhuangdao, implying that sewage from the Luan River and shipping activities are important sources of PAHs in Liaodong Bay. Conclusion: An ecological risk assessment of PAHs, based on the effect range-low quotients, indicated that adverse biological effects caused by acenaphthene occasionally may take place in the sediments of Liaodong Bay. PAH source identification suggested that PAHs in most sediments were mainly from incomplete combustion of grass, wood, and coal. At other stations near the Luan River Estuary, both petrogenic and pyrogenic inputs were significant, and the petroleum-derived PAHs were mainly from shipping activities and discharge of pollutants via rivers. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - We estimated the source contributions to carbonaceous aerosol concentration in Korea on the basis of Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment Phase B (INTEX-B) anthropogenic emissions and satellite-derived biomass burning emissions by using a nested version of GEOS-Chem with a spatial resolution of 0.5°×0.667° for the period March 2006-February 2007. First, we evaluated the model by comparing the simulated and observed aerosol concentrations at East Asia Network (EANET) sites and at a site in Korea. The results indicate that the model reproduces the variability and magnitudes of the observed SO42-, NO3-, and NH4+ concentrations in Korea and those of the observed PM10 concentrations in East Asia. However, the organic carbon (OC) and black carbon (BC) aerosol concentrations estimated by the model are lower than those observed in Korea by a factor of 2, especially in winter. This underestimation is likely due to extremely low domestic anthropogenic emissions and lack in seasonal variation. Source adjustments using a simple fitting and the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) monthly allocation factors for seasonal variation yield significantly improved model results (R2 increased from 0.58 to 0.84), which can then be used to estimate the source contributions to the OC and BC concentrations in Korea. We found that domestic anthropogenic emissions are the most important factors, contributing 74% (9% from fossil fuels and 65% from biofuels) and 78% (42% from fossil fuels and 36% from biofuels) to the OC and BC concentrations, respectively, on an annual mean basis in Korea. The trans-boundary transport of Chinese sources is another important factor, contributing 13% and 20% to the OC and BC concentrations, respectively. The contributions of wildfires and biogenic sources to the annual mean carbonaceous aerosol concentration in Korea are relatively small (4% and 6%, respectively). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass productivity and fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) derived from intracellular lipid of a Nannochloropsis sp. isolated from Singapore's coastal waters were studied under different light wavelengths and intensities. Nannochloropsis sp., was grown in both phototrophic and mixotrophic (glycerol as the carbon source) culture conditions in three primary monochromatic light wavelengths, i.e., red, green and blue LEDs, and also in white LED. The maximum specific growth rate (μ) for LEDs was blue&gt;white&gt;green&gt;red. Nannochloropsis sp. achieved a μ of 0.64 and 0.66d-1 in phototrophic and mixotrophic cultures under blue lighting, respectively. The intracellular fatty acid composition of Nannochloropsis sp. varied between cultures exposed to different wavelengths, although the absolute fatty acid content did differ significantly. Maximum FAME yield from Nannochloropsis sp. was 20.45% and 15.11% of dry biomass weight equivalent under photo- and mixotrophic culture conditions respectively for cultures exposed to green LED (550nm). However, maximum volumetric FAME yield was achieved for phototrophic and mixotrophic cultures (i.e., 55.13 and 111.96mg/l, respectively) upon cell exposure to blue LED (470nm) due to highest biomass productivity. It was calculated that incremental exposure of light intensity over the cell growth cycle saves almost 20% of the energy input relative to continuous illumination for a given light intensity. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the present work, microbial lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus was immobilized by covalent binding onto olive pomace. Immobilized support material used to produce biodiesel with pomace oil and methanol. The properties of the support and immobilized derivative were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The maximum immobilization of T. lanuginosus was obtained as 18.67. mg/g support and the highest specific activity was 10.31. U/mg protein. The properties of immobilized lipase were studied. The effects of protein concentration, pH and buffer concentration on the immobilization and lipase activity were investigated. Biodiesel production using the immobilized lipase was realized by a three-step addition of methanol to avoid strong substrate inhibition. Under the optimized conditions, the maximum biodiesel yield was 93% at 25. °C in 24. h reaction. The immobilized enzyme retained its activity during the 10 repeated batch reactions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fatty acid methyl ester was produced from used vegetable cooking oil using Mg1-x Zn1+xO2 solid catalyst and the performance monitored in terms of ester content obtained. Used vegetable cooking oil was employed to reduce operation cost of biodiesel. The significant operating parameters which affect the overall yield of the process were studied. The highest ester content, 80%, was achieved with the catalyst during 4h 15min reaction at 188°C with methanol to oil ratio of 9:1 and catalyst loading of 2.55wt% oil. Also, transesterification of virgin oil gave higher yield with the heterogeneous catalyst and showed high selectivity towards ester production. The used vegetable cooking oil did not require any rigorous pretreatment. Catalyst stability was examined and there was no leaching of the active components, and its performance was as good at the fourth as at the first cycle. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this work is to study the catalyst prepared by glucose-starch mixture. Assessment experiments showed that solid acid behaved the highest esterification activity when glucose and corn powder were mixed at ratio of 1:1, carbonized at 400°C for 75min and sulfonated with concentrated H2SO4 (98%) at 150°C for 5h. The catalyst was characterized by acid activity measurement, XPS, TEM and FT-IR. The results indicated that solid acid composed of CS0.073O0.541 has both Lewis acid sites and Brǒnsted acid sites caused by SO3H and COOH. The conversions of oleic acid esterification and triolein transesterification are 96% and 60%, respectively. Catalyst for biodiesel production from waste cottonseed oil containing high free fatty acid (FFA 55.2wt.%) afforded the methyl ester yield of about 90% after 12h. The catalyst deactivated gradually after recycles usage, but it could be regenerated by H2SO4 treatment. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In order to achieve a viable biodiesel industry, new catalyst technology is needed which can process a variety of less expensive waste oils, such as yellow grease and brown grease. However, for these catalysts to be effective for biodiesel production using these feedstocks, they must be able to tolerate higher concentrations of free fatty acids (FFA), water, and sulfur. We have developed a class of zirconia supported metaloxide catalysts that achieve high FAME yields through esterification of FFAs while simultaneously performing desulfurization and de-metallization functions. In fact, methanolysis, with the zirconia supported catalysts, was more effective for desulfurization than an acid washing process. In addition, using zirconia supported catalysts to convert waste grease, high in sulfur content, resulted in a FAME product that could meet the in-use ASTM diesel fuel sulfur specification (<500 ppm). Possible mechanisms of desulfurization and de-metallization by methanolysis were proposed to explain this activity. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Poly (sodium acrylate) supporting NaOH (NaOH/NaPAA) was prepared by in situ polymerization of aqueous solution of acrylic acid with an over-neutralization by adding excess of NaOH. NaOH/NaPAA presented a promising selectivity for water absorbency and good water retention with negligible swelling capacity in the organic solvents of methanol, glycerol, rubber seed oil methyl esters, and rubber seed oil. NaOH/NaPAA catalysts showed a basic strength of 15.0. <H_. <. 18.4 and their basicity increased with the increase of the NaOH loading amount. NaOH/NaPAA catalysts exhibited almost the same catalytic activity in the transesterification of rubber seed oil with methanol under the optimized reaction conditions compared to conventional homogeneous NaOH catalyst. Furthermore, the functional absorbent/catalyst system presented a good water resistance in the transesterification which retained high catalytic activity when a water concentration in the reaction system was less than 2 wt.%. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Penicillium expansum lipase (PEL) was used to catalyze biodiesel production from corn oil in [BMIm][PF6]11-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate.1 (an ionic liquid, IL) and tert-butanol. Both systems were optimized in terms of MeOH/oil molar ratio, reaction temperature, enzyme loading, solvent volume, and water content. The high conversion obtained in the IL (86%) as compared to that in tert-butanol (52%) demonstrates that the IL is a superior solvent for PEL-catalyzed biodiesel production. Poor yields were obtained in a series of hydrophilic ILs. Addition of salt hydrates affected biodiesel production predominantly through the specific ion (Hofmeister) effect. The impact of methanol on both activity and stability of PEL in the IL and in hexane was investigated, in comparison to the results obtained by two commonly used lipases, Novozym 435 and Lipozyme TLIM. The results substantiate that while different lipases show different resistance to methanol in different reaction systems, PEL is tolerant to methanol in both systems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The use of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) for microbial lipid accumulation was investigated in flask cultures of Cryptococcus albidus. The optimum culture temperature and pH were 25. °C and pH 6.0, respectively, and the highest lipid content (27.8%) was obtained with ammonia chloride as a nitrogen source. The lipid yield coefficient on VFAs was 0.167 g/g of C. albidus with a VFAs (acetic, propionic, butyric acids) ratio of 8:1:1, which was in good agreement with a theoretically predicted lipid yield coefficient of the VFAs as a carbon source. The major fatty acids of the lipids accumulated by C. albidus were similar to those of soybean oil and jatropha oil. A preliminary cost analysis shows that VFAs-based biodiesel production is competitive with current palm and soybean based biodiesels. Further process development for lower aeration cost and higher lipid yield will make this process more economical. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

When co-product was not considered, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were 5.60kg CO2eq kg-1H2 for WS-H2, 5.32kg CO2eq kg-1H2 for SSS-H2, and 5.18kg CO2eq kg-1H2 for SPP-H2. BioH2 pathways reduced GHG emissions by 52-56% compared to diesel and by 54-57% compared to steam methane reforming production of H2. The energy ratios (ER) were also comparable: 1.08 for WS-H2, 1.14 for SSS-H2 and 1.17 for SPP-H2. A shift from SPP-H2 to WS-H2 would therefore not affect the ER and GHG emissions of these BioH2 pathways. When co-product was considered, a shift from SPP-H2 to WS-H2 or SSS-H2 decreased the ER, while increasing the GHG emissions significantly. Co-product yield should be considered when selecting BioH2 feedstocks. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae have been identified as a potential biodiesel feedstock due to their high lipid productivity and potential for cultivation on marginal land. One of the challenges in utilizing microalgae to make biodiesel is the complexities of extracting the lipids using organic solvents followed by transesterification of the extracts to biodiesel. In the present work, reaction conditions were optimized that allow a single step extraction and conversion to biodiesel in high yield from microalgae. From the optimized conditions, it is demonstrated that quantitative conversion of triglycerides from several different microalgae and cyanobacteria could be achieved, including from mixed microbial biomass collected from a municipal wastewater lagoon. Evidence is presented that for some samples, significantly more biodiesel can be produced than would be expected from available triglycerides, indicating conversion of fatty acids contained in other molecules (e.g., phospholipids) using this approach. The effectiveness of the approach on wet algae is also reported. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper explores the feasibility of converting waste Rohu fish (Labeo rohita) scale into a high-performance, reusable, low-cost heterogeneous catalyst for synthesis of biodiesel from soybean oil. The thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed that a significant portion of the main component of fish scale i.e. HAP (hydroxyapatite) could be transformed into β-tri-calcium phosphate when calcined above 900°C for 2h. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) morphology studies of the calcined scale depicted a fibrous layer of porous structure; while a BET surface area of 39m2/g was measured. Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to determine the optimal parametric conditions viz. methanol/oil molar ratio, 6.27:1, calcination temperature, 997.42°C and catalyst concentration, 1.01wt.% of oil corresponding to a maximum FAME yield of 97.73%. Reusability results confirmed that the prepared catalyst could be reemployed up to six times, procreating a potentially applicable avenue in biodiesel synthesis. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, Scenedesmus obliquus SJTU-3 and Chlorella pyrenoidosa SJTU-2 were cultivated with 0.03%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50% CO2. The two microalgae could grow at 50% CO2 (&gt;0.69gL-1) and grew well (&gt;1.22gL-1) under CO2 concentrations ranging from 5% to 20%. Both of the two examined microalgae showed best growth potential at 10% CO2. The maximum biomass concentration and CO2 biofixation rate were 1.84gL-1 and 0.288gL-1d-1 for S. obliquus SJTU-3 and 1.55gL-1 and 0.260gL-1d-1 for C. pyrenoidosa SJTU-2, respectively. The main fatty acid compositions of the two examined microalgae were fatty acids with C16-C18 (&gt;94%) under different CO2 levels. High CO2 levels (30-50%) were favorable for the accumulation of total lipids and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The present results suggested that the two microalgae be appropriate for mitigating CO2 in the flue gases and biodiesel production. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Crude glycerol (CG), a by-product of biodiesel production, is an organic carbon-rich substrate with potential as feedstock for polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production. PHA is a biodegradable thermoplastic synthesized by microorganisms as an intracellular granule. In this study we investigated PHA production on CG using mixed microbial consortia (MMC) and determined that the enriched MMC produced exclusively polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) utilizing the methanol fraction. PHB synthesis appeared to be stimulated by a macronutrient deficiency. Intracellular concentrations remained relatively constant over an operational cycle, with microbial growth occurring concurrent with polymer synthesis. PHB average molecular weights ranged from 200-380 kDa, while thermal properties compared well with commercial PHB. The resulting PHB material properties and characteristics would be suitable for many commercial uses. Considering full-scale process application, it was estimated that a 38 million L (10 million gallon) per year biodiesel operation could potentially produce up to 19 metric ton (20.9. ton) of PHB per year. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A 1.2. kW, 2450. MHz resonant continuous microwave processing system was designed and optimized for oil extraction from green algae (Scenedesmus obliquus). Algae-water suspension (1:1 w/w) was heated to 80 and 95. °C, and subjected to extraction for up to 30 min. Maximum oil yield was achieved at 95. °C and 30 min. The microwave system extracted 76-77% of total recoverable oil at 20-30 min and 95. °C, compared to only 43-47% for water bath control. Extraction time and temperature had significant influence (p<. 0.0001) on extraction yield. Oil analysis indicated that microwaves extracted oil containing higher percentages of unsaturated and essential fatty acids (indicating higher quality). This study validates for the first time the efficiency of a continuous microwave system for extraction of lipids from algae. Higher oil yields, faster extraction rates and superior oil quality demonstrate this system's feasibility for oil extraction from a variety of feedstock. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Continuous esterification of free fatty acids (FFA) from acidified oil with methanol was carried out with NKC-9 cation-exchange resin in a fixed bed reactor with an internal diameter of 25 mm and a height of 450 mm to produce biodiesel. The results showed that the FFA conversion increased with increases in methanol/oil mass ratio, reaction temperature and catalyst bed height, whereas decreased with increases in initial water content in feedstock and feed flow rate. The FFA conversion kept over 98.0% during 500 h of continuous esterification processes under 2.8:1 methanol to oleic acid mass ratio, 44.0. cm catalyst bed height, 0.62 ml/min feed flow rate and 65. °C reaction temperature, showing a much high conversion and operational stability. Furthermore, the loss of sulfonic acid groups from NKC-9 resin into the production was not found during continuous esterification. In sum, NKC-9 resin shows the potential commercial applications to esterification of FFA. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - One of the main drawbacks of the use of biodiesel is its bad behavior at low temperatures. In this work, we show that it is possible to take profit of the presence of free fatty acids in the starting materials used for biodiesel production (i.e. reused oils) by synthesizing additives able to improve cold flow properties. The synthesis of fatty acid derivatives have been successfully carried out by esterification of stearic, oleic and linoleic acids with bulky linear and cyclic alcohols and by epoxidation of methyl oleate and subsequent ring-opening reaction with the same alcohols. The study of crystallization patterns of pure derivatives by DSC and optical microscopy revealed the improvement of cold properties of biodiesel. Blends of biodiesel with up to 5% of some of these compounds allowed a decrease of CFPP (Cold Filter Pour Point). Both observations reveal the utility of these compounds as cheap and renewable additives. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, regulated and unregulated gaseous emissions and fuel consumption with five different fuels were tested in a 4-cylinder, light-duty diesel EURO IV typically used for the automotive vehicles in Europe. Three different biodiesel fuels obtained from soybean oil, rapeseed oil and palm oil, a Fischer Tropsch fuel and an ultra low sulphur diesel were studied. The test used was the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), this allowed tests to be carried out on an engine warmed up beforehand to avoid the effect of cold starts and several tests a day. Regulated emissions of NOX, CO, HC and CO2 were measured for each fuel. Unburned Hydrocarbon Speciation and formaldehyde were also measured in order to determine the maximum incremental reactivity (MIR) of the gaseous emissions. Pollutants were measured without the diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) to gather data about raw emissions. When biodiesel was used, increases in regulated and unregulated emissions were observed and also significant increases in engine fuel consumption. The use of Fischer Tropsch fuel, however, caused lower regulated and unregulated emissions and fuel consumption than diesel. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents a general optimization model that enables the selection of fuel conversion technologies, capacities, biomass locations, and the logistics of transportation from the locations of forestry resources to the conversion sites and then to the final markets. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model has been formulated and implemented in a commercial software package (GAMS) using databases built in Excel. The MILP represents decisions regarding (1) the optimal number, locations, and sizes of various types of processing plants, (2) the amounts of biomass, intermediate products, and final products to be transported between the selected locations over a selected period, and maximizes the objective function of overall profit. The model has been tested based on an industry-representative data set that contains information on the existing wood resources, final product market locations and demands, and candidate locations and sizes for different types of processing plants, as well as the costs associated with the various processing units and transportation of materials, covering the Southeastern region of the United States. The model is applied to design both a distributed, and a more centralized, conversion system. The overall profits, values, cost, and supply network designs of both systems are analyzed using the optimization model. In particular, we investigate: 1) which parameters have major effect on the overall economics, and 2) the benefits of going to more distributed types of processing networks, in terms of the overall economics and the robustness to demand variations. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The development of renewable energy source alternatives has become a planet need because of the unavoidable fossil fuel scarcity and for that reason biodiesel production has attracted growing interest over the last decade. The reaction yield for obtaining fatty acid alkyl esters varies significantly according to the operating conditions such as temperature and the feed reactants ratio and thus investigation of the thermodynamics involved in such reactional systems may afford important knowledge on the effects of process variables on biodiesel production. The present work reports a thermodynamic analysis of fatty acid esterification reaction at low pressure. For this purpose, Gibbs free energy minimization was employed with UNIFAC and modified Wilson thermodynamic models through a nonlinear programming model implementation. The methodology employed is shown to reproduce the most relevant investigations involving experimental studies and thermodynamic analysis. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Calcium-based mixed oxides catalysts (CaMgO and CaZnO) have been investigated for the transesterification of Jatropha curcas oil (JCO) with methanol, in order to evaluate their potential as heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production. Both CaMgO and CaZnO catalysts were prepared by coprecipitation method of the corresponding mixed metal nitrate solution in the presence of a soluble carbonate salt at ~ pH 8-9. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and N2 adsorption (BET). The conversion of JCO by CaMgO and CaZnO were studied and compared with calcium oxide (CaO), magnesium oxide (MgO) and zinc oxide (ZnO) catalysts. Both CaMgO and CaZnO catalysts showed high activity as CaO and were easily separated from the product. CaMgO was found more active than CaZnO in the transesterification of JCO with methanol. Under the suitable transesterification conditions at 338 K (catalyst amount = 4 wt. %, methanol/oil molar ratio = 15, reaction time = 6 h), the JCO conversion of more than 80% can be achieved over CaMgO and CaZnO catalysts. Even though CaO gave the highest activity, the conversion of JCO decreased significantly after reused for forth run whereas the conversion was only slightly lowered for CaMgO and CaZnO after sixth run. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of the work presented here is the production of liquid biofuels from wet organic waste matter in a continuous one-step catalytic process under hydrothermal conditions. The catalytic reaction of wet organic matter at near-critical water conditions (T &gt; 300 °C, p &gt; 22.1 MPa) is used to produce a mixture of combustible organics which can be used as liquid biofuel. In order to achieve a good product quality in a continuous one-step process, two catalysts were applied, a homogeneous potassium carbonate catalyst and a heterogeneous ZrO2 catalyst. In addition, the reaction mixture was recirculated. The continuous flow of concentrated waste biomass feed at low flow rates and recirculation of the hot reaction mixture were the most challenging obstacles to overcome. The scale of the plant (0.1 l reactor volume) allowed for a variation of the feed, reaction temperature, and recirculation rate in order to optimise the process conditions. Still, the product quantity obtained was sufficient to perform a analytical characterisation. The experimental results confirmed the feasibility of the process. Hydrothermal treatment of waste biomass, after dewatering, resulted in a biocrude oil of high calorific value. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Currently, bioethanol leads the automotive fuel market as the main substitute for gasoline in spark-ignition engines. However, worldwide interest has been triggered in the potential of 2,5-dimethylfuran, known as DMF, since the discovery of improved production methods. Although the energy content of DMF is comparable to that of gasoline, little is known about its combustion characteristics and emissions. Therefore, this work examines the effect of DMF in a single cylinder direct-injection spark-ignition engine. The results are compared to ethanol and gasoline using the optimized spark timings for gasoline and the respective fuel. In summary, DMF produces competitive combustion and emissions qualities to gasoline, which, in some cases surpass ethanol. The two biofuels have a higher burning rate and lower initial combustion duration than gasoline. They also produce greater combustion efficiency, which helps to lower hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. These initial results highlight how DMF, which was originally only considered as an octane improver, has the potential to become a competitive renewable gasoline alternative. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recently a "Biofuels Promotion and Development Law" was approved in Mexico that requires increasing volumes of renewable to blend into the transportation fuel pool, much of which is likely to be ethanol. Emissions data under the three different driving conditions of the United States FTP-75 certification cycle were obtained for regulated, toxic and carbonyl compounds using recent model year vehicles representing 61% of the typical fleet available in Mexico. Ozone-forming potential and specific reactivity of tailpipe and evaporative emissions were also calculated. Comparison were performed using the traditional methyl-tertiary butyl ether employed in Mexico with an ethanol fuel at the same level of oxygen content, taking into account the current fuel specifications and the stream stocks available at the Mexican refineries. The results suggest that the contribution of cold start to regulated emissions range from 37% to 40% whiles those of toxic from 40% to 47% in both fuels. Results also indicate an increase in the rates of evaporative emissions of higher Specific Reactivy with the ethanol fuel. Estimation of the percent reduction of pollutants using the Complex Model of the USA Environmental Protection Agency suggests that volatile organic compounds will exceeds the limits imposed by the model if vapour pressure of the ethanol gasoline is not properly adjusted. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - One of the reasons why Jatropha curcas has recently been hailed as one of the world's most sustainable biofuel crops, is its suitability to grow on arid land where it offers the additional benefit of erosion control. As arid lands are often very vulnerable to land use changes, it is nevertheless important to fully understand (belowground) plant functional and structural development before they are planted at large scale. Here we introduce possible measurement methods for the root system structure of J. curcas seedlings and adult plants, formulate a set of hypotheses on root system structure, and demonstrate these in the light of root structure stability. Initially developing one taproot and four perpendicularly oriented laterals, the root structure of Jatropha appears to be quite promising to control soil erosion by water and wind on arid land. The lateral roots could decrease soil erodibility through additional soil cohesion, while the taproot and sinkers may enable exploitation of subsurface soil moisture and thus enhance vegetative cover, even in very dry environments. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work presents the first dual fuel measurements with pure jatropha oil and biogas, using a 12 kW diesel engine generator. Reference tests are done with pure jatropha oil and with diesel to characterize the engine's thermal efficiency ηt, volumetric efficiency ηv and air-excess ratio λ versus output power. An extensive parameter study is done to predict/explain the effect of dual fuel operation on ηv and λ. Dual fuel experiments, adding different qualities (CH 4/CO2 ratios) of synthetic biogas to the intake air, show that thermal efficiency is hardly affected for higher loads. For lower loads, biogas addition results in a decrease up to 10% in thermal efficiency, independent of biogas quality. Both ηv and λ decrease with addition of biogas, in quantitative agreement with predictions. The engine runs well up to a certain heat release fraction of methane; at higher fractions irregularities are observed, probably attributable to light end-gas knock. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work investigates the production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from Jatropha curcas oil using a variety of heterogeneous catalysts: resins, zeolites, clays, hydrotalcites, aluminas and niobium oxide. For this purpose, a catalyst screening was first conducted in a batch reactor at the following operating conditions: oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:9, 6h of reaction, 5 wt% catalyst, at 333 and 393K. From the screening step, KSF clay and Amberlyst 15 catalysts were selected to carry out a 23 full factorial central composite rotatable design so as to elucidate the effects of process variables on FAME yield. The optimum reaction conditions for both catalysts were found to be oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:12, 5 wt% of catalyst, 433K and 6h of reaction with a FAME yield of about 70 wt%. A kinetic study was then experimentally performed and a semi-empirical model was built to represent the experimental data. Finally, catalyst re-utilization in five successive batch experiments was evaluated at the optimized conditions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A pure component topological index was integrated with the modified Grunberg-Nissan or the modified Dalton-type mass-average equation to calculate the mean topological index χm,1 or χm,2 of five biodiesel fuels (peanut, canola, coconut, and palm, soybean oil). Then, the χm,1 or χm,2 was respectively related with the SMD values of biodiesel fuels (taken from the literature, at 313 K), and two regression equations were obtained. The regression equation derived from χm,1 has a higher predictive accuracy than the regression equation derived from χm,2, and the deviations of these two regression equations were within 1.73% and 1.87%, respectively. Furthermore, a regression equation derived from the correlation of χm,1 and SMD was used to calculate the SMD values of biodiesel fuels (at 353 K), and the deviations were within 0.78%. Three types of hypothetical biodiesel fuels were investigated to know the effect of the molecular structure (carbon number and unsaturated bond) on the SMD. A suitable material for the preparation of a biodiesel having the comparable atomization with the diesel no.1 or no.2 will be composed of such components (low carbon number and more unsaturated bonds). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this work is to assess pollen viability using the staining technique and in vitro germination with different concentrations of sucrose in Jatropha ribifolia and Jatropha mollissima, contributing to the knowledge of the reproductive biology and subsidizing their conservation, management and utilization. Pollen viability was measured by dye method. Acetocarmine, acetic orcein and cotton-blue stain were used. The culture medium for pollen germination was solidificated by the addition of 1% agar combined with 0 (control), 10, 20, 30 and 40% of sucrose. The data were submitted to analysis of variance at 5% probability. All dyes used in this experiment allowed easy differentiation between fertile and non fertile pollen. The rate of formation of pollen tubes was higher in medium with 10% of sucrose for both species because the trend is that the sucrose concentration increases the supply of carbon, changes the osmotic potential and inhibits the formation of pollen tube in vitro. © 2011 Academic Journals.

AB  - In the present study, the effects of different biodiesel blends on the unregulated emissions of a Euro 4 compliant passenger car were examined. Two fresh and two oxidized biodiesel fuels of different source materials were blended with an ultra low sulphur automotive diesel fuel at proportions of 10, 20, and 30% v/v. Emission measurements were conducted on a chassis dynamometer with a constant volume sampling (CVS) technique, over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the Artemis driving cycles. The experimental results revealed that the addition of biodiesel led to important increases in most carbonyl compounds. Sharp increases were observed with the use of the oxidized biodiesel blends, especially those prepared from used frying oil methyl esters. Similar to carbonyl emissions, most PAH compounds increased with the addition of the oxidized biodiesel blends. It can be assumed that the presence of polymerization products and cyclic acids, along with the degree of unsaturation were the main factors that influenced carbonyl and PAH emissions profile. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin/dibenzofuran (PCDD/F) emissions from heavy-duty diesel engines (HDDEs) fuelled with paraffinic-palmbiodiesel blends have been rarely addressed in the literature. A high-resolution gas chromatograph/high-resolution mass spectrometer (HRGC/HRMS) was used to analyze 17 PCDD/F species. Experimental results indicate that the main species of PCDD/Fs were OCDD (octachlorinated debenzo-p-dioxin) and OCDF (octachlorodibenzofuran), and they accounted for 40-50% of the total PCDD/Fs for all test fuels. Paraffinic-palmbiodiesel blends decreased PCDD/Fs by 86.1-88.9%, toxic PCDD/Fs by 91.9-93.0%, THC (total hydrocarbons) by 13.6-23.3%, CO (carbon monoxide) by 27.2-28.3%, and PM (particulate matter) by 21.3-34.2%. Using biodiesel blends, particularly BP9505 or BP8020, instead of premium diesel fuel (PDF) significantly reduced emissions of both PCDD/Fs and traditional pollutants. Using BP9505 (95vol% paraffinic fuel+5vol% palmbiodiesel) and BP8020 instead of PDF can decrease PCDD/F emissions by 5.93 and 5.99gI-TEQyear-1 in Taiwan, respectively. © 2010.

AB  - A common goal in present and future forestry, biofuels and biomaterials practices, is the need to valorize lignocellulose processes to maximize value and optimize autonomic economy. Consequently, a key focus of modern biorefining is the on-site utilization of all residual materials generating products of the highest possible value. The LignoBoost process, recently demonstrated on the pilot-scale at Kraft pulp mills, injects CO2 into pulping liquors which results in a lower solution pH and thereby precipitates lignin. The present paper compares and evaluates the pyrolysis of pulping liquor lignins precipitated by sulfuric acid (pH 3) and the aforementioned CO2 method (pH 10.5 and 9.5). The CO2 based process yielded lignin that showed superior pyrolysis properties including low gas formation and increased bio-oil yields, close to 40%, consisting primarily of low (150 g mol−1) molecular weight compounds. Subsequent NMR analysis showed that the oils exhibit favorable changes in functionalities, e.g. loss of aromatic and gain in aliphatic carbon percentages as well as decrease in carboxyl and methoxyl (oxygen containing) groups. Moreover, NMR results further confirmed previously hypothesized lignin pyrolysis reactions, while at the same time showed the potential of CO2 precipitated lignin for pyrolysis and subsequent liquid biofuel production. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This biodiesel lab experiment increased the student's understanding of biofuels and associated chemical concepts. The flash point testing proved to be a constructive activity to relate vapor pressure properties of biodiesel and other fuels to their chemical structure. Comparison of student-produced biodiesel with that obtained from a commercial supplier illustrated how fuel properties depend on the production process and the resulting composition and purity of the fuel product. The contrast between density and flash point testing also demonstrated the reason why multiple QA-QC tests are necessary for fuels. The fact that the crude biodiesel produced by students did not conform to ASTM standards was a good lesson in QA-QC and provided students with insight to the rules and processes concerning industrial chemical production and commercial regulation. © 2010 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.

AB  - New chemical kinetic reaction mechanisms are developed for two of the five major components of biodiesel fuel, methyl stearate and methyl oleate. The mechanisms are produced using existing reaction classes and rules for reaction rates, with additional reaction classes to describe other reactions unique to methyl ester species. Mechanism capabilities were examined by computing fuel/air autoignition delay times and comparing the results with more conventional hydrocarbon fuels for which experimental results are available. Additional comparisons were carried out with measured results taken from jet-stirred reactor experiments for rapeseed oil methyl ester fuels. In both sets of computational tests, methyl oleate was found to be slightly less reactive than methyl stearate, and an explanation of this observation is made showing that the double bond in methyl oleate inhibits certain low temperature chain branching reaction pathways important in methyl stearate. The resulting detailed chemical kinetic reaction mechanism includes more approximately 3500 chemical species and more than 17,000 chemical reactions. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Combustion Institute.

AB  - Biodiesel is typically a mixture of long chain fatty acid methyl esters for use in compression ignition engines. Improving biofuel engine performance requires understanding its fundamental combustion properties and the pathways of combustion. This research study presents new combustion data for methyl decanoate in an opposed-flow diffusion flame. An improved detailed chemical kinetic model for methyl decanoate combustion is developed, which serves as the basis for deriving a skeletal mechanism via the direct relation graph method. The novel skeletal mechanism consists of 648 species and 2998 reactions. The skeletal mechanism reproduces the behavior of the fully detailed mechanism in plug flow and stirred reactors for temperatures of 900-1800 K, equivalence ratios of 0.25-2.0, and pressures of 101 and 1013 kPa. This mechanism well predicts the methyl decanoate opposed-flow diffusion flame data. The results from the flame simulations indicate that methyl decanoate is consumed via abstraction of hydrogen atoms to produce fuel radicals, which lead to the production of alkenes. The ester moiety in methyl decanoate leads to the formation of low molecular weight oxygenated compounds such as carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, and ketene. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Combustion Institute.

AB  - In Latvia, rapeseed methyl ester (RME) is generally considered to have a significant economic potential in the field of biofuels. As investments grow, it is important to evaluate the environmental impacts of this production and to highlight the main sources of these impacts. Nowadays, the share of biofuels in the transport sector in Latvia is attested to have a value of 0.3% (around 75% biodiesel and 25% bioethanol). Biofuel production in Latvia doubled in the last two years: the current total biodiesel production is approximately 64 ktonne/year (year 2009). The aim of this paper is to understand and model the environmental performance of the biodiesel produced from rapeseeds under the local Latvian conditions. Firstly, energy crops were evaluated by assessing their levels of biodiesel productivity. Secondly, the current Latvian climatic conditions and cultivation parameters were taken into account. To conclude, a comparison with the impacts of fossil based diesel was conducted. © 2011, Versita. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biofuels are receiving growing negative attention. Direct and/or indirect land-use changes that result from their cultivation can cause emissions due to carbon losses in soils and biomass and could negate any eventual greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction benefit. This paper evaluates the implications of land-use change emission on the climate-change mitigation potential of different biofuel production systems in 12 case studies in six countries. We calculated carbon debts created by conversion of different land-use types, ranging from annual cropland to primary forest. We evaluated case studies using three different biofuel crops: oil palm, Jatropha, and soybean. The time needed for each biofuel production system to pay back its carbon debt was calculated based on a life-cycle assessment of the GHG reduction potentials of the system. Carbon debts range from 39 to 1743.7 Mg C02 ha-1. The oil palm case studies created the largest carbon debts (472.8–1743.7 t C02 ha-1) because most of the area expansion came at the expense of dense tropical forest. The highest debt was associated with plantation on peatland. For all cases evaluated, only soybean in Guarantã do Norte and Alta Floresta, Brazil needed less than one human generation (30 years) to repay the initial carbon debt. Highest repayment times were found for Jatropha (76–310 years) and oil palm (59–220 years) case studies. Oil palm established in peatlands had the greatest repayment times (206–220 years). High repayment times for Jatropha resulted from the combined effects of land-cover change and low CO2 emission reduction rate. These outcomes raise serious questions about the sustainability of biofuel production. The carbon implications of conversion of (semi-)natural systems with medium to high biomass indicate that, in order to generate climate benefits, cultivation of biofuel feedstocks should be restricted to areas that already have low carbon content. © 2011 by the author(s).

AB  - There is no doubt about the importance of quality control of biodiesel to provide users with a reliable and consistent fuel quality which guarantees a good engine performance. For this reason, the fuel is characterized by measuring different properties according to international standards. This chapter presents the most important characterization properties, form the standpoint of the biodiesel producer. Since standards require the measurement of several properties and most of the necessary measuring equipment is expensive, and in many cases operated by highly trained personnel, the complete characterization and quality control of the biofuel is usually carried out only in industries with large-scale production capacity. Most small and medium producers are not always able do so. However, some equipment can be designed and built at a reasonable cost, following the specifications set by the standards, which allows the determination of some important parameters. Moreover, measurement of electrical properties (discussed in the following chapters) can also give relevant information about the quality of the biofuel. Both are useful alternatives for small- and medium-scale producers, as well as small research groups. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2011.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the relationship between ethanol prices and oil prices in the Brazilian market, seeking information regarding the intensity of price transmission and the relationship between these markets. Specifically, it aimed to examine the elasticity transmission and causality price between oil markets and the Brazilian ethanol, and evaluate the impact of introduction flex fuel vehicles in ethanol production in Brazil. It was used for analysis of transmission and causality price vector auto-regressive models (VAR) applied to the oil price series, anhydrous alcohol, hydrated alcohol, dummy for flex fuel vehicles, flex fuel vehicle sales, gasoline prices, sales vehicle by Alcohol, Gasoline vehicle sales and a time trend. The results showed that ethanol prices are influenced by the price of oil of the previous week, which shows the influence of oil prices fluctuations on world prices of ethanol in the Brazilian market. It was also verified that the introduction of flex fuel vehicles in Brazil has contributed to the increase of production and price of alcohol.

AB  - Due to its agricultural origin and function as a fuel oxygenate, ethanol is being promoted as an alternative biomass-based fuel for use in spark ignition engines, with mandates for its use at state and regional levels. While it has been established that the addition of ethanol to a fuel reduces the particulate mass concentration in the exhaust, little attention has been paid to changes in the physicochemical properties of the emitted particles. In this work, a dynamometer-mounted GM Quad-4 spark ignition engine run without aftertreatment at 1,500 RPM and 100% load was used with four different fuel blends, containing 0, 20, 40 and 85 percent ethanol in gasoline. This allowed the effects of the fuel composition to be isolated from other effects. Instrumentation employed included two Aerosol Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometers covering different size ranges for analysis of single particle composition, an Aethalometer for black carbon, a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer for particle size distributions, a Photoelectric Aerosol Sensor for particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) species and gravimetric filter measurements for particulate mass concentrations. It was found that, under the conditions investigated here, additional ethanol content in the fuel changes the particle size distribution, especially in the accumulation mode, and decreases the black carbon and total particulate mass concentrations. The molecular weight distribution of the PAHs was found to decrease with added ethanol. However, PAHs produced from higher ethanol-content fuels are associated with NO2- (m/z-46) in the single-particle mass spectra, indicating the presence of nitro-PAHs. Compounds associated with the gasoline (e.g., sulfur-containing species) are diminished due to dilution as ethanol is added to the fuel relative to those associated with the lubricating oil (e.g., calcium, zinc, phosphate) in the single particle spectra. These changes have potential implications for the health effect impacts of particulate emissions from biofuel blends. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Over the last years numerous attempts have been made to minimize the amount of toxic and harmful exhaust gases from diesel powered vehicles. The rapidly exhausted fossil sources coupled with increasing price of petroleum together with the public awareness concerning the environmental protection, are the main reasons that have made many scientists to search for alternative and renewable energy sources. According to the recent EU regulations starting with 1st of January 2010, 5.75wt% of classical diesel fuel must be replaced with more environmental friendly fuels. The most used biofuel is biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters), mainly synthesized by catalytic transesterification of fatty glycerides. Roughly 10 wt% of glycerol is obtained as by-product in catalytic transesterification of fatty glycerides and there are many researching directions in order to find new applications for the increasing availability of glycerol as a low-cost feedstock. In our study we have tested the energetic and ecologic performances (the exhaust emissions as CO, CO2 and NOx) of biodiesel or alkyl ether-diesel blends by testing the fuels on a Diesel engine 392-L4-DT/104 at different engine speeds. The emission tests were measured by using a FTIR SESAM 1.4 equipment. Engine tests were run on the same engine in the same day in order to have the same atmospheric conditions (96 kPa pressure and 29°C) within the three repetitions of each test and average of measured values were taken. The measured CO emissions of biodiesel and alkyl ether-diesel blends were found to be 15% and 37% lower than that of diesel fuel, respectively. © 2011 WIT Press.

AB  - By 2020, according to several government policies like the European Union countries, road transportation fuels must contain at least 10% (v/v) biofuel like biodiesel. Consequently, the world biodiesel production is expected to rise in the next years. However, most biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils, which compete with human food production. Biodiesel from microalgae could help to reach the requested level of biofuel (biodiesel) without endangering the world food supply because microalgae cultivation does not compete with arable land. Nevertheless, the cost of biodiesel production from microalgae must be lowered. One of the main challenges is to extract the lipids from the microalgae and to transform them into biodiesel. The 1st objective of this study was therefore to compare chloroformmethanol- water and hexane as solvents for Nannochloropsis Oculata, Isochrysis Galbana and Pavlova Lutheri microalgae lipid extraction. The 2nd objective was to transform the lipids into biodiesel by an acid catalysed (acetyl chloride) transesterification. The results obtained demonstrated that a lipid yield of 32% (w/w) could be obtained by an extraction with chloroform-methanol-water without reflux. With hexane reflux, the lipids extracted from the microalgae reached 22% (w/w). The fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) composition was not influenced by the reflux (chloroform-methanol-water) during the solvent extraction. The main FAME weight composition (% wt.) obtained from an acid catalyzed transesterification (100°C, 1h) were methyl palmitoleate (56-58%), methyl palmitate (12-14%) and methyl eicosapentaenoate (9.6-10.1%).© 2011 WIT Press.

AB  - Alternative fuels, emissions control technologies and advanced propulsion technologies offer great potential for reducing emissions from, and increasing fuel economy of, buses employed in public transportation. The use of fuels such as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and biodiesel, emissions controls such as diesel particulate filters (DPF) and diesel oxidation catalysts (DOC), and the use of advanced propulsion systems such as hybrid-electric diesel have great potential for decreasing emissions from public transit vehicles and potentially increasing fuel economy. The focus of this paper is to assess the environmental benefits of alternative fuels and advanced hybrid drive technologies in transit vehicles through experimental testing and analysis. Results show that hybrid-electric diesel and CNG buses yield significant reductions in CO2 emissions, approximately 10-20% lower than conventional diesel. Stoichiometric CNG buses demonstrated extremely low emissions of NOx, while conventional, lean-burn CNG had the highest NOx emissions, approximately twice that of hybrid technologies and conventional diesel engines. The hybrid-electric technology demonstrated the highest fuel economy, while CNG has the lowest fuel economy. The use of a 20% biodiesel blend (B20) demonstrated no discernable differences in fuel economy, while showing slightly higher NOx emissions levels and significantly lower PM compared to conventional diesel. © 2011 WIT Press.

AB  - To identify some desirable algal strains for our future research and/or the production of algae-based biofuel, 43 green algal strains were successfully isolated from Chinese freshwaters, and then incubated in the laboratory bioreactors for the growth and oil accumulation investigations. During a 15 d incubation experiment, the accumulations of their biomass and total lipids, together with the lipid productivities for these green algal strains were systematically investigated and compared. Results indicated that the accumulations of biomass for the 43 algal strains ranged from 0.53 g/L to 6.07 g/L during the experiments, with the highest biomass of 6.07 g/L for green algae Scenedesmus bijuga. The lipid content for the tested algal strains varied from 20% to 51% of the dry biomass at the end of cultivation experiments. Green algae Chlorella pyrenoidosa was one of the best oil producers based on our investigations, with the total lipid content of 51% of dry biomass. Taking the growth rates and the accumulations of intracellular lipids into the consideration, 10 strains were considered to have significant potential for biofuel applications. In addition, the lipid productivities of the selected strains were further investigated.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to carry out a comparative analysis of the Brazilian bioethanol sector and the Malaysian palm biofuel sector. The major findings for the Brazilian experience are economic nationalism, mandatory policy with initial focus on the domestic market, a nationwide biofuel infrastructure, incentivized mill construction and the adoption of flex-fuel vehicles are the cornerstone of its success. Production factors like abundant sugar cane feedstock and evolving production technologies have made immense contribution. The Malaysian experience however differs from that of Brazil's. The minuscule domestic market, a lack of biofuel infrastructure on a nationwide basis and a small number of diesel passenger vehicles force the Malaysian biofuel producers to be reliant on the international market. The viability of palm biofuel is very much dependent on petroleum prices. If food value is higher than fuel value, palm oil would be diverted towards food production and vice versa.

AB  - The dilution sampling method simulates the rapid cooling and dilution processes after hot flue gas have left the stack. This allows gases or vapors to nucleate both homogeneously and heterogeneously, and to condense on preexisting particles in processes analogous to those that occur in the ambient environment. Using this method the authors can collect filterable particulate matter (PM) and condensible PM, that is, primary PM, simultaneously. In order to make this method more suitable for field investigation, a compact dilution sampler was developed. The sampler enhances mixing of dilution air with the stack gas, and thus shortens the length of the mixing section. The design decreases the nominal flow rate through the aging section, and accordingly reduces the size of the residence chamber. The decreased size of the sampler is suitable for field test. Sampling gas is pressured into the residence chamber, and air pressure in the chamber is micro-positive. Uncollected redundant gas is automatically discharged through unused sampling ports, which keeps the unit stable. Performance evaluation tests demonstrate that the design is reasonable. The sampler has been applied to characterize PM emissions from various combustion sources in China. IMPLICATIONS Particulate matter (PM) emitted from stationary combustion sources is an important contributor to urban ambient PM, especially for PM2.5 (PM ≤2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter). Characterizing PM emissions from various combustion sources and providing reliable emission data are important for identifying their contributions to urban ambient PM and for designing corresponding control measures. This research developed a compact dilution sampler, which is a reliable tool for characterizing PM emissions from stationary combustion sources in China. The data obtained by the field measurements using the dilution sampler will be helpful for source apportionment and emission inventory development. © 2011 Air and Waste Management Association.

AB  - The high-pressure spray characteristics of biofuels, specifically, Pongamia oil and its blends with diesel are studied for various gas pressures. Two single-hole solenoid injectors with nozzle diameters of 200 and 260 μm are used along with a high-pressure common-rail direct-injection system to inject fuel into a high-pressure spray visualization chamber. The spray structure is characterized using a high-speed laser-based shadowgraphy technique. The spray structure of Pongamia oil revealed the presence of an intact liquid core at low gas pressure. At high gas pressures, the spray atom- ization of the Pongamia oil showed marked improvement. The spray tip penetration of Pongamia oil and its blends with diesel is higher compared to that of diesel for all test conditions. The spray cone angle of Pongamia oil and 50%Pongamia oil blend with diesel is lower as compared to that of diesel. Both these observations are attributed to the presence of large droplets carrying higher momentum in oil and blend. The droplet size is measured at an injection pressure of 1000 bar and gas pressure of 30 bar at 25 mm below the nozzle tip using the particle/droplet image analysis (PDIA) method. The droplet size measurements have shown that the Sauter mean diameter (SMD) in the spray core of Pongamia oil is more than twice that of diesel. The spray tip penetration of the 20% blend of Pongamia with diesel (P20) is similar to that of diesel but the SMD is 50% higher. Based on experimental data, appropriate spray tip penetration correlation is proposed for the vegetable oil fuels such as Pongamia. © 2011 by Begell House, Inc.

AB  - The increasing of energy consumption and fossil fuel emissions (especially CO2, SO2 and NOx) and the limitation of crude oil reserves, determined a growing trend toward renewable energy technologies, like solar, wind, geo-thermal energy and biomass for biofuels. From all the renewable energies sources, biomass attracts more and more interest being a renewable resource with economic potential, which can be found all over the world, with positive environmental properties due to neutral emissions of CO2 and low sulphur content. Biofuels obtained from biomass are becoming competitive with fossil fuels because of their environmental friendliness, availability, biodegradability, contribution to sustainable development and even economic benefits. One modern technology of producing biofuels, especially biodiesel, from biomass is Fischer-Tropsch process. The short or long chain hydrocarbons are obtained using syngas (H2 and CO) as feedstock. For the past five decades, the syngas was provided by coal or natural gas, being a well-establish technology. Today, because of the environmental concerns, researchers are more interested in obtaining liquid hydrocarbons also from syngas produced by biomass gasification. In this paper the Fischer-Tropsch technology that uses syngas obtained from wood chips gasification at the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant Güssing was investigated. The main objective was to establish the products distribution of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis over Co-based catalyst, under different temperatures (230 °C, 240 °C), and flow gas variation (5 Nm3/h and 4 Nm3/h). For this purpose, during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, the composition of syngas before and after the slurry-bed reactor was analysed and the degree of CO conversion was determined. The product distribution of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis was characterised by Anderson-Schulz-Flory plots. Reliable results of chain growth probability were obtained with temperature and space velocity variation. These results showed that temperature and space velocity are critical parameters for the Co-based catalyst productivity and the selectivity to C5+ hydrocarbons in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.

AB  - An experimental investigation of the combustion behavior of nano-aluminum (n-Al) and nano-aluminum oxide (nAl2O3) particles stably suspended in biofuel (ethanol) as a secondary energy carrier was conducted. The heat of combustion (HoC) was studied using a modified static bomb calorimeter system. Combustion element composition and surface morphology were evaluated using a SEM/EDS system. N-Al and n-Al2O3 particles of 50- and 36-nm diameters, respectively, were utilized in this investigation. Combustion experiments were performed with volume fractions of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10% for n-Al, and 0.5, 1, 3, and 5% for n-Al2O3. The results indicate that the amount of heat released from ethanol combustion increases almost linearly with n-Al concentration. N-Al volume fractions of 1 and 3% did not show enhancement in the average volumetric HoC, but higher volume fractions of 5, 7, and 10% increased the volumetric HoC by 5.82, 8.65, and 15.31%, respectively. N-Al2O3 and heavily passivated n- Al additives did not participate in combustion reactively, and there was no contribution from Al2O3 to the HoC in the tests. A combustion model that utilized Chemical Equilibrium with Applications was conducted as well and was shown to be in good agreement with the experimental results. © 2011 Jones et al.

AB  - This work is aimed at the evaluation of the operating parameters and emission of two tractors: Hürlimann H-488 DT and Hürlimann XB Max 100. The measurements were done on a test bench in the laboratory of the Agroscope Reck-enholz-Tänikon Research Station ART, Ettenhausen, Switzerland during February 2010. The goal of this paper was to evaluate the operating parameters of the two models of tractors by using classical diesel oil and biofuel, as well as to evaluate the emission (greenhouse gases, dangerous exhaust gases and carcinogens), to make statistical analysis of the results and the conclusion about the samples used and the impact on engine parameters, environment and human health. From the results achieved, it is possible to state the following facts. In each way, the emissions of rape seed methylester (RME) and diesel are equivalent. The values of CO and HC and also particles are lower for RME. But NOx values are lower for diesel oil. It is liquid that the newer engine of Hürlimann XB Max 100 decreases emission of CO, HC and NOx significantly.

AB  - The article deals with the evaluation of environmental benefits of E10 fuel. The fuel consists of 10 % of bioethanol and 90 % of petrol Natural 95. Adding 10 % of bioethanol into the automotive fuel is permitted by the Directive 2009/30/EC of the European Parliament and Council, which defines the environmental specifications of fuels for vehicles with petrol and diesel engines. By adding biofuels into the current motor fuel, the European Union makes effort to reduce carbon dioxide production and reduce consumption of fossil fuels. In addition to this property, bioethanol has positive impact on the production of other harmful substances. This property of bioethanol is often neglected; therefore the aim of this article is to evaluate the changes of all harmful substances. Measurement was done on the engine Skoda Felicia 1.3 MPi 50kW. In order not to affect the measurement by catalyst activities, emissions were measured in front of the converter. To assess the production of harmful emissions per one kilometer, virtual simulation of the European NEDC homologation cycle was used.

AB  - Biofuel is one candidate that can address the global warming and energy security challenges faced by the transportation sector. However, biofuel production is subject to unpredictable external disturbances caused by demand variation, regional instability and extreme weather. It is highly desired to design a biofuel plant such that it has operational flexibility to survive through these disturbances. Gasification based thermo-chemical conversion is one of the promising approaches: the plant can produce a variety of products including electricity, liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, and diesel while taking almost any kind of biomass as feedstock. In this paper, technical and economic performance of thermo-chemical biofuel plants is evaluated under external disturbances, including extreme weather, market fluctuation, and policy uncertainties. Four plant configurations with varying electricity generation capacity and different in-plant hydrogen production methods (methane autothermal reforming or water-gas shifting) are considered. It has been found that by providing additional electricity production capacity and producing hydrogen via methane reforming, the biofuel plant could have the best chance to maximize profit under external disturbances. Results from this research are expected to help relevant biofuel stakeholders, i.e. investors, plant managers, and government agencies, to make key decisions with regards to investment, plant operation, as well as policy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Currently, several renewable energy technologies have reached, or are approaching maturity and can be utilised for small- and large-scale applications. Biodiesel, a cleaner burning replacement fuel, is argued to potentially contribute to sustainable development in many countries and regions of the world. Biodiesel development, however, entails complex interactions of actors such as the technology developers, government at different levels, communities, as well as the natural environment; different actions or responses in the greater system might hinder or undermine the positive effects of such a development. Given such complexity, an integrated and holistic technology assessment approach is indispensible to determine the potential effects of biodiesel development on sustainability in general, which can then inform and enhance proper planning and management. The paper thus introduces the Bioenergy Technology Sustainability Assessment (BIOTSA) model that has been developed, based on a system dynamics approach. The model is demonstrated and evaluated with a specific case: the assessment of the effects of biodiesel development on selected sustainability indicators for the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. The strengths and limitations of the model are discussed and future perspectives are outlined. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pyrolysis of vegetative biomass into biochar and application of the more stable form of carbon to soil have been shown to be effective in reducing the emission of greenhouse gases, improving soil fertility, and sequestering soil contaminants. However, there is still lack of information about the impact of biochar amendment in agricultural soils on the sorption and environmental fate of pesticides. In this study, we investigated the sorption and dissipation of a neonicotinoid insecticide acetamiprid in three typical Chinese agricultural soils, which were amended by a red gum wood (Eucalyptus spp. .) derived biochar. Our results showed that the amendment of biochar (0.5% (w/w)) to the soils could significantly increase the sorption of acetamiprid, but the magnitudes of enhancement were varied. Contributions of 0.5% newly-added biochar to the overall sorption of acetamiprid were 52.3%, 27.4% and 11.6% for red soil, paddy soil and black soil, respectively. The dissipation of acetamiprid in soils amended with biochar was retarded compared to that in soils without biochar amendment. Similar to the sorption experiment, in soil with higher content of organic matter, the retardation of biochar on the dissipation of acetamiprid was lower than that with lower content of organic matter. The different effects of biochar in agricultural soils may attribute to the interaction of soil components with biochar, which would block the pore or compete for binding site of biochar. Aging effect of biochar application in agricultural soils and field experiments need to be further investigated. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article presents a new approach for incorporating process-integration tools into life cycle analysis (LCA) for biofuel production. Process synthesis techniques using mass- and energy-integration tools are employed to generate various scenarios for reducing mass and energy consumption in the process. The global implications of these changes and the associated trade-offs are assessed using the LCA tool: GREET. The developed approach enables the consideration of several levels of process integration while tracking the process economics and the reduction of the net greenhouse gas emissions. Several cases of biofuels with different processing technologies have been considered in this study, and the results show that when the process-integration tools are effectively utilized and combined with LCA, better insights are obtained and the net greenhouse gas emissions decrease drastically for different biofuels. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to report our results on the behavior of an Otto engine working with gasoline blended with a fraction rich in esters of carboxylic acids derived from biomass pyrolysis bio-oil, hereby called as "Bioflex". Sugarcane trash undergoes a fast pyrolysis process at the PPR-200 pilot plant to produce the bio-oil at Unicamp (Brazil). The process of separating carboxylic acids from bio-oil, the production of esters from these acids, the process of blending these esters with gasoline as well as the results of the use of this blend in an Otto engine of 4kW capacity - component of a 2 kWe generator - are described. Trial tests determined that it is possible to blend up to 14vol.% of Bioflex with gasoline type C used in Brazil. The engine performance with this blend compared to the performance of the engine working with pure gasoline resulted in identical power output and fuel consumption. The results showed that it is technically feasible to use blends of carboxylic acid esters derived from the biomass pyrolysis bio-oil with gasoline in conventional Otto engines. © 2011 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - Brazil has been a pioneer in biofuels production (1975: launch of the National Alcohol Program - Proalcool) and remains a leader in the field, helped by its huge land reserves. Ethanol, massively produced from sugarcane, has been joined by biodiesel, still less important but growing fast. Governement- sponsored R&D has reduced environmental impacts of the sector, which has attracted investment from major transnational corporations. It is mainly developed in São Paulo state, where it has has given rise to many industries, as shown by the example of Sertãozinho city.

AB  - Ground contamination by oily substances led to several environmental issues. This work focused on the isolation and characterization of micro-organisms which possess the capability of degrading Jatropha oil, a feed stock of biodiesel production, under anaerobic condition. The active isolated strains were tested for morphological, physiological and genotypic characteristics. Based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis, the Enterococcus faecalis and Burkholderia cenocepacia W-1 were selected due to their ability to produce large clear zones. Further studies were carried out for oil degradation using minimal M9 salt media supplemented with 1% Jatropha oil as the sole carbon source. Lipolytic activity assay showed that the highest activity was obtained at 532 U/L. In addition, GC/MS analysis revealed that different compounds from the head space and supernatant included several hydrocarbons. However, free fatty acids formed during hydrolytic activity resulted in the decrease of pH, and also retarded bacterial growth probably due to the toxicity of the fatty acids on the cells. The consequence of this study is the benefit of reduced environmental problems from Jatropha oil contamination as well as obtained useful gaseous biofuels. © 2011 Academic Journals.

AB  - A two-stage process consisting of two reactions steps with glycerin separation and ethanol/catalyst addition in each of them was optimized for ethyl esters production. The optimal reaction temperature was 55 °C. At an ethanol/oil molar ratio of 4.25:1 (25% v/v alcohol with respect to oil), a 99% conversion value was obtained with low ethanol consumption. In contrast to methoxide catalysts, sodium and potassium hydroxide catalysts severely complicate the purification since no phase separation took place under most conditions. With a total sodium methoxide concentration of 1.06 g catalyst/100 g oil, and adding 50% of the catalyst in each reaction step, biodiesel with a total glycerin content of 0.172% was obtained. The optimal conditions found in this study make it possible to use the same industrial facility to produce either methyl or ethyl esters. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The main challenges of setting up a 400 kt y-1 biomass fueled dimethylether plant in the city of Växjö consist not only of evaluating social and economic impact but also exploring ways to initiate and develop the market for DME. One way of initiating and developing the market for DME is by mixing DME with LPG. In the longer perspective, DME can be a substitute to diesel which, however, requires a consistent orchestrated strategy. For the raw material situation it is indicated that the main bulk of logging residues and stumps can be obtained near the city and to a lesser extent from adjacent regions supplemented with marginal imports. The employment effects are considerable; a positive net effect of 550-750 full-time jobs is expected. The geographical localization of jobs will to a large extent be in or near Växjö (for operation of the plant), and nearby regions (for collection of raw material and transports). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is a substance that preserves air quality. This type of fuel is designed to enhance the richness of a diesel automobile. Various organizations are setup to control air pollution and find new sources of fuels for vehicles. Not only does biodiesel help the environment, it also assists people is using a lower cost means of transportation. It is a more harmless method than the now used petroleum diesel. Biodiesel is created from nature oils and fats that can be gathered from anyone's gardens. This means that it is a renewable source of power. Biodiesel is the name of a clean burning alternative fuel produced from domestic, renewable resources and it can be blended at any level with petroleum diesel to create a biodiesel blend and can be used in compression ignition (diesel) engines with no major modifications. The oil obtained from the seeds of Pongamia pinnata holds promise as fuel used as alternative for diesel. These have a variety of uses, but the economic exploitation of these plants has remained neglected for long time. Survey of Pongamia pinnata plant species at the study area was conducted during January to September to know the density of the species and impact of morphological characteristics on the yield efficiency of both the species. Since, lot of wasteland (4631 ha) is found in the study area (Bhadravathi taluk), recognition of the potential use of these species as a source of biofuels and in wasteland reclamation has got numerous scopes. This paper reflects on the ecological and economical benefits from the implication of Pongamia pinnata as an energy source in the study area. © 2011 - Kalpana Corporation.

AB  - Preoccupation with global energy supplies and climate change in the global North, and a desire to improve the balance of trade and capture value in the emerging carbon market by developing countries, together place biofuels firmly on the map of global land use change. Much of this recent land use change is occurring in developing countries where large agro-ecologically suitable tracts of land may be accessed at lower economic and opportunity cost. This is leading to the gradual penetration of commercial crops that provide suitable biofuel feedstocks (e.g., sugarcane, soybean, oil palm, jatropha) into rural communities and forested landscapes throughout many areas of the global South. Expansion of biofuel feedstock cultivation in developing countries is widely embraced by producer country governments as a means to achieve energy security and stimulate rural economic development through employment and smallholder market integration. It is also expected that foreign and domestic investments in biofuel feedstock cultivation will lead to positive economic spillovers from knowledge transfer and investor contributions to social and physical infrastructure. While biofuel feedstocks are expanding through large industrial-scale plantations and smallholder production alike, the expansion of industrial-scale production systems has been countered by a critical response by civil society actors concerned about the implications for rural livelihoods, customary land rights, and the environmental effects of biofuel feedstock cultivation. To date, however, limited data exist to demonstrate the conditions under which widely anticipated economic and climate change mitigation benefits accrue in practice, and the implications of these developments for forests, local livelihoods, and the climate change mitigation potential of biofuels. In such a situation, debates are easily polarized into those for and against biofuels. This special issue seeks to nuance this debate by shedding light on the local social and environmental impacts accruing to date from the expansion of biofuel feedstock cultivation through in-depth case studies in 6 countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Findings provide a more nuanced picture of costs and benefits, and point to a host of risks that need to be proactively managed to leverage the potential of the industry as an engine of national social and economic development. © 2011 by the author(s).

AB  - The rapid growth in urban population, the increasing industrialization and rising demands for energy and motor vehicles has as a result the production of air pollution and the need of imported oil as well. The imported oil has had an enormous impact on so many people, so rapidly in so many ways and in so many places around the world. There are facts that fossil fuels are damaging the environment and peoples' health too. An example of the harmful effects of fossil fuel in the environment would be global warming, which is the rise in the earth's temperature. Due to rising oil prices, the lack of petroleum, and global warming, it needs to be taken into consideration seriously the replacement of fossil fuels from renewable fuels. More affordable and longer lasting, renewable fuels do not only resurrect the economy but do also save the environment before it's too late. At the present paper will be examined the use of diesel-soy oil mixtures in diesel four-stroke engine. The mixtures that have been used are the following: diesel-5% soy oil, diesel-10% soy oil, diesel-20% soy oil, diesel-30% soy oil, diesel-40% soy oil, diesel-50% soy oil. The fuels were submitted in different temperatures 10°C, 20°C, 30°C. For those mixtures and for every fuel temperature the gas emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen monoxide (NO) are being measured and the fuel consumption is also examined.

AB  - Energy and exergy utilization and carbon dioxide emission during production of soybean, sunflower, and olive oils are assessed. In all cases, agriculture is the most energy and exergy intensive process and emits most of the carbon dioxide, and diesel is the dominant energy and exergy source. The cumulative degree of perfection (CDP) for soybean and olive oil is 0.92 and 0.98, respectively, whereas the CDP for the sunflower oil is 2.36. Decreasing diesel consumption with good agricultural practices and substituting with biodiesel from renewable resources would decrease the cumulative exergy consumption, as a result, CDP of olive and soybean oil rises to 1.6 and sunflower oil to 2.9. Major contribution to the carbon dioxide emission is due to the excessive use of fertilizers. The most energy intensive process is olive oil production. However, since the fertilizer consumption here is limited, total carbon dioxide emission is less than those of the other two processes are. On the other hand, excessive fertilizer consumption during the soybean agriculture results in a rather large CO2 emission. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The operation of a district heating system depends on the heat load demand, which varies throughout the year. In this paper, we analyze the coproduction of district heat and electricity or biomotor fuels. We demonstrate how three different taxation scenarios and two crude oil price levels influence the selection of production units to minimize the district heat production cost and calculate the resulting primary energy use. Our analysis is based on the annual measured heat load of a district heating system. The minimum-cost district heat production system comprises different production units that meet the district heat demand and simultaneously minimize the district heat production cost. First, we optimize the cost of a district heat production system based on the cogeneration of electricity and heat with and without biomass integrated gasification combined-cycle technology. We considered cogenerated electricity as a byproduct with the value of that produced by a condensing power plant. Next, we integrate and optimize different biomotor fuel production units into the district heat production system by considering biomotor fuels as byproducts that can substitute for fossil motor fuels. We demonstrate that in district heating systems, the strengthening of environmental taxation reduces the dependence on fossil fuels. However, increases in environmental taxation and the crude oil price do not necessarily influence the production cost of district heat as long as biomass price is not driven by policy measures. Biomotor fuel production in a district heating system is typically not cost-efficient. The biomotor fuels produced from the district heating system have to compete with those from standalone biomotor fuel plants and also with its fossil-based counterparts. This is also true for high oil prices. A carbon tax on fossil CO2 emissions based on social cost damage will increase the competitiveness of biomass-based combined heat and power plants, especially for BIGCC technology with its high electricity-to-heat ratio. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass can be used for the production of fuels, and chemicals with reduced life cycle (greenhouse gas) emissions. Currently, these fuels and chemicals are produced mainly from natural gas and other fossil fuels. In Western Canada, forest residue biomass is gasified for the production of syngas which is further synthesized to produce different fuels and chemicals. Two types of gasifiers: the atmospheric pressure gasifier (commercially known as SilvaGas) and the pressurized gasifier (commercially known as RENUGAS) are considered for syngas production. The production costs of methanol, (dimethyl ether), (Fischer-Tropsch) fuels, and ammonia are $0.29/kg, $0.47/kg, $0.97/kg, and $2.09/kg, respectively, for a SilvaGas-based gasification plant with a capacity of 2000 dry tonnes/day. The cost of producing methanol, DME, F-T fuels, and ammonia in a RENUGAS-based plant are $0.45/kg, $0.69/kg, $1.53/kg, and $2.72/kg, respectively, for a plant capacity of 2000 dry tonnes/day. The minimum cost of producing methanol, DME, F-T fuels, and ammonia are $0.28/kg, $0.44/kg, $0.94/kg, and $2.06/kg at plant capacities of 3000, 3500, 4000, and 3000 dry tonnes/day, respectively, using the SilvaGas-based gasification process. Biomass-based fuels and chemicals are expensive compared to fuels and chemicals derived from fossil fuels, and carbon credits can help them become competitive. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the role of uncertain crude oil prices, uncertain crop yields, and competition for acreage on corn, soybean, and switchgrass prices under biofuel production mandates. We find enforcement of the cellulosic mandate is costly in that it raises equilibrium prices of all three crops through competition for acreage. However, crude oil prices largely determine industry profitability even in the face of high crop prices. Further we find that uncertainty in crude oil prices and crop yields causes higher corn, soybean, and switchgrass prices compared to a baseline with no uncertainty. © 2011 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate crambe seeds germination and vigor under water stress conditions induced by polyethylene glycol solutions. The seeds were germinated on substrate moistened with polyethylene glycol solutions, using the osmotic potentials of 0 (control), -0.2, -0.4, -0.6, -0.8, -1.0, -1.2 and -1.4 MPa. The seeds germination was evaluated by normal seedlings and root emission percentages. Vigor was evaluated by germination average time, relative frequency, velocity and synchronization index. It was observed that more negative osmotic potential caused significant reduction in crambe seed germination and vigor, and no normal seedlings was observed at potentials below -0.6 MPa.

AB  - Among the biofuels produced nowadays in the world, biodiesel became more and more attractive thanks to its advantages compared with petroleum-based diesel: (a) reducing the dependence on petroleum; (b) reduction of most exhaust emissions; (c) biodegradability; (d) higher flash point, leading to safer handling and storage; (e) excellent lubricity. However, the neat vegetable oils used in biodiesel production determine a higher price of biodiesel compared with petroleum diesel price. Waste cooking oils can be alternative raw material for biodiesel production especially because of its low cost, high availability and benefits of environmental protection. The research presented in this paper aimed to establish: (a) simple methods for monitoring the synthesis of biodiesel by transesterification of two different waste cooking sunflower oils with methanol using NaOH as catalyst, in comparison with neat sunflower oil and (b) the characteristics of oils and biodiesel obtained, comparative with characteristics described for biodiesel by the standards ASTM D6751 and EN 14214. The results obtained showed that during biodiesel synthesis, the saponification value decreased both for sunflower oil and waste cooking oils due to transesterification reaction of lipids from oils and formation of methyl esters. The values of physical and chemical characteristics of biodiesel were much smaller than those for neat and waste sunflower oils, especially viscosity, saponification value and acid value. The characteristics values of biodiesel obtained from waste cooking oils were better than characteristics of the petroleum diesel (standard EN 590), and they fit within ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards, which indicate that the obtained biodiesel samples could be used in engines without other modifications.

AB  - The study of effect of injection timing along with engine operating parameters in Jatropha biodiesel engine is important as they significantly affect its performance and emissions. The present paper focuses on the experimental investigation of the influence of injection timing, load torque and engine speed on the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of Jatropha biodiesel engine. For this purpose, the experiments were conducted using full factorial design consisting of (33) with 27 runs for each fuel, diesel and Jatropha biodiesel. The effect of variation of above three parameters on brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake thermal efficiency (BTE), peak cylinder pressure (Pmax), maximum heat release rate (HRRmax), CO, HC, NO emissions and smoke density were investigated. It has been observed that advance in injection timing from factory settings caused reduction in BSFC, CO, HC and smoke levels and increase in BTE, Pmax, HRRmax and NO emission with Jatropha biodiesel operation. However, retarded injection timing caused effects in the other way. At 15Nm load torque, 1800rpm engine speed and 340 crank angle degree (CAD) injection timing, the percentage reduction in BSFC, CO, HC and smoke levels were 5.1%, 2.5%, 1.2% and 1.5% respectively. Similarly the percentage increase in BTE, Pmax, HRRmax and NO emission at this injection timing, load and speed were 5.3%, 1.8%, 26% and 20% respectively. The best injection timing for Jatropha biodiesel operation with minimum BSFC, CO, HC and smoke and with maximum BTE, Pmax, HRRmax is found to be 340 CAD. Nevertheless, minimum NO emission yielded an optimum injection timing of 350 CAD. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recently, biodiesel has become more attractive since it is made from renewable resources and also for the fact that the resources of fossil fuels are diminishing day by day. This study compares combustion of B5, B10, B20, B50, B80 and B100 with petroleum diesel over wide input air flows at two energy levels in an experimental boiler. The comparison is made in terms of combustion efficiency and flue gas emissions (CO, CO2, NOX, and SO2) and influence of air flow at two energy levels 219kJ/h and 249kJ/h is studied. The findings show that at higher level energy diesel efficiency was a little higher than that of biodiesel, but at lower level biodiesels are efficient than diesel. Except B10, Biodiesel and other blends emitted less pollutant CO, SO2 and CO2 than diesel. B10 emitted lower CO2 and NOX, but emitted higher SO2 than diesel. Despite studies reporting an increase in the NOX level resulting from burning of biodiesel over conventional petroleum diesel fuels in engines, our findings indicated at the second energy level a reduction in the NOX level in the flue gases resulting from burning of biodiesel. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Opium poppy, Papaver somniferum L., is one of the ancient herbal medicines. In addition to this medical use of latex, opium that is extracted from the immature seed capsule, it is also used illegally for pleasure. It is being produced in great quantities in Turkey especially in Afyonkarahisar city. The seeds of opium poppy plant have high ratio oil content. The opium poppy seeds and oil of these seeds are purely used as an ingredient in production of bakery products. In this study, biodiesel evaluation of the opium poppy seeds that have a high oil ratio is aimed. Alkali catalyzed (NaOH) single-phase reaction was preferred to produce biodiesel from opium poppy oil. The parameters like catalyst concentration, methanol ratio, reaction temperature were optimized and biodiesel production was obtained with high yield in reaction time of 75. min. The methyl ester content in the opium poppy oil biodiesel was determined with Gas Chromatography-Frame Ionized Detector (GC-FID). In optimum conditions, methanol ratio and catalyst concentration was determined as 20. wt% and 0.5. wt%, respectively. The reaction temperature was optimized as 60 °C. Biodiesel was obtained from the opium poppy oil under optimum conditions. Some basic features of the produced methyl esters were determined. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Soil salinity is one of the major abiotic stresses with adverse effects on plant productivity and quality. As salt constantly accumulates in soil with irrigation, soil salinity becomes one of the greatest problems in agricultural production through out the world. Jatropha curcas, as the first referent tree in development of China biological diesel oil and a hotspot of the research in the world facing global energy crisis recently, has a very high environmental adaptation. However, few studies have been reported on the mechanism of salt adaptation and chemical regulation of the tree. Improvement of salt tolerance to utilize extensive salt soil is an important issue in both agricultural and biological sciences. Moreover, salt tolerance improved by chemical regulation used to be considered as an economic and effective method. Paclobutrazol (PP333) causes metabolic and structural changes in plant, and improves plant stress tolerance. Therefore, In order to evaluate the effects of foliage spraying PP333 on salt tolerance of J. curcas seedlings, the plant dry weight, root/shoot ratio, water content, the leaf cell ultrastructure, chlorophyll content, the photosynthesis, the osmotic adjustment ability and the antioxidation ability of J. curcas seedlings treated with 200 mmol/L NaCl for 10 d with foliage spraying in 600 mg/L of PP333 in greenhouse were investigated. The results obtained were as follows: (1) 200 mmol/L NaCl stress significantly decreased the seedling dry weight, water content and root/shoot ratio, and drastically increased the leaf electrolyte leakage. However, compared with the plant treated only with NaCl, the plant dry weight, root/shoot ratio and water contents of the seedlings treated with foliage spraying in 600 mg/L of PP333 under NaCl stress were all increased significantly, and their leaf electrolyte leakage percentage was decreased significantly. (2) The photos of transmission electron microscope indicated that the leaf cells of J. curcas contained distinct starch grains, that elliptic chloroplasts clung closely to cell wall under control and that plasmolysis phenomenon and cell membrane damage of leaf cells under 200 mmol/L NaCl were obviously visible. Moreover, NaCl-treated chloroplasts did not contain starch grains but formed osmiophilic globules. However, in J. curcas seedlings treated with salt and with foliage spraying in 600 mg/L of PP333, plasmolysis phenomenon did not occur, osmiophilic globule numbers decreased and osmiophilic globule volume diminished evidently. (3) J. curcas seedlings treated with 200 mmol/L NaCl showed weak osmotic adjustment ability (0.06 MPa) in leaves. However, the seedlings treated with foliage spraying in 600 mg/L of PP333 significantly displayed evident promotion in osmotic adjustment ability (0.49 MPa in leaves of non-NaCl treatment and 0.30 MPa in leaves of NaCl treatment). (4) Compared with control, in salt-treated J. curcas seedlings, chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) were both decreased evidently. Compared with salt treatment, in the seedlings treated with salt and spraying in 600 mg/L of PP333, the chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) were both increased significantly. (5) Compared with control, in salt-treated J. curcas seedlings, MDA content and POD activity were greatly enhanced, and SOD and CAT activities were decreased significantly. However, compared with salt treatment, in seedlings treated with salt and foliage spraying in 600 mg/L of PP333 MDA content and POD activity were significantly decreased, but SOD and CAT activities increased. To sum up, promotion of salt adaptation of J. curcas with foliage spraying in PP333 was mainly attributed to enhancement of the photosynthesis, the osmotic adjustment ability and the antioxidation ability.

AB  - Biomass based oxygenated fuels have been identified as possible replacement of fossil fuel due to pollutant emission reduction and decrease in over-reliance on fossil fuel energy. In this study, 4v% water-containing ethanol was mixed with (65-90%) diesel using (5-30%) biodiesel (BD) and 1v% butanol as stabilizer and co-solvent respectively. The fuels were tested against those of biodiesel-diesel fuel blends to investigate the effect of addition of water-containing ethanol for their energy efficiencies and pollutant emissions in a diesel-fueled engine generator. Experimental results indicated that the fuel blend mix containing 4v% of water-containing ethanol, 1v% butanol and 5-30v% of biodiesel yielded stable blends after 30 days standing. BD1041 blend of fuel, which composed of 10v% biodiesel, 4v% of water-containing ethanol and 1v% butanol demonstrated -0.45 to 1.6% increase in brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC, mLkW-1h-1) as compared to conventional diesel. The better engine performance of BD1041 was as a result of complete combustion, and lower reaction temperature based on the water cooling effect, which reduced emissions to 2.8-6.0% for NOx, 12.6-23.7% particulate matter (PM), 20.4-23.8% total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and 30.8-42.9% total BaPeq between idle mode and 3.2kW power output of the diesel engine generator. The study indicated that blending diesel with water-containing ethanol could achieve the goal of more green sustainability. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Methanolysis of muskmelon seed oil was optimized employing RSM (response surface methodology). Four process variables were evaluated at two levels: methanol/oil molar ratio (3:1-12:1), catalyst concentration in relation to oil mass (0.25-1.25. wt % KOH), reaction temperature (25-65 °C) and methanolysis reaction time (20-90. min). Multiple regression analysis was employed to get the quadratic polynomial equation for predicting transesterification using RSM. The result indicated that catalyst concentration and reaction temperature were the important factors that significantly affect the yield of MMOMEs (muskmelon oil methyl esters)/biodiesel. The RSM methodology was used to obtain methyl esters yield (89.5%) were found at following reaction conditions; 5.8:1 methanol-to-oil ratio, 0.79% catalyst concentration, 55 °C reaction temperature and 72.5-min reaction time. There was a linear correlation between observed and predicted values. The biodiesel was analyzed using GC/MS (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry) which indicated four FAMEs (fatty acid methyl esters) (linoleic-, oleic-, palmitic- and stearic acids) as its major components. The FT-IR (fourier transform infraRed) spectrum of MMOMEs was also acquired to ensure the confirmation of methyl esters formation. Fuel properties of MMOMEs were determined and found to satisfy the ASTM D 6751 and EU 14214 specifications. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Increased demand for biodiesel feedstock has encouraged greater napus canola (Brassica napus L.) production, but there may be a need for greater production of other oilseed crops for this purpose. A multi-site field study was conducted to determine the oil yield potential of various crops relative to that of napus canola in the semi-arid, short-season environment of the Canadian prairies. Oilseed crops evaluated included rapa canola (Brassica rapa L.), juncea canola (Brassica juncea L.), Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata L.), oriental mustard (Brassica juncea L.), yellow mustard (Sinapis alba L.), camelina (Camelina sativa L.), flax (Linum usitatissimum L.), and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Max.]. Crop emergence and growth were generally good for all crops, but soybean did not fully mature at some locations. The number of site-years (out of a total of 9) that crops attained similar or greater yields compared to napus canola were camelina (6), oriental mustard (5), juncea canola (3), flax (3), soybean (3), rapa canola (2), yellow mustard (2), and Ethiopian mustard (1). The ranking of seed oil concentration was napus canola=rapa canola=juncea canola-flax=camelina=oriental mustard>Ethiopian mustard>yellow mustard>soybean. Considering yield and oil concentration, the alternative oilseed crops exhibiting the most potential for biodiesel feedstock were camelina, flax, rapa canola and oriental mustard. Oils of all crops were easily converted to biodiesel and quality analyses indicated that all crops would be suitable for biodiesel feedstock with the addition of antioxidants that are routinely utilized in biodiesel fuels.

AB  - Butyl-levulinate has been identified as a promising fuel candidate with high oxygen content. Its combustion in diesel engines yields very low soot and NOx emissions. It can be produced by the esterification of butanol and levulinic acid, which themselves are platform chemicals in a biorenewables-based chemical supply chain. Since the equilibrium of esterification limits the conversion in a conventional reactor, reactive distillation can be applied to overcome this limitation. The presence of the high-boiling catalyst sulfuric acid requires a further separation step downstream of the reactive distillation column to recover the catalyst for recycle. Optimal design specifications and an optimal operating point are determined using rigorous flowsheet optimization. The challenging optimization problem is solved by a favorable initialization strategy and continuous reformulation. The design identified has the potential to produce a renewable transportation fuel at reasonable cost.

AB  - In 2009 approx. 40 Mt of palm oil were produced globally. Growing demand for palm oil is driven by an increasing human population as well as subsidies for biodiesel and is likely to increase further in coming years. The production of 1 t crude palm oil requires 5 t of fresh fruit bunches (FFB). On average processing of 1 t FFB in palm oil mills generates 0.23 t empty fruit bunches (EFB) and 0.65 t palm oil mill effluents (POME) as residues. In this study it is assumed that land use change does not occur. In order to estimate the environmental impacts of palm oil production a worst and a best case scenario are assessed and compared in the present study using 1000 kg of FFB as functional unit.The production and treatment of one t FFB causes more than 460 kg CO2eq in the worst case scenario and 110 kg CO2eq in the best case scenario. The significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction is achieved by co-composting residues of the palm oil mill. Thus treating those residues appropriately is paramount for reducing environmental impacts particularly global warming potential (GWP) and eutrophication potential (EP).Another important contributor to the EP but also to the human toxicity potential (HTP) is the biomass powered combined heat and power (CHP) plant of palm oil mills. Frequently CHP plants of palm oil mills operate without flue gas cleaning. The CHP plant emits heavy metals and nitrogen oxides and these account for 93% of the HTP of the advanced palm oil production system, of which heavy metal emissions to air are responsible for 79%. The exact emission reduction potential from CHP plants could not be quantified due to existing data gaps, but it is apparent that cleaning the exhaust gas would reduce eutrophication, acidification and toxicity considerably. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Economic analysis is an essential evaluation for considering feasibility and viability of large-scale, photoautotrophic algae-based, biofuel production. Thus far, economic analysis has been conducted on a scenario-by-scenario basis which does not allow for cross-comparisons. In 2008, a comparative study was carried out using a cross-section of cost analyses consisting of 12 public studies. The resulting triacylglyceride cost had a spread of two orders of magnitude excluding two studies which were intended for specialty chemicals. The cost spread can be largely attributed to disparate assumptions and uncertainties in economic and process inputs. To address this disparity, four partners from research, academia, and industry collaborated on a harmonization study to estimate algal oil production costs based on a common framework. The updated cost comparison based on a normalized set of input assumptions was found to greatly reduce economic variability, resulting in algal oil production costs ranging from $10.87 gallon-1 to $13.32 gallon-1. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the current work, the effect of using CPO (crude palm oil)-OD (ordinary diesel) blends as fuel on the performance of CI (compression ignition) engine is studied. Three different blends of CPO-OD (25%, 50% and 75%) were investigated using direct-injection, stationary diesel engine. The CPO-OD blends were preheated to about 60 °C before the injection to reduce the viscosity of the blends. The experiments were conducted at variable engine speeds (1000 rpm through 3000 rpm) under fixed throttle opening. The results revealed that the CPO-OD exhibited higher torque and power output at engine speeds lower than 2000 rpm, while the BSFC (brake specific fuel consumption) was found to be higher than the OD at the same engine speeds. CPO enhanced the BSFC at higher engine speeds (above 2000 rpm). The CPO-OD blends exhibited lower emissions of NOx and higher emission of CO compared to the OD. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this work was to study the long term storage stability of JCB (Jatropha curcas biodiesel). For the objective JCB was mixed with PY (Pyrogallol) and different metal contaminants. JCB samples were stored for 6 months in open air exposed to sunlight. Different properties were checked with respect to time. It was found that stability of fresh JCB was not acceptable as per EN 14214. When PY was mixed with JCB, it stability increased and 200 ppm of PY was sufficient to make fresh and pure JCB stable for almost 6 months. Viscosity (n), PV (peroxide value) and AV (acid value) increased with respect to time. Unsaturated fatty acid composition was also checked with respect to time. From the experiment it was clear that as oxidation deterioration advanced, linoleic and linolenic acid methyl esters decreased and the fraction of oleic acid methyl became relatively high with respect to storage time. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - High acid levels, characteristic of rubber seed oil (RSO), limit RSO use in biodiesel production. The aims of this study were to determine the causes of these high acid levels by investigating what affects the storage of rubber seeds and RSO had on the acid levels. Two storage conditions/methods were evaluated, one representing a proposed storage method (SM 1), the other mimicking storage conditions characteristic to the Xishuangbanna region (SM 2). Furthermore, RSO storage was evaluated by testing RSO acid levels over a 2-month period, under standard storage conditions. Seeds from SM 2 displayed increased seed pile temperatures, higher levels of Mildew infection, lower seed oil content and higher acid levels. Low seed oil content and high acid values of SM 2 were resultant of the high Mildew infection and increased seed pile temperatures. In addition, a critical value of 90% relative humidity of seed piles was identified, above which Mildew infection increased sharply. Storage of crude RSO resulted in increased acid values. This data shows that in order to reduce high acid values, seed pile temperature, humidity and Mildew infections need to be kept to a minimum, as well as the storage time of the seeds and the RSO. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Experiments has been carried out to estimate the performance, emission and combustion characteristics of a single cylinder; four stroke variable compression ratio multi fuel engine fuelled with waste cooking oil methyl ester and its blends with standard diesel. Tests has been conducted using the fuel blends of 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% biodiesel with standard diesel, with an engine speed of 1500 rpm, fixed compression ratio 21 and at different loading conditions. The performance parameters elucidated includes brake thermal efficiency, specific fuel consumption, brake power, indicated mean effective pressure, mechanical efficiency and exhaust gas temperature. The exhaust gas emission is found to contain carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide. The results of the experiment has been compared and analyzed with standard diesel and it confirms considerable improvement in the performance parameters as well as exhaust emissions. The blends when used as fuel results in the reduction of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, carbon dioxide at the expense of nitrogen oxides emissions. It has found that the combustion characteristics of waste cooking oil methyl ester and its diesel blends closely followed those of standard diesel. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of low concentration biodiesel blends on the regulated and particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emissions from a modern passenger car. Emissions measurements were performed on a chassis dynamometer using constant volume sampling technique, following the European regulations. All measurements were conducted over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the Artemis driving cycles. Aiming to evaluate the fuel impact on emissions, a soy-based, a palm-based, and a rapeseed oil based biodiesel were blended with diesel fuel at proportions of 10, 20, and 30% by volume. The emissions of PM, HC, and CO decreased with biodiesel over most driving conditions. Some increases were observed over the NEDC, which may be attributed to the cold-start effect and to certain fuel characteristics. NOx emissions increased with biodiesel and strongly were dependent to the degree of unsaturation of the fuel. CO2 emissions and fuel consumption followed similar patterns and increased with biodiesel. PAH emissions presented discordant results, leading to the hypothesis that the influence of biodiesel source material was particularly strong on the formation of these pollutants. Both increases and decreases were observed in PAH, nitrated PAH and oxygenated PAH compounds with the use of biodiesel blends. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Production of methyl dodecanoate (biodiesel) using lauric acid and methanol with a solid acid catalyst of sulfated zirconia is studied by using two distillation sequences. In the first sequence, the methanol recovery column follows the reactive distillation column. In the second sequence, the reactive distillation and methanol recovery columns are thermally coupled. Thermally coupled distillation sequences may consume less energy by allowing interconnecting vapor and liquid streams between the two columns to eliminate reboiler or condenser or both. Here we study the thermally coupled side-stripper reactive distillation and eliminate the condenser of the reactive distillation column. Both the sequences are optimized by using the thermal and hydraulic analyses of the Column Targeting Tools of Aspen Plus simulator. Comparisons of the optimized sequences show that in the thermally coupled sequence, the energy consumption is reduced by 13.1% in the reactive distillation column and 50.0% in the methanol recovery column. The total exergy losses for the columns are reduced by 281.35 kW corresponding to 21.7% available energy saving in the thermally coupled sequence. In addition, the composition profiles indicate that the thermally coupled reactive distillation column operates with the lower concentration of water in the reaction zone which reduces catalytic deactivation. © 2011.

AB  - In this work we explore the concept of integrated biorefineries, and we examine alternative schemes for the co-production of biofuels (biodiesel) and chemicals (succinic acid). Four different biorefinery schemes considering the different uses of crude glycerine from the biodiesel process are simulated and compared: (i) the disposal of crude glycerine as a waste, (ii) the purification (through distillation) of crude glycerine to 80%, (iii) the purification of glycerine to 95%. and (iv) the production of succinic acid from glycerine through fermentation. For the latter, we consider the bioprocess that converts the glycerol to succinate, and a downstream separation process that purifies and crystallises our product to the final succinic acid crystals. To apply complex kinetics for the fermentation we have linked Aspen Plus (2006.5) with Matlab (R2007b), where we have used the experimentally-based unstructured model from Vlysidis et al., 2009 and 2010. We first determine the operating parameters of the fermentor that have a significant effect on the economics of this scenario, i.e. the cycle time of the batch fermentation and the water flowrate entering the bioreactor. Subsequently, we perform single- and multi-objective optimisation to maximise the profit and/or to minimise the environmental impact of the overall process. We then analyse and compare the economics of the four different biorefinery schemes by using well-known profitability and/or emission criteria. Furthermore, we carry out sensitivity analysis that takes into consideration price variations for the most important materials and we extract firm conclusions about the profitability of each scenario. It is found that succinic acid co-production can enhance the profit of the overall biorefinery by 60% for a 20 years plant lifetime. These results indicate the importance of glycerol when it is utilised as a key renewable building block for the production of commodity chemicals. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There has been an increasing concern about the emissions of airborne particulate matter (PM) from diesel engines because of their close association with adverse health and environmental impacts. Among the alternative fuels being considered, biodiesel made by the transesterification of waste cooking oil has received wide attention in recent years because of its low cost and the added advantage of reducing waste oil disposal. This study was conducted to make a comparative evaluation of the particulate-bound elements emitted from ultra low sulphur diesel (ULSD) and waste cooking oil-derived biodiesel (B100) and a blend of both the fuels (B50). It was observed that the PM mass concentrations were reduced by about 36% when B100 was used. Crustal elements such as Mg, K and Al were found to be in higher concentrations compared to other elements emitted from both B100 and ULSD. Zn, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Mg, Ba, K were found to be higher in the biodiesel exhaust while Co, Pb, Mn, Cd, Sr, and As were found to be higher in the ULSD exhaust. To evaluate the potential health risk due to inhalation of PM emitted from diesel engines running on ULSD and B100, health risk estimates based on exposure and dose-response assessments of particulate-bound elements were calculated assuming exposure for 24 h. The findings indicate that the exposure to PM of the B100 exhaust is relatively more hazardous and may pose adverse health effects compared to ULSD. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents global scenarios of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) emissions from road transport through to 2050, taking into account the potential impacts of: (1) the timing of air pollutant emission regulation implementation in developing countries; (2) global CO2 mitigation policy implementation; and (3) vehicle cost assumptions, on study results. This is done by using a global energy system model treating the transport sector in detail. The major conclusions are the following. First, as long as non-developed countries adopt the same vehicle emission standards as in developed countries within a 30-year lag, global emissions of SO2, NOx, and PM from road vehicles decrease substantially over time. Second, light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty trucks make a large and increasing contribution to future global emissions of SO2, NOx, and PM from road vehicles. Third, the timing of air pollutant emission regulation implementation in developing countries has a large impact on future global emissions of SO2, NOx, and PM from road vehicles, whereas there is a possibility that global CO2 mitigation policy implementation has a comparatively small impact on them. © 2011 by the authors.

AB  - Density measurements have long been used to monitor petrochemical distillation. The density of the petrochemicals decreases as one moves up the distillation column. Measuring the density or specific gravity of biodiesel has been reported to be the preferred method of blending biodiesel fuel for both accuracy and ease of use. To see widespread use, a measurement technology must not only be capable of accurately monitoring a parameter, but it must do so in an economical way. This paper explores the application of microelectromechanical systems technology to fuel monitoring, quality control, and blending. This microfluidic sensor has on-chip density/ specific gravity, temperature, and viscosity measurement capabilities, as will be demonstrated in the experimental results. The ability to differentiate between gasoline, ethanol, diesel, biodiesel, butanol, Fischer-Tropsch fuel, water, and air contamination with a density measurement and in some cases a viscosity measurement will be demonstrated. Using gravimetric measurements, based on fluid density, concentrations of fuel blends like ethanolgasoline can be measured. Contamination levels of water in ethanol can also be measured in this manner. The density of fuel over temperature can be made with this sensing technology and applied to custody transfer. Potential microfluidic clogging issues are addressed by filtration and by adding the capability of sensing flow through the sensor. Measuring fluids under high flow rates is accommodated with a bypass design. An intrinsically safe circuit has been developed to enable use of this technology with flammable liquids. Vibration testing has been undertaken to show that these micromachined devices, with their high resonant frequencies, are immune to vehicular and aviation vibration, unlike conventional density metres made using larger resonating steel tubing.

AB  - For a number of analytical tests required in the biodiesels or ethanol-fuel product specifications, the scope of these test methods does not include such alternative energy sources. Thus, it is not clear that these methods are applicable to biofuels without any modifications to take care of the different matrices. Examples are given where the modifications have been implemented in the test methods and other cases where such research and development work is still required before using the methods for biofuels.

AB  - Oxidation stability is a physical property of liquid fuels used to describe the ageing behavior of fuels during transport and storage. In biodiesel and its blends with diesel, oxidation of fuel can result in acid formation and polymer solids which plug filters and leave problematic deposits throughout the fuel supply system. ASTM Fuel Specification Standards include both 100 % biodiesel and biofuel-blends. Of all these fuel standards only ASTM D6751, which is for 100 % biodiesel "as a blendstock," mentions the test method EN 14112. Although the following fuel specification standards permit the blending of biodiesel into the fuel, to date these standards have not yet identified a suitable oxidation stability test method for blended fuels: ASTM D975 for diesel fuel oils (<5 % biodiesel); ASTM D396 for burner fuel oils (<5 % biodiesel); and ASTM D7467 for diesel fuel oil (6-20 % biodiesel). ASTM D2274 is the most frequently used method to characterize ageing behavior of diesel by determining the polymer (sludge) content of artificially aged fuel. ASTM D02.14 approved two new test methods for evaluation of oxidation stability. ASTM D7545 is a new method for testing oxidation stability of middle-distillates. ASTM D7525 is the sister method for gasoline. These methods utilize a new rapid small scale oxidation tester (RSSOT) named PetroOXY. Within the RSSOT's test chamber, a 5 mL sample of fuel is combined with oxygen, at 700 kPa, and heated to 140°C. This initiates a fast oxidation whose results are determined by the time needed to achieve a pressure drop of 10 % in the system. Testing confirmed that the time needed to achieve the 10 % drop in pressure is directly related to the sample's oxidation stability. The RSSOT-method is quicker than other actual methods evaluating the oxidation stability biodiesel, petroleum middle-distillates, and blends. Round-robins based upon this have been conducted in Europe and Japan. Copyright © 2010 by ASTM International.

AB  - Proficiency testing programs (PTPs) play an important role in maintaining the quality of data produced in a laboratory. PTPs are a useful statistical quality assurance (SQA) tools to monitor the strengths and weaknesses of a laboratory's performance. Many laboratory accreditation agencies require laboratory participation in such programs. Two significant PTPs sponsored by American Society for Testing and Materials Committee D02 on Petroleum Products and Lubricants have been the programs on biodiesel and fuel-ethanol that were launched in the past few years. The data obtained from these SQA programs will be presented and analyzed for the lessons learned and the changes that are necessary in these PTP programs and biofuels specifications.

AB  - The thermophysical properties of biofuels are required for the efficient design of their chemical processing, distribution, and utilization. We provide a review of biofuel properties research at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). We are expanding two Standard Reference Databases to include biofuels. The ThermoData Engine will collect and evaluate all published property data on biofuel components. The NIST Reference Fluid Thermodynamic and Transport Properties database is a calculational database providing properties of biofuel components and blends based on thermodynamic and transport models. The property models in the databases implement an equation of state approach based on well defined reference fluids. Complex mixtures, including blends of biofuels with conventional fuels, are modeled as "surrogate blends," i.e., a blend of perhaps a dozen components that captures the essential characteristics of a complex fuel. Surrogate blends are formulated from a "suite" of well-characterized pure compounds. Property measurements for the pure compounds in the surrogate suite include but are not limited to density, speed of sound, and viscosity. We have also carried out measurements on actual biofuel samples. A recent extension of the distillation curve that we have developed at NIST is proving very valuable in characterizing fuels. This "advanced distillation curve method" provides much more quantitative information than the traditional method, including chemical characterization of the different "cuts" as the distillation proceeds. We present examples of our measurements and models completed to date and outline future plans. Copyright © 2010 by ASTM International.

AB  - The recent introduction of biodiesel blends to the U.S. market has coincided with an increase in the reported problems of fouling of fuel filters and fuel injection equipment, manifested in power loss, noise, vibration, and increased filter changes. However, the introduction of biodiesel has to a large extent coincided with the introduction of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel and changes in engine technology, leading to higher fuel injection pressures. It is thus proposed that current incidences of fouling are not a problem brought about solely as a result of the introduction of biodiesel. A review of known fuel degradation mechanisms suggests that the effects of increased fuel pressure and also high shear environments should be examined as a probable cause of increasing deposit formation. Deposit formation on both fuel filters and injectors has previously been attributed to a variety of sources including: Biological contamination, both aerobic and non-aerobic, water contamination, adulteration with lubricating oil, fuel additive interactions, and biodiesel degradation. The deposits currently being encountered appear to be more akin to the high carbon content particles found in diesel exhaust than those previously described and are frequently found in the presence of deposit precursor molecules. This paper concentrates on the issue of fuel filter fouling, presents the analysis of currently encountered deposits, relates these results to some of the degradation mechanisms alluded to above, and suggests possible precursor molecules in fuels both pre and post stressing to support the proposed mechanisms. It is also shown that existing fuel quality tests do not correlate well with reported fouling propensity, suggesting that new test methods are required to ensure future fuels are fit for purpose.

AB  - Copyright © 2010 by ASTM International, 100 Barr Harbor Drive, PO Box C700, West Conshohocken, PA 19428-2959. The world is looking for changes in its energetic matrix through the use of biofuels to reduce the dependence on oil derivatives. Currently, the number of studies concerning mixtures of triglycerides from animals or plants with diesel fuel has risen due to efforts to reduce the consumption of diesel oil. This paper studies the behavior of the density of plant oils mixed with diesel fuel in relation to temperature, which is essential to guarantee engine efficiency. The density is related to the mass and to the volume being a critical property to the assessment of the subministered energy to the engine by the injection system, which behaves like a pump of positive displacement. Samples of the diesel fuel mixture were made with plant triglycerides in proportion and range of ∼5-20%. The densities of the samples were measured in a density meter with temperature varying between 18 and 25°C, as well as at 15°C, according to ASTM standard. Afterwards, the uncertainties of measurement were calculated, and the density change with respect to temperature is presented and shown in density variation curves. An analysis of the density variation curves shows that.

AB  - We present an analysis of direct land use change (dLUC) resulting from the conversion of semiarid woodlands in Brazil and India to Jatropha curcas, a perennial biofuel crop. The sites examined include prosopis woodlands, managed for woodfuel production under periodic coppicing, in southern India, and unmanaged caatinga woodlands in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. The jatropha plantations under consideration include pruned and unpruned stands and ranged from 2 to 4 years of age. Stocks of carbon in aboveground (AG) pools, including woody biomass, coarse debris, leaf litter, and herbaceous matter, as well as soil organic carbon (SOC) were evaluated. The jatropha plantations store 8-10 tons of carbon per hectare (tCha-1) in AG biomass and litter when managed with regular pruning in both India and Brazil. Unpruned trees, only examined in Brazil, store less biomass (and carbon), accumulating just 3tCha-1 in AG pools. The two woodlands that were replaced with jatropha show substantial differences in carbon pools: prosopis contains ∼11tCha-1 in AG stocks of carbon, which was very close to the jatropha stand which replaced it. In contrast, caatinga stores ∼35tCha-1 in AG biomass. Moreover, no change in SOC was detected in land that was converted from Prosopis to jatropha. As a result, there is no detectable change in AG carbon stocks at the sites in South India where jatropha replaced prosopis woodlands. In contrast, large losses of AG carbon were detected in Central Brazil where jatropha replaced native caatinga woodlands. These losses represent a carbon debt that would take 10-20 years to repay. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The air quality impacts of the partial electrification of the transportation fleet and the use of biofuels (E85) were modeled for the Austin Metropolitan Statistical Area, based on a 2030 vision of regional development. Changes in ozone precursor emissions and predicted ozone, carbon monoxide and aldehyde concentrations were estimated for multiple electrification and biofuel scenarios. Maximum changes in hourly ozone concentration from the use of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) for 17% of the vehicle miles traveled ranged from - 8.5 to 2.2ppb, relative to a base case with no electrification and minimal biofuel use, depending on time of day and location. Differences in daily maximum 1h ozone concentration ranged from - 2.3 to 0.004 ppb. Replacement of all gasoline fuels with E85 had a smaller effect than PHEVs on maximum daily ozone concentrations. Maximum ozone changes for this scenario ranged from - 2.1 to 2.8 ppb and the difference in daily maximum 1h ozone concentrations ranged from - 1.53 to 0 ppb relative to the base case. The smaller improvements in maximum ozone concentrations associated with extensive (100%) use of biofuels, compared to a smaller (17%) penetration of PHEVs, suggests that higher levels of PHEV penetration may lead to even greater improvements; however, the higher penetration would require expansion of the electrical grid capacity. The air quality impacts of the PHEVs would then depend on the emissions associated with the added generation. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Camelina oil is a low-cost feedstock for biodiesel production that has received a great deal of attention in recent years. This paper describes an optimization study on the production of biodiesel from camelina seed oil using alkaline transesterification. The optimization was based on sixteen well-planned orthogonal experiments (OA16 matrix). Four main process conditions in the transesterification reaction for obtaining the maximum biodiesel production yield (i.e. methanol quantity, reaction time, reaction temperature and catalyst concentration) were investigated. It was found that the order of significant factors for biodiesel production is catalyst concentration&gt;reaction time&gt;reaction temperature&gt;methanol to oil ratio. Based on the results of the range analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA), the maximum biodiesel yield was found at a molar ratio of methanol to oil of 8:1, a reaction time of 70min, a reaction temperature of 50°C, and a catalyst concentration of 1wt.%. The product and FAME yields of biodiesel under optimal conditions reached 95.8% and 98.4%, respectively. The properties of the optimized biodiesel, including density, kinematic viscosity, acid value, etc., were determined and compared with those produced from other oil feedstocks. The optimized biodiesel from camelina oil meets the relevant ASTM D6571 and EN 14214 biodiesel standards and can be used as a qualified fuel for diesel engines. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The performance, emission and combustion characteristics of a single cylinder four stroke variable compression ratio multi fuel engine when fueled with waste cooking oil methyl ester and its 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% blends with diesel (on a volume basis) are investigated and compared with standard diesel. The suitability of waste cooking oil methyl ester as a biofuel has been established in this study. Bio diesel produced from waste sun flower oil by transesterification process has been used in this study. Experiment has been conducted at a fixed engine speed of 1500. rpm, 50% load and at compression ratios of 18:1, 19:1, 20:1, 21:1 and 22:1. The impact of compression ratio on fuel consumption, combustion pressures and exhaust gas emissions has been investigated and presented. Optimum compression ratio which gives best performance has been identified. The results indicate longer ignition delay, maximum rate of pressure rise, lower heat release rate and higher mass fraction burnt at higher compression ratio for waste cooking oil methyl ester when compared to that of diesel. The brake thermal efficiency at 50% load for waste cooking oil methyl ester blends and diesel has been calculated and the blend B40 is found to give maximum thermal efficiency. The blends when used as fuel results in reduction of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon and increase in nitrogen oxides emissions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigates the use of ferric chloride (FeCl3) as a fuel borne catalyst (FBC) for waste cooking palm oil based biodiesel. The metal based additive was added to biodiesel at a dosage of 20μmol/L. Experiments were conducted to study the effect of ferric chloride added to biodiesel on performance, emission and combustion characteristics of a direct injection diesel engine operated at a constant speed of 1500rpm at different operating conditions. The results revealed that the FBC added biodiesel resulted in a decreased brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of 8.6% while the brake thermal efficiency increased by 6.3%. FBC added biodiesel showed lower nitric oxide (NO) emission and slightly higher carbon dioxide (CO2) emission as compared to diesel. Carbon monoxide (CO), total hydrocarbon (THC) and smoke emission of FBC added biodiesel decreased by 52.6%, 26.6% and 6.9% respectively compared to biodiesel without FBC at an optimum operating condition of 280bar injection pressure and 25.5o bTDC injection timing. Higher cylinder gas pressure, heat release rate and shorter ignition delay period were observed with FBC added biodiesel at these conditions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In Europe, methyl esters cannot be classified as biodiesel until the EN 14214 Standard specifications are fulfilled. The aim of this paper is to examine the efficiency of removing several impurities in biodiesel from used cooking oils by means of three basic operations under conditions that have been kept as close to commercial operating practice as possible: (a) adsorption (magnesium silicate and bentonite); (b) liquid-liquid extraction (distilled water, tap water, glycerol); and (c) ion exchange (cation resin). The results show that all the purification methods can remove soap, methanol and glycerol effectively, while none had an effect on density, kinematic viscosity, FAME content or glyceride content. However, some of them have shown an influence on FFA and water content. The liquid-liquid extraction with glycerol at 15. wt.% and a 2-step contact proved to be the most suitable. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The control of transient emissions from turbocharged diesel engines is an important objective for automotive manufacturers, as stringent criteria for exhaust emissions must be met. Starting, in particular, is a process of significant importance owing to its major contribution to the overall emissions during a transient test cycle. On the other hand, bio-fuels are getting impetus today as renewable substitutes for conventional fuels, especially in the transport sector. In the present work, experimental tests were conducted at the authors' laboratory on a bus/truck, turbocharged diesel engine in order to investigate the formation mechanisms of nitric oxide (NO), smoke, and combustion noise radiation during hot starting for various alternative fuel blends. To this aim, a fully instrumented test bed was set up, using ultra-fast response analyzers capable of capturing the instantaneous development of emissions as well as various other key engine and turbocharger parameters. The experimental test matrix included three different fuels, namely neat diesel fuel and two blends of diesel fuel with either bio-diesel (30% by vol.) or n-butanol (25% by vol.). With reference to the neat diesel fuel case during the starting event, the bio-diesel blend resulted in deterioration of both pollutant emissions as well as increased combustion instability, while the n-butanol (normal butanol) blend decreased significantly exhaust gas opacity but increased notably NO emission. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Compared to lipid extraction from algae, little work has been performed for cyanobacteria. In this article it is aimed to show high lipid accumulation potential of Synechococcus sp., Cyanobacterium aponinum and Phormidium sp. cells in BG-11 medium. Four different pH values (6-9) and NaNO3 (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5g/L) concentrations were examined at different incubation days to discover the highest lipid accumulation. The maximum lipid content could be achieved in the medium containing 0.25g/L NaNO3 at pH 7 for Synechococcus sp., pH 8 for C. aponinum and pH 9 for Phormidium sp. after 15days. The maximum lipid contents and C16 and C18 methyl ester yields were measured as 42.8% and 46.9% for Synechococcus sp., 45.0% and 67.7% for C. aponinum, 38.2% and 90.6% for Phormidium sp. The saturated compounds were 74.5%, 77.9%, 84.7% for Synechococcus sp., C. aponinum and Phormidium sp., respectively. These crude lipids could be promising feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas is an oil bearing species with multiple uses and considerable economic potential as a biofuel plant, however, oil and deoiled cake are toxic. A non-toxic variety of J. curcas is reported from Mexico. The present investigation explores the effects of different plant growth regulators (PGRs) viz. 6-benzyl aminopurine (BAP) or thidiazuron (TDZ) individually and in combination with indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), on regeneration from in vitro and field-grown mature leaf explants, in vitro and glasshousegrown seedlings cotyledonary leaf explants of non-toxic J. curcas. In all the tested parameters maximum regeneration efficiency (81.07%) and the number of shoot buds per explants (20.17) was observed on 9.08 μM TDZ containing Murashige and Skoog's (MS) medium from in vitro cotyledonary leaf explants. The regenerated shoot buds were transferred to MS medium containing 10 μM kinetin (Kn), 4.5 μM BAP and 5.5 μM α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) for shoot proliferation. The proliferated shoots could be elongated on MS medium supplemented with 2.25 μM BAP and 8.5 μM IAA. Rooting was achieved when the basal cut end of elongated shoots were dipped in half strength MS liquid medium containing different concentrations and combinations of IBA, IAA and NAA for four days followed by transfer to growth regulators free half strength MS medium supplemented 0.25 mg/l activated charcoal. The rooted plants could be established in soil with more than 90% survival rate. © Society for Plant Biochemistry and Biotechnology 2011.

AB  - Fossil carbon in particulate matter comes from anthropogenic use and combustion of fossil fuels, while nonfossil carbon may originate from both biogenic (e.g., pollen, plant debris, fungal spores, and biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA)) and anthropogenic sources (e.g., cooking and residential wood combustion). We investigated the relative contributions of fossil and nonfossil sources to fine carbonaceous aerosols in five European cities by radiocarbon analysis of aerosol samples collected at four types of sites in 2002-2004. The average fraction of nonfossil carbon was 43 11%, with the lowest fraction, 36 7%, at urban curbside sites and the highest fraction, 54 11%, at rural background sites, farthest away from the impact of man-made emissions. Generally, fossil carbon concentrations at urban curbside sites are elevated in comparison to background sites, which is expected because of their proximity to vehicular emissions. Contrary to what might be expected, the concentration of nonfossil carbon is also higher at curbside than at background sites. This may be attributable to differences between site categories in levels of primary biological aerosols, brake and tire wear in resuspended road dust, biofuels, emissions from cooking and residential wood combustion, or processes such as anthropogenic enhancement of biogenic SOA and increased partitioning of semivolatile compounds into the aerosol phase at urban sites. The exact causes should be investigated by future detailed source analyses. Copyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.

AB  - Recently, with the increasing interest on some potential alternative substitutes of petroleum fuels such as biodiesel and butanol, more and more researches are focused on the field of bio-fuels because they are renewable and friendly to the environment and can possibly reduce domestic demand on foreign petroleum. Bio-fuels are generally used in the commercial market by mixing with petroleum-based diesel or gasoline. Since the volatilities and boiling points of ethanol/butanol and diesel/biodiesel fuels are significantly different, micro-explosion can be expected in the blend mixture. In this study, a numerical model of micro-explosion including bubble generation, bubble expansion, and final breakup for multi-component bio-fuel droplets is proposed. From the simulated results of droplet characteristics at the onset of micro-explosion, it is concluded that micro-explosion is possible under engine operation condition for ethanol/butanol-diesel/biodiesel fuel blends. There exists an optimal droplet size and ambient condition for the occurrence of micro-explosion. © 2011 SAE International.

AB  - The feasibility of biodiesel production from jatropha (Jatropha curcas) oil was investigated with respect to the biodiesel blending properties and its oxidation stability with antioxidants. The JME (jatropha oil methyl esters) had the cetane number of 54, cold filter plugging point of -2 °C, density of 881 kg/m3 at 15 °C, ester content of 99.4 wt.%, iodine value of 96.55 g I2/100 g, kinematic viscosity of 4.33 mm2/s at 40 °C, and oxidation stability of 3.86 h. Furthermore, the JME was blended with palm oil biodiesel and soybean oil biodiesel at various weight ratios and evaluated for fuel properties as compared to the relevant specifications. In addition, several antioxidants at concentrations between 100 and 1000 ppm were studied for their potential to improve the oxidation stability of the JME. The relationship between the IP (induction period) in the measurement of the oxidation stability associated with the antioxidant consumption in the JME was described by first-order reaction rate kinetics. Moreover, the ln IP (natural logarithm of the IP) at various concentrations of pyrogallol showed a linear relationship with the test temperature. The oxidation stability at ambient temperatures was predicted on the basis of an extrapolation of the temperature-dependent relationship. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The engine performance impact of soybean oil ethyl ester blending into diesel fuel was analyzed employing heat release analysis, in-cylinder exergy balances and dynamometric tests. Blends with concentrations of up to 30% of soybean oil ethyl ester in volume were used in steady-state experiments conducted in a high speed turbocharged direct injection engine. Modifications in fuel heat value, fuel-air equivalence ratio and combustion temperature were found to govern the impact resulting from the addition of biodiesel on engine performance. For the analyzed fuels, the 20% biodiesel blend presented the best results of brake thermal efficiency, while the 10% biodiesel blend presented the best results of brake power and sfc (specific fuel consumption). In relation to mineral diesel and in full load conditions, an average increase of 4.16% was observed in brake thermal efficiency with B20 blend. In the same conditions, an average gain of 1.15% in brake power and a reduction of 1.73% in sfc was observed with B10 blend. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In several countries biodiesel blending programs have been implemented looking for reduction in fossil fuel dependence and environmental benefits, including climate change mitigation. The current global biodiesel production, from different fatty raw materials, reaches about 6 billion liters per year and represents 10% of whole biofuel production. Nevertheless, in many cases the actual advantages of biodiesel production and usage are not clearly evaluated. Essentially, the feasibility of biodiesel production can be determined by its efficiency in solar energy conversion, as indicated by agro-industrial productivity and energy balance parameters, which expresses a relative demand of natural resources (land and energy) to produce biofuel. Taking into account the Brazilian conditions, in this paper an assessment of biodiesel production is presented, comparing four different productive systems. According to this evaluation, soybean and castor are limitedly feasible, whereas tallow and palm oil represent more suitable alternatives. The selection of an efficient productive system is crucial for the rationality of biodiesel production. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nowadays one of the most important environmental issues is the exponential increase of the greenhouse effect by the polluting action of the industrial and transport sectors. The production of biofuels is considered a viable alternative for the pollution mitigation but also to promote rural development. The work presents an analysis of the environmental impacts of the methanol production from sugarcane bagasse, taking into consideration the balance of the energy life cycle and its net environmental impacts, both are included in a LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) approach. The evaluation is done as a case study of a 100,000 t/y methanol plant, using sugarcane bagasse as raw material. The methanol is produced through the BTL (Biomass to Liquid) route. The results of the environmental impacts were compared to others LCA studies of biofuel and it was showed that there are significant differences of environmental performance among the existing biofuel production system, even for the same feedstock. The differences are dependent on many factors such as farming practices, technology of the biomass conversion. With relation to the result of output/input ratio, the methanol production from sugarcane bagasse showed to be a feasible alternative for the substitution of an amount of fossil methanol obtained from natural gas. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nowadays, many farmers tend to focus a part of their production on technical crops and/or a utilization of classical crops as main products or byproducts for industrial as well as energy purposes. As for the biomass energy generation, oil crops are primarily used as a substitute for diesel engine fuels thanks to the high energy content in their oils. Similarly, their main product serves as a source for the dye and paint industry. Although there are many different oily crops used for technical purposes, i.e. rape seed (canola), soybeans, and groundnut, sunflower is the major one in many regions. For instance, long-term testing results have proven a feasibility of a regular turbo charged diesel engine operation on raw cold-pressed sunflower oil provided that the car is equipped with a double fuel tank system. However, liquid biofuels based on chemically derived oily compounds, known as esters, are more suitable as an environmentally friendly diesel substitute for general usage. Methyl- or ethyl-esters are usually blended in mixtures with crude diesel oil and/or other mineral hydrocarbons (C8 - C12) because of economical reasons, even though operation on pure esters is accomplishable as well. Nevertheless, the processing technologies, various compounds and portions of the final blend are still under research and development in order to achieve an optimal performance with lower emissions and a higher energy balance ratio (renewable output : fossil input). Moreover, there is also a potential for utilization of the by-products of agricultural and forestry sectors in terms of the biomass energy. Generating rigid, liquid as well as gaseous fuels by pyrolisis and gasification can bring a new approach to producing the green electricity and liquid fuels (BTL) generation using wastes or low cost by-products. The authors' goal is to compose a comparative study of the above listed approaches and technologies for the sunflower processing based on physical and chemical properties, standardization and a global economy development with a high respect to sustainability. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - There are many studies showing that the performance results for engines operating with biofuels are acceptable, although very few long-term analysis of wear and maintenance problems are shown. Three mono-cylinder compression ignition engines were tested for approximately 1000. h each, with pure diesel oil (D100), pure soy methyl ester (SME100) and pure castor oil methyl ester (CME100). The lubricating oil analysis didn't reveal any excessive amount of metals compared to the engine with pure diesel. Viscosity decreased very soon to values below the minimum recommended due to dilution with the methyl esters, especially with SME100. The injection system analysis showed that opening pressures, hydraulic flux and corrosion levels were acceptable. The SME piston showed a very small crack. A higher amount of carbon deposits and gum formation was found over biofuel pistons, indicating poor combustion. Piston ring seating and gap were inside specification. Cylinder liners presented no damage on running surface. The valves presented abrasive and adhesive wear, contact fatigue for SME100 and marks at valve seating for CME100, considered acceptable after 1000. h of test. The results obtained show that the use of pure methyl esters fuels was acceptable for these engines regarding wear and maintenance problems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms that can produce lipids, proteins and carbohydrates in large amounts over short periods of time. These products can be processed into both biofuels and useful chemicals. Two algae samples (Cladophora fracta and Chlorella protothecoid) were studied for biofuel production. Microalgae appear to be the only source of renewable biodiesel that is capable of meeting the global demand for transport fuels. Microalgae can be converted to biodiesel, bioethanol, bio-oil, biohydrogen and biomethane via thermochemical and biochemical methods. Industrial reactors for algal culture are open ponds, photobioreactors and closed systems. Algae can be grown almost anywhere, even on sewage or salt water, and does not require fertile land or food crops, and processing requires less energy than the algae provides. Microalgae have much faster growth-rates than terrestrial crops. the per unit area yield of oil from algae is estimated to be from 20,000 to 80,000liters per acre, per year; this is 7-31 times greater than the next best crop, palm oil. Algal oil can be used to make biodiesel for cars, trucks, and airplanes. The lipid and fatty acid contents of microalgae vary in accordance with culture conditions. The effect of temperature on the yield of hydrogen from two algae (C. fracta and C. protothecoid) by pyrolysis and steam gasification were investigated in this study. In each run, the main components of the gas phase were CO2, CO, H2, and CH4.The yields of hydrogen by pyrolysis and steam gasification processes of the samples increased with temperature. The yields of gaseous products from the samples of C. fracta and C. protothecoides increased from 8.2% to 39.2% and 9.5% to 40.6% by volume, respectively, while the final pyrolysis temperature was increased from 575 to 925K. The percent of hydrogen in gaseous products from the samples of C. fracta and C. protothecoides increased from 25.8% to 44.4% and 27.6% to 48.7% by volume, respectively, while the final pyrolysis temperature was increased from 650 to 925K. The percent of hydrogen in gaseous products from the samples of C. fracta and C. protothecoides increased from 26.3% to 54.7% and 28.1% to 57.6% by volume, respectively, while the final gasification temperature was increased from 825 to 1225K. In general, algae gaseous products are higher quality than gaseous products from mosses. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The increasing global demand of biofuels for energy security and reduction in climate change effects generate the opportunity to explore new biomass sources. Algae is a very promising source of biomass in this context as it sequester a significant quantity of carbon from atmosphere and industrial gases and is also very efficient in utilizing the nutrients from industrial effluents and municipal wastewater. Therefore cultivation of algal biomass provide dual benefit, it provides biomass for the production of biofuels and also save our environment from air and water pollution. The life cycle assessment (LCA) of algal biofuels suggests them to be environmentally better than the fossil fuels but economically it is not yet so attractive. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae are promising biomass species owing to their fast growth rate and high CO2 fixation ability as compared to terrestrial plants. Microalgae have long been recognized as potentially good source for biofuel production because of their high oil content and rapid biomass production. In this study Chlorella sp. MP-1 biomass was examined for its physical and chemical characteristics using Bomb calorimeter, TGDTA, CHN and FTIR. The proximate composition was calculated using standard ASTM methodology. Chlorella sp. MP-1 biomass shows low ash (5.93%), whereas high energy (18.59MJ/kg), carbohydrate (19.46%), and lipid (28.82%) content. The algal de-oiled cake was characterized by FTIR spectroscopy and thermogravimetric study at 10°C/min and 30°C/min to investigate its feasibility for thermo-chemical conversion. The present investigation suggests that within the realm of biomass energy technologies the algal biomass can be used as feedstock for bio and thermo-chemical whereas the de-oiled cake for thermo-chemical conversion thereby serving the demand of second generation biofuels. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The biodiesel production from a naturally isolated strain of Chlorella in 2. L bubble-column photobioreactor was studied. The microalgal strain was isolated from the rice paddy-field soil samples during a screening program. After 17. days, at the end of exponential phase of growth, the total content of the lipids was extracted. The extracted fatty acids were first esterified and then identified using GC/MS analysis. Several types of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were identified in the isolated microalga and the presence of saturated fatty acids in Chlorella sp. MCCS 040 was approved. The composition of fatty acids in the studied species of microalga was mainly palmitic acid methyl ester, myristic acid methyl ester, stearic acid methyl ester and undecanoic acid methyl ester. This strain because of its highly saturated fatty acids content can be an ideal candidate for biodiesel production. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to study marine macroalgae as an alternative raw material for the biodiesel production. The obtained results show that biodiesel production from oil extracted from marine algae is feasible by transesterification. Oil extraction can be carried out simultaneously with the transesterification. To investigate the optimum reaction conditions, the reaction was carried out at various methanol to oil molar ratios, catalyst concentrations and reaction temperatures. The process yields 1.6-11.5% depending on the reaction conditions. Moreover, the properties of macroalgae transesterification residue after transesterification were analyzed, concluding that it is a suitable material for fuel pellets manufacturing. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It is well-established that microalgal-derived biofuels have the potential to make a significant contribution to the US fuel market, due to several unique characteristics inherent to algae. Namely, autotrophic microalgae are capable of achieving very high efficiencies in converting solar energy into biomass and oil relative to terrestrial oilseed crops, while at the same time exhibiting great flexibility in the quality of land and water required for algal cultivation. These characteristics allow for the possibility to produce appreciable amounts of algal biofuels relative to today's petroleum fuel market, while greatly mitigating " food-versus-fuel" concerns. However, there is a wide lack of public agreement on the near-term economic viability of algal biofuels, due to uncertainties and speculation on process scale-up associated with the nascent stage of the algal biofuel industry.The present study aims to establish baseline economics for two microalgae pathways, by performing a comprehensive analysis using a set of assumptions for what can plausibly be achieved within a five-year timeframe. Specific pathways include autotrophic production via both open pond and closed tubular photobioreactor (PBR) systems. The production scales were set at 10 million gallons per year of raw algal oil, subsequently upgraded to a " green diesel" blend stock via hydrotreating. Rigorous mass balances were performed using Aspen Plus simulation software, and associated costs were evaluated on a unit-level basis. Upon completing the base case scenarios, the cost of lipid production to achieve a 10% return was determined to be $8.52/gal for open ponds and $18.10/gal for PBRs. Hydrotreating to produce a diesel blend stock added onto this marginally, bringing the totals to $9.84/gal and $20.53/gal of diesel, for the respective cases. These costs have potential for significant improvement in the future if better microalgal strains can be identified that would be capable of sustaining high growth rates at high lipid content. Given that it is difficult to maximize both of these parameters simultaneously, it was determined that the near-term research should focus on maximizing lipid content as it offers more substantial cost reduction potential relative to an improved algae growth rate. Additional economic sensitivity studies were established to identify other important cost drivers, and a resource assessment comparison was made to evaluate parameters such as water and CO2 requirements. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Due to increasing oil prices and climate change concerns, biodiesel has gained attention as an alternative energy source. Biodiesel derived from microalgae is a potentially renewable and carbon-neutral alternative to petroleum fuels. One of the most important decisions in obtaining oil from microalgae is the choice of algal species to use. Eight microalgae from a total of 33 isolated cultures were selected based on their morphology and ease of cultivation. Five cultures were isolated from river and identified as strains of Scenedesmus obliquus YSR01, Nitzschia cf. pusilla YSR02, Chlorella ellipsoidea YSR03, S. obliquus YSR04, and S. obliquus YSR05, and three were isolated from wastewater and identified as S. obliquus YSW06, Micractinium pusillum YSW07, and Ourococcus multisporus YSW08, based on LSU rDNA (D1-D2) and ITS sequence analyses. S. obliquus YSR01 reached a growth rate of 1.68±0.28 day-1 at 680nm and a biomass concentration of 1.57±0.67g dwt L-1, with a high lipid content of 58±1.5%. Under similar environmental conditions, M. pusillum reached a growth rate of 2.3±0.55 day-1 and a biomass concentration of 2.28±0.16g dwt L-1, with a relatively low lipid content of 24±0.5% w/w. The fatty acid compositions of the studied species were mainly myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, oleic, linoleic, g-linolenic, and linolenic acids. Our results suggest that S. obliquus YSR01 can be a possible candidate species for producing oils for biodiesel, based on its high lipid and oleic acid contents. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae have been proposed as possible alternative feedstocks for the production of biodiesel because of their high photosynthetic efficiency. The high energy input required for microalgal culture and oil extraction may negate this advantage, however. There is a need to determine whether microalgal biodiesel can deliver more energy than is required to produce it. In this work, net energy analysis was done on systems to produce biodiesel and biogas from two microalgae: Haematococcus pluvialis and Nannochloropsis. Even with very optimistic assumptions regarding the performance of processing units, the results show a large energy deficit for both systems, due mainly to the energy required to culture and dry the microalgae or to disrupt the cell. Some energy savings may be realized from eliminating the fertilizer by the use of wastewater or, in the case of H. pluvialis, recycling some of the algal biomass to eliminate the need for a photobioreactor, but these are insufficient to completely eliminate the deficit. Recommendations are made to develop wet extraction and transesterification technology to make microalgal biodiesel systems viable from an energy standpoint. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Algae containing 30-75% of lipid by dry basis can be called oilgae. All microalgae species produce lipid however some species can contain up to 70% of their dry weight. Microalgae appear to be the only source of renewable biodiesel that is capable of meeting the global demand for transport fuels. Biodiesel production by using oilgae is an alternative process in contrast to other procedures not only being degradable and non-toxic but also as a solution to global warming via reducing emission gases. Algae-based technologies could provide a key tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants and other carbon intensive industrial processes. Because algae are rich in oil and can grow in a wide range of conditions, many companies are betting that it can create fuels or other chemicals cheaper than existing feedstocks. The aim of microalgae biofixation of CO2 is to operate large-scale systems that are able to convert a significant fraction of the CO2 outputs from a power plant into biofuels. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Global threats of fuel shortages in the near future and climate change due to green-house gas emissions are posing serious challenges and hence and it is imperative to explore means for sustainable ways of averting the consequences. The dual application of microalgae for phycoremediation and biomass production for sustainable biofuels production is a feasible option. The use of high rate algal ponds (HRAPs) for nutrient removal has been in existence for some decades though the technology has not been fully harnessed for wastewater treatment. Therefore this paper discusses current knowledge regarding wastewater treatment using HRAPs and microalgal biomass production techniques using wastewater streams. The biomass harvesting methods and lipid extraction protocols are discussed in detail. Finally the paper discusses biodiesel production via transesterification of the lipids and other biofuels such as biomethane and bioethanol which are described using the biorefinery approach. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Carbon-neutral renewable liquid biofuels are needed to displace petroleum-derived transport fuels in the near future - which contribute to global warming and are of a limited availability. A promising alternative is conveyed by microalgae, the oil content of which may exceed 80% (w/wDW) - as compared with 5% of the best agricultural oil crops. However, current implementation of microalga-based systems has been economically constrained by their still poor volumetric efficiencies - which lead to excessively high costs, as compared with petrofuel prices. Technological improvements of such processes are thus critical - and this will require a multiple approach, both on the biocatalyst and bioreactor levels. Several bottlenecks indeed exist at present that preclude the full industrial exploitation of microalgal cells: the number of species that have been subjected to successful genetic transformation is scarce, which hampers a global understanding (and thus a rational design) of novel blue-biotechnological processes; the mechanisms that control regulation of gene expression are not fully elucidated, as required before effective bioprocesses based on microalgae can be scaled-up; and new molecular biology tools are needed to standardize genetic modifications in microalgae - including efficient nuclear transformation, availability of promoter or selectable marker genes, and stable expression of transgenes. On the other hand, a number of pending technological issues are also present: the relatively low microalga intrinsic lipid productivity; the maximum cell concentration attainable; the efficiency of harvest and sequential recovery of bulk lipids; and the possibility of by-product upgrade. This review briefly covers the state of the art regarding microalgae toward production of biofuels, both from the point of view of the microalgal cell itself and of the supporting bioreactor; and discusses, in a critical manner, current limitations and promising perspectives in this field. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper solves a problem of using unconventional fuels for driving jet engines. The carried out experiments were aimed at assessing the possibilities of using various contributions of MERO (methyl esters of rapseed oil) biofuel mixed with Jet A-1 aircraft fuel and for analyzing the influences of using an alternative fuel exerted upon the selected parts of the jet engine. The authors of the article compare the effect of adding bio-ingredients (MERO) to Jet A-1 aircraft fuel on the properties of rubber sealings used in the aircraft engine. The physical properties of MERO bio-ingredients and Jet A-1 aircraft fuel are very similar. The conducted research has discovered additional options of mixing MERO biofuel and Jet A-1 aircraft fuel and demonstrated that the total concentration (0-100%) of MERO biofuel in Jet A-1 aircraft fuel reaches a process of creating of a homogeneous mixture without sediments or coagulants. The evaluated results indicate that the appendage of the methyl esters of rapseed oil in Jet A-1 aircraft fuel give out a relatively large slump in physical-mechanical properties within the period of a few days. The raising content of MERO in aircraft fuel is bulking samples and makes itself felt by increasing the weight of the samples.

AB  - The article considers and solves the problems of adapting the mathematical models, used in calculating operational characteristics of diesel engines burning mineral diesel oil, to engines converted to RME biofuels. The analysis of mathematical models of calculating the main technical and economic characteristics of diesel engines as well as the parameters of the in-cylinder process and the concentration of toxic substances in the exhaust gases is performed. The need for adjusting the calculation algorithms is also demonstrated. The computer programs based on single-zone thermodynamic models are used in the research. The programs of mathematical modelling are modified, i.e. supplemented with the algorithm for calculating energy characteristics of the combustion products (e.g. specific heat capacity, internal heat, the lower calorific value, etc.). Based on the computer programs, modified for examining diesel engines burning biofuels, the computer-aided mathematical modelling experiment is carried out. The results of modelling are compared with the data obtained in testing the diesel engine 1A41. The mathematical modelling performed demonstrates the accuracy acceptable for solving practical problems: the difference between the obtained calculation results and diesel engine testing data for the load range of (1.0÷0.5) Pi nom does not exceed ± 5÷7%. Higher accuracy of modelling the characteristics of diesel engines, operating in the low- and medium-load modes, may be accounted for by the adjustment of the algorithm for calculating the induction period and the on-set phase of fuel injection.

AB  - At present, the world faces severe issues of energy crises and environmental deterioration. Fuel is inevitable for industrial development and growth of any country. The fossil fuel resources have always been terrifying. Biofuel energy, a renewable source, seems to be an ideal solution for global energy and environmental concern. The present work focuses on an optimized protocol for the production of biodiesel from a feasible source, i.e., sesame plant oil (Sesamum indicum L.) through base catalyzed transesterification. The sesame plant oil is investigated in this study as a potential source of biodiesel based on fuel properties and physico-chemical analysis. The free fatty acid number of crude sesame oil was 0.83 mg/g of KOH (1.66%). Conversion of sesame crude oil (triglyceride) to biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester) was 75.45% and 72.56% at 1:6 molar ratio (oil:methanol) by using optimum 0.67% KOH and 0.34% NaOH catalyst, respectively, at 60°C for qualitative authentication. Specified analytical techniques are as follows: GC-MS used to clarify the different fatty acid methyl esters; FT-IR to monitor the transesterification reaction; and NMR for the justification of proton and carbon of that compound. Qualitatively, the biodiesel fuel properties were analyzed by the standard method American Society for Testing Material (ASTM). Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The ever increasing price of petroleum-based fuels and lack of energy security form the major challenge facing majority of non-oil producing countries, Botswana included. A number of countries are now encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy including biofuels. Botswana is also encouraging this trend. Available evidence indicates that a small quantity of biodiesel fuel is produced from used waste cooking oil in Botswana. However, the quality of the product is not yet known because there are presently no local biodiesel standards through which small local producers can demonstrate that their product has been produced according to an approved procedure and is consistently of high quality. A comparative analysis between biodiesel and petroleum-based diesel revealed that the quality in terms of thermal efficiency of biodiesel produced by one of the local company (Biodiesel Botswana) compares well with the data for petroleum-based diesel fuel. © 2011 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - The South African government, as part of its efforts to mitigate the effects of the ongoing energy crisis, has proposed that biofuels should form an important part of the country's energy supply. The contribution of liquid biofuels to the national fuel supply is expected to be at least 2% by 2013. The Biofuels Industrial Strategy of the Republic of South Africa of 2007 outlines key incentives for reaching this target and promoting the development of a sustainable biofuels industry. This paper discusses issues relating to this strategy as well as key drivers in biofuel processing with reference to potential impacts on South Africa's rich biological heritage. Our understanding of many of the broader aspects of biofuels needs to be enhanced. We identify key areas where challenges exist, such as the link between technology, conversion processes and feedstock selection. The available and proposed processing technologies have important implications for land use and the use of different non-native plant species as desired feedstocks. South Africa has a long history of planting non-native plant species for commercial purposes, notably for commercial forestry. Valuable lessons can be drawn from this experience on mitigation against potential impacts by considering plausible scenarios and the appropriate management framework and policies. We conceptualise key issues embodied in the biofuels strategy, adapting a framework developed for assessing and quantifying impacts of invasive alien species. In so doing, we provide guidelines for minimising the potential impacts of biofuel projects on biodiversity. © 2011. The Authors.

AB  - This paper focuses on the benefits that can be attained from the correct option of smallscale combined heat and power plant (CHP) relative to fuel availability and sphere of application. The analysis serves as a means of highlighting some of the owners of large-scale farms as well as holders of industrial greenhouses that influence the penetration of small-scale cogeneration plants running on bio-based liquid fuels. The identification of the main influencing factors and their weight is the first step towards the implementation of a more coherent strategy, if the EC (European Commission) and national energy authorities wish for new small-scale cogeneration technologies to have a future in the context of sustainable development of rural Lithuania. Against this background, this paper aims at presenting the technical, environmental and economic aspects of the possibilities of utilizing biodiesel, biodiesel-conventional diesel blends and rapeseed oil in combined heat and power production as an issue for further discussions regarding the formative breakthrough attitude towards a possible path of country's sustainable development. © 2011 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika.

AB  - In this study, for the first time, fly ash was used as a thermal barrier coating material in a diesel engine. The study consists of three phases. In first phase, biodiesel was prepared in a laboratory scale setup by single step base catalyzed transesterification method. In the second phase, engine combustion chamber elements such as cylinder head, cylinder liner, valves and piston crown face were coated with fly ash, which is a thermal power plant waste, to a thickness of 200 μm by using plasma spray coating method. In third phase, experiments were carried out on fly ash coated single cylinder diesel engine fueled by methyl ester of rice bran, pongamia oil and its blend (20% by volume) with diesel. The test run was repeated on uncoated engine under the same running conditions and the results were compared. An increase in engine power and decrease in specific fuel consumption, as well as significant improvements in exhaust gas emissions (except NOx) were observed for all test fuels used in the fly ash coated engine compared with that of the uncoated engine. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the outcomes of a questionnaire survey to ascertain the perspectives of local communities on the proposal to construct a large-scale biodiesel production facility in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, with feedstock supply to the production facility from the former communal homelands of the Province. A total of 303 questionnaires were administered through interactions with the communities that are expected to be a part of the feedstock production supply chain by visiting households and having in-depth interviews, and through a focus group discussion. Opinions were found to be overwhelmingly against the proposed biodiesel production supply chain. The concerns of local people varied, but the major issues were land availability as this is regarded as their identity; infrastructure development; associated pollution (air and water) posing serious health risk; doubts about the credibility of the developers; food security; and the distortion of the social fabric of the local communities. In general, local people felt that they were excluded from the project development and were asked to accept industrial scale development that will further lead to the impoverishment of the communities. The results also highlighted how large-scale plants may be affected by the local dynamics of perceptions; the willingness to partake in the supply chain was informed by personal, social and institutional factors and beliefs, as well as internal conflicts, due to perceived environmental, social and ecological risks, that were aggravated by miscommunication and the lack of understanding. The paper is deemed useful for policy makers to understand why communities may object to relatively large bioenergy projects, and to assist the developers of such projects to avoid delays and refusal of planning consent that can be associated with adverse local opinions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recently biodiesel, as an alternative fuel is getting more significance to replace diesel fuel completely or partially. However, corrosion of automotive materials in biodiesel is a major concern as this can reduce engine life. This study aims to investigate the corrosion behavior of mild steel at three different temperatures such as room temperature, 50 and 80 °C. Static immersion tests in B0 (diesel), B50 (50% biodiesel in diesel), B100 (biodiesel) were carried out for 1200 h. At the end of the tests, corrosion characteristic was investigated by weight loss measurements and changes of the exposed metal surface. Fuels were analyzed by using TAN analyzer and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in order to investigate the change in acidity and oxidation of fuel respectively upon exposure. Surface morphology was examined by optical microscope and scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy. Corrosion products were detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Results showed that the corrosion of mild steel increases with increase of temperature. Upon exposure of biodiesel to mild steel at high temperature, the water content and oxidation products are increased. © 2011.

AB  - This work focuses on the development of heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production from high free fatty acid (FFA) containing Jatropha curcas oil (JCO). Solid base and acid catalysts were prepared and tested for transesterification in a batch reactor under mild reaction conditions. Mixtures of solid base and acid catalysts were also tested for single-step simultaneous esterification and transesterification. More soap formation was found to be the main problem for calcium oxide (CaO) and lithium doped calcium oxide (Li-CaO) catalysts during the reaction of jatropha oil and methanol than for the rapeseed oil (RSO). CaO with Li doping showed increased conversion to biodiesel than bare CaO as a catalyst. La2O3/ZnO, La2O3/Al2O3 and La0.1Ca0.9MnO3 catalysts were also tested and among them La2O3-ZnO showed higher activity. Mixture of solid base catalysts (CaO and Li-CaO) and solid acid catalyst (Fe2(SO4)3) were found to give complete conversion to biodiesel in a single-step simultaneous esterification and transesterification process. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L is an economically potential tree species gaining interest globally because of its feasible contribution towards production of commercial biofuel. Little is known however, of its genetic variation patterns within Kenyan accessions for maximum exploitation. Eight populations covering most of its distribution range in Kenya were sampled and leaves of 160 individual trees collected. Analysis of molecular diversity was carried out using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Ten random primers generated 251 loci that were scored for diversity. Shannon's diversity index varied from 0.116 (Likoni) to 0.360 (Namanga). Analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that, more variation (53%; P = 0.01) was partitioned among populations while 47% (P = 0.01) variation was partitioned within populations. Nested analysis of variance showed no variation across regions (0%; P > 0.01). The level of genetic structure and diversity may be explained by the modes of germplasm introductions and the biological traits of J. curcas. Based on these results, Jatropha accessions are quite variable and seeds collected from various populations are bound to exhibit wide variation. Selection of a J. curcas breeding population should encompass a large number of individuals across all accessions in order to capture the wide genetic variation. © 2011 Academic Journals.

AB  - This study investigated the particulate matter (PM), particle-bound carbons, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emitted from a diesel-engine generator fuelled with blends of pure fossil diesel oil (D100) and varying percentages of waste-edible-oil biodiesel (W10, 10 vol %; W20, 20 vol %; W30, 30 vol %; and W50, 50 vol %) under generator loads of 0, 1.5, and 3 kW. On average, the PM emission factors of all blends was 30.5 % (range, 13.7-52.3 %) lower than that of D100 under the tested loads. Substituting pure fossil diesel oil with varying percentages of waste-edible-oil biodiesel reduced emissions of particle-bound total carbon (TC) and elemental carbon (EC). The W20 blend had the lowest particle-bound organic carbon (OC) emissions. Notably, W10, W20, and W30 also had lower Total-PAH emissions and lower total equivalent toxicity (Total-BaPeq) compared to D100. Additionally, the brake-specific fuel consumption of the generator correlated positively with the ratio of waste-edible-oil biodiesel to pure fossil diesel. However, generator energy efficiency correlated negatively with the ratio of waste-edible-oil biodiesel to pure fossil diesel. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this study, spent bleaching clay containing 26.6 wt.% of residual palm oil was pyrolyzed using a tubular furnace. Carboxylic acids ranging from C 9-C18 and alkanes ranging from C16-C 44 were the major classes of compounds found in the pyrolytic products analyzed using GC-MS. Significant amounts of monoaromatic compounds, alkenes, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, esters, nitrogenated compounds, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were found in the bio-oil produced in this study. The bio-oil resulting from the pyrolysis process gave n-hexadecanoic acid as the major compound. Decomposition temperature of the adsorbed oil determined using TGA was found to be in the range of 573-683 K. Topographical and elemental analyses of the clay was done using SEM-EDX. The functional groups were determined using FTIR. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Saponified, palm, olive, rapeseed and castor oils were pyrolysed (at 750 °C for 20 s) by pyrolysis gas chromatography with mass selective and flame ionisation detection (Py-GC/MSD and FID) to clarify their thermochemical behaviours. The liquefiable compounds recovered from palm, olive and rapeseed oils mainly contained linear alkenes (up to C19) and alkanes (up to C17), both similar to those found in gasoline (C4-C 10) and diesel fuel (C11-C22) boiling range fractions of petroleum, whereas in the case of castor oil a significant amount of undesired oxygen-containing products (e.g., ketones and phenols) were formed. The obtained data on reaction mechanisms can also be utilised in applications where various biofuels are produced, for example, from the extractive-derived by-product (tall oil) of kraft pulping. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The U.S. renewable fuel standard has made it a requirement to increase the production of ethanol and advanced biofuels to 36 billion by 2022. Ethanol will be capped at 15 billion, which leaves 21 billion to come from other sources such as butanol. Butanol has a higher energy density and lower affinity for water than ethanol. Moreover, alcohol fueled engines in general have been shown to positively affect engine-out emissions of oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide compared with their gasoline fueled counterparts. In light of these developments, the variety and blend levels of oxygenated constituents is likely to increase in the foreseeable future. The effect on engine-out emissions for total hydrocarbons is less clear due to the relative insensitivity of the flame ionization detector (FID) toward alcohols and aldehydes. It is well documented that hydrocarbon (HC) measurement using a conventional FID in the presence of oxygenates in the engine exhaust stream can lead to a misinterpretation of HC emissions trends for alcohol fuel blends. Characterization of the exhaust stream for all expected hydrocarbon constituents is required to accurately determine the actual concentration of unburned fuel components in the exhaust. In addition to a conventional exhaust emissions bench, this characterization requires supplementary instrumentation capable of hydrocarbon speciation and response factor independent quantification. Although required for certification testing, this sort of instrumentation is not yet widely available in engine development facilities. Therefore, an attempt is made to empirically determine FID correction factors for oxygenate fuels. Exhaust emissions of an engine fueled with several blends of gasoline and ethanol, n-butanol and iso-Butanol were characterized using both a conventional FID and a Fourier transform infrared. Based on these results, a response factor predicting the actual hydrocarbon emissions based solely on FID results as a function of alcohol type and content is presented. Finally, the correlation derived from data presented in this study is compared with equations and results found in the literature. © 2011 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - Algae are an attractive biofuel feedstock because of their fast growth rates and improved land use efficiency when compared with terrestrial crops. Process train components needed to produce algal biofuels include (1) cultivation, (2) harvesting, and (3) conversion into usable fuel. This paper compares various process train options and identifies knowledge gaps presently restricting the production of algal biodiesel and algae-derived biogas. This analysis identified energy-intensive processing and the inability to cultivate large quantities of lipid-rich algal biomass as major obstacles inhibiting algal biodiesel production. Anaerobic digestion of algal biomass requires fewer process train components and occurs regardless of lipid content. In either scenario, the use of wastewater effluent as a cultivation medium seems necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and maximize water use efficiency. Furthermore, anaerobically digesting algal biomass generated from low-technology wastewater treatment processes represents an appropriate technology approach to algal biofuels that is poorly investigated. Coupling these processes can improve global health by improving sanitation, while providing a cleaner burning biogas alternative to indoor biomass cooking systems typical of less-developed areas. © 2010 Publishing Technology.

AB  - Heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) present a growing energy and environmental concern worldwide. These vehicles rely almost entirely on diesel fuel for propulsion and create problems associated with local pollution, climate change, and energy security. Given these problems and the expected global expansion of HDVs in transportation sectors, industry and governments are pursuing biofuels and natural gas as potential alternative fuels for HDVs. Using recent lifecycle datasets, this paper evaluates the energy and emissions impacts of these fuels in the HDV sector by conducting a total fuel-cycle (TFC) analysis for Class 8 HDVs for six fuel pathways: (1) petroleum to ultra low sulfur diesel; (2) petroleum and soyoil to biodiesel (methyl soy ester); (3) petroleum, ethanol, and oxygenate to e-diesel; (4) petroleum and natural gas to Fischer- Tropsch diesel; (5) natural gas to compressed natural gas; and (6) natural gas to liquefied natural gas. TFC emissions are evaluated for three greenhouse gases (GHGs) (carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane) and five other pollutants (volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and sulfur oxides), along with estimates of total energy and petroleum consumption associated with each of the six fuel pathways. Results show definite advantages with biodiesel and compressed natural gas for most pollutants, negligible benefits for e-diesel, and increased GHG emissions for liquefied natural gas and Fischer-Tropsch diesel (from natural gas). © 2011 Air & Waste Management Association.

AB  - There is a move towards large-scale planting of perennial bioenergy crops in many countries to help reduce Green House Gas emissions, whilst still meeting energy demand. However, the implications of such wholesale land use change have yet to be fully understood which raises some concerns over the strategy. This paper identifies, through literature review, that significant social, economic and environmental impacts might be expected from land use change in two different parts of the world, São Paulo, Brazil, where sugarcane is the predominant perennial biomass crop, and England where miscanthus and short rotation coppice are likely to predominate. In order to examine the extent to which these impacts can be addressed in decision-making, the paper develops a framework for testing the effectiveness of environmental assessment practice in these two regions, and applies it to both. The conclusion is that, whilst tools which can address sustainability impacts in decision-making exist, the legal framework in England precludes their application for the majority of land use change, and in Brazil there is incomplete consideration of social and economic impacts at the strategic level. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Tractor performance tests conducted under laboratory test conditions are important because these tests determine the performance characteristics used to compare strengths and weaknesses of tractors. Th e objective of this study was to determine the effect of diesel fuel (B0) and 3 different biodiesel blends made of canola oil (B10, B20, B30) on tractor power take-off (PTO) performance characteristics. Performance characteristics studied were PTO power, engine torque, engine fuel consumption, and specific fuel consumption on an agricultural tractor (Massey Ferguson 3056 2WD) at the test laboratory of the Directorate of Agricultural Machinery Test Center (TAMTEST), Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Ankara, Turkey. Th e maximum PTO power (32.35 ± 0.06 kW), the minimum specific fuel consumption (288.72 ± 0.11 g kW-1 h-1), and the minimum fuel consumption (11.08 ± 0.13 L h-1) were achieved by using B20 at an engine speed of 2100 min-1. The nominal engine speed for petrodiesel was 2200 min-1, whereas the greatest engine power was accomplished at 2100 min-1 for all biodiesel blends. Even though 2%-4% reduction was obtained in fuel consumption by using biodiesel blends at 2100 min-1, the mean fuel consumption was statistically insignifi cant (P &gt; 0.05), whereas average fuel consumption was higher with petrodiesel at 2200 min-1 (P &lt; 0.05). It was concluded that B20 (20% biodiesel + 80% petrodiesel) could be a more efficient alternative to petrodiesel fuel. © TÜBİTAK.

AB  - Bioremediation of sandy soil contaminated with fish-biodiesel, conventional diesel, and blends of both was studied in microcosm experiments at different temperatures, simulating the subarctic environment. While distinct lag, exponential, and stationary phases were observed at 20. °C, degradation at 6. °C was slow and the lag phase continued throughout the 4-week experiment. A three-phase 1st order kinetic model successfully described respiration at 20. °C, a one-phase model was sufficient at 6. °C. For temperatures fluctuating between ∼6 and ∼20. °C, higher than expected microbial activity persisted at 6. °C for several days, due to the presence of active cultures, even though the soil temperature closely followed the air temperature. At 20. °C, respiration peaked already after 1 week, and 18-51% of the initially added fuel was mineralized within 4 weeks, whereby degradation was higher at higher biodiesel percentages. Biodiesel addition accelerated mineralization of blends with regular diesel beyond expectations. In blends with 20% biodiesel, the degradation rate constant was twice as high as for conventional diesel. These synergistic effects are likely due to an active microbial population. Addition of biodiesel to conventional diesel could reduce the impact of diesel spills. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An experimental investigation was carried out on a small direct injection (DI) diesel engine, fuelling the engine with 10% (B10), 20% (B20), 30% (B30) and 40% (B40) blending of Koroch seed oil methyl ester (KSOME) with diesel. The performance and combustion characteristics of the engine at various loads are compared and analyzed. The results showed higher brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and lower brake thermal efficiency (BTE) for the KSOME blends. The engine indicated power (IP) was more for the blends up to B30, but found to be reduced for the blend B40 when compared to that of diesel. The engine combustion parameters such as pressure crank angle diagram, peak pressure, time of occurrence of peak pressure, net heat-release rate, cumulative heat release, ignition delay and combustion duration were computed. The KSOME blends exhibited similar combustion trend with diesel. However, the blends showed an early start of combustion with shorter ignition delay period. The study reveals the suitability of KSOME blends up to B30 as fuel for a diesel engine mainly used in generating sets and the agricultural applications in India without any significant drop in engine performance. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study is aimed at investigating the effect of injection system parameters such as injection pressure, injection timing and nozzle tip protrusion on the performance and emission characteristics of a twin cylinder water cooled naturally aspirated CIDI engine. Biodiesel, derived from pongamia seeds through transesterification process, blended with diesel was used as fuel in this work. The experiments were designed using a statistical tool known as Design of Experiments (DoE) based on response surface methodology (RSM). The resultant models of the response surface methodology were helpful to predict the response parameters such as Brake Specific Energy Consumption (BSEC), Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE), Carbon monoxide (CO), Hydrocarbon (HC), smoke opacity and Nitrogen Oxides (NO. x) and further to identify the significant interactions between the input factors on the responses. The results depicted that the BSEC, CO, HC and smoke opacity were lesser, and BTE and NO. x were higher at 2.5. mm nozzle tip protrusion, 225. bar of injection pressure and at 30°. BTDC of injection timing. Optimization of injection system parameters was performed using the desirability approach of the response surface methodology for better performance and lower NO. x emission. An injection pressure of 225. bar, injection timing of 21°. BTDC and 2.5. mm nozzle tip protrusion were found to be optimal values for the pongamia biodiesel blended diesel fuel operation in the test engine of 7.5. kW at 1500. rpm. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A nano-magnetic catalyst KF/CaO-Fe3O4 was prepared by a facile impregnation method. The magnetic property of the catalyst was studied by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The results demonstrated that the catalyst was ferromagnetic, and it could be recovered by magnetic separation. The nano-magnetic catalyst was also characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and BET surface area analyzer. It was found that the catalyst possessed a unique porous structure with an average particle diameter of ca. 50nm. Besides, the factors affecting biodiesel yield were investigated, and a desired fatty acid methyl esters yield over 95% was obtained under the optimal conditions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The finite nature of fossil fuels necessitates consideration of alternative fuels from renewable sources. The term biofuel refers to liquid, gas and solid fuels predominantly produced from biomass. Biofuels include bioethanol, biomethanol, biodiesel and biohydrogen. Biodiesel, defined as the monoalkyl esters of vegetable oils or animal fats, is an attractive alternative fuel because it is environmentally friendly and can be synthesized from edible and non-edible oils. Here, we review the various methods for the production of biodiesel from vegetable oil, such as direct use and blending, microemulsion, pyrolysis and transesterification. The advantages and disadvantages of the different biodiesel-production methods are also discussed. Finally, we analyze the economics of biodiesel production using Malaysia as a case study. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Among other biofuels, ethanol proves significant qualities that recommend it as an alternative fuel for classic thermal engines, thus offering opportunities of saving conventional petroleum fuels and diminishing the levels of the main exhaust emissions, especially CO, CO2 and hydrocarbons (HC). Ethanol could be generously obtained by applying technologies that transform biomass into sugar compounds and alcohol. Vegetal species like poplars, with a rapid growing cycle, offer the main source for obtaining wooden biomass, thus permitting ethanol production by industrial methods, such as enzymatic fermentation of the sugar compounds. The resulting product is tested as to the requested properties, for its further utilization as a fuel for Spark Ignition (SI) Engines. Therefore, regarding its octane number, caloric heat, lubrication capacity, etc., bioethanol shows good features to be used as a single fuel or in mixture with gasoline to supply SI Engines.

AB  - Biofuels could reduce reliance on fossil oil, while helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promoting rural development. This study assessed the viability of using local biodiesel production from sunflower in Tuscany (Italy) to meet inland demand for diesel fuel in compliance with the European Directives. A crop growth model, GIS and geostatistics were used to identify suitable areas for biodiesel production, considering potential sunflower yields alongside essential sustainability criteria: energy efficiency and greenhouse gas (GHG) savings throughout the supply chain. Simulation results indicate that biodiesel potential, estimated at 95,000 t/year, corresponds to 104,400 tCO2 eq/year of GHG saved and to 26,500 TOE/year of fossil energy saved. Two scenarios of biodiesel requirement, derived from EU targets, were evaluated. The results of the evaluation indicated that the 2010 target of replacing 5.75% of transportation diesel fuel can be met, while the 2020 target (reaching a 10% of replacement) cannot be met, since local biodiesel production could replace only 4.78% of diesel fuel requirement. A third scenario considered replacing diesel fuel currently used in the agricultural sector. Results showed that the fuel requirement of this sector cannot be fulfilled since biodiesel could cover only approximately 36% of the expected demand. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels world production has increased sharply in recent years. Oil reserves depletion, the oil high price and the confidence in biofuels "carbon neutrality" are the main causes of this phenomenon. However, claims related to the negative consequences of biofuel programs are frequent; mainly those related to the biofuels/food competition and sustainability. This paper aims to contribute for the development of a framework for sustainability indicators as a tool for performance assessment. The most used indicators to measure the biofuels sustainability are: Life Cycle Energy Balance (LCEB), quantity of fossil energy substituted per hectare, co-product energy allocation, life cycle carbon balance and changes in soil utilization. On the other hand, existing assessment tools, such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Integrated Environmental Assessment (IEA), are compared emphasizing their advantages and disadvantages. Main constraints related to the studied frontiers, as well as the lack of reliable data and their effects are also discussed. Discussions are held on the basis of real life cycle studies carried out by the authors about palm oil biodiesel and different alternatives for the stillage treatment and disposal. Finally, suggestions and recommendations are made to improve existing methodologies for biofuels sustainability evaluation, all this from a south perspective. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - European Union countries' current energy policies for the transport sector promote, amongst other initiatives; urban mobility plans, the renewal of fleets of cars and industrial vehicles and the introduction of biofuel. From the point of view of eco-efficiency and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), energy policies must go further. The objective of this paper is to analyse the current transport model and the policies on energy efficiency being promoted in the EU from a LCA point of view. Special attention has been paid to private vehicles, in assessing the environmental impact of the various stages of manufacture, their use and disposal, and the consequences of plans to renew fleets. How old should a vehicle ideally be so that when it is changed, the embodied energy in the materials of the vehicle is less than the gain in energy efficiency due to changing the model for example? In addition the paper analyses the different means of transport in the energy consumption-time ratio from a LCA viewpoint. The fact that reducing transport times leads to greater energy consumption gives rise to the question: how long does nature take to repair the environmental damage caused? © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the present study, rubber seed oil, coconut oil and palm kernel oil, which are locally available especially in Kerala (India), are chosen and their transesterification processes have been investigated. The various process variables like temperature, catalyst concentration, amount of methanol and reaction time were optimized. Biodiesel from rubber seed oil (with high free fatty acid) was produced by employing two-step pretreatment process (acid esterification) to reduce acid value from 48 to 1.72mg KOH/g with 0.40 and 0.35 v/v methanol-oil ratio and 1.0% v/v H2SO4 as catalyst at a temperature of 63(±2)°C with 1h reaction time followed by transesterification using methanol-oil ratio of 0.30 v/v, 0.5 w/v KOH as alkaline catalyst at 55(±2)°C with 40min reaction time to yield 98-99% biodiesel. Coconut oil and palm oil, being edible oils, transesterification with 0.25 v/v methanol-oil ratio, 0.50% w/v KOH as at 58(±2)°C, 20min reaction time for coconut oil and 0.25% v/v methanol-oil ratio, 0.50% w/v KOH as alkaline catalyst at 60(±2)°C for palm kernel oil will convert them to 98-99% biodiesel. The brake thermal efficiency of palm oil biodiesel was higher with lower brake specific fuel consumption, but rubber seed oil biodiesel(ROB) showed less emission (CO and NOx) compared to other biodiesels. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Chile depends on foreign sources for energy. A solution for this problem is needed to guarantee stability and economic development. Public policies have been proposed involving diversification of the power matrix with an increasing share for Non-conventional Renewable Energies (NCRE) from unconventional resources in the medium- and long-term. In this framework, new funding strategies are fundamental to encourage applied research in this field. Main research subjects are considered: survey, quantification and characterization of raw materials, introduction of energy crops and studies focused on transportation, management and conversion of lignocellulose for the second-generation biofuel industry. A recent regulatory framework allows the substitution of 2 or 5% of gasoline and diesel by ethanol and biodiesel, respectively; however, this is not mandatory because biofuel supply is still non-secured. On the other hand, the scenario for private initiatives focused on first-generation biofuels is not promising, and this may continue in time depending on the price of imported biofuels and local production costs. In 2015, production of second-generation biodiesel in Chile should be fundamentally based on forestry residues using Fischer-Tropsch processes. Local efforts consider biochemical transformation of lignocelluloses including agricultural wastes. Our group is focused on optimization of local second-generation bioethanol production; preliminary results are presented here. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper revisits the recent developments in biofuel markets and their economic, social and environmental impacts. Several countries have introduced mandates and targets for biofuel expansion. Production, international trade and investment have increased sharply in the last few years. However, some analysts linked biofuels to the 2007-2008 global food crisis. Existing studies diverge on the magnitude of the projected long-term impacts of biofuels on food prices and supply, with studies that model only the agricultural sector showing higher impacts and studies that model the entire economy showing relatively lower impacts. In terms of climate change mitigation, biofuels reduces GHG emissions only if GHG emissions related to land-use change are avoided. When biofuel production entails conversion of forest to cropland, net reduction of GHG would not be realized for many years. Existing literature does not favor the diversion of food for large-scale biofuels production, but the regulated expansion of biofuels in countries with surplus lands and a strong biofuel industry cannot be ruled out. Developments in non-food based or cellulosic (or second generation) biofuels may offer some hope, yet they still compete with food supply through land use and are currently constrained by a number of technical and economic barriers. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Brazil is experiencing a surge in planting of sugar cane crops driven by internal markets and external policy drivers for biofuels. The current expectation is for the expansion of these crops to continue. This creates concern over the extent to which the full implications of large scale land use change are currently being considered by decision-makers. Using the State of São Paulo as a case study (as it accounts for the majority of sugar cane grown in Brazil), a comparison was made of the impacts identified in Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) and Preliminary Environmental Reports (PERs), which have to be submitted for approval of most new sugar cane activities, with significant impacts known to be associated with sugar cane activities derived from literature review. The results from a review of 32 EISs and PERs (30% of the population) indicated that whilst some impacts were well covered by the sample (water and soil pollution, and air emissions) energy balance and Green House Gas emissions and food security had very limited consideration, and water resources, residues, labour conditions and social responsibility were only partially covered. Environmental Impact Assessment is constrained by its environmental advocacy role and its application to the project level only. This study highlights its limitations in the context of assessment of land use change which demands more strategic consideration. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In the present work the production of biodiesel using bitter almond oil (BAO) in a potassium hydroxide catalyzed transesterification reaction was investigated. The BAO was obtained from resources available in Iran and its physical and chemical properties including iodine value, acid value, density, kinematic viscosity, fatty acid composition and mean molecular weight were specified. The low acid value of BAO (0.24. mg. KOH/g) indicated that the pretreatment of raw oil with acid was not required. The fatty acid content analysis confirmed that the contribution of unsaturated fatty acids in the BAO is high (84.7. wt.%). Effect of different parameters including methanol to oil molar ratio (3-11. mol/mol), potassium hydroxide concentration (0.1-1.7% w/w) and reaction temperature (30-70 °C) on the production of biodiesel were investigated. The results indicated that these parameters were important factors affecting the tranesterification reaction. The fuel properties of biodiesel including iodine value, acid value, density, kinematic viscosity, saponification value, cetane number, flash point, cloud point, pour point and distillation characteristics were measured. The properties were compared with those of petroleum diesel, EN 14214 and ASTM 6751 biodiesel standards and an acceptable agreement was observed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Due to the increasing demand for fossil fuels and environmental threat due to pollution a number renewable sources of energy have been studied worldwide. In the present investigation influence of injection timing on the performance and emissions of a single cylinder, four stroke stationary, variable compression ratio, diesel engine was studied using waste cooking oil (WCO) as the biodiesel blended with diesel. The tests were performed at three different injection timings (24°, 27°, 30° CA BTDC) by changing the thickness of the advance shim. The experimental results showed that brake thermal efficiency for the advanced as well as the retarded injection timing was lesser than that for the normal injection timing (27° BTDC) for all sets of compression ratios. Smoke, un-burnt hydrocarbon (UBHC) emissions were reduced for advanced injection timings where as NOx emissions increased. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) was used to predict the engine performance and emission characteristics of the engine. Separate models were developed for performance parameters as well as emission characteristics. To train the network, compression ratio, injection timing, blend percentage, percentage load, were used as the input parameters where as engine performance parameters like brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake specific energy consumption (BSEC), exhaust gas temperature (Texh) were used as the output parameters for the performance model and engine exhaust emissions such as NOx, smoke and (UBHC) values were used as the output parameters for the emission model. ANN results showed that there is a good correlation between the ANN predicted values and the experimental values for various engine performance parameters and exhaust emission characteristics and the relative mean error values (MRE) were within 8%, which is acceptable. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Dual-injection strategies in spark-ignition engines allow the in-cylinder blending of two different fuels at any blend ratio, when simultaneously combining port fuel injection (PFI) and direct-injection (DI). Either fuel can be used as the main fuel, depending on the engine demand and the fuel availability. This paper presents the preliminary investigation of such a flexible, bi-fuel concept using a single cylinder spark-ignition research engine. Gasoline has been used as the PFI fuel, while various mass fractions of gasoline, ethanol and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) have been used in DI. The control of the excess air ratio during the in-cylinder mixing of two different fuels was realized using the cross-over theory of the carbon monoxide and oxygen emissions concentrations. The dual-injection results showed how the volumetric air flow rate, total input energy and indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) increases with deceasing PFI mass fraction, regardless of the DI fuel. The indicated efficiency increases when using any ethanol fraction in DI and results in higher combustion and fuel conversion efficiencies compared to gasoline. Increasing the DMF mass fraction in DI reduces the combustion duration more significantly than with increased fractions of ethanol or gasoline in DI. The hydrocarbon (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions mostly reduce when using any gasoline or ethanol fraction in DI. When using DMF, the HC emissions reduce, but the NOx and CO2 emissions increase. © 2011.

AB  - Disposal of waste palm cooking oil (WPCO) via an environmental-friendly route is of major importance in the quest for sustainable development. In this study, WPCO was utilized instead of refined vegetable oils as the source of triglycerides for biodiesel production. WPCO contains several impurities, such as water and free fatty acids, which limit its application in catalytic transesterification processes. Consequently, a catalyst-free process using supercritical methanol was employed to investigate the potential of WPCO as an economical feedstock for biodiesel production. The parameters that influence the reaction, including reaction time, temperature and the molar ratio of alcohol to oil, were investigated. For comparison purposes, refined palm oil (RPO) was also subjected to supercritical methanol reaction and it was found that both processes produced comparable optimum yields of 80% at their respective optimum conditions. Hence, it can be concluded that WPCO has high potential as an economical and practical future source of biodiesel. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate and select lineages of early soybeans on the yield potentialand oil content for the production of biodiesel and correlate the nuclear magnetic resonance and Soxhlet methods in the analysis of oil content. Among the different sources of biomass, vegetal oils are a potential source of renewable resource for fuel production, turning into a viable alternative compared to diesel. It was evaluated 19 early maturity lineages in randomized blocks with 3 replicates and compared with 5 cultivars. The performance of each lineage was assessed by measurement of the following features: number of days to flowering (NDF), number of days to maturity (NDM), plant height (cm) at flowering (APF), plant height (cm) at maturity (APM), height of insertion of first pod (AIV), lodging (AC),oil content in grain expressed in percentage (%OL), grain yield (PG) and oil content yield (PO). From the levels obtained by two methods of extracting of oil it was done the analysis of correlation. The results showed the superiority of lineage UFU-106 on the yield and productivity of oil. Although the oil content of lineage UFU-101 has been high, the yield of this genotype was below the desirable performance. Concerning to the methods of extraction of oil, the results showed an egative correlation coefficient, indicating that there was no correlation between the two methods.

AB  - The study evaluates the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of biodiesel production through three chosen land use change scenarios in Thailand: rubber plantation to oil palm plantation in Krabi, cassava plantation to oil palm plantation in Chonburi, and abandoned land to oil palm plantation in Pathumthani. The carbon stock changes were estimated based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and combined with the life cycle GHG emissions from palm oil and biodiesel production in Thailand. For 1 million liters of biodiesel production per day, the Krabi, Chonburi and Pathumthani cases resulted in -709 Mg CO2-eq/day, -748 Mg CO2-eq/day and -600 Mg CO2-eq/day, respectively. The Pathumthani case showed the lowest negative GHG balance even with least fertilization partly because of larger transportation distances while the Chonburi case was the highest despite low yield as it would require more land to grow oil palm for the same amount of biodiesel, resulting in more soil carbon being sequestered. However, the land use change scenarios chosen for this study all show a negative GHG balance which means that biodiesel helps reduce GHG in the atmosphere. © 2010 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - Experiments were conducted on a single cylinder direct injection diesel engine using diesel, biodiesel and biodiesel-diesel-ethanol (diestrol) water micro emulsion fuels to investigate the performance, emission and combustion characteristics of the engine under different load conditions at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. The results indicated that biodiesel and micro emulsion fuels had a higher brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) than that of diesel. A slight improvement in the brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) was observed for micro emulsion fuels. The brake thermal efficiency of biodiesel and micro emulsion fuels were comparable to that of diesel. The emission characteristics like carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), unburnt hydrocarbon (UHC), nitric oxide (NO) and smoke emissions for biodiesel and micro emulsion fuels were lower than diesel fuel at all load conditions. The cylinder gas pressure of micro emulsion fuels was lower than diesel at low loads but it became almost identical to diesel at medium and full load conditions. The heat release rate for micro emulsion fuels was higher than biodiesel and diesel fuels for all loads. Biodiesel showed shorter ignition delay for the entire load range and the longer ignition delay observed for micro emulsion fuels. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel, as an alternative fuel, is gradually receiving more popularity for use in internal combustion engines. However questions continue to arise with regard to its compatibility with elastomeric materials. The present work aims to investigate the comparative degradation of physical properties for different elastomers [e.g. ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM), silicone rubber (SR), polychloroprene (CR), polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE) and nitrile rubber (NBR)] upon exposure to diesel and palm biodiesel. Static immersion tests in B0(diesel), B10 (10% biodiesel in diesel), B20, B50 and B100(biodiesel) were carried out at room temperature (25 °C) for 1000 h. Different physical properties like, changes in weight and volume, hardness and tensile strength were measured at every 250 h of immersion time. Compositional changes in biodiesel due to exposure of different elastomers were investigated by Gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GCMS). The overall sequence of compatible elastomers in palm biodiesel is found to be PTFE > SR > NBR > EPDM > CR. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Palm oil (PO) was treated using different methods in order to use and test it as fuel in Compression Ignition (CI) engines. The treatments include PO preheated and preparation of PO/diesel oil blends, using mixtures of PO with waste cooking oil (WCO), which are converted into esters by a transesterification process. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of the palm oil-based biofuels to replace diesel oil in CI engines. Tests were conducted in a single cylinder, four-stroke, air-cooled, direct injection diesel engine (no engine modifications were required). Experiments were initially carried out with diesel oil for providing baseline data. All the tested fuels have a low heating value compared to diesel fuel. A high fraction of PO in diesel fuel decreases the heating value of the blend. The brake thermal efficiency increases for the PO/Diesel blends. HC emissions for all those fuels except for the PO/Diesel blends are found lower, while CO emissions rise for all types of fuels. NOx emissions are higher at low load, but lower at full load, for the engine fueled with PO and lower both at middle and full load for the engine fueled with the esters. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An experimental study has been carried to use raw Algae oil and its methyl esters in an indirect injection diesel engine. Effects of engine speed, engine load output, injection timing of the algae biofuel and engine compression ratio on the engine output torque, combustion noise (maximum pressure rise rate), maximum pressure and maximum heat release rate have been studied. Raw oil extracted from microalgae and two versions of its methyl ester (0.1 and 0.2 methyl ester versions) have been evaluated in a Ricardo E6 engine. It has been shown that the algae oil methyl ester's properties are similar to diesel fuel and its use has been successful in running the diesel engine smoothly. However, its use reduced the engine output torque slightly and increased the combustion noise. The engine output can be increased and the combustion noise can be reduced by controlling the engine design parameters e.g. injection timing and compression ratio. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. produces seed oil that is viewed as having tremendous potential as an economical alternative for diesel fuel. Seed yield, the main factor determining jatropha oil production, is highly associated with flower development, especially with the number of female flowers. However, little was known regarding floral development in this species. Accordingly, studies were undertaken to develop more information on the developmental process of floral organs. The early floral development was divided into 12 phases. The present study illustrated that, the sex differentiation of male or female flowers occurred in phase-VII; earlier phases presented unapparent structural differences. The male flowers always had unisexual tissues during floral development. In contrast, early development of female flowers presented bisexual tissues, with male sexual degradation occurring at the later developmental phases. There was significant location specificity with respect to the inflorescence of male and female flowers. Based on this, the present study combined the total number of female flowers, and divided the inflorescence into three types, which had significant differences in the number of female flowers; they likewise presented different probabilities of occurrence in terms of different growing seasons. © 2011 Academic Journals.

AB  - This work presents the physical-chemical properties of fuel blends of waste cooking oil biodiesel or castor oil biodiesel with diesel oil. The properties evaluated were fuel density, kinematic viscosity, cetane index, distillation temperatures, and sulfur content, measured according to standard test methods. The results were analyzed based on present specifications for biodiesel fuel in Brazil, Europe, and USA. Fuel density and viscosity were increased with increasing biodiesel concentration, while fuel sulfur content was reduced. Cetane index is decreased with high biodiesel content in diesel oil. The biodiesel blends distillation temperatures T10 and T50 are higher than those of diesel oil, while the distillation temperature T 90 is lower. A brief discussion on the possible effects of fuel property variation with biodiesel concentration on engine performance and exhaust emissions is presented. The maximum biodiesel concentration in diesel oil that meets the required characteristics for internal combustion engine application is evaluated, based on the results obtained. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - An investigation to determine the dominant route of NOx formation in biofuel flames and to confirm the relationship of the NO x increase with iodine numbers in fuels has been presented. This is done through the measurement of the concentration of OH and CH radicals, indicators of the formation of NOx through the Zeldovich and Fenimore mechanisms. A laminar partially pre-mixed flame at an initial fuel equivalence ratio (φ) = 7 was used to minimize the effects of fluid mechanics and isolate the effects of fuel chemistry. Three biofuels, with different iodine numbers, were studied: soy methyl ester (SME), canola methyl ester (CME) and methyl stearate (MS). Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) images of hydroxyl radicals (OH) and CH radicals were captured with a diagnostic system consisting of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser and an Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) with frequency doubler option (FDO) using proper wavelengths. It was found that the population of OH radicals was low in the flames of all fuels, but significant CH radical concentrations were detected in all the flames, with the maximum population occurring in the SME fuel flame. The presence of high concentrations of CH measured in the regions of peak NOx indicate that NOx formation is primarily through the Fenimore mechanism, rather than the thermal mechanism, at this fuel-rich condition. Moreover, the fuel with highest iodine number, SME, produced significantly more NOx because of its tendency to facilitate the production of more soot, C, and CH radicals.

AB  - Logistics management is one of the key hurdles for using corn stover as a feedstock for ethanol production. This article presents a model and its application to compare the costs and CO 2 emissions of three corn stover transportation options in the state of Minnesota: truck, rail, and pipeline systems. The corn stover production potential for 53 corn-producing counties in Minnesota is mapped, and potential corn stover storage facilities are located along the railroad system based on regional corn stover production potential. An optimization model was constructed and populated to minimize transportation needs between the storage locations and potential conversion facilities. Because feedstock transportation distance and associated CO 2 emissions depend on the number of biorefineries, we varied the number from 1 to 215 and identified optimal locations sequentially at the minimum transportation distance between storage locations and a given number of biorefineries. Using the minimum-distance biorefinery locations identified for each given number of biorefineries, the CO 2 emissions associated with corn stover transportation and the total costs were calculated. The results show that pipeline transportation provides the least-cost option, while rail transportation provides the least-CO 2 emissions option. In addition, optimal plant capacity was calculated to be about 450 million liters per year (MLY) regardless of the transportation option, so that five becomes the ideal number of biorefineries in Minnesota. Sensitivity analysis on the major assumptions and parameters was performed, and its implications in interpreting the results are discussed. © 2011 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - The recent decline in Ontario's forest sector has resulted in the idling or closure of many mills, creating an opportunity for forest-derived bioenergy supported by the Ontario Green Energy and Green Economy Act. Combined heat and power production from forest biomass seems to provide an optimal balance between energy supplied and employment opportunities. This option could provide Ontario with 5.3% of electricity and 1.5% of heat energy needs. The province could sustainably support up to 12 60-MW installations. Five key recommendations are advanced, including the need for a bioenergy strategy within the province, options for developing funding for this sector, and the possibility of creating a bioenergy network using existing research assets within Ontario.

AB  - To establish a facile and feasible method to evaluate and control the quality of Jatropha curcus L. seed oil for biodiesel feedstock, Gas chromatographic (GC) fingerprint technology was introduced and employed. Initially, the chromatograms of the 13 oil samples from various plantation zones in Guizhou, China were obtained under optimized GC conditions. Ten common peaks were selected as the characteristic peaks for chemometrics, seven of which were identified and quantified by comparing with the standards. The mean chromatogram of S7 (n= 3) was selected as the reference spectrum for similarity analysis based on the influence of the fatty acid composition of the raw material on the fuel properties of resulting biodiesel. Furthermore, the result of SA was confirmed by hierarchical clustering analysis and principal component analysis. By this method, all samples can be classified into three groups. The similarity value of samples approaching 1.000 compared with sample 7 was indicative of the desired fuel properties of biodiesel, indicating the potential practical applications in the quality evaluation and control of biodiesel feedstock. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is biodegradable, non-toxic and has the capacity for sustainable development, energy conservation and environmental preservation. Apart from yielding high value latex, the rubber plant supply large amount of rubber seed, which are currently underutilized. Extracting biodiesel from rubber seed is a viable option which demands attention for research to consolidate and optimize the process parameters. Design of experiments (DOE) is a powerful statistical approach which is used for optimizing the process parameters through two stage esterification process, relating acid and alkaline as catalyst. Reducing the acid value is the primary objective for process optimization in acid esterification process, whereas, maximizing the monoester yield is the objective for the alkaline-esterification process. Different saturated and unsaturated monoesters present in the biodiesel were quantified using gas chromatograph in order to determine the yield percentage, which ensures the quality of the biodiesel. The fuel was tested for properties such as viscosity, calorific value and carbon residue using standard test procedures and found to be analogous with diesel, which makes it possible to use this alternate fuel in the existing engine without any modification. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters, FAME) was prepared by transesterification of the mixed oil (soybean oil and rapeseed oil) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as catalyst. The effects of mole ratio of methanol to oil, reaction temperature, catalyst amount and reaction time on the yield were studied. In order to decrease the operational temperature, a co-solvent (hexane) was added into the reactants and the conversion efficiency of the reaction was improved. The optimal reaction conditions were obtained by this experiment: methanol/oil mole ratio 5.0:1, reaction temperature 55 °C, catalyst amount 0.8. wt.% and reaction time 2.0. h. Under the optimum conditions, a 94% yield of methyl esters was reached ∼94%. The structure of the biodiesel was characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy. The sulfur content of biodiesel was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma emission spectrometer (ICP), and the satisfied result was obtained. The properties of obtained biodiesel from mixed oil are close to commercial diesel fuel and is rated as a realistic fuel as an alternative to diesel. Production of biodiesel has positive impact on the utilization of agricultural and forestry products. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper considers biodiesel production from residues; tallow and used cooking oil (UCO). The tallow system is more complex involving two processes. The first process is rendering in which tallow (animal fat) and Meat and Bone Meal (MBM) are produced from the slaughter of cattle. MBM is assumed as a thermal energy source for cement manufacture and thus is not used for biodiesel production. The second process is biodiesel production from tallow. Three methodologies are employed to examine sustainability of the biodiesel. The no allocation approach assigns all the parasitic demands to the tallow; thus all energies required to make both MBM and tallow are associated with the tallow biodiesel. The resulting energy balance is negative. The substitution approach allocates the energy in MBM (used to produce cement) to tallow biodiesel. This results in the net energy being greater than the gross energy. The allocation by energy content method divides the parasitic demands of the rendering process between tallow and MBM by energy content. The parasitic demands of the biodiesel process are divided by energy content of the biodiesel, glycerol and K-fertiliser. For tallow biodiesel this yielded a net energy value of 38.6% of gross energy. The same method generated a net energy value of 67% for UCO biodiesel. More importantly the recommended method (allocation by energy content) generated a value of 54% greenhouse gas (GHG) emission savings for tallow and a value of 69% for UCO. Plants commencing after 2017, need to have a 60% GHG emission savings, to be considered sustainable. Thus a facility treating both feedstocks would need to treat a maximum of 60% tallow to be considered sustainable after 2017. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative fuel for conventional diesel that is made from natural plant oils, animal fats, and waste cooking oils. This paper discusses the economics of producing biodiesel fuel from algae grown in open ponds. There is potential for large-scale production of biodiesel from algal farms on non-arable land; however, previous studies have failed to demonstrate an economically viable process that could be scalable to a commercialized industry. The problems include inconsistent and insufficient algal productivities, uncertain capital and operating costs, volatile market prices and unknown levels of government support. Although intensive work is being done on many technological issues, the economic studies and data are incomplete and out of date. This paper presents an updated financial analysis of the production and economic conditions that could have a profound effect on the success of this important alternative fuel production process. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fifteen eukaryotic microorganisms were tested for their ability to assimilate biodiesel derived waste glycerol and convert it into value-added metabolic products. For this purpose yeast and Zygomycetes strains were cultivated in nitrogen-limited raw glycerol-based media (initial glycerol concentration 30 g/L). Yeasts tested accumulated restricted lipid quantities (up to ~22%, wt/wt, in the case of Rhodotorula sp), while differentiations in their fatty acid composition were recorded in relation to the yeast strains employed and the fermentation time. On the contrary, fungi accumulated higher quantities of lipid inside their mycelia (ranging between 18.1 and 42.6%, wt/wt, of dry biomass) that contained in variable amounts the medically important GLA (γ-linolenic acid). Moreover, Yarrowia lipolytica, Pichia membranifaciens and Thamnidium elegans were further studied in media having increased initial glycerol concentrations. In these conditions Y. lipolytica secreted significant amounts of acetic acid (29.2 g/L), as well as mannitol (19.4 g/L) while P. membranifaciens reached 28.4 g/L of biomass at glycerol concentration 90 g/L. T. elegans produced 11.6 g/L of oil, with 71.1%, wt/wt, of fat in biomass, while the maximum concentration of GLA was 371 mg/L. Detailed analysis of T. elegans lipids indicated that the phospholipids fraction was particularly rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper discusses the influence of biodiesel on the engine combustion characteristics. The considered fuel is neat biodiesel from rapeseed oil. The considered engine is a bus diesel engine with injection M system. The engine characteristics are obtained by experiments and numerical simulation. The results obtained with biodiesel are compared to those obtained with mineral diesel under various operating regimes. In this way, the influences of biodiesel usage on the injection pressure, injection timing, ignition delay, in-cylinder gas pressure and temperature, heat release rate, exhaust gas temperatures, harmful emissions, specific fuel consumption, and on engine power are analyzed. Furthermore, the relationships among fuel properties, injection and combustion characteristics, harmful emissions, and other engine performance are determined. Special attention is given to possible explanations of higher NO. x emission in spite of lower in-cylinder gas temperature. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study investigates the fabrication and use of electroless-deposited nickel alloys, containing phosphorus and tungsten, as potential coating materials that effectively protect steel-based biodiesel containers from corrosion. Through long-term static immersion and high-temperature oxidation tests, coupled with surface analyses of the coatings and assessments of the biodiesel's acidity and storage stability, it is determined that a nickel coating with 15 wt% of phosphorus is favorably compatible with biodiesel, both in terms of corrosion protection and fuel stability. © 2010 ACA and OCCA.

AB  - In this work, an attempt has been made to characterize, isolate and elucidate the structure of unusual fatty acid in the seed oil of Aegle marmelos Corre. Further, this nonedible seed oil is screened for its bio-diesel or industrial feedstock property. The Aegle marmelos Corre seeds yielded 49.0% oil. The seed oil contains 12.5% of 12-hydroxyoctadec-cis-9-enoic acid (ricinoleic acid) along with other normal fatty acids. The identification and characterization was supported by FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MS, GC analysis and chemical degradation technique. A good agreement is seen between the calculated and experimental results of iodine value (IV) and saponification value (SV). The prominent parameters of bio-diesel such as cetane number (CN), lower heating value (LHV) and higher heating value (HHV) are deployed to envisage the quality of oil for use as bio-diesel. This seed oil is nonedible and is found to be the alternative feed stock for the production of bio-diesel since it convenes the major specifications of bio-diesel. The bio-diesel property of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) of this seed oil is compared with other bio-diesels. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, hydrotalcite-derived particles with Mg/Al molar ratio of 3/1 were synthesized by a coprecipitation method using urea as precipitating agent, subsequently with (MHT) microwave-hydrothermal treatment, and followed by calcination at 773 K for 6 h. These particles were micro-sized mixed Mg/Al oxides as characterized by SEM and AFM. But actually they were nanosized according to the calculations from XRD data. Because of their strong basicity, the nanoparticles were further used as catalyst for biodiesel production from Jatropha oil after pretreatment. Experiments were conducted with the solid basic catalyst in an ultrasonic reactor under different conditions. At the optimized condition, biodiesel yield of 95.2% was achieved, and the biodiesel properties were close to those of the German standard. The catalyst can be reused for 8 times. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There has been an increasing interest in the commercial production of physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.) due to the recent Brazilian Program of Biofuel Production. Information on this crop is still scarce and more research is necessary to set the grounds of crop adaptability in different local conditions. An experiment was set up on this issue under greenhouse environment. Growth and quality of physic nut seedlings was monitored up to transplanting time. The influence of types and volumes of seedling containers was analysed along with different substrates and fertilization strategies. The water use was also detailed in the trial. Results showed the best achievements of growth rate and seedling quality, at appropriate transplanting time, were reached from the combination of the commercial substrate, largest containers and fertilizers of slow nutrient liberation.

AB  - This paper investigates the potential futures for alternative-fuel vehicles in Denmark, where the vehicle registration tax is very high and large tax rebates can be given. A large stated choice dataset has been collected concerning vehicle choice among conventional, hydrogen, hybrid, bio-diesel, and electric vehicles. We estimate a mixed logit model that improves on previous contributions by controlling for reference dependence and allowing for correlation of random effects. Both improvements are found to be important. An application of the model shows that alternative-fuel vehicles with present technology could obtain fairly high market shares given tax regulations possible in the present high-tax vehicle market. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - During the production of biodiesel, a significant amount of glycerol is generated which currently has little commercial value. A study on the growth and lipid production of Chlorella protothecoides using glycerol as the carbon source was performed to demonstrate the utility of recycling crude glycerol created during biodiesel production. Glycerol was examined as both the sole carbon source and in combination with glucose. Algae cultures grown on only glycerol in shake flasks showed a specific growth rate and final lipid yield of 0.1/h and 0.31 g lipid/g substrate, respectively. The values were similar to those observed on pure glucose, 0.096/h and 0.24 g lipid/g substrate. When the media contained a mixture of glycerol and glucose, simultaneous uptake of the two substrates was observed. Due to the difference in rates of lipid storage, lipid production was 0.077 g lipid/(l h) during growth on glycerol, while growth on glucose had a productivity of 0.096 g lipid/(l h). During growth on the 9:1 mixture of both glucose and glycerol, lipid productivity was 0.098 g lipid/(l h). In order to simulate the use of waste glycerol from biodiesel production the experiments were repeated and similar growth rates, yields, and lipid productivities were achieved. Therefore, we have demonstrated the promise for simultaneous high growth rates and lipid yields of C. protothecoides heterotrophically grown on mixtures of glycerol. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - A mixed integer programming model was developed to estimate the delivered cost of woody biomass, including the costs associated with stumpage, bundling (if any), extraction, storage, loading and hauling, and chipping-grinding under different woody biomass handling systems. The model was designed to optimize a woody biomass based biofuel facility's location with the objective of minimizing the total annual delivered cost of woody biomass under resource and operational constraints. The model was applied in the central Appalachian region within the state of West Virginia. Results showed that the optimal plant location would be at Addison or Grantsville in West Virginia, depending on the system used when daily demand is 900 tonnes of dry woody biomass. For that base-case scenario, the average delivered cost ranged from $2.30 GJ-1 to $3.02 GJ-1 across the systems. Extensive sensitivity analysis was performed under different scenarios, including biomass availability and purchase-stumpage price, demand, extraction distance, and fuel pricing. The delivered cost was mostly affected by woody biomass demand. Skidding distance had the least impact on the delivered cost. The results would be useful in facilitating the research and economic development of woody biomass utilization for bioenergy in the region.

AB  - Biodiesel production is worthy of continued study and optimization of production procedures due to its environmentally beneficial attributes and its renewable nature. Heterogeneous transesterification is considered to be a green process. The process requires neither catalyst recovery nor aqueous treatment steps and very high yields of methyl esters can be obtained, close to the theoretical value. However, heterogeneously catalyzed transesterification generally requires more severe operating conditions, and the performance of heterogeneous catalysts is generally lower than that of the commonly used homogeneous catalysts. Heterogeneous catalysis for biodiesel production has been extensively investigated in the last few years. Many metal oxides have been studied for the transesterification process of oils; these include alkali earth metal oxides, transition metal oxides, mixed metal oxides and supported metal oxides. The use of solid metal oxides as catalysts in oil transesterification is well established, accordingly, researchers' attempts are now focused on how to attain the highest catalyst activity. Catalyst activity is a function of its specific surface area, base strength and base site concentration. High specific surface area, strong base strength and high concentration of base sites are characteristics of an active transesterification catalyst. This review provides a brief overview of the different metal oxides frequently used in the process of transesterification of oils for the production of biodiesel with special reference to the various methods of catalyst preparation and catalyst characterization. Reaction conditions and catalyst leaching analysis are also highlighted. Finally, concluding remarks regarding catalyst selection and catalyst preparation steps are provided. © IRSEN, CEERS,IAU.

AB  - Recently, decreasing of fossil fuel reserves and their negative effect on environment have increased the interest in alternative energy sources. One of the alternative energy sources is vegetable oils. In this study, blends of 50 % opium poppy oil 50 % diesel fuel mixture are tested as alternative fuel on a single cylinder, 4-stroke, air cooled, pre-combustion chamber diesel engine at different speeds and its effects on engine performance and emissions are investigated. When compared to the diesel fuel as average, engine torque and power decrease at 4 % and 5.73 %, respectively. Specific fuel consumption increases by using of 50% opium poppy oil 50 % diesel fuel mixture. When compared to the diesel fuel as average, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides emissions of 50 % opium poppy oil 50 % diesel fuel mixture decrease to 15.5 % and 5.9 %, respectively. Diesel fuel opium poppy oil mixture has been found notably successful and environment friendly as an alternative fuel for diesel engines. © IRSEN, CEERS, IAU.

AB  - In the present work, a thermophilic esterase from Thermus thermophilus HB27 was cloned into Kluyveromyces marxianus and into Kluyveromyces lactis using two different expression systems, yielding four recombinant strains. K. lactis showed the highest esterase expression levels (294 units per gram dry cell weight, with 65% of cell-bound enzyme) using an episomal system with the PGK promoter and terminator from Saccharomyces cerevisiae combined with the K. lactis k1 secretion signal. K. marxianus showed higher secretion efficiency of the heterologous esterase (56.9 units per gram dry cell weight, with 34% of cell-bound enzyme) than K. lactis. Hydrolytic activities for the heterologous esterases were maximum at pH values between 8.0 and 9.0 for both yeast species and at temperatures of 50 °C and 45 °C for K. marxianus and K. lactis, respectively. When compared to previously published data on this same esterase produced in the original host or in S. cerevisiae, our results indicate that Kluyveromyces yeasts can be considered good hosts for the heterologous secretion of thermophilic esterases, which have a potential application in biodiesel production or in resolving racemates. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Concerns about diminishing fossil fuel reserves along with global warming effects caused by increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are driving society toward the search for new renewable sources of energy that can substitute for coal, natural gas and petroleum in the current energy system. Lignocellulosic biomass is abundant, and it has the potential to significantly displace petroleum in the production of fuels for the transportation sector. Ethanol, the main biomass-derived fuel used today, has benefited from production by a well-established technology and by partial compatibility with the current transportation infrastructure, leading to the domination of the world biofuel market. However, ethanol suffers from important limitations as a fuel (e.g., low energy density, high solubility in water) than can be overcome by designing strategies to convert non-edible lignocellulosic biomass into liquid hydrocarbon fuels (LHF) chemically similar to those currently used in internal combustion engines. The present review describes the main routes available to carry out such deep chemical transformation (e.g., gasification, pyrolysis, and aqueous-phase catalytic processing), with particular emphasis on those pathways involving aqueous-phase catalytic reactions. These latter catalytic routes achieve the required transformations in biomass-derived molecules with controlled chemistry and high yields, but require pretreatment/hydrolysis steps to overcome the recalcitrance of lignocellulose. To be economically viable, these aqueous-phase routes should be carried out with a small number of reactors and with minimum utilization of external fossil fuel-based hydrogen sources, as illustrated in the examples presented here. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Biofuel has so far been backed by government policies in the quest for low carbon fuel in the near future and promises to ensure energy security through partially replacing fossil fuels. At present biodiesel is mostly produced by transesterification reaction from oil-seed feedstock and has to conform to ASTM D6751 specifications. Biodiesel sustainability has sparked debate on the pros and cons of biodiesel and the question of food security. The use of waste cooking oil such as palm and coconut oil in diesel engines is more sustainable if they can perform similarly to ordinary diesel fuel (B0). This paper presents the experimental study carried out to evaluate emission and performance characteristics of a multi-cylinder diesel engine operating on waste cooking oil such as 5% palm oil with 95% ordinary diesel fuel (P5) and 5% coconut oil with 95% ordinary diesel fuel (C5). B0 was used for comparison purposes. The results show that there are reductions in brake power of 1.2% and 0.7% for P5 and C5 respectively compared with B0. In addition, reduction of exhaust emissions such as unburned hydrocarbon (HC), smoke, carbon mono-oxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) is offered by the blended fuels. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the present study, copper vanadium phosphate (CuVOP) with three-dimensional network structure was synthesized by hydrothermal method, and was characterized by Infrared spectrum (IR), elemental analysis (EA), EDXRF (energy dispersive X ray fluorescence) etc. Moreover, soybean oil was used as feedstock for producing biodiesel, and biodiesel was produced by CuVOP-catalyzed transesterification process. Response surface methodology was employed to statistically evaluate and optimize the conditions for the maximum conversion to biodiesel, and the effects of amount of catalyst, ratio of methanol to oil, reaction time and reaction temperature were investigated by the 24 full-factorial central composite design. The maximum conversion is obtained at amount of catalyst of 1.5%, methanol/oil molar ratio of 6.75, reaction temperature of 65 °C and reaction time of 5 h. Copper vanadium phosphate CuVOP resulted very active in the transesterification reaction for biodiesel production. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of various synthetic phenolic antioxidants on the oxidation stability of biodiesel blends with the employment of the modified Rancimat method. The experimental results revealed that an improvement in oxidation stability could be achieved with all antioxidants tested. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisol (BHA) displayed the lowest effectiveness in neat biodiesel, whereas their use in biodiesel blends showed a greater stabilizing potential. Propyl gallate (PG) and pyrogallol (PA) additives showed the strongest effectiveness in both the neat biodiesel and the biodiesel blends. During a naturally ageing process of the biodiesel blends which was conducted for a period of 10 weeks, samples were taken every 2 weeks to measure the oxidation stability, kinematic viscosity and acid value. This process was designed in such manner to simulate the ageing of an automotive biofuel stored in the fuel tank of a vehicle. The results showed a sharp decrease in fuel stability over time. Although limited effects were observed in viscosity, the acid value was significantly increased over time. The addition of antioxidants resulted in some increases in viscosity and acid value of the biodiesel blends. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel as an eco-friendly fuel is gaining much acceptance in recent years. This communication provides an overview on the possibility of using mixed microalgae existing in ecological water-bodies for harnessing biodiesel. Microalgal cultures from five water-bodies are cultivated in domestic wastewater in open-ponds and the harvested algal-biomass was processed through acid-catalyzed transesterification. Experiments evidenced the potential of using mixed microalgae for harnessing biodiesel. Presence of palmitic acid (C16:0) in higher fraction and physical properties of algal oil correlated well with the biodiesel properties. Functional characteristics of water-bodies showed to influence both species diversity and lipid accumulation. Microalgae from stagnant water-bodies receiving domestic discharges documented higher lipid accumulation. Algal-oil showed to consist 33 types of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids having wide food and fuel characteristics. Simultaneous wastewater treatment was also noticed due to the syntrophic association in the water-body microenvironment. Diversity studies visualized the composition of algae species known to accumulate higher lipids. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work offers an optimized method in the transesterification of pristine (soybean) oil and cooked oil to bio-diesel, based on microwave dielectric irradiation as a driving force for the transesterification reaction and SrO as a catalyst. This combination has demonstrated excellent catalytic activity and stability. The transesterification was carried out with and without stirring. According to 1H NMR spectroscopy and TLC results, this combination accelerates the reaction (to less than 60s), maintaining a very high conversion (99%) and high efficiency. The catalytic activity of SrO under atmospheric pressure in the presence of air and under the argon atmosphere is demonstrated. The optimum conversion of cooked oil (99.8%) is achieved under MW irradiation of 1100W output with magnetic stirring after only 10s. The optimum method decreases the cost of bio-diesel production and has the potential for industrial application in the transesterification of cooked oil to bio-diesel. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Reactive separations using green catalysts offer great opportunities for manufacturing fatty esters, involved in specialty chemicals and biodiesel production. Integrating reaction and separation into one unit provides key benefits such as: simplified operation, no waste, reduced capital investment and low operating costs. This work presents a novel heat-integrated reactive absorption process that eliminates all conventional catalyst related operations, efficiently uses the raw materials and equipment, and considerably reduces the energy requirements for biodiesel production - 85% lower as compared to the base case. Rigorous simulations based on experimental results were carried out using Aspen Plus and Dynamics. Despite the high degree of integration, the process is well controllable using an efficient control structure proposed in this work. The main results are provided for a plant producing 10 ktpy fatty acid methyl esters from methanol and waste vegetable oil with high free fatty acids content, using sulfated zirconia as solid acid catalyst. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigated the use of Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) fluorometry to measure nutrient induced physiological stress and subsequent synthesis of cellular neutral lipids. A freshwater Chlorella sp. was subjected to complete nutrient stress (distilled H2O) and selective nutrient stress in modified BG-11 media (BG-11-N, BG-11-P and BG-11-Fe). Physiological stress was recorded using parameters, rETR, Fv/Fm, Ek, α and NPQ. Induced stress became evident when these parameters were significantly altered, suggesting the onset of neutral lipid synthesis. Complete nutrient stress induced the highest yield of cellular neutral lipids (∼49%) compared to absence of selected nutrients (∼30%). Physiological stress was recorded by a significant decrease in rETR (75%), Fv/Fm (36%), and Ek (60%) and an increase in NPQ (83%). Optimization of neutral lipids occurred by initially maximizing the biomass and subsequently subjecting the harvested biomass to complete nutrient stress. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Some acetals can be produced from renewable resources (bioalcohols) and seem to be good candidates for different applications such as oxygenated diesel additives. In the present case the production of 1,1 diethoxy butane from bioethanol and butanal is presented. Butanal can be obtained from biobutanol following a partial oxidation or a dehydrogenation process. In this paper innovative process development about the synthesis of the mentioned acetal including catalytic reactive distillation experimental and simulation results will be presented and discussed. Katapak SP modules containing Amberlyst 47 resin were used as structured catalytic packings. This reactive system allowed reaching higher conversions than the equilibrium ones at the same temperatures. All the experimental data gathered allowed to tune a simulation model for the reactive distillation operation which showed a fairly good behavior in order to perform initial 1,1 diethoxy butane production process design studies. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel has been produced by transesterification of canola oil with methanol in the presence of highly Brønsted acidic ionic liquids based on 1-benzyl-1. H-benzimidazole, and the effect of reaction temperature, type and amount of catalyst, molar ratio and reaction time investigated. The results show that the 4B ionic liquid has the highest catalytic activity and best recyclability under the optimised reaction conditions. Thus, this ionic liquid is able to catalyze the transesterification of canola oil to its methyl esters in 5. h with yields of more than 95%. Density functional calculations (B3LYP), using the 6-311G basis set, have been performed to have a better understanding on the reactivity of these catalysts. The catalytic activity of 4B for the transesterification of other vegetable oils and alcohols has also been studied. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A rigorous chemical engineering mass balance/unit operations approach is applied here to bio-diesel from algae mass culture. An equivalent of 50,000,000gallons per year (0.006002m3/s) of petroleum-based Number 2 fuel oil (US, diesel for compression-ignition engines, about 0.1% of annual US consumption) from oleaginous algae is the target. Methyl algaeate and ethyl algaeate diesel can according to this analysis conceptually be produced largely in a technologically sustainable way albeit at a lower available diesel yield. About 11square miles of algae ponds would be needed with optimistic assumptions of 50g biomass yield per day and m2 pond area. CO2 to foster algae growth should be supplied from a sustainable source such as a biomass-based ethanol production. Reliance on fossil-based CO2 from power plants or fertilizer production renders algae diesel non-sustainable in the long term. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Glycerol is an agro-industrial residue generated in high amounts during the biodiesel production. The growing production of biodiesel is creating a worldwide glycerol surplus. Therefore, replacing sugar-based feedstock in bioprocesses by glycerol could be potentially attractive. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the most commonly used microorganisms in the agri-food industry and therefore currently produced in large quantities from sugar-based feedstock. Unfortunately, growth of S. cerevisiae strains on glycerol is very low with reported μmax around 0.01h-1. This study demonstrates that successive growth of the S. cerevisiae CBS 8066, CEN. PK 113-7D and Ethanol Red on glycerol as sole carbon source considerably improved the μmax from 0.01 up to 0.2h-1. The "adapted strain" CBS 8066-FL20 was kinetically characterized during aerobic and oxygen-limited cultivation in bioreactor and the results discussed in terms of their implication for developing glycerol-based S. cerevisiae bioprocesses. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effect of microwave irradiation on the simultaneous extraction and transesterification (in situ transesterifcation) of dry algal biomass to biodiesel was investigated. A high degree of oil/lipid extraction from dry algal biomass and an efficient conversion of the oils/lipids to biodiesel were demonstrated in a set of well-designed experimental runs. A response surface methodology (RSM) was used to analyze the influence of the process variables (dry algae to methanol (wt/vol) ratio, catalyst concentration, and reaction time) on the fatty acid methyl ester conversion. Based on the experimental results and RSM analysis, the optimal conditions for this process were determined as: dry algae to methanol (wt/vol) ratio of around 1:12, catalyst concentration about 2 wt.%, and reaction time of 4. min. The algal biodiesel samples were analyzed with GC-MS and thin layer chromatography (TLC) methods. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the algal biomass samples before and after the extraction/transesterification reaction are also presented. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative fuel for diesel engines produced through transesterification of oleaginous feedstocks. To analyze the influence of the fatty-acid composition on biodiesel optimization, transesterification of several vegetable oils has been studied. Reactions were carried out in flasks filled with vegetable oils, heated to the reaction temperature and stirred at 1100. rpm. The reactions started when the methanol and potassium hydroxide solutions were added to the flasks. Concentration of catalyst, amount of methanol, reaction temperature and time were optimized using a factorial design and a surface response design. Also, a kinetics study was carried out to optimize the reaction time. Results showed that reaction parameters optimal values depend on the oil chemical and physical properties. It can be concluded from this field trial that the effect of both catalyst concentration and reaction time over the transesterification yield is greatly influenced by the saturation degree and fatty-acid chain length. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A bioenergy production and delivery system built around the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway (GLSLS) transportation corridor was assessed for its ability to mitigate energy security and climate change risks. The land area within 100km of the GLSLS and associated railway lines was estimated to be capable of producing at least 30Mt(dry)yr-1 of lignocellulosic biomass with minimal adverse impacts on food and fibre production. This was estimated to be sufficient to displace all of the coal-fired electricity in Ontario plus more than 620million L of green diesel (equivalent to 5.3% of diesel consumption in GLSLS provinces). Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions were 88% and 76% lower than coal-fired power and conventional diesel, respectively. Production costs of $120MWh-1 for power and up to $30GJ-1 ($1.1L-1) for green diesel were higher than current market prices, but a value for low-carbon energy would narrow the price differential. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In order to use the photosynthetic cyanobacterium Synechocystis as a source of feedstock for carbon-neutral, nonpetroleum-based diesel fuel, we evaluated several solvents and solvent systems for their ability to extract lipid from wild-type Synechocystis PCC 6803. Chloroform. +. methanol-based Folch and Bligh & Dyer methods had the highest lipid recoveries. Less toxic solvents, such as methanol and MTBE, or direct trans-esterification of biomass (without pre-extraction step) gave only slightly lower lipid-extraction yields. Ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, hexane, acetic ester, and their combinations were not effective for lipid extraction from Synechocystis (>20% loss), even though they are widely used for non-polar lipid extraction from other feedstock, including algae. We confirmed the success of chloroform. +. methanol-based extraction by their penetration of the cell membrane system, higher polarity, and stronger interaction with hydrogen bonds. The less-polar solvents not only had lower lipid yield, but also extracted more non-lipid compounds that require extra purification to remove. We also characterized the fatty-acid profile of Synechocystis PCC 6803: C16:0 (∼60%), C16:1 (∼9.5%), C18:0 (∼1.2%), C18:1 (∼2%), C18:2 (∼9.8%), and C18:3 (∼16.5%). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Presence of unreacted glycerides in biodiesel may reduce drastically its quality. This is why conversion of raw material in biodiesel through transesterification needs to readjust reaction parameter values to complete. In the present work, monitoring of glycerides transformation in biodiesel during the transesterification of vegetable oils was carried out. To check the influence of the chemical composition on glycerides conversion, selected vegetable oils covered a wide range of fatty acid composition. Reactions were carried out under alkali-transesterification in the presence of methanol. In addition, a multiple regression model was proposed. Results showed that kinetics depends on chemical and physical properties of the oils. It was found that the optimal reaction temperature depends on both length and unsaturation degree of vegetable oils fatty acid chains. Vegetable oils with higher degree of unsaturation exhibit faster monoglycerides conversion to biodiesel. It can be concluded that fatty acid composition influences reaction parameters and glycerides conversion, hence biodiesel yield and economic viability. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Methods for improving the cold flow properties of canola-based biodiesel are described. Freezing point depression via dilution is evaluated through controlled studies of methyl stearate freezing in seven different solvents, and methyl palmitate in three solvents. Without accounting for solute activity, the Hildebrand equation can predict the impact of methyl stearate freezing point in an alkane solvent (pentane) to within 4 °C. However, there is wide deviation for the other solutions, indicating wide ranging solute activities in these solvents. Dilution in toluene results in the greatest freezing point depression. In addition, several polymeric additives are screened for their effectiveness as biodiesel pour point depressants. After examining more than 13 polymers, including several alkyl methacrylate homo- and copolymers, it is shown that poly(lauryl methacrylate) homopolymer most effectively improves the biodiesel cold flow properties. At 1% loading, poly(lauryl methacrylate) lowers the pour point by as much as 30 °C and the low temperature filterability point (LTFP) by as much as 28 °C. When evaluating the impact of polymer concentration, it is shown that poly(lauryl methacrylate) concentrations of 0.14% perform poorly, whereas 0.5% has only a slightly lower impact than 1%. Concentrations above 1% exhibit no improvement. Finally, it is shown that a limited amount of mixing can notably reduce the LTFP in several samples. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The enzymatic production of biodiesel by transesterification of cottonseed oil was studied using low cost crude pancreatic lipase as catalyst in a batch system. The effects of the critical process parameters including water percentage, methanol:oil ratio, enzyme concentration, buffer pH and reaction temperature were determined. Maximum conversion of 75-80% was achieved after 4. h at 37°C, pH 7.0 and with 1:15. M ratio of oil to methanol, 0.5% (wt of oil) enzyme and water concentration of 5% (wt of oil). Various organic solvents were tested among which a partially polar solvent (t-butanol) was found to be suitable for the reaction. The major fuel characteristics like specific gravity, kinematic viscosity, flash point and calorific value of the 20:80 blends (B20) of the fatty acid methyl esters with petroleum diesel conformed very closely to those of American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) standards. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article is a selective review of new approaches and emerging technologies for ultra-clean (ultra-low sulfur) diesel fuels. The issues of diesel deep desulfurization are becoming more serious because the crude oils are getting higher in sulfur content, while the regulated sulfur limits are becoming lower and lower. Deep reduction of diesel sulfur (from 500 to &lt;15 ppmw sulfur) is dictated largely by 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene, which represents the least reactive sulfur compounds that have substitutions on both 4- and 6-positions. The deep hydrodesulfurization (HDS) problem of diesel streams is exacerbated by the inhibiting effects of co-existing poly aromatics and nitrogen compounds in the feed as well as H2S in the product. New and more effective approaches and continuing catalysis and processing research are needed for producing affordable ultra-clean diesel fuels, because meeting the new government sulfur regulations in 2006-2010 is only a milestone. Desulfurization research should also take into consideration the fuel-cell fuel processing needs, which will have stringent requirements on desulfurization.

AB  - Renewable diesel surrogates made from shorter chain length fatty acids have improved cold flow properties. Acyl-ACP thioesterases specific for shorter chain length fatty acids are therefore of considerable interest in the genetic engineering of biofuel producing organisms, both for their ability to increase the production of shorter fatty acids, and for their involvement in fatty acid secretion in bacterial systems. Here we show that the heterologous expression of two thioesterases, biased towards the production of lauric (C12:0) and myristic acid (C14:0), causes increased accumulation of shorter chain length fatty acids in the eukaryotic microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Accumulation of shorter chain length fatty acids corresponds to transgene transcript levels. We achieved levels of C12:0 of up to 6.2% of total fatty acids and C14:0 of up to 15% by weight. Unlike observations in cyanobacteria, no significant secretion of fatty acids was observed. Instead, we found that 75-90% of the shorter chain length fatty acids produced was incorporated into triacylglycerols. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of thioesterases is a valid way to improve the biofuel production phenotype of eukaryotic microalgae. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - While the cost competitiveness of vegetable oil-based biofuels (VOBB) has impeded extensive commercialization on a large-scale, the economic viability of small-scale on-farm production of VOBB is unclear. This study assessed the cost competitiveness of small-scale on-farm production of canola- [Brassica napus (L.)] and soybean-based [Glycine max (L.)] biodiesel and straight vegetable oil (SVO) biofuels in the upper Midwest at 2007 price levels. The effects of feedstock type, feedstock valuation (cost of production or market price), biofuel type, and capitalization level on the cost L-1 of biofuel were examined. Valuing feedstock at the cost of production, the cost of canola-based biodiesel ranged from 0.94 to 1.13 $ L-1 and SVO from 0.64 to 0.83 $ L-1 depending on capitalization level. Comparatively, the cost of soybean-based biodiesel and SVO ranged from 0.40 to 0.60 $ L-1 and from 0.14 to 0.33 $ L-1, respectively, depending on capitalization level. Valuing feedstock at the cost of production, soybean biofuels were cost competitive whereas canola biofuels were not. Valuing feedstock at its market price, canola biofuels were more cost competitive than soybean-based biofuels, though neither were cost competitive with petroleum diesel. Feedstock type proved important in terms of the meal co-product credit, which decreased the cost of biodiesel by 1.39 $ L-1 for soybean and 0.44 $ L-1 for canola. SVO was less costly to produce than biodiesel due to reduced input costs. At a small scale, capital expenditures have a substantial impact on the cost of biofuel, ranging from 0.03 to 0.25 $ L-1. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bio-oils usually contain many types of compounds with various chemical properties. A bio-oil sample derived from rice husk through rapid pyrolysis was fractioned using solvent- or solid-extraction techniques based on their various properties. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize their various spectral properties for further understanding the characteristics of the bio-oil. Bio-oil mostly contains many aromatic ring components, acidic polar fractions, few weak- and non-polar components. The results all show that the main compounds and functional groups in the various bio-oil fractions were different and depended on the fractionation methods. The compositions of the bio-oil fractions were also analyzed with a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method. The consistency of the results obtained from the spectrometric methods with the GC/MS method indicates that the spectrometric methods have a good potential for rapid and effective characterization of bio-oils. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microbial conversion of lignocellulosic sugars to triacylglycerols (a biodiesel or renewable diesel feedstock) was investigated using the oleaginous yeast Rhodotorula glutinis (ATCC 15125). In the shake flask experiments, R. glutinis was first grown in a nitrogen-rich medium utilizing an artificial acid hydrolysate of lignocellulosic biomass switchgrass as the sole carbon and energy source. Once the culture had reached the stationary phase, the cells were harvested and transferred to a fresh nitrogen-free media containing artificial acid hydrolysate sugars for lipid accumulation. Analysis of the data collected showed that the yeast were able to grow in the medium containing artificial acid hydrolysate sugars as the carbon and energy source. The net specific Growth rate(s) indicated that the presence of acetic acid and furfural in the artificial acid hydrolysate inhibited the growth of R. glutinis on glucose, but not the growth on xylose. The lipid accumulated in the cells, determined by gravimetrical method, increased from initial 4.3%-39.0% of dry cell mass weight. The major fatty acids of the accumulated lipids were palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and γ-linoleic acid. These results indicate that it is feasible to convert the sugars in acid hydrolysate of lignocellulosic biomass to triacylglycerols using R. glutinis. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: The production of biodiesel from activated sludge obtained from Tuscaloosa, AL was optimized based on the yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) using an in situ transesterification process. An orthogonal central composite response surface design was considered to investigate the main and interaction effects of temperature, methanol to sludge ratio, and catalyst concentration. RESULTS: The biodiesel yield can be satisfactorily described by the quadratic response surface model with R2 of 0.836 and a statistically not significant lack of fit (p = 0.254). Coded regression coefficients, main effect plots and surface plots indicated that maximum biodiesel yield may be obtained at 75 °C, 30 mL g-1 (methanol/sludge) and 10% volume (catalyst concentration). Numerical optimization showed that at this reaction condition, a biodiesel yield of 3.78% (weight) can be obtained. Experimental verification gave a biodiesel yield of 3.93 ± 0.15% (weight) giving a model error of 7.35%. This indicates high reliability of the model. CONCLUSIONS: The economic analysis showed that the in situ transesterification of wet activated sludge (84.5% weight moisture) is less economical than the in situ transesterification of dried sludge (5% weight moisture). However, sensitivity analysis indicated that the process can be made more economical by reduction of water to 50% (weight). At this level of moisture, a biodiesel break-even price of around $7.00 per gallon is attainable, which is still more expensive than petroleum-based diesel (~$2.95 per gallon). For the biodiesel from activated sludge to be economically competitive, a biodiesel yield of at least 10% (weight) is necessary. © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Overview: The development of innovative methods to efficiently convert biomass to fuels and industrial chemicals is one of the grand challenges of the current age. n-Butanol is a versatile and sustainable platform chemical that can be produced from a variety of waste biomass sources. The emergence of new technologies for the production of fuels and chemicals from butanol will allow it to be a significant component of a necessarily dynamic and multifaceted solution to the current global energy crisis. IMPACT: The production of butanol from biomass and its utilization as a precursor to a diverse set of fuel products has the potential to reduce petroleum use worldwide. In concert with other emerging renewable technologies, significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions may be realized. The rapid incorporation of renewables into the world fuel supply may also help to offset predicted increases in transportation fuel prices as the supply of oil declines. APPLICATIONS: Recent work has shown that butanol is a potential gasoline replacement that can also be blended in significant quantities with conventional diesel fuel. These efforts have transitioned to research focused on the development of viable methods for the production of an array of oxygenated and fully saturated jet and diesel fuels from butanol. The technologies discussed in this paper will help drive the commercialization and utilization of a spectrum of butanol based sustainable fuels that can supplement and partially displace conventional petroleum derived fuels. © 2010.

AB  - Canola oil is high in oleic acid which is commonly used for food and industrial purposes. To determine adaptability of spring canola (Brassica napus L.) to the High Plains for industrial oil production, 26 irrigated trials were conducted from 2005 to 2008. Trials were divided into five regions-1: 36-37°N 108°W; 2: 39-40°N 101-103°W; 3: 41-42°N 102-103°W; 4: 41-42°N 104°W; 5: 43-44°N 106-108°W. Cultural practices were based on site-specific protocols. Four cultivars, Hyola 401, Hyola 357 Magnum, SW Marksman, and SW Patriot, were planted in replicated plots in April or May under standard irrigation and harvested in July to October depending on region. Seed yield Hyola 401 and Hyola 357 Magnum were higher than SW Marksman and SW Patriot across the five regions and within Regions 1, 2, 3, and 5. Regions 1, 2 and 3 yielded significantly greater than did Regions 4 and 5. Samples from 18 trials were examined for their oil content and fatty acid distribution. The four cultivars had greater than 38% oil content; SW Marksman and SW Patriot had higher oil content than Hyola 401 and Hyola 357 Mag. Higher oil content was achieved in Regions 1, 4 and 5. Across and within regions, the percent of oleic acid did not differ for the four cultivars. The mean content of oleic acid decreased going north from Region 2 to Region 5, as did seed yield in the High Plains. Linoleic acid increased going north from Region 1. Linolenic acids showed little variation across regions. Considering yield and total oil content together, growing spring canola would be excellent in the High Plains. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Jatropha curcas, a multipurpose shrub has acquired significant economic potential as biodiesel plant. The seeds or pressed cake is toxic due to the presence of toxic substances and is not useful as food/fodder despite having the best protein composition. A simple, efficient, and reproducible method for plant regeneration through direct organogenesis from petiole explants of non-toxic J. curcas was developed using Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different concentrations of thidiazuron (TDZ). The best induction of shoot buds (57.61%), and number of shoot buds (4.98) per explant were obtained when in vitro petiole explants were placed horizontally on MS medium supplemented with 2.27 μM TDZ. The Induced shoot buds were transferred to MS medium containing 10 μM kinetin (Kn), 4.5 μM 6-benzyl aminopurine (BA), and 5.5 μM α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) for shoot proliferation and subsequent elongation was achieved on MS medium supplemented with 2.25 μM BA and 8.5 μM IAA. The elongated shoots could be rooted on half-strength MS medium with 15 μM IBA, 11.4 μM IAA and 5.5 μM NAA with more than 90% survival rate. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bioethanol is by far the most widely used biofuel for transportation worldwide. Production of bioethanol from biomass is one way to reduce both consumption of crude oil and environmental pollution. Bioethanol can be produced from different kinds of raw materials. These raw materials are classified into three categories of agricultural raw materials: simple sugars, starch and lignocellulose. The price of the raw materials is highly volatile, which can highly affect the production costs of the bioethanol. One major problem with bioethanol production is the availability of raw materials for the production. Lignocellulosic biomass is the most promising feedstock considering its great availability and low cost, but the large-scale commercial production of fuel bioethanol from lignocellulosic materials has still not been implemented. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A life cycle assessment of hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) biofuel was performed. The study was commissioned by Volvo Technology Corporation and Volvo Penta Corporation as part of an effort to gain a better understanding of the environmental impact of potential future biobased liquid fuels for cars and trucks. The life cycle includes production of vegetable oil from rape, oil palm or Jatropha, transport of the oil to the production site, production of the HVO from the oil, and combustion of the HVO. The functional unit of the study is 1 kWh energy out from the engine of a heavy-duty truck and the environmental impact categories that are considered are global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP) and embedded fossil production energy. System expansion was used to take into account byproducts from activities in the systems; this choice was made partly to make this study comparable to results reported by other studies. The results show that HVO produced from palm oil combined with energy production from biogas produced from the palm oil mill effluent has the lowest environmental impact of the feedstocks investigated in this report. HVO has a significantly lower life cycle GWP than conventional diesel oil for all feedstocks investigated, and a GWP that is comparable to results for e.g. rape methyl ester reported in the literature. The results show that emissions from soil caused by microbial activities and leakage are the largest contributors to most environmental impact categories, which is supported also by other studies. Nitrous oxide emissions from soil account for more than half of the GWP of HVO. Nitrogen oxides and ammonia emissions from soil cause almost all of the life cycle EP of HVO and contribute significantly to the AP as well. The embedded fossil production energy was shown to be similar to results for e.g. rape methyl ester from other studies. A sensitivity analysis shows that variations in crop yield and in nitrous oxide emissions from microbial activities in soil can cause significant changes to the results. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We examined the co-evolution of the transportation, and electricity and heat generation sectors in the Netherlands until 2040 using a MARKAL bottom-up cost optimisation model. All scenario variants investigated indicate a switch away from crude oil-based diesel and petrol for transportation. Lowest overall CO2 abatement cost is achieved by accommodating transportation first and using relatively expensive options for emissions reduction in electricity generation if needed. Biomass and carbon capture and storage (CCS) are used to full potential. Transportation CO2 emissions are reduced by switching to ethanol or bio-based synthetic fuels combined with CCS, and series hybrid cars if needed. Depending on the availability of biomass and carbon storage capacity, electricity is produced from biomass, coal with CCS, or wind complemented with natural gas. Indirect greenhouse gas emissions rise to 34-54% of national emissions in 2040. The difference in annual investment required between the scenario variants with and without CO2 emissions reductions of 68% by 2040 is 4-7 billion euro/year, or 0.5-1.2% of projected GDP. Investment costs are mostly determined by the cost of cars and electricity generation capacity. We observe competition for limited biomass supply and CO2 storage capacity between the transportation and power sectors. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Access to energy is known as a key issue for poverty reduction. Electrification rate of sub-Saharan countries is one of the lowest among the developing countries. However, this part of the world has natural energy resources that could help raising its access to energy, then its economic development. An original "flexy-energy" concept of hybrid solar PV/diesel/biofuel power plant, without battery storage, is performed in this paper. This concept is developed in order to not only make access to energy possible for rural and peri-urban populations in Africa (by reducing the electricity generation cost) but also to make the electricity production sustainable in these areas. For landlocked countries like Burkina Faso, this concept could help them reducing their electricity bill (then their fuel consumption) and accelerate their rural and peri-urban electrification coverage. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effects of diesel oil-soybean biodiesel blends on a passenger vehicle exhaust pollutant emissions were investigated. Blends of diesel oil and soybean biodiesel with concentrations of 3% (B3), 5% (B5), 10% (B10) and 20% (B20) were used as fuels. Additionally, the effects of anhydrous ethanol as an additive to B20 fuel blend with concentrations of 2% (B20E2) and 5% (B20E5) were also studied. The emissions tests were carried out following the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The results showed that increasing biodiesel concentration in the fuel blend increases carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxides of nitrogen (NOX) emissions, while carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and particulate matter (PM) emissions are reduced. The addition of anhydrous ethanol to B20 fuel blend proved it can be a strategy to control exhaust NOX and global warming effects through the reduction of CO2 concentration. However, it may require fuel injection modifications, as it increases CO, HC and PM emissions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Combustion-derived soot or black carbon (BC) in the atmosphere has a strong influence on both climate and human health. In order to propose effective mitigation strategies for BC emissions it is of importance to investigate geographical distributions and seasonal variations of BC emission sources. Here, a radiocarbon methodology is used to distinguish between fossil fuel and biomass burning sources of soot carbon (SC). SC is isolated for subsequent off-line 14C quantification with the chemothermal oxidation method at 375 °C (CTO-375 method), which reflects a recalcitrant portion of the BC continuum known to minimize inadvertent inclusion of any non-pyrogenic organic matter. Monitored wind directions largely excluded impact from the Stockholm metropolitan region at the EMEP-Aspvreten rural station 70 km to the south-west. Nevertheless, the Stockholm city and the rural stations yielded similar relative source contributions with fraction biomass (fbiomass) for fall and winter periods in the range of one-third to half. Large temporal variations in 14C-based source apportionment was noted for both the 6 week fall and the 4 month winter observations. The fbiomass appeared to be related to the SC concentration suggesting that periods of elevated BC levels may be caused by increased wood fuel combustion. These results for the largest metropolitan area in Scandinavia combine with other recent 14C-based studies of combustion-derived aerosol fractions to suggest that biofuel combustion is contributing a large portion of the BC load to the northern European atmosphere. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel commonly experiences oxidative and hydrolytic degradation, leading to problems of low storage stability and corrosion of fuel containers. This study investigates the fabrication and use of electrodeposited nickel and nickel-tungsten alloys as potential coating materials that effectively protect steel-based biodiesel containers from corrosion. Through long-term static immersion, surface analyses of the coatings, and assessments of the biodiesel's acidity, it is determined that the electrodeposited nickel is well compatible with biodiesel, whereas the addition of tungsten deteriorates the corrosion resistance of nickel. Tight control of the tungsten content in nickel deposits is required to enhance both mechanical integrity and corrosion resistance of the deposits exposed to biodiesel environments. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels are renewable energy sources for internal combustion engines and they have low emissions. They are increasingly used as an alternative to petroleum fuels. In this work, three different fuel types, such as commercial diesel fuel (D2), 20% biodiesel and 80% diesel fuel called here as B20, and 80% biodiesel and 20% kerosene, called here as BK20, were used in a single cylinder, four stroke, direct injection compression ignition engine. Kerosene was used as an additive to approach the properties of biodiesel to D2. The effects of the blends on CO, NOx, and smoke emissions as well as on some of the performance parameter of the engine were investigated. The prepared fuel, BK20 blend, has almost the same fuel properties as conventional diesel fuel. The experimental results showed that the exhaust emissions for BK20 were fairly reduced as compared to diesel fuel as well as B20. Besides, the performance of CI engine was improved with the use of the BK20, especially in comparison to B20. Results suggest that the BK20 can be substituted to the petroleum-based diesel fuel in diesel engines. Copyright © Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The performance of a 4 stroke 3 cylinder direct injection naturally aspirated, Perkins D3.142 engine was measured in order to determine the suitability of a biofuel produced from the seeds of Croton megalocarpus for engine use. The raw oil from the seeds was subjected to a transesterfication process and supplied to the engine as a Croton methyl ester (CME) in various blends with diesel fuel. The engine performance (brake thermal efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption and exhaust temperature) were measured and evaluated. A Horiba PG-250 portable analyser was used to measure the CO, HC, CO 2, NOx, and O2, concentrations. The tests indicated a lower brake thermal efficiency for CME compared with the pure diesel fuel. The exhaust gas temperature increased with increase in load for all tested fuels. It was found that the performance of the CME was comparable to pure diesel fuel but the biodiesel produced lower smoke and NOx emissions. Emissions of CO were reduced at higher loads with the biofuel. The performance of the engine indicated that CME has properties and characteristics that make it a viable additive or alternative to conventional fossil diesel fuel. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Environmental changes that have occurred due to the use of fossil fuels have driven the search for alternative sources that have a lower environmental impact. First-generation biofuels were derived from crops such as sugar cane, corn and soybean, which contribute to water scarcity and deforestation. Second-generation biofuels originated from lignocellulose agriculture and forest residues, however these needed large areas of land that could be used for food production. Based on technology projections, the third generation of biofuels will be derived from microalgae. Microalgae are considered to be an alternative energy source without the drawbacks of the first- and second-generation biofuels. Depending upon the growing conditions, microalgae can produce biocompounds that are easily converted into biofuels. The biofuels from microalgae are an alternative that can keep the development of human activity in harmony with the environment. This study aimed to present the main biofuels that can be derived from microalgae. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Global petroleum reserves are shrinking at a fast pace, increasing the demand for alternate fuels. Microalgae have the ability to grow rapidly, and synthesize and accumulate large amounts (approximately 20-50% of dry weight) of neutral lipid stored in cytosolic lipid bodies. A successful and economically viable algae based biofuel industry mainly depends on the selection of appropriate algal strains. The main focus of bioprospecting for microalgae is to identify unique high lipid producing microalgae from different habitats. Indigenous species of microalgae with high lipid yields are especially valuable in the biofuel industry. Isolation, purification and identification of natural microalgal assemblages using conventional techniques is generally time consuming. However, the recent use of micromanipulation as a rapid isolating tool allows for a higher screening throughput. The appropriate media and growth conditions are also important for successful microalgal proliferation. Environmental parameters recorded at the sampling site are necessary to optimize in vitro growth. Identification of species generally requires a combination of morphological and genetic characterization. The selected microalgal strains are grown in upscale systems such as raceway ponds or photobireactors for biomass and lipid production. This paper reviews the recent methodologies adopted for site selection, sampling, strain selection and identification, optimization of cultural conditions for superior lipid yield for biofuel production. Energy generation routes of microalgal lipids and biomass are discussed in detail. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study examines the performance of supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) extraction and hexane extraction of lipids from marine Chlorococcum sp. for lab-scale biodiesel production. Even though the strain of Chlorococcum sp. used in this study had a low maximum lipid yield (7.1 wt% to dry biomass), the extracted lipid displayed a suitable fatty acid profile for biodiesel [C18:1 (∼63 wt%), C16:0 (∼19 wt%), C18:2 (∼4 wt%), C16:1 (∼4 wt%), and C18:0 (∼3 wt%)]. For SCCO2 extraction, decreasing temperature and increasing pressure resulted in increased lipid yields. The mass transfer coefficient (k) for lipid extraction under supercritical conditions was found to increase with fluid dielectric constant as well as fluid density. For hexane extraction, continuous operation with a Soxhlet apparatus and inclusion of isopropanol as a co-solvent enhanced lipid yields. Hexane extraction from either dried microalgal powder or wet microalgal paste obtained comparable lipid yields. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae possess the potential to produce bio-oils, carbohydrates, protein, amino acids and other value added products, each of which increase its value as a crop. Unfortunately, proven systems do not yet exist for commercial scale production. System designs have generally not adequately accounted for water and energy use at scale, as well as byproduct markets, and thus yielded systems that are both unaffordable and unsustainable. We address energy and water use by presenting a straightforward microalga-to-bio-oil production process and then characterize system performance using steady-state water and energy balances. Practical limitations to commercial production of bio-oils from photosynthetic microalgae are proposed and conclusions drawn regarding system potential for assumed biomass productivities. As this is a theoretical analysis of a generic process and in practice many of the bottlenecks presented remain to be solved, it is our intent that the analysis framework presented herein can be applied to future systems that propose such solutions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel production through transesterification of lipids generates large quantity of biodiesel waste (BW) containing mainly glycerin. BW can be treated in various ways including distillation to produce glycerin, use as substrate for fermentative propanediol production and discharge as wastes. This study examined microbial fuel cells (MFCs) to treat BW with simultaneous electricity generation. The maximum power density using BW was 487±28mW/m2 cathode (1.5A/m2 cathode) with 50mM phosphate buffer solution (PBS) as the electrolyte, which was comparable with 533±14mW/m2 cathode obtained from MFCs fed with glycerin medium (COD 1400mg/L). The power density increased from 778±67mW/m2 cathode using carbon cloth to 1310±15mW/m2 cathode using carbon brush as anode in 200mM PBS electrolyte. The power density was further increased to 2110±68mW/m2 cathode using the heat-treated carbon brush anode. Coulombic efficiencies (CEs) increased from 8.8±0.6% with carbon cloth anode to 10.4±0.9% and 18.7±0.9% with carbon brush anode and heat-treated carbon brush anode, respectively. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study demonstrates the production of algal biodiesel from Dunaliella tertiolecta, Nannochloropsis oculata, wild freshwater microalgae, and macroalgae lipids using a highly efficient continuous catalytic process. The heterogeneous catalytic process uses supercritical methanol and porous titania microspheres in a fixed bed reactor to catalyze the simultaneous transesterification and esterification of triacylglycerides and free fatty acids, respectively, to fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel). Triacylglycerides and free fatty acids were converted to alkyl esters with up to 85% efficiency as measured by 300MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. The lipid composition of the different algae was studied gravimetrically and by gas chromatography. The analysis showed that even though total lipids comprised upwards of 19% of algal dry weight the saponifiable lipids, and resulting biodiesel, comprised only 1% of dry weight. Thus highlighting the need to determine the triacylglyceride and free fatty acid content when considering microalgae for biodiesel production. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this study was to document and compare the lipid class and fatty acid composition of the green microalga Chlorella zofingiensis cultivated under photoautotrophic and heterotrophic conditions. Compared with photoautotrophic cells, a 900% increase in lipid yield was achieved in heterotrophic cells fed with 30gL-1 of glucose. Furthermore heterotrophic cells accumulated predominantly neutral lipids (NL) that accounted for 79.5% of total lipids with 88.7% being triacylglycerol (TAG); whereas photoautotrophic cells contained mainly the membrane lipids glycolipids (GL) and phospholipids (PL). Together with the much higher content of oleic acid (C18:1) (35.2% of total fatty acids), oils from heterotrophic C. zofingiensis appear to be more feasible for biodiesel production. Our study highlights the possibility of using heterotrophic algae for producing high quality biodiesel. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae have the ability to mitigate CO2 emission and produce oil with a high productivity, thereby having the potential for applications in producing the third-generation of biofuels. The key technologies for producing microalgal biofuels include identification of preferable culture conditions for high oil productivity, development of effective and economical microalgae cultivation systems, as well as separation and harvesting of microalgal biomass and oil. This review presents recent advances in microalgal cultivation, photobioreactor design, and harvesting technologies with a focus on microalgal oil (mainly triglycerides) production. The effects of different microalgal metabolisms (i.e., phototrophic, heterotrophic, mixotrophic, and photoheterotrophic growth), cultivation systems (emphasizing the effect of light sources), and biomass harvesting methods (chemical/physical methods) on microalgal biomass and oil production are compared and critically discussed. This review aims to provide useful information to help future development of efficient and commercially viable technology for microalgae-based biodiesel production. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper analyses the potential environmental impacts and economic viability of producing biodiesel from microalgae grown in ponds. A comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study of a notional production system designed for Australian conditions was conducted to compare biodiesel production from algae (with three different scenarios for carbon dioxide supplementation and two different production rates) with canola and ULS (ultra-low sulfur) diesel. Comparisons of GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions (g CO2-e/tkm) and costs (¢/tkm) are given. Algae GHG emissions (-27.6 to 18.2) compare very favourably with canola (35.9) and ULS diesel (81.2). Costs are not so favourable, with algae ranging from 2.2 to 4.8, compared with canola (4.2) and ULS diesel (3.8). This highlights the need for a high production rate to make algal biodiesel economically attractive. © 2010.

AB  - This study described the combustion and exhaust emissions characteristics of biodiesel fuel with multiple-injection strategies. Also, this investigation included the free spray characteristics and in-cylinder spray behaviors of the multiple-injection modes. Free spray and in-cylinder spray images were obtained from the spray visualization system. Combustion and exhaust emissions characteristics were analyzed using a single cylinder diesel engine with a displacement volume of 373.33cm3 and a compression ratio of 17.8. The exhaust emissions were analyzed using a smoke meter and an exhaust gas analyzer. A scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) was utilized to measure the particle number and size distribution of the nano-sized particle matter.It revealed that the injected spray before BTDC 25° developed toward the piston bowl region, and then progressed along the piston wall. When the biodiesel spray was injected at BTDC 25°, the spray targeted the piston lib. In single-injection combustion, the combustion pressure and rate of heat release at an injection timing of BTDC 30° dramatically decreased. These characteristics influenced on the decrease of the indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and the increase of soot, HC, and CO emissions because of the incomplete combustion. The multiple-injection modes showed a higher IMEP than the single-injection mode. In addition, the pilot injection strategy represented a higher IMEP than the split injection mode. The analysis of exhaust emissions characteristics of the multiple-injection modes showed that a short injection interval induced a decrease in soot, HC, and CO emissions, while NO. x emission increased. On the other hand, when the multiple-injection modes applied to the diesel engine, particles with large sizes were significantly decreased compared to single-injection combustion. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microbial oils with high unsaturated fatty acids content, especially oleic acid content, are good feedstock for high quality biodiesel production. Trichosporon capitatum was found to accumulate lipid with around 80% oleic acid and 89% total unsaturated fatty acids content on nitrogen-limited medium. In order to improve its lipid yield, effects of medium components and culture conditions on cell growth and lipid accumulation were investigated. Optimization of media resulted in a 61% increase in the lipid yield of T. capitatum after cultivation at 28°C and 160. rpm for 6. days. In addition, T. capitatum could grow well on cane molasses and afford a lipid yield comparable to that on synthetic nitrogen-limited medium. The biodiesel from the microbial oil produced by T. capitatum on cane molasses displayed a low cold filter plugging point (-15°C), and so T. capitatum might be a promising strain to provide lipid suitable for high quality biodiesel production. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
