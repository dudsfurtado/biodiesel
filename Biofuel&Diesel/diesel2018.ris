AB  - Support- and sulfide-free cobalt molybdenum catalysts are prepared via different synthetic procedures for catalytic deoxygenation of oleic acid under inert (N2) and solvent-free conditions. Among the tested catalysts, the CoMo catalyst prepared via a sol-gel method achieves the highest catalytic performance, namely, 88.9% oleic acid conversion, with 48.1% C9–C17 selectivity, and 69.6% oxygen removal rate, owing to its excellent physical properties. Additionally, oxygen vacancy is formed in CoMo catalyst during sol-gel synthesis process and it also effect on the catalytic activity. Examination of the deoxygenation reaction over pre-reduced catalysts reveals that the CoMoO4 species is the active species in the CoMo catalysts. The fuel properties of the resultant products are affected strongly by the catalytic performances of the CoMo catalysts. The biofuel produced using the CoMo catalyst prepared via the sol-gel method showed the highest calorific value (10,119 cal/g) and the lowest viscosity (31.5 cP), and, consequently, this CoMo catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic activity and has significant potential for application in biofuel production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We report here that the Re/SiO2 catalyst can be a suitable low-cost catalyst for processing polyols into acetals in solvent-free conditions with a high conversion rate and selectivity up to 100% in mild conditions. During a complex investigation, we broadly tested the blending potential of the acetals that were formed by measuring properties such as density, viscosity, isentropic compressibility, isobaric thermal expansion, cetane number and other parameters of both the crude additives and the blends that were prepared with petroleum diesel oil. The results indicate that the investigated acetals can generally be used for blending with petroleum diesel oil in order to obtain the valuable biofuels that are in great demand in the contemporary transportation industry due to the regulatory restrictions that have been introduced in order to protect the environment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalytic cracking processes (CC) of non-edible vegetable oils (VOs) are considered efficient pathway to produce alternative energy sources to replace the fossil fuel. Castor oil (CO) and jatropha oil (JO) are the appropriate resources for biofuels because of their chemical structures and their hydrocarbon chains which are similar to fuel. This investigation was conducted to synthesize, characterize and evaluate acidic catalyst in the CC of castor and JO. The interaction between the oils and the catalyst was studied based on the brand of the produces biofuels. The effect of the concentration of the catalyst on the reaction product was studied including: viscosity, kinematic viscosity, pour point and cloud point. The results revealed that the prepared catalyst can catalyze the cracking reaction of the VOs and produce several grades of biofuels. The study displayed that the physical and fuel characteristics of the obtained biofuels are located within the ASTM specification limits. Also, the chemical nature of the cracked oil has a substantial impact on the composition of the achieved biofuel. The mechanisms of the CC processes of CO and JO were proposed. The physical and fuel properties of the achieved biofuels were discussed using their chromatographic analysis data. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The search for acid-base bifunctional catalysts has become a hot topic in the preparation of biofuels from renewable resources. In the present work, a series of novel acid-base bifunctional metal-boron catalysts were successfully prepared by a sol-gel method and characterized by XRD, IR, SEM, TEM, TGA, BET, and TPD. Among those bifunctional solid materials, the Ca-B(700) catalyst had the highest density of both acid and base sites and showed excellent catalytic performance in the production of biodiesel from nonedible oils with high acid value. Under the optimal reaction conditions of 20/1 methanol/oil mole ratio and 4 wt % catalyst dosage at 105 °C for 2 h, a high biodiesel yield of 96.0% could be obtained from Jatropha curcas oil in one-pot. In addition, Ca-B(700) was also applicable to producing biodiesel from Firmiana platanifolia L.f. oil in a relatively low acid value, with an almost quantitative yield (98.5%) at 65 °C after 2 h. The Ca-B(700) catalyst had good stability and reusability, which is a promising acid-base bifunctional catalytic material for the preparation of biodiesel. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - As the demand for energy continuously increases, alternatives to fossil resources must be found to both prevent fossil source depletion and decrease overall environmental impact. One solution is increasing contributions from renewable, biological feedstock, and from wastes. This paper presents an analysis of the current methods of biomass conversion, to extract biofuels and biologically produced gases to then be used in fuel cells. Pathways for converting biomass feedstock into fuel cell fuels selected here were anaerobic digestion, metabolic processing, fermentation, gasification, and supercritical water gasification, which were compared to natural gas and fossil hydrogen reference cases. These thermochemical and biological conversion pathways can also make use of residues from agriculture, forestry, or some household and industry wastes, producing hydrogen and hydrogen-rich gases. Solid oxide fuel cells were also found to be the preferred technology for such bio-derived fuel gases, due to their wide range of fuel options, wide scalability from single kW to multi 100 kW, and high efficiency. © 2018 The Author(s)

AB  - The current study compares the performance, emission and combustion characteristics of two different biofuel extracted from waste peels of lemon and orange fruit through steam distillation process in common rail direct injection engine. The study is further extended by variation of parameters such as injection pressures, split injection quantities and exhaust gas recirculation. The brake thermal efficiency for orange peel is higher than diesel and lemon peel oil at 600 bar with 10% of pilot fuel quantity. The similar cetane index of orange peel oil (OPO) means there is minimal performance drop for its blend and lemon peel oil (LPO) performs well as compared to diesel however this benefit is not greater than OPO. However, for 30% pilot fuel quantity the fuel efficiency is dropped by 10.74% and 4.72% for OPO and LPO respectively as compared to 10% pilot fuel quantity. Through the use of a greater quantity of pilot fuel injection, the low viscosity of LPO further increases its performance characteristics whereas OPO sees a decrement. The inherent oxygen content of both biofuel blends shows reduced emission of un-burnt hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions under 600 bar and 10% pilot injection with the penalty of oxides of nitrogen emission. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although the application of microreactors in different processes has been extensively explored in recent decades, microreactors continue to be underexplored in the context of the enzyme-catalysed process for biodiesel production. Due to their numerous advantages, microreactors could become the next step in the development of a biodiesel production process characterised by sustainability, cost-effectiveness and energy efficiency. In this investigation, biodiesel production was catalysed by lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus (Lipolase L100). Edible sunflower oil was used as a model substrate in order to investigate the process. After optimal process conditions had been determined, waste-cooking oil was used for biodiesel production to make the production process more sustainable. Three different substrate-feeding strategies were investigated and finally an optimal strategy was proposed. In all the investigated systems, fatty acids methyl esters (FAME) content was higher than 95% and obtained in a significantly shorter time (less than 2 h) compared to the batch process in which biodiesel production was catalysed by lipase (C = 95%, t = 96 h). After the optimal biodiesel production system had been proposed, an integrated system with two microchips connected in series was developed. The first microchip was used for biodiesel production and the second for simultaneous purification i.e. glycerol separation. Finally, purified biodiesel was produced with glycerol content below the detection limit. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With increasing pollution concerns and stringent emission regulations, it has become difficult to meet the emission standards with the use of a single fuel. Binary and ternary fuel mixtures are being investigated all over the globe to satisfy the emission norms. In the present work, a reduced reaction mechanism for a waste cooking oil (WCO) biodiesel/n-pentanol mixture is proposed for the chemical kinetic simulation of an internal combustion engine. The mechanism consists of 146 species and 506 reactions. WCO biodiesel and n-pentanol are biofuels with many advantages. WCO biodiesel has properties (cetane number, viscosity, etc.) that are similar to those of diesel fuel, whereas n-pentanol has a high boiling temperature, low heat of vaporization, high lower heating value, and low autoignition temperature compared to other shorter chain alcohols. Mixing of higher molecular weight alcohols (n-pentanol) with diesel/biodiesel lowers the knock resistance as a result of their high reactivity at low as well as high temperatures. This characteristic makes them suitable for a diesel engine and advanced engine combustion modes, such as homogeneous charge compression ignition and reactivity controlled compression ignition engines. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and trimethyl orthoformate (TMOF) are potential biofuel ethers and could replace conventional fossil fuels, or act as additives to aid combustion. Laser flash photolysis with laser-induced fluorescence detection of the OH radical has been used to measure the rate coefficients of the OH reaction with these ethers, from 298 K to approximately 740 K. The temperature dependence of the rate coefficients is parametrized as k OH+MTBE (298-680 K) = 9.8 × 10 -13 × (T/298) 2.7 × exp(2500/RT) cm 3 molecule -1 s -1 and k OH+TMOF (298-744 K) = 8.0 × 10 -13 × [(T/298) 2.6 + (T/298) -8.1 ] × exp[2650/RT] cm 3 molecule -1 s -1 . The room temperature (298 K) bimolecular rate coefficients were measured as k OH+MTBE = (2.81 ± 0.32) × 10 -12 cm 3 molecule -1 s -1 and k OH+TMOF = (4.65 ± 0.50) × 10 -12 cm 3 molecule -1 s -1 where the errors represent statistical uncertainties at the 2σ level in combination with an estimated 10% systematic error. Regeneration of OH radicals was observed for both reactions at higher temperatures in the presence of O 2 via biexponential OH decays, which were observed above 489 K and 568 K, for TMOF and MTBE respectively. The OH yield from MTBE/O 2 , between 620 and 700 K, was invariant with the concentration of oxygen (10 15 -10 18 molecules cm -3 ) at (36 ± 5)%. Mechanisms for OH regeneration from MTBE are briefly discussed and compared with those in the literature and from dimethyl and diethyl ether. The lower OH yield from MTBE, compared to these other ethers, is most likely due to competition with an HO 2 formation channel. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Pyrolysis of lignin in the gas-phase using "wall-less" and cw-IR CO 2 laser powered homogeneous pyrolysis (LPHP) non-isothermal and continuous droplet evaporation (CDE) isothermal reactors has been performed. Hydrolytic lignin was dissolved in an acetone/water (9:1) mixture and dispersed into LPHP and CDE reactors using a constant output atomizing device and a syringe pump, respectively. Large differences in gas phase depolymerization of lignin have been seen in both reactors. The temperature distribution in the LPHP reactor was evaluated by thermocouple measurements and validated by the method of "chemical thermometer" and COMSOL Multiphysics simulations. The gas phase delivery of lignin into the hot zone of the LPHP reactor under "wall-less" conditions led to the breakdown of lignin into paramagnetic fragments that deposited onto the cell walls, which were studied by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Phenolics were not detected at all in the LPHP reactor. However, major phenolics (phenol(s), guaiacol(s), syringol(s)) were detected in the CDE reactor. At laser powers higher than 20 W and a high initial concentration of dispersed lignin (5 g/L), an intensification of demethoxylation reactions of phenolics by concomitant alkylation of aromatic rings along with the expulsion of CO from phenoxy rings (to account for formation of indenes and naphtalenes) was achieved in the LPHP reactor when a prepyrolyzed mixture from the CDE reactor entered the LPHP reactor. The yields of qualified biofuel products such as styrene, different alkyl benzenes, and surrogate fuels of diesel such as indene, 1,2-dihydro naphthalene, naphthalene, and other derivatives were detected in the LPHP reactor with decreasing amounts of phenolics. These results represent valuable observations about the primary mechanism of lignin depolymerization. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Presently, very few strategies are available for directly converting glucose-like compounds to 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF), a remarkable biofuel candidate. We report here on this conversion effectively using aluminum-based mixed-acid catalyst in co-solvent medium. The combination of aluminum triflate and Amberlyst-15 exhibited an admirable synergistic catalytic effect for the one-pot cascade conversion of glucose. Importantly, the interfusion of dimethyl sulfoxide into ethanol as co-solvent medium can significantly promote the formation of EMF reducing the extent of side reactions. Based on this protocol, the effects of key process variables on the conversion of glucose were investigated via response surface methodology, leading to EMF in up to a 48.1% yield. The catalytic system can be separated with the reaction products and demonstrates reusability. Also, the generality of developed catalytic strategy can extended to synthesize EMF directly from glucose-based polysaccharides, such as sucrose and starch. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Biodiesel engines produce several intermediate species, which can potentially harm the human health. The concentration of these species and their health risk potential varies depending on engine technology, fuel, and engine operating condition. In this study, experiments were performed on a large number of engines having different configurations (emissions norms/fuel used), which were operated at part load/full load using B20 (20% v/v biodiesel blended with mineral diesel) and mineral diesel. Experiments included measurement of gaseous emissions, and physical, chemical, and biological characterization of exhaust particulate matter (PM). Chemical characterization of PM was carried out for detecting polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's) and PM bound trace metals. The biological toxicity associated with PM was assessed using human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK 293T). The mutagenic potential of the PM was tested at three different concentrations (500, 100, and 50 μg/mL) using two different Salmonella strains, TA98 and TA100, with and without liver S9 metabolic enzyme fraction. PM samples exhibited cytotoxic effect on HEK 293T cells (IC 50 &lt; 100 μg/mL) and there was significant potential for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Comparison of different engines showed that modern engines (Euro-III and Euro-IV compliant) produced relatively cleaner exhaust compared to older engines (Euro-II compliant). Biodiesel-fueled engines emitted lower number of particles compared to diesel-fueled engines. However, chemical characterization revealed that biodiesel-fueled engines exhaust PM contained several harmful PAHs and trace metals, which affected the biological activity of these PM, as reflected in the biological investigations. Mutagenicity and cytotoxicity of PM from biodiesel-fueled engines were relatively higher compared to their diesel counterparts, indicating the need for exhaust gas after-treatment. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Sustainability, at present, is a prominent component in the development of production systems that aim to provide the future energy and material resources. Microalgae are a promising feedstock; however, the sustainability of algae-based production systems is still under debate. Commercial market volumes of algae-derived products are still narrow. The extraction and conversion of primary metabolites to biofuels requires cultivation at large scales; cost-effective methods are therefore highly desirable. This work presents a complete and up to date review on sustainability analysis of various microalgae production scenarios, including techno-economic, environmental, and social impacts, both in large-scale plants for bioenergy production and in medium-scale cultivars intended for the production of high added-value chemicals. The results show that further efforts in algal-based research should be directed to improving the productivity, the development of multi product scenarios, a better valorization of coproducts, the integration with current industrial facilities to provide sustainable nutrient resources from waste streams, and the integration of renewable technologies such as wind energy in algae cultivars. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Driven by biofuel policies, which aim to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase domestic energy supply, global production and consumption of bioethanol have doubled between 2007 and 2016, with rapid growth in corn-based bioethanol in the U.S. and sugar cane-based bioethanol in Brazil. Advances in crop yields, energy use efficiency in fertilizer production, biomass-to-ethanol conversion rates, and energy efficiency in ethanol production have improved the energy balance and GHG emission reduction potential of bioethanol. In the current study, the water, energy, and carbon footprints of bioethanol from corn in the U.S. and sugar cane in Brazil were assessed. The results show that U.S. corn bioethanol has a smaller water footprint (541 L water/L bioethanol) than Brazilian sugar cane bioethanol (1115 L water/L bioethanol). Brazilian sugar cane bioethanol has, however, a better energy balance (17.7 MJ/L bioethanol) and smaller carbon footprint (38.5 g CO2e/MJ) than U.S. bioethanol, which has an energy balance of 11.2 MJ/L bioethanol and carbon footprint of 44.9 g CO2e/MJ. The results show regional differences in the three footprints and highlight the need to take these differences into consideration to understand the implications of biofuel production for local water resources, net energy production, and climate change mitigation. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The recalcitrant nature of lignocelluloses requires a pretreatment process before the fermentative butanol production. The commonly used pretreatment processes, such as steam explosion, sulfuric acid, ammonia fiber explosion, ionic liquid (IL), and biological, require different quantities and types of process chemicals, and produce different quality and quantity of fermentable sugars. This study determines life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) these pretreatment methods by developing a system-level process model including corn stover feedstock supply system and the downstream butanol production process. This study further evaluates the uncertainty associated with energy use and GHG emissions for each stage of the entire butanol production chain and provide the future optimization opportunities. Probabilistic results of these analyses describe a distribution of GHG emissions with an average of 18.09-1056.12 gCO 2e /MJ and a 95% certainty to be less than 33.3-1888.3 gCO 2e /MJ. The highest GHG emissions of IL-pretreatment of 1056.12 gCO 2e /MJ reaches to 89.8 gCO 2e /MJ by switching IL-recovery from 80 to 99 wt %, which is the most influential parameter for IL-pretreatment. Additionally, credits from excess electricity, butanol yield, nitrogen replacement, and diesel fuel for transportation and harvesting were the most influential parameters. Based on the current state of technologies, apart from ionic liquid and biological pretreatments, other pretreatment processes have similar metrics of sustainability. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this work, the effect of single and split injection strategy on combustion, performance and emissions characteristics of biodiesel was experimentally investigated on a common rail direct injection assisted diesel engine. In single injection strategy, Nozzle opening pressure and fuel injection timing was varied from 200 to 600 bar and 19°–27° CA bTDC respectively. Experimental results revealed that B100 had the maximum brake thermal efficiency of 35.74% at 500 bar and 25° CA bTDC. Engine exhaust emissions of unburned hydrocarbon and smoke were decreased, whereas nitric oxide emission increased in B100 fuel at higher nozzle opening pressure and advanced fuel injection timing. In split injection strategy, start of main injection timing and post injection timing was varied from 19° to 25° CA bTDC and −5° CA bTDC to 5° CA aTDC respectively. The results exhibited that the B100-90%-10% has the maximum brake thermal efficiency of 34.43%. Minimum unburned hydrocarbon and smoke emissions were obtained in B100-75%-25%. Maximum nitric oxide emission was obtained in B100-90%-10%. Thus, the experimental studies clearly states that advanced injection strategy reduces the exhaust emissions and improves the engine performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, engine performance, exhaust emissions and combustion behaviors of a single-cylinder, four-stroke, direct-injection diesel engine running on biodiesel/diesel/1-butanol and biodiesel/diesel/n-pentanol fuel blends were investigated and compared with diesel fuel under different engine speeds and full load operating conditions. Test fuels were prepared with 5 and 10 vol% 1-butanol and n-pentanol. Engine test results indicated that brake powers and torques decreased as the amount of alcohol increased, while BSFC increased between 0.77% and 8.07%. Alcohol blended fuels acquired lower EGT and CO2, while observing higher O2 emission due to high oxygen content of alcohol compared to diesel fuel. Alcohol treated blends also diminished NOX by 0.56–2.65%, CO by 6.90–32.40%, and smoke by 10.47–44.43%. Moreover, n-pentanol blended fuels showed better performance and emission results than 1-butanol blends. Maximum in-cylinder pressure of higher alcohol blended fuels found between 94.55 and 95.82 bar at 371-372oCA for 1400 rpm, and between 78.19 and 82.19 bar at 375-376oCA for 2600 rpm. Alcohol addition into the blends increased maximum in-cylinder pressure up to 1.38% at low speed, whereas it decreased up to 3.75% at high speed. Furthermore, higher HRR values up to 8.5% were observed with the alcohol mixed fuels. Consequently, higher alcohols (n-pentanol and 1-butanol) can be utilized as alternative additives in biodiesel/diesel blends for diesel engines to improve emissions, although they adversely influence engine performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study reports on a comparative analysis of the influence of linseed oil-derived biodiesel on a compression ignition engine combustion and performance. New findings on particle emission and size distribution are presented and discussed. A low-sulfur commercial diesel fuel and soybean biodiesel were used as a reference. Engine feeding with biodiesel blends leads to slight increase (5–15%) in the maximal pressure rise rate compared to the diesel fuel accompanied by a minor rise in coefficient of variation at low loads. Combustion duration of all studied biodiesel blends is longer compared to the diesel fuel under all operating modes. At low-load operating modes, reduction in particle number concentrations under feeding with blends of the diesel fuel with soybean and linseed-derived biofuels (in 1:1 ratio by volume) is observed in the entire range of measured particle sizes. At high loads, the opposite trend is revealed: in the ultrafine particles size range (<90 nm), the measured particle number concentration for the biodiesel blends is substantially higher compared to diesel fuel. In contrast to soybean biodiesel, the linseed-derived blends demonstrated a trend of reduction in nitrogen oxides emission as compared to diesel at higher engine loads. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - More demand for fossil fuel and high-rise in the air pollution levels due to combustion of the fossil fuel give us an opportunity to discover some clean and environmental-friendly fuels for the engines. This study includes the optimization of engine operating parameters to obtain an optimum thermal performance of the engine running on pongamia based biodiesel blends. The fuel injection pressure, fuel injection timing, pongamia based biodiesel blends, and engine load were considered as input parameters for the optimization of Brake thermal efficiency, unburnt hydrocarbon, and NOx emission. An experiment was conducted according to the central composite rotating design (CCRD) matrix. The optimum combination of input parameters for maximum performance and minimum exhaust emissions were obtained at 15°bTDC fuel injection timing, 196.36 bar fuel injection pressure, 40% blend of biodiesel with diesel, and 53% engine load. The other biodiesel blends did not perform well during the 40% blend of biodiesel at the prescribed injection timing and pressure. RSM provides a better combination in terms of improving the performance of the engine. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that all developed models were statistically significant. The predicted combination was validated by confirmatory tests and the error in prediction was found to be within 4%. The percentage error was 2.4%, 4.95%, and 0.93% with respect to BTE, UHC, and NOx. For the future work, the combination of different biodiesel blends from various sources can be performed to obtain improved results. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the 1000-seed weight (M1000) and oil content of seeds of canola (Brassica napus L.), safflower (Carthamus tinctorius), crambe (Crambe abyssinica Hochst), flax (Linum usitatissimum) and radish (Raphanus sativus L.), grown in fall/winter at four locations in the State of Parana (Brazil) with varying edaphoclimatic features, and intended for the production of biodiesel. The weight of the 1000 seeds (M1000) measurement was conducted using an electronic counter (ESC 2008 SANICK). Seed moisture content was determined using the oven drying method at 105 °C. The Soxhlet method was used to extract and quantify the oil. The weight of the 1000 seeds was higher for canola, safflower and crambe grown at the Londrina location. At the four locations evaluated, the cultivar that produced seeds with the highest oil content was crambe FMS Brilhante, followed by canola, flax, safflower and radish. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify the edaphoclimatic conditions at the locations, and in particular the temperature, which had no effect on M1000 and oil content. The oilseed plants with the highest M1000 value did not have the highest oil content, and there was an inverse relationship between M1000 and oil content. © 2018

AB  - The interesterification of waste cooking oil (WCO) and ethyl acetate (ETA) are investigated in homogeneous catalyst system using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and acetic acid (CH3COOH). Later on, the subsequent biofuel has been investigated for the combustion characteristics, gaseous and particulate matter related emissions in a single-cylinder agricultural diesel engine. In the reaction, fatty acid ethyl esters were the main product whereas triacetin by-product was formulated in a single phase biofuel. The parameters affected the free fatty acid (FFA) conversion were studied such as catalyst system, molar ratio of ETA:WCO, molar ratio of catalyst:WCO, reaction time, and temperature. The experimental results revealed that NaOH was more favorable than the acid catalyst counterpart. The 92% biofuel yield was reached from the optimization at the NaOH:WCO of 0.015:1 M ratio and the ETA:WCO of 30:1 M ratio at 80 °C in 3 h. In the engine validation at 3.4 and 6.6 bar IMEP loads, 1700 rpm speed, the results from the combustion analysis using an indicating system reveal that the WCO biofuel initiates the combustion faster with pronounce premixed combustion regime than that of diesel fuel. The specific fuel consumption of WCO biofuel was greater, leading to a slight reduction in brake thermal efficiency by 4% and 10% at 3.4 and 6.6 bar IMEP loads, respectively compared with diesel fuel. The nano-particle emissions was characterized by an electrical mobility spectrometer and analyzed in terms of particle number. The total particle number increased with smaller size when fueling with WCO biofuel. In comparison over the loads tested, the total particle number concentrations were in the ranges of 8.1 × 1011 to 1.1 × 1012 m−3 for WCO biofuel and 4.8 × 1011 to 5.7 × 1011 m−3 for diesel fuel. Meanwhile, the particle sizes were in the ranges of 182–251 nm for WCO biofuel and 279–402 nm for diesel fuel. Summarily, for the biofuel production, this homogeneous process is beneficial in terms of low-cost feedstock, glycerol-free and mild reaction condition. © 2018

AB  - Biodiesel production can be the solution to the problem of how to deal with waste cooking oils (WCO) and the associated problem of environmental contamination. Every year, tonnes of WCO are poured into toilets and drains, contaminating water supplies and creating serious problems in waste water treatment plants. WCO is a waste material that can be used to produce biodiesel. The main aim of this study is to determine how the type of WCO (and how much it has been used) affect the quality of the biodiesel obtained. Four types of WCO (sunflower, maize, olive and a blend of soybean, palm and sunflower) with two different levels of degradation were used to produce biodiesel. The WCO were subjected to a transesterification process, using NaOH and methanol as reagents, reaction temperatures of between 50 and 67.5 °C, a 60 min reaction time and magnetic stirring. The quality of the biodiesel that was obtained was measured on the basis of four parameters as set out in the UNE-EN 14214 standard: density at 15 °C, kinematic viscosity at 40 °C, acid number and iodine value. This characterisation forms part of the second aim of this research, namely to determine which types of WCO can produce a quality biodiesel via a single stage transesterification process. The results show that the biodiesel quality is closely related to that of the WCO, and that the transesterification method can be recommended for WCO with densities (at 15 °C) of up to 930 kg/m3, kinematic viscosity (at 40 °C) of up to 38.46 mm2/s, and acid numbers of up to 4.19 mg KOH/g. The production method used is a simple, economic and effective way of adding value to a hazardous and difficult to manage waste material like WCO. © 2018

AB  - The laminar burning velocity of 2-methylfuran was investigated using the constant volume method (CVM) at high initial pressure and temperature conditions. The so-called, linear x(p) approximation and a non-linear analytical x(p) relation were used to study the laminar burning velocities of 2-methylfuran fuel. The CVM results were compared to the constant pressure method (CPM) data and numerical results. The CVM and CPM results showed a consistent trend. A percentage deviation of between −8.9% and 8.2% as well as −6% and 8% were observed at initial pressures of 1 and 2 bar when the CVM results were compared to the CPM data while the difference was between −12% and 6% at 4 bar. The numerical results predicted higher laminar burning velocities at all initial conditions when compared to the CVM results. Laminar burning velocity correlations have been obtained from the combined experimental data as a function of the various unburned mixture pressures and temperatures at equivalence ratios of 0.7–1.4. Laminar burning velocities at high unburned mixture temperature and pressure measurement up to 421 K and 8 bar can be obtained from the few experimental data using the correlation in this study. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work presents a simple and sensitive method to measure in situ free Cu(II) ions in biodiesel using organic-resistant screen-printed gold electrodes (SPGEs) and demonstrates the direct correlation of the content of Cu(II) ions with oxidation stability of biodiesel. Biodiesels contaminated with copper due to corrosion, spiking with standard solutions, and naturally occurring from the oil source, were analyzed after simple dilution in 90% (v/v) ethanol and 10% (v/v) water containing 0.1 mol L−1 HCl as electrolyte (final concentration). Square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry under hydroethanolic media enabled the determination of Cu(II) ions in biodiesel, while the total Cu content was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. The Rancimat method measured the oxidation stability of biodiesels based on induction period (IP) values, and the results indicate a decrease in IP values due to the catalytic effect of copper in biodiesel, which present direct correlation with the free content of Cu(II) rather than the total copper content. Hence, we recommend the measurement of free metal ions in biodiesel to predict its lower oxidation stability using disposable SPGEs for in-loco analysis. This voltammetric sensor responds to Cu(II) ions in hydroethanolic media for 80 consecutive measurements before its replacement and it is considered highly-repetitive (RSD &lt; 5% for n = 10) with a low detection limit (1.5 µg L−1 corresponding to 1.70 µg kg−1). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The objective of the present study is to explore the effects of the minor addition of 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol, classified respectively as aliphatic and aromatic type alcohols based on the classified hydroxyl group position in their molecular structure. Simarouba glauca and diesel blends (B20 and B40) were prepared and tested to study the CI engine performance, emission and combustion characteristics under different load conditions. To each of the four combination fuel samples prepared for B20 and B40, 1-pentanol and benzyl alcohol additives were added at 5% and 10% concentrations by volume. Experimental tests for all of the different fuels were performed in a single cylinder, four-stroke and constant speed CI engine and the engine characteristics were compared with diesel and biofuel blends. The experimental study reveals that the poor performance of B20 and B40 is enhanced with 1-pentanol (P) and benzyl alcohol (Bn) addition. The improvement in performance is considerable with an increase in the concentrations of alcohol in B20 and B40 blends. Higher HC, CO and smoke emissions associated with B20 and B40 blend fuels are reduced with alcohol addition. NOx emissions are also reduced with the addition of alcohol blends and 1-pentanol shows more promising results in terms of low NOx emissions compared to benzyl alcohol. Alcohol addition with B20 and B40 extended the ignition delay period due to low cetane number. However, combustion phasing is reduced as a result of improved combustion. The outcome of this research work is that poor combustion characteristics of the biofuel-diesel blend can be improved with the minor addition of aliphatic and aromatic alcohol. Except for comparatively higher NOx emissions, benzyl alcohol showed promising results in terms of performance parameters like efficiency, emission and combustion improvement. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Understanding spray behaviors is key for the successful employment of high injection pressure systems and biofuels such as 2-methylfuran (MF) and ethanol (ETH) in modern direct-injection gasoline engines. In this present work, the MF spray characteristics in the near-field (up to 1.6 mm) and far-field (up to 48 mm) were experimentally investigated under ultra-high injection pressure of 30, 40 and 50 MPa compared to those of ETH and isooctane (ISO). The effects of injection pressure and fuel properties on the spray morphology, tip penetration and cone angle development have been analyzed. The results showed that MF had a unique spray tip structure with a bubble attached to a mushroom tip at 30 and 40 MPa. The formation of this mushroom tip and bubble was closely related and strongly influenced by the Weber number. Among the three fuels tested, MF presented the lowest spray tip velocity at both near-field and far-field due to its large density. Compared to ETH, MF and ISO always had wider macro cone angles due to their lower viscosity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A series of raw kaolinite-supported SO4 2−/ZnAl2O4 (S/ZA-Kao) macroporous solid acid catalysts were synthesized and applied in esterification of both oleic acid with methanol and acetic acid with n-butanol for the biofuels synthesis. The structures and acidic properties of S/ZA-Kao catalysts were characterized by means of XRD, FE-SEM, EDS, BET, FT-IR (direct and NH3 adsorbed), NH3-TPD, TG and XPS. The results indicated the mass ratio of ZnAl2O4/kaolinite played a significant role in adjusting the active components dispersion, textural and acidic properties. The optimal S/ZA-Kao(6:4) catalysts performed the macroporous structure and the high dispersion of active components, which might be the essential reason for its improved acid sites and reduced limitation of mass transfer. As a result, the macroporous solid acid exhibited superior conversion of 98.2% in acetic acid esterification and 70.1% in oleic acid esterification. The kinetic study demonstrated that the relatively lower values of activation energy over the S/ZA-Kao(6:4) macroporous solid acid, further confirming that the macroporous solid acid was highly efficient for the biofuel synthesis via esterification. Moreover, the further investigation indicated the catalytic activities were closely related to the ratio of Brönsted acid sites on catalysts. Besides, S/ZA-Kao(6:4) macroporous solid acid particularly displayed excellent reusability, which was due to its structural stability and high dispersion of active components. © 2018

AB  - Polyoxymethylene dimethyl ethers (PODEn) is an emerging biofuel that has a great potential to become one of the competitive alternative fuels for diesel engine. In the present study, systematic studies were made to evaluate the influences of PODEn on the physical fuel properties that are routinely used to define the quality of diesel fuels. Such fuel properties were measured for the three (diesel + PODEn) mixtures, diesels, and PODEn. The measured properties included cetane number, lubricity, density, viscosity, solidifying point, cold filter plugging point, flash point, and heat capacity. Comparisons of measured properties of the mixtures and their individual components were made to achieve the following purposes: First, to reveal the changes in the properties of diesels upon the addition of PODEn and in the properties of the (diesel + PODEn) mixtures as the weight percent of PODEn is increased; Second, to see whether or not the addition of PODEn worsens the properties of diesels, in particular, whether or not the measured values of the (diesel + PODEn) mixtures exceed the standard values set by the Beijing-VI. Novel theoretical equations were developed to quantitatively predict the density, viscosity, and heat capacity of the (diesel + PODEn) mixtures in terms of the corresponding properties of the diesel and PODEn. Comparisons were made between measured and predicted properties and the agreements are excellent. © 2018

AB  - Under section 211 of the Clean Air Act, the EPA is required to set renewable fuel percentage standards every year. This action establishes the annual percentage standards for cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel that apply to gasoline and diesel transportation fuel produced or imported in the year 2019. Relying on statutory waiver authority that is available when the projected cellulosic biofuel production volume is less than the applicable volume specified in the statute, EPA is establishing volume requirements for cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel that are below the statutory volume targets. The applicable volume of biomass-based diesel for 2020 is being established. This final rule is effective on 2/11/2019.

AB  - The world today is facing challenging crises like depletion of fossil fuels and environmental pollution. Biofuels can be an alternative solution to fossil fuels. Iran hosts a variety of weather conditions and its soil can grow different types of plants suitable for production of liquid biofuels. In this regard, the present research is an in-depth attempt to explore the potentials of Khuzestan Province as an agriculture hub of Iran to produce liquid biofuels. The studied biodiesel sources included oilseeds, animal fats and fish wastes, and the sources of bioethanol were wheat, sugarcane, sugar beet, rice, barley, maize, alfalfa, potato, grapes, apple, date and other local citrus fruits including orange, grapefruit, sweet lemon, sour lemon and sour orange. Results showed that the province's production potential was 1.04 Gl of bioethanol. A 5% addition of ethanol to gasoline (i.e. E5) can save 63.5 Ml of gasoline throughout the province. The estimated biodiesel production from animal fat- and oil-containing products and fish wastes is about 56 Ml in this province that can supply 2% of its total diesel fuel requirement. The estimated fat-based biodiesel production of Iran is 332.56 million liters. By adding the biodiesel production from oilseeds, Iran can produce 1.27 Gl of biodiesel fuel. This amount can supply 4.2% of the country's total diesel fuel consumption. The results for bioethanol and biodiesel production show promising alternatives. As a result of sound management of agricultural residues, E5 (5% ethanol, 95% gasoline) for SI engines and B2 (2% biodiesel and 98% diesel fuel) for diesel engines can be commercially produced as they impose no modifications to these engines. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Upgrading is a critical step for producing hydrocarbon biofuels. Recently, upgrading algae lipids had attracted a lot of attention, but the attention to aviation biofuel was not enough. Meanwhile, the research of upgrading wet algae lipids was very limited. The hydrogenation characteristics were investigated for lipids derived from extraction of dry and wet algae. Hydrotreating parameters including temperature (270–350 °C) and catalyst loading (10–30%) were investigated and two-stage hydrogenation was conducted at the optimal reaction condition. Two-stage biofuels resulted in lower heteroatoms including O and N both for dry and wet algae lipids. The elemental contents of N were below 0.007% and the O contents were below 0.3%. The heating values were about 46.2 MJ/kg. Both of dry and wet algae lipids can be hydrotreated to aviation biofuel by the two-stage hydrogenation, even though the wet algae lipids contained more carboxylic acid, sterol, and vitamin E than dry algae lipids, which contains more alcohols and esters. The compound of 5-Methyl-3-phenylcyclopent-2-en-1-one is difficult to be upgraded. The content of aromatics and cyclo-paraffins shows a rising trend and some of the aromatics could be upgraded to cyclo-paraffins in the hydrogenation process. In addition, the yield of high-quality biofuel from dry algae lipids is 73.02%, and that is 76.47% for wet algae lipids, which indicated that the wet route hydrogenation might have an advantage over the dry route. The hydrotreating results of model compound cholesterol indicated that much amounts of aromatics was generated. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Among the new technologies developed for the heavy-duty fleet, the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) aftertreatment system in standard Diesel engines associated with biodiesel/diesel mixtures is an alternative in use to control the legislated pollutants emission. Nevertheless, there is an absence of knowledge about the synergic behaviour of these devices and biodiesel blends regarding the emissions of unregulated substances as the Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and Nitro-PAHs, both recognized for their carcinogenic and mutagenic effects on humans. Therefore, the goal of this study is the quantification of PAHs and Nitro-PAHs present to total particulate matter (PM) emitted from the Euro V engine fuelled with ultra-low sulphur diesel and soybean biodiesel in different percentages, B5 and B20. PM sampling was performed using a Euro V – SCR engine operating in European Stationary Cycle (ESC). The PAHs and Nitro-PAHs were extracted from PM using an Accelerated Solvent Extractor and quantified by GC–MS. The results indicated that the use of SCR and the largest fraction of biodiesel studied may suppress the emission of total PAHs. The Toxic Equivalent (TEQ) was lower when using 20% biodiesel, in comparison with 5% biodiesel on the SCR system, reaffirming the low toxicity emission using higher percentage biodiesel. The data also reveal that use of SCR, on its own, suppress the Nitro-PAHs compounds. In general, the use of larger fractions of biodiesel (B20) coupled with the SCR aftertreatment showed the lowest PAHs and Nitro-PAHs emissions, meaning lower toxicity and, consequently, a potential lower risk to human health. From the emission point of view, the results of this work also demonstrated the viability of the Biodiesel programs, in combination with the SCR systems, which does not require any engine adaptation and is an economical alternative for the countries (Brazil, China, Russia, India) that have not adopted Euro VI emission standards. © 2018

AB  - Theportable measurement emissions system was used to test the real road emission characteristics and economics of using different fuels for two China VI buses and two China III buses. Based on the vehicle studied in this paper the results show that compared with the use of Beijing VI diesel, the CO emissions from the use of B5 biodiesel by the China VI bus decreased by 33.1%, the NOx increased by 15.6%, and the PN decreased by 13.1%. The CO emission factor of B5 biodiesel for four buses was 29.5% lower than that of Beijing VI diesel, the NOx emission factor was increased by 12.7%, and the PN emission factor was reduced by 9.1%. Through the analysis of CO2, the CO2 emission factor of B5 biodiesel increased by 11.3% compared with Beijing VI diesel, and the fuel consumption was calculated by using the carbon balance calculation method. The fuel density were comprehensively considered, and the results showed that the fuel consumption of B5 compared to Beijing VI was increased by 11.51% over a hundred kilometers, and the overall difference was significant. Subsequent research is needed to study the impact of other physical and chemical indicators such as oil calorific value on fuel economy. ©2018, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - In 2016, the global environmental impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissionswas 49.3 gigatons CO2 equivalent. Worldwide, the transportation sector is responsible for 14% of GHG. Electric vehicles (EV) powered by less-polluting energy sources are one way to reduce the environmental impact of the transportation sector, but immediate transportation demands cannot be met by existing EV technology. Use of less polluting biofuel in place of petroleum-based gasoline or diesel fuel to power the existing transportation fleet is a widely accepted transitional solution, including in the Republic of Korea. The purpose of this research is to investigate approaches to biofuels in the US and the UK in order to evaluate Korea's current energy policies related to use of biofuels and to make recommendations for strengthening Korea's energy policy. This article addresses only policies for use of biodiesel rather than ethanol (widely used in the US) because ethanol is not used in Korea. This research shows that Korea calculates GHG using the principle that biofuel is carbon neutral, but energy policies in the US and the UK treat biofuel as not entirely carbon neutral. Korea should examine how to calculate GHG from biodiesel according to the standard set by the UK in order to work toward a more environmentally sustainable energy policy. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This study spatially estimated degraded lands in Indonesia that have limited functions for food production, carbon storage, and conservation of biodiversity and native vegetation and examined their suitability to grow biodiesel species (Calophyllum inophyllum, Pongamia pinnata, and Reutealis trisperma) and biomass species (Calliandra calothyrsus and Gliricidia sepium). Results showed ~3.5 million ha of degraded lands potentially suitable for these species in Indonesia. With the all-five-species scenario, these lands had the potential to produce 1105 PJ year-1 of biomass and 3 PJ year-1 of biodiesel. With the biodiesel-only-species scenario, these lands showed the potential to produce 10 PJ year-1 of biodiesel. Despite this energy potential, however, the land sizes were too small to support economies of scale for biofuel production. The study findings contribute to identifying lands with limited functions, modeling the growth of biofuel species on regional lands, and estimating carbon stocks of restored degraded lands in Indonesia. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This research aimed to determine the influence of process parameters on yields of biofuel production by hydrocracking of waste virgin coconut oil using HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst and to determine statistical relationship of yields of biofuels with the parameters by Pearson’s correlation. The various operating parameters in batch reactor were a reaction temperature (350-400°C), an initial hydrogen pressure (20-40 bar), and a reaction time (1-3 h). The highest yields of gasoline (6.79 wt%) and kerosene (31.38 wt%) were achieved under a temperature at 400°C, initial hydrogen pressure at 40 bar, and a reaction time of 3 h. The highest yield of diesel of 58.62 wt% was achieved at a reaction time of 1 h under temperature 400°C and initial hydrogen pressure 40 bar. Using Pearson’s correlation data analysis, the correlation coefficient between two variables (the yield of biofuel and the operating condition) showed strong dependence of reaction temperature and time on yields of hydrocarbon chains of various length. Yields of shorter hydrocarbon chains such as biogasoline and biokerosene required higher reaction temperature and longer reaction time and vice versa. However, pressure dependence on yields of biofuels was insignificant. © 2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rising level of CO2, increasing demands and price of fossil fuel, generation of waste are the major challenges of the modern society. Biorefinery approach for production of biodiesel using waste as feedstock could be an alternative of these problems. The present research demonstrates the use of municipal secondary sludge as growth media for production of biodiesel by chemolithotrophic, oleaginous bacteria Serratia sp. ISTD04. The characterization of bacteria and biodiesel was performed by TEM and GC–MS, NMR respectively. The hydrocarbon range, C-7 to C-25 and suitable saturated and unsaturated fatty acid composition, makes it an impending fuel. Optimization of in-situ transesterification process parameters increased the yield by 25% and similarly increases in transesterification efficiency from 74% to 94%. The fuel properties (Total acid value, Cetane number, Cloud point, Pour point, Heating value, Kinematic viscosity) of 5% blended biodiesel was analyzed by ASTM standard methods and its shows good fuel behavior. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Heart of Rajasthan, Ajmer with the 8481 sq. km. area is located in the north west of India between 25 0 38 “ and 26 0 58 “ north 75 0 22” E longitude, surrounded all sides by Aravalli mountains. Serpentile hills (Nag Pahar ) protects it from becoming desert. Pushkar means “blue lotus”, is old pilgrim near Ajmer. Ajmer also famous for Mayo college, Anasagar, Foysagar, Soniji ki Nasiyaan, Akbari fort Museum, Nareli jain Teerth and the second holiest shrine after Mecca, is khawaja Moinuddin chisti’s Dargah. Ajmer is located in semi-arid zone so the flora and fauna also adapted to survive in the dry,waterless region of the state. Petroleum has been used as transportation fuel for more than last 100 years, but it is not fulfilling the need of increasing population, also cause Air pollution. LPG, CNG, Diesel are also used as Fuel. Most promising replacement come from organic biomass crops such as Corn(Zea mays), Rapeseed (Brassica napus), Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum), Palm oil(Arecaceae), Jatropha (Jatropha curcas), Soybean (Glycine max), Cotton seed (Gossypium arboretum), Sunflower (Helianthus annuus),Wheat (Triticum aestivum) and Switch grass (Panicum virgatum). Biofuels are better than fossil fuels. because: 1. Biofuels are renewable. 2. They lower toxic emission. 3. They burn clean. 4. No need to import them. 5. They can be grown locally and produced locally. Ethanol is produced from plants and mingled with petroleum diesel and gasoline.Green fuel, biofuel is distilled from plants and animals. It is environment friendly and through fermentation to create ethanol. Oil producing plants, Vegetable oil, coconut oil can be used as fossil oil to create diesel that can be burn by vehicle. One more fungus Botryococcus braunii which store more fat (tree fungus ) can also provide green fuel. The organism found in Patagonia rain forest produce a mixture of chemicals that is similar to diesel. The fungus Gliocladium roseum grow inside Ulmo tree (Eucryphia cordifolia) North Patagonia produce large amount of long chain hydrocarbon similar to fossil fuel. Green algaes can also produce biofuels, 01 acre of algae can produce 200 times as much oil as 01 acre corn. Corn (Zea mays), Rapeseed (Brassica napus), Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum), can be used as biofuels in Ajmer, Rajasthan. Hydrogen is also a clean fuel, when used as a fuel produces water only. Thus Biofuel can be produced by green plants which are renewable and clean. Comparative account of biofuel plants and fossil fuels are studied in the present paper with special reference to Rajasthan. © BEIESP.

AB  - This study investigates the thermochemical properties of the separate components of jatropha biomass residues of Nigerian origin towards bio-oil production. The biomass residues (Jatropha curcas fruit shells and seed coat) were obtained from their mature jatropha fruits and subjected to physico-chemical characterization (structural composition analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, proximate and ultimate analyses). The structural compositions (extractives, hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin contents) of jatropha fruit shell and jatropha seed coat were 3%, 34.0%, 40.0% and 12.7%, and 42.3%, 32.5%, 10.5% and 5.7%, respectively. The thermogravimetric analysis showed that the ash contents of jatropha seed coat and jatropha fruit shell were 0.8% and 15.4%, respectively. The carbon contents were 48.3% and 41.5%, while measured calorific values were 20.06 MJ/kg and 17.14 MJ/kg for jatropha seed coat and fruit shell, respectively. The carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulphur contents were found comparable with those in the literature. This study indicated that the thermochemical properties of the Nigerian Jatropha fruit and seeds residues were comparable with literature values and residues were found suitable for bio-oil production. © 2018, Joint Center on Global Change and Earth System Science of the University of Maryland and Beijing Normal University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Mali has introduced a program to produce biodiesel using jatropha, a shrub widely available throughout the country. The aim of the program is to partially substitute diesel, which is entirely supplied through imports, with domestically produced biodiesel. In this paper, we use a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and a microsimulation model to analyze macroeconomic and distributional impact of a hypothetical expansion of jatropha based biodiesel industry in Mali. We find that the expansion of biodiesel industry (i.e., both jatropha farming and oil conversion), would increase GDP, though slightly, if idle lands are utilized for jatropha cultivation. However, the expansion of jatropha would cause slight loss in GDP if the existing agriculture land is used for jatropha cultivation. The distributional results are slightly different. We find that rural poverty would decrease no matter whether idle lands or existing agricultural lands are used for jatropha plantation, although the percentage reductions in rural poverty are higher in the former compared to the latter case. Our results indicate that if governments plan to promote jatropha biodiesel they should not allow jatropha to compete with food staples on the existing land. Policies should be targeted to utilize the idle lands which have not been used for any productive use. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The growth in environment pollution as a result of fossil fuels increased consumption has led scientists to focus on biofuels such as biodiesel and bioalcohols. The ternary blends of bioalcohols with fossil fuels and biodiesel show better properties as fuels for diesel engine, than binary blends of biodiesel with diesel fuel. The purpose of this work is to report experimental density data for biodiesel+diesel fuel+isopropanol pseudo-ternary system at atmospheric pressure, covering the whole composition range and for temperature ranging from 293.15 to 323.15K.

AB  - Catalytic reduction of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), deemed as one of the key bio-based platform compounds, is a very promising pathway for the upgrading of biomass to biofuels and value-added chemicals. Conventional hydrogenation of HMF is mainly conducted over precious metal catalysts with high-pressure hydrogen. Here, a highly active, sustainable, and facile catalytic system composed of K2CO3, Ph2SiH2, and bio-based solvent 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) was developed to be efficient for the reduction of HMF. At a low temperature of 25◦C, HMF could be completely converted to 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) in a good yield of 94% after 2 h. Moreover, a plausible reaction mechanism was speculated, where siloxane in situ formed via hydrosilylation was found to be the key species responsible for the high reactivity. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Based on many regulations the biofuels are widely used in combustion engines. The operational parameters, such as performance parameters or emission production, are often monitored. The essence of changes to these operational parameters is related to the effect of biofuels on the course of cylinder pressure inside the combustion chamber. The contribution deals with the effect of biobutanol-sunflower oil-diesel fuel blends on the performance parameters, the behaviour of the cylinder pressure of the compression ignition engine during combustion, and exhaust gas temperature. Biobutanol-sunflower oil-diesel fuel blends in ratios of 10-20-70% and 20-20-60% were used as test fuels, with diesel fuel used as a reference. Turbocharged four-cylinder inline CI engine Zetor 1204 installed in the tractor Zetor Forterra 8642 was used for measurement. Based on the results, it can be stated that with higher amount of butanol in the fuel mixture, the maximum value of cylinder pressure decreases, especially at a high engine load. © 2018 Jakub Čedík et al., published by Sciendo 2018.

AB  - In this study, a novel microalgal strain, Desmodesmus sp. KAERI-NJ5, was isolated, identified, and evaluated as a candidate for biodiesel feedstock. In a preliminary study, the effects of four general microalgal growth factors, including temperature, pH, light intensity, and concentration of nitrogen source (KNO 3 ), on the microalgal photoautotrophic growth were evaluated. With the exception of light intensity, the growth factors needed to be optimized for the microalgal biomass production. Optimization was done using response surface methodology. The optimal conditions for biomass production were pH 6.54, 27.66℃, and 0.52 g/l KNO 3 . The biomass production at the optimal conditions was 1.55 g/l, which correlated well with the predicted value of 1.5 g/l. The total lipid and fatty acid methyl ester contents of the cells grown at the optimal conditions were 49% and 21.2% of cell dry weight, respectively. To increase the lipid content of the biomass, microalgae were challenged by nitrogen starvation. Enhancement of total lipid and fatty acid content up to 52.02% and 49%, respectively, were observed. Lipid analysis of the nitrogen-starved cells revealed that C16 and C18 species accounted for 95.9% of the total fatty acids. Among them, palmitic acid (46.17%) and oleic acid (39.43%) dominantly constituted the algal fatty acids. These results suggest Desmodesmus sp. KAERI-NJ5 as a promising feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2018, The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - Jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) is an oil seed species, adaptive to different climate and soil conditions. It is known due to its high-oil-content seed, being an option for biodiesel production and presenting competitive yields under irrigated condition. This study was developed in an experimental area located in a humid subtropical region of Brazil and the objective was to evaluate Jatropha’s energy balance under irrigation and rainfed condition during the first four years of its cycle. The input and output energy values were determined by multiplying the material amount by the related energy conversion factors. These values were used to determine the energy indices: energy balance (EB), and energy return on investment (EROI) for both conditions. Fertilizers had the highest contribution on energy input (42.58 GJ ha-1, 37.7% in irrigated area and 45.9% in rainfed area) followed by fuel consumption (32.96 GJ ha-1, 29.8% in irrigated area and 35.5% in rainfed area). Total energy input for the second, third and fourth years in the irrigated area was 114.58 GJ ha-1 (which 19.3% was due to the irrigation) and 92.51 GJ ha-1 in rainfed area. The output energy flows were 73.78 and 47.88 GJ ha-1 for irrigated and rainfed areas, respectively. In this study, negative value for EB and unviable EROI (&lt;1) were obtained. However, EROI showed evolution when evaluated year-by-year, reaching values above 1 in the 4th year for both systems, as expected from perennial crops. Considering just the period evaluated, this crop was not sustainable for energy production, but this is a long lifespan crop and for the following years it is expected yield levels like the last one and values positive of energy balance. © 2018, Int.

AB  - Modern research in the field of renewable energy determines the directions of practical implementation of different energy sources. The possibility of rapid practical application of such results is crucial for economic growth. The paper critically analyses the advanced publications as the results of fundamental researches for different directions of renewable energy and identifies the key points that have influenced the practical development of each of these areas. It is shown how scientific research in different countries after the practical implementation affects their economic development. The key players in the global renewable energy market have been determined. Among low-income economies, Ukraine has been considered as a country that has at the same time almost blank market for renewable energy and a high-level research potential based on a large number of universities and research institutes. The example of Ukraine shows two problems typical for countries with a weak economy: (1) the existence of a large gap between the results of scientific research and the possibility of their implementation; (2) the availability of advanced results in the directions that, due to the need for significant investments, are very difficult to be implemented practically (materials science for solar power, thermoelectricity, new types of batteries, etc.) and almost no research in the industries that are intensively developing and are potentially economically profitable (biofuels, bioenergy from agricultural waste, wind energy). Such data can help foreign companies to enter the Ukrainian market or facilitate the commercialization of research results of Ukrainian scientists. © 2018 International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.

AB  - To obtain drop-in fuel properties from 3rd generation biomass, we herein report the catalytic hydrotreatment of microalgae biocrude, produced from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Spirulina. Our contribution focuses on the effect of temperature, initial H2 pressure, and residence time on the removal of heteroatoms (O and N) in a batch hydrotreating setup. In contrast to common experimental protocols for hydrotreating at batch scale, we devised a set of two-level factorial experiments and studied the most influential parameters affecting the removal of heteroatoms. It was found that up to 350◦C, the degree of deoxygenation (de-O) is mainly driven by temperature, whereas the degree of denitrogenation (de-N) also relies on initial H2 pressure and temperature-pressure interaction. Based on this, complete deoxygenation was obtained at mild operating conditions (350◦C), reaching a concurrent 47% denitrogenation. Moreover, three optimized experiments are reported with 100% removal of oxygen. In addition, the analysis by GC-MS and Sim-Dis gives insight to the fuel quality. The distribution of heteroatom N in lower (&lt;340◦C) and higher (&gt;340◦C) fractional cuts is studied by a fractional distillation unit following ASTM D-1160. Final results show that 63–68% of nitrogen is concentrated in higher fractional cuts. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Leather processing for commercial purposes involves going through a set of complex and laborious operations, resulting in over 70% waste relative to the initial feedstock; a quarter of this waste is produced in Europe. Worldwide there are about 36,000 companies active in this sector, generating a turnover of almost 48 billion euros. As in any industrial sector, waste recovery is a highly researched topic, with alternatives for its use being constantly considered. One of the most interesting solutions to this problem consists of using part of the waste for power applications. For instance, the 10% fats from total animal waste could well be employed to power diesel engines, both in raw state or as biodiesel. The remainder, which contains mostly proteins, can be exploited to obtain biogas through anaerobic digestion. This paper presents the results of experimental determinations on the combustion of animal fats and compares it to other biofuels, such as vegetable oils and solid biomass. The advantages of co-firing hydrogen-rich gas (HRG) and vegetable biomass are also analyzed. According to the presented results, combustion of the investigated fuels has a lower impact on the environment, with the concentration of pollutants in the flue gases being low. Thus, the paper proves that all the proposed solutions are ecological alternatives for biomass exploitation for energy recovery purposes, based on comparing the results in terms of pollutant emissions. This paper provides qualitative and quantitative perspectives on multiple alternatives of energy recovery from biomass resources, while also briefly describing the methods and equipment used to this end. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Jatropha curcas is a promising feedstock for biofuel production because its oil is highly suitable for processing bio-jet fuels and biodiesel. However, Jatropha exhibits a long juvenile stage in subtropical areas. miR172, a conserved small non-proteincoding RNA molecule with 21 nucleotides, regulates a wide range of developmental processes. To date, however, no studies have examined the function of miR172 in Jatropha. There are five miR172 precursors encoding two mature miR172s in Jatropha, which are expressed in all tissues, with the highest expression level in leaves, and the levels are up-regulated with age. Overexpression of JcmiR172a resulted in early flowering, abnormal flowers, and altered leaf morphology in transgenic Arabidopsis and Jatropha. The expression levels of miR172 target genes were down-regulated, and the flower identity genes were up-regulated in the JcmiR172a-overexpressing transgenic plants. Interestingly, we showed that JcmiR172 might be involved in regulation of stem vascular development through manipulating the expression of cellulose and lignin biosynthesis genes. Overexpression of JcmiR172a enhanced xylem development and reduced phloem and pith development. This study helped elucidate the functions of miR172 in perennial plants, a known age-related miRNA involved in the regulation of perennial plant phase change and organ development. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - This study aimed at comparing the growth and physiological changes in Jatropha curcas L. (jatropha or physic nut) young plants fertilized or not with a commercial product based on a micronutrient delivery system (MDS), under different doses of NPK. Measurements of growth, chlorophyll content, and leaf gas exchange were performed in the greenhouse, where plants were arranged in a split-split plot design. Plants were grown for 120 days in 3.9 L pots containing local soil, with or without MDS (main plot), combined with NPK doses (0; 1.8; 4.7 and 7.4 g L-1) in subplots. Dose-response curves showed that most variables were positively responsive to NPK doses in plants growing without MDS, whereas slight responses or even opposite behavior was observed in MDS-fertilized plants. MDS application under low NPK doses resulted in higher biomass allocation in leaves and roots, increases in number of leaves and chlorophyll content, plant height, stem diameter, shoot and root dry weight, stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, leaf transpiration, and water use efficiency, as well as decreases in intercellular CO2 in the leaf and vapor-pressure deficit. The enhanced biomass allocation, photosynthesis and gas exchange in MDS-supplemented plants indicates the relevant role played by this fertilizer in jatropha metabolism, resulting in more vigorous plants. © 2018, Universidade Federal de Uberlandia.

AB  - Laboratory tests simulating the process of polluting stormwater with fuels and subsequent treating in a separator of oil derivative substances were conducted. Diesel oil (pure diesel oil abbreviated as DERV – diesel-engine road vehicle), diesel oil with bio-components, and pure biofuel – BIO100 were the subject of the tests. Depending on the kind of fuel, the differences in the concentration of oil derivatives in the treated samples were observed. The total reduction in contaminants after 2 min of separation amounted to 91% for BIO100, about 94% for DERV with bio-components, and almost 99% for DERV, however, after 10 s of separation, reduction of DERV was about 90%, whereas, reduction of BIO100 was only 2%. The basic parameters influencing the flotation process were also measured, being the interfacial tension and zeta potential. Depending on the type of fuel, the differences in zeta potential amounted to approximately 26% and differences in interfacial tension reached almost 40%. Such differences may indicate the different susceptibility of oily wastewater to gravity separation. It indicates the necessity for examination of whether the assumptions used for separator design will also be correct in the case of treating stormwater polluted with commercial fuels, including biofuels, available on the market. © 2018 Desalination Publications.

AB  - The target of the Indonesian government in 2025 is increasing the use of renewable energy up to 23%, one part of potential renewable energy in Indonesia is biofuel. Biofuel requires raw materials of plant or animal oil with or without catalyst, it does not require the raw material of ethanol or methanol. The product is similar to gasoline and diesel that came from crude oil. Potential oil-producing plants in Indonesia are Palm Oil and Nyamplung (Calophyllum inophyllum L.). The process of making biofuel from this material is done by heating the reactor or furnace with temperature range of 350-500°C. To reach the stability of furnace temperature, it requires temperature control systems and one of them is PID. Arduino microcontroller is an open source and user friendly platform for hardware and software. The control system that designed by using arduino is capable to control the furnace temperature from 200°C to 400°C and it is using a 6000 watt heater. The best system response is achieved when Kp=15, Ki = 15 and Kd = 1. With these parameter values, the system has the lowest overshoot response of 16%, so it is safe for biofuel furnace, even though the rise time value is 146 s, settling time of 429 and steady state error is equal to 2.87%. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.

AB  - Vegetable oils are desirable as alternate fuels with ignition quality equivalent to diesel and its combustion characteristics, but unsuitable for direct operation in compression ignition (CI) engines as fuel because of their high viscosity in nature. Hence, fuel and engine based modifications are being tried to improve the performance of the CI engines. The high viscous oil does not evaporate quickly even after it is injected into the hot combustion chamber. Therefore, converting the high viscous vegetable oil into biodiesel improves the evaporation and hence combustion. There are two major problems related to the use of biodiesel as fuel are its oxidation stability and cold flow performance. In this investigation, castor oil, having a very high viscosity of 226.2 cSt at ambient temperature, is used as a fuel. The test results show a significant increase in the brake thermal efficiency from 23.5% (neat castor oil) to 29.7% with castor oil biodiesel (COME) operation. CO and HC emissions of the engine are less with castor oil biodiesel. The smoke emission reduces marginally with castor oil biodiesel to 69% at full load, but it is still higher than diesel fuel 57%. © 2018 Technoscience Publications. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Use of biodiesel in compression ignition engine is widely recognized due to its reduced exhaust emissions, enhanced carbon dioxide cycle, less toxicity and improved safety. Biodiesel derived from vegetable and biological sources encompasses a substantial quantity of saturated FFA, which leads to increased kinematic viscosity. The present work aims at comparing the feasibility of using the methyl esters of cottonseed and alga (Stoechospermum marginatum) oil separately in a compression ignition engine. The bio-oils were transesterified through base catalysed transesterification using methanol and potassium hydroxide as catalyst. Addition of n-butanol up to 10% improves the physico-chemical properties of fuel, thereby promoting enhanced combustion. The test fuels were formulated on analysing their stability through Taguchi’s approach in design of the experiments. The L9 orthogonal array show cast a stable blend as mineral diesel 80%, biodiesel 20% and n-butanol oxygenate 10% for 21 days without precipitation. The performance and emission analysis of the test fuel blends showed higher brake thermal efficiency with lower brake specific energy consumption for algal biodiesel blends. The oxygenated blends of algal biodiesel emitted lesser carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and smoke in comparison with cottonseed biodiesel. © 2018 Technoscience Publications. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - In this study, the evaluation of the catalytic behavior of several wild bacterial strains in the 1,3-selective ethanolysis of triglycerides with ethanol to produce a new type of biodiesel (Ecodiesel) that integrates glycerol as monoacylglycerols was carried out. The Ecodiesel production not only avoids the elimination of glycerol, which is largely generated as a by-product in the biodiesel industry, but also results in an increase in the biofuel yield. The wild microbial strain samples were obtained from several lipophilic organisms. In addition to evaluate the enzymatic extracts, the minimum grade of purification of the strains, necessary to obtain similar results to those attained with commercial lipases was studied. This purification treatment included a dialysis followed by a lyophilization process. Such extracts were directly used as biocatalysts in the transesterification reaction of sunflower oil with ethanol, attaining much better results (yield close to 100%) than those obtained with strains which were not submitted to the purification process (yields lower than 10%). Furthermore, the results here obtained are similar to those obtained with commercial lipases but were achieved under mild conditions and lower reaction time (2 h). In addition, the stability of the enzymatic extracts was corroborated by subsequent reactions, showing no loss of activity. Thus, this study brings to light that enzymatic extracts obtained by a very simple purification process can be economically competitive with the conventional biodiesel production methods. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Most biofuel companies are in a small scale with short experience of operating the entire supply chain. In order to compete with existing fossil fuel competitors, renewable companies should be more responsive to demand. It is financially important to reflect this in the decision supporting system of the company. This paper addresses an evolutionary algorithm based methodology for the distribution problem of renewable energies. A numerical example was presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed methodology with some remarks. © 2018 Wideochirurgia I Inne Techniki Maloinwazyjne. All rights reserved.

AB  - We developed a project during an undergraduate course (advanced experimental chemistry) on the microwave-assisted synthesis of biodiesel (BD), via base-catalyzed transesterification of coconut fat (CF) and soybean oil (SO) by ethanol, followed by product analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Our goals were to introduce a problem with relevant socio-economic impact (production of BD); to discuss and compare methods for biofuel analysis, and to gain insight into transesterification mechanism as an important example of acyl-transfer reactions. Comparison of both BFs showed clear difference in fatty acid composition; that from CF contains shorter, saturated chains (mainly ethyl dodecanoate- and tetradecanoate), whereas biodiesel from SO is essentially composed of longer unsaturated chains (e.g., ethyl oleate and linoleate). The project takes eight hours to complete, is conceptually simple, being suitable for inclusion in the undergraduate science curriculum. © 2018 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - A protein-rich microalgae species Arthrospira platensis was pyrolyzed in a semi batch reactor using two clay catalysts kaolin and calcium bentonite to understand the effects of temperature and catalysts on the yield and composition of bio oil. The optimum temperature for a higher bio oil yield of 55.9 wt. % was 500°C. The bio-oil yield decreased in presence of both the clay catalysts. The effect was more pronounced with kaolin as compared to calcium bentonite. The energy recovery in kaolin catalyzed pyrolysis was lower than thermal and calcium bentonite catalyzed reactions. The FTIR and GC/MS results of the algal bio-oil conform the presence of nitrogenous compounds, alcohols, acids, esters, phenols, hydrocarbons, carbonyl compounds and aromatic compounds. The aromatics fractions in the bio-oil increased significantly in presence of clay catalysts. The bio-oil was slightly alkaline with higher HHV, comparative specific gravity and viscosity as that of fossil fuel. © 2018 World Research Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present experimental investigation aims at production of second-generation biofuels from straight vegetable oils (SVOs) and carrying out their performance assessment in a compression ignition (CI) engine. The intended second-generation biofuels, i.e., deoxygenated vegetable oils (DVOs), were produced through catalytic deoxygenation of palm and karanja SVOs over 5 wt% Pd/C catalyst under an inert (N2) atmosphere using a batch autoclave reactor. Fuel characterization and elemental analysis were carried out for the produced DVOs to evaluate various fuel properties. In order to evaluate the fuel composition and presence of diesel range aliphatic hydrocarbons, GC-MS and FT-NMR tests were carried out. The engine performance and emission characteristics with the DVOs were evaluated in a developed experimental diesel engine setup. Results showed that the DVOs exhibit better engine performance, lower emissions, and marginally higher NOx emissions compared to those with diesel fuel. In order to establish the DVOs as possible CI engine fuels, the performance and emission characteristics with the DVOs were compared against those with their corresponding established B20 biodiesel blends. The comparative assessment revealed that the engine performance and emission characteristics with the DVOs are superior compared to those with the corresponding B20 biodiesel blends. Especially, the NOx emissions with the DVOs are significantly lower as compared to their corresponding B20 biodiesel blends. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A comparative life cycle assessment of the sugarcane biorefinery in different conceptual arrangements was conducted considering four different alternatives with increasing utilization of byproducts. The first alternative with the least use of byproducts was taken as the base case and the fourth alternative was a completely integrated plant with gradually enhanced and efficient use of byproducts. The functional unit was defined as the production of 1 t of sugar in the biorefinery complex. The calculations were performed for the eight most relevant impact categories including global warming, freshwater eutrophication, terrestrial acidification, terrestrial ecotoxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity, human carcinogenic toxicity, mineral resource scarcity, and fossil resource scarcity. Overall, it was observed that for most of the impact categories, the values were progressively reduced with an increased use of byproducts (i.e., prevention of cane burning and its recovery; filter cake, ash, wastewater, and sludge as fertilizer; bagasse and cane trash for high-pressure cogeneration; ethanol as biofuel and recovery of CO2; biogas for waste to energy production). In general, it could be concluded that an enhanced and efficient use of byproducts would significantly improve the environmental performance of the biorefinery complex. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Malaysian Dolomite has shown potential deoxygenation catalyst due to high capacity in removing oxygen compound and produce high quality of biofuel with desirable lighter hydrocarbon (C8-C24). The performance of this catalyst was compared with several commercial catalysts in catalytic pyrolysis of Waste Cooking Oil. Calcination at 900 °C in N2 produced catalyst with very high activity due to decomposition of CaMg(CO3)2 phase and formation of MgO-CaO phase. The liquid product showed similar chemical composition of biofuel in the range of gasoline, kerosene and diesel fuel. Furthermore, Malaysian Dolomite showed high reactivity with 76.51 % in total liquid hydrocarbon and the ability to convert the oxygenated compounds into CO2, CO, CH4, H2, hydrocarbon fuel gas, and H2O. Moreover, low acid value (33 mg KOH/g) and low aromatic hydrocarbon content were obtained in the biofuel. Thus, local calcined carbonated material has a potential to act as catalyst in converting waste cooking oil into biofuel. Copyright © 2018 BCREC Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - Utilization of halotolerant algal strains and saline water resources is necessary to increase the areas available for algal cultivation and to mitigate fresh water use issues. However, the added salt content from salt-water algae cultivation may impact downstream biomass pretreatment and conversion processes especially when combined with the salt that is generated as part of our Combined Algal Processing (CAP) scheme which includes pretreatment with sulfuric acid for cell disruption and carbohydrate hydrolysis. Here we compared the pretreatment, fermentation, and lipid extraction processes on salt-water versus fresh-water grown algal biomass. Response surface pretreatment plots showed that a broader range of conditions for the salt-water grown algae species yield &gt;90% sugar yield compared to a narrower range for fresh-water species. Despite this, we anticipated that high salt content would inhibit fermentation of algal sugars, a key element the CAP scheme and sought to reduce the formation of additional salt from pretreatment and neutralization by substituting oxalic acid for sulfuric acid. The sugar release response surface for oxalic acid was of a different shape than that of sulfuric acid but achieved &gt;90% sugar release at 2% acid. Fermentation results showed that for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the added salts had minimal impact on sugar utilization rates or ethanol production. For Actinobacillus succinogenes however, a significant delay was observed due to the additional salts and fermentation was further delayed or inhibited by pretreatment with oxalic acid. This was remedied by removal of the oxalic acid either by the addition of CaCO3 or trioctylamine whereupon fermentation rates recovered. Differences in lipid extraction yields were observed from the fermentation broth between the salt-water grown and fresh-water grown algal biomass and was species dependent. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - In the process of creating eco-friendly environment and conserving fossil fuels for the future generations, biodiesel has been chosen as a good substitute for diesel. It is a proven fact that biodiesel operated diesel engine can deliver comparable results with diesel. The present work focuses on TSME20 (tamarind seed methyl ester 20% + diesel 80%) as a renewable fuel, and its performance and emission results are analyzed at different exhaust gas recirculation rates and various injection pressures. The process is done in two stages. Firstly, experiments are conducted on TSME20 operated diesel engine at three injection pressures (180, 200, and 220 bar), and the results are analyzed. From the experimental results, improved efficiency by 2.29% and reduced emissions, such as hydrocarbon, smoke, and carbon monoxide, by 53.84, 56.25, and 75.15% are observed at the peak load for the increased injection pressure (220 bar) over 200 bar except NOx levels, which are found high by 11% compared to 200-bar injection pressure. Secondly, tests are again performed at the optimal condition of 220-bar injection pressure with the exhaust gas re-circulation (EGR) rates at different levels, i.e., 10 and 20%. The test results reveal that the addition of 10% EGR to the engine operating at 220 bar counteracts the release of NOx levels, which are found reduced by 80.5% over standard conditions without much compromise in engine performance. Also, the combustion characteristics of diesel engine at 220-bar fuel injection pressure of tamarind biodiesel blend showed enhancement when compared to other fuel injection pressures. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The interest in research on alcohol-based biofuels is on the rise. Fusel oil is a long-chain alcohol and a by-product of bioethanol synthesis. This study analyzed the effects of blended levels of fusel oil and biodiesel in diesel fuel on the performance and exhaust emissions of a single-cylinder diesel engine. The effects of input parameters (i.e., fusel oil content (%), biodiesel content (%), engine speed (rpm), and engine load (%), each at five levels) on response parameters (i.e., power, torque, fuel consumption, and emission factors, namely NOX, UHC, CO, and CO2) were investigated. Different levels were used for analyzing fusel oil (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20%), biodiesel (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20%), engine load (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%), and engine speed (1400, 1700, 2000, 2300, and 2600 rpm). Response surface method (RSM) was employed to maximize engine performance and minimize exhaust emissions. A blend of D90F5 B5 (5% fusel oil, 5% biodiesel, and 90% petro-diesel) and engine speed of 2026 rpm at load 46% were predicted to be an optimal value. Using a 72% desirability function, optimum results for torque (14.2 Nm), power (3.37 kW), and brake-specific fuel consumption (356.9 g/kWh) were also obtained from RSM. Based on the optimized inputs, the optimized values of different output pollutants were 0.14 vol.% for CO, 1.62 vol.% for CO2, 23.7 ppm for UHC, and 85.17 ppm for NOX. The result illustrated that use of fusel oil decreased NOX emissions up to 20%, while UHC and CO emissions increased up to 32% and 22%, respectively. In addition, the use of fusel oil content (up to 10%) in the blended fuels improved the engine power by 5.6%. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In any commercial transaction, the presence of tolerances from specification limits is essential to ensure that the true value of the property of interest is sufficiently close to the specification value with a mutually agreed probability, so that there is no litigation between the parties. In order to meet this requirement, this tolerance is treated elegantly as a “toast” or more technically as a superior quality that the customer receives—giveaway. This work presents a new methodology for determining the tolerance limits of critical properties in some fuels, based on the reproducibility, on the difference between the averages of all acceptable results of each laboratory and on the specifications derived from the Brazilian National Agency for Oil, Natural Gas and Biofuels. Applying this approach to flash point by tag closed, final boiling point, volatility (95 % evaporated temperature), electrical conductivity and total sulfur content of some fuels and by means of a hypothesis test, the results show that this methodology was validated for most of the proposed new limits. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Hydrotreating technique is one of the most promising method for producing high quality of biofuels from plant oils. Here, the non-esculent rice bran oil was subjected to hydrotreatment in a high pressure cata-test unit, using sulfided NiMo/Al2O3, catalyst, under various pressures, temperatures and liquid hourly space velocities. The influence of each of these factors on the qualities and quantities of the acquired products was investigated, and the operating conditions were optimized. Evaluation of the final product was made on basis of its fuel characteristics, and compared with those of the raw oil. The results revealed the significant improvement of the physicochemical properties of the hydrotreated product to become very close, or may be better than those derived from petroleum sources. © 2018

AB  - Sugars derived from biomass hemicelluloses, especially pentoses, have low value because they are generally not suitable for industrial fermentation processes. In contrast, dehydration of xylose, one of the main constituents of hemicelluloses, yields furfural. The dehydration process is relatively simple, and furfural has several applications mainly in the polymer and lubricant industries. Moreover, chemical upgrade of furfural can yield 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) and ethyl levulinate (EL), two chemicals that can be used as fuel additives in gasoline and diesel, respectively. In this work, three chemical upgrading routes for furfural were proposed and simulated based on process data available in the literature. The economic analysis showed the feasibility of producing MTHF in a two-step hydrogenation process, in four geographic regions (Brazil, China, European Union, and the United States). The maximum furfural price to allow profits at a minimum acceptable rate of return of 10% is $457 Mg−1. On the other hand, the conversion of furfural to ethyl levulinate is not economically attractive mainly because of its lower energy density, which resulted in a low selling price. This study also discussed the need for new catalysts to avoid high hydrogen to furfural ratios while enabling hydrogenation at high pressures. These operating conditions were found to be major technoeconomic hurdles for the chemical upgrade of biomass-derived furfural to MTHF and EL. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Experimental investigation about the ceramic coating on diesel engine components is to evaluate its effective efficiency with respect to different loads. It is conducted on the Kirloskar single cylinder diesel engine; in addition, the engine performance, emission, and combustion have been analyzed by treating with the coated piston on the engine runs with diesel (D100) and biodiesel (B100). Yttria-stabilized zirconia is the ceramic agent coated on the piston with the help of plasma spray coating method. After the experimental results based on the comparison of coated and uncoated piston, it shows that the coated piston performed very effectively with increased brake thermal efficiency, decreased specific fuel consumption at all applied spectrum of loads. The emission is also evaluated with special equipment for testing and it shows that the hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide are some major pollutants tend to reduce in the coated piston than the uncoated piston. But there is an increase in nitrogen monoxide where it is controlled by varying injection timing and pressure with advanced fuel injectors according to the survey. Other benefits of this thermal barrier coating are that thermal fatigue faced by the surface of the components can be reduced to a greater level. The combustion has high heat release rate and pressure due to the complete heat within the insulated chamber without any conduction through the surface of the surrounded components. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study investigated the status of Jatropha plants farming for biodiesel production in Rwanda. A total of 73 Jatropha farmers from five sectors namely, Kigarama, Kigina, Kirehe, Mahama and Nyamugali in Kirehe district, Eastern Province, were selected. The study examined eight key parameters that determine the status of Jatropha plants farming. These parameters are classification of Jatropha farmers, methods for Jatropha plants growing, government strategy on providing Jatropha quality seeds or seedlings to farmers, government involvement to initiate local farmers to cultivate Jatropha plants for biodiesel production, knowledge level of the farmers on Jatropha plants farming, Jatropha seeds yield, perception level of investing on Jatropha plants farming and opinions of the key players in the biodiesel project. Through interviews and questionnaires, information was gathered and analysed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Result indicates that majority of the farmers (82%) in the five sectors reported that they were farming Jatropha plants as individual farmers while about 18% indicated that they were cultivating Jatropha plants as cooperatives. Majority of the farmers (70%) used agro-forestry farming technique due to shortage of farm lands. It was also revealed that most of the farmers (55%) have little knowledge on growing Jatropha plants. With regards to farmers using quality Jatropha seeds or seedlings, most farmers (93%) indicated that the government has not provided Jatropha seeds or seedlings. On the other hand, majority of the farmers (80%) stated that there have been very low involvements of the government to initiate farmers to cultivate Jatropha plants for biodiesel production project. In terms of Jatropha seeds yield, majority of the farmers (63%) in the five sectors rated Jatropha seed production level as low (between 1.1 and 2.9 t/ha/year) while about 33% stated that it was very low (between 0 and 1 t/ha/year). This was attributed to lack of reliable markets, low level of sensitisation, lack of preliminary studies on suitable areas for Jatropha plantation, lack of policy and institutional framework on biofuels, shortage of farm lands for intensification of Jatropha framing and low soil adaptation of the Jatropha plants. Due to low production level and lack of reliable markets, 71% of the total respondents considered Jatropha plants farming as a very low investment. Since there is no biodiesel production at the moment which would have created a reliable market for Jatropha seeds, Jatropha farming for biodiesel production in Rwanda is not viable. It is recommended that the government should carry out a feasibility study to generate knowledge on growth performance of various Jatropha species under the prevailing environmental conditions. In addition, due to shortage of land farms, the government should undertake economic assessment of growing Jatropha trees as hedges. © 2018 International Energy Initiative

AB  - After decades of ‘living dangerously’, the human kind has paused to think of Mother Nature. Alternate energy sources are being developed as a part of this realization. The use of indigenous sources of nutrients would considerably bring down the cost of production. A mixed consortium of Chlorella vulgaris, Arthrospira platensis, and tap water-originated Scenedesmus dimorphus was cultured using natural seawater, anaerobic digester sludge, and its growth was compared with synthetic commercial media like Zarrouk’s media, NaNO3 media, and NH4Cl media. A spectrophotometric method was standardized for regular biomass estimation. The dry biomass of a 15-day pure, batch culture of Arthrospira was found to yield around 600 mg/L in anaerobic digester sludge, whereas the pure batch culture of chlorella’s growth was hindered mainly due to the presence of bacteria and grazers. Regular microscopic observation and biomass monitoring revealed a drastic reduction in grazing activity, with the use of autoclaved AD sludge, resulting in a strong and stable microalgal mixed consortia. The consortia growth in AD sludge was found to be better than with the synthetic media with no cost of nutrient. The mixed consortia yielded a biomass up to 600 mg/L and lipid of 21.18%. The lipid generated from AD sludge had around 95% unsaturates and contained around 5% omega-3 fatty acids. The use of anaerobic digester sludge in a non-sterile condition reduces the total cost of the biodiesel production process as a whole and introduces a decentralized system for waste water treatment as well. © 2017, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Global demand for alternative energy sources increases due to concerns regarding energy security and greenhouse gas emissions. However, little is known regarding the impacts of biofuels to the environment and human health even though the identification of such impacts is important to avoid biofuels leading to undesired effects. In this study mutagenicity and genotoxicity of the three biofuel candidates ethyl levulinate (EL), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF) and 2-methylfuran (2-MF) were investigated in comparison to two petroleum-derived fuels and a biodiesel. None of the samples induced mutagenicity in the Ames fluctuation test. However, the Micronucleus assay revealed significant effects in Chinese hamster (Cricetulus griseus) V79 cells caused by the potential biofuels. 2-MF revealed the highest toxic potential with significant induction of micronuclei below 20.0 mg/L. EL and 2-MTHF induced micronuclei only at very high concentrations (>1000.0 mg/L). In regard to the genotoxic potential of 2-MF, its usage as biofuel should be critically discussed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The pyrolysis of almond shell as a biomass feedstock was performed in order to obtain a bio-based feedstock for bio-refineries in a fixed-bed reactor under inert atmosphere (occurred by N2 gas) at certain experimental conditions including 500 °C of temperature and a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Then, the catalytic cracking of obtained pyrolytic liquid was conducted by using bentonite clay as a low-cost catalyst material at the conditions of 400 °C of temperature, a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and catalyst ratio of 30 wt%. The upgraded bio-oil revealed the properties of a basic fuel including 4.01 cSt of viscosity at the temperature of 40 °C; approximately 45.22% lower than that of non-upgraded bio-oil, low density of 1100.78 kg m−3 at 15.6 °C, H/C molar ratio of 1.413 and calorific value (HHV) of 26.92 MJ kg−1. The results of the chromatographic and spectroscopic analysis of the obtained bio-oils have revealed that the presence of bentonite clay led to a considerable increase in some organic compound groups such as phenolic, ketones, and oxygenated aromatics. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Domestic and imported biomass or biofuels used for energy purposes play an important role in many future energy scenarios and national policies. But both the realizable potential for biomass and the environmental consequences of its deployment for energy can be controversial. The aim of this study is to identify environmentally-optimal strategies for bioenergy, considering domestic biomass resource availability, the full energy system context, and a consequential life cycle perspective. We apply our approach to the case of Switzerland and three alternative energy scenarios for the year 2035, and compare the environmentally-optimal strategies obtained over several single-issue and one fully-aggregated impact indicator. From the optimal solutions, we analyze substrate-specific (i.e., per biomass resource type) marginal impacts of biomass supply and the influences of boundary conditions imposed on biomass use by the different future energy scenarios. Minimizing impacts on global warming, cumulative fossil energy demand, and the Swiss ecological scarcity method leads to near-complete utilization of sustainably-available biomass resources, whereas less biomass is deployed when optimizing for particulate matter formation, land use (biodiversity loss), and water footprint. The results suggest that increased deployment of energy wood (excluding forest wood apt for material applications) and manures would be environmentally beneficial. In contrast, substrates suitable for animal feeding should not be used for energy purposes due to the burdens associated with increasing the demand for conventional feedstuffs. The findings and case-specific recommendations illustrate the importance of considering a holistic environmental perspective, alongside techno-economic restrictions to the physical biomass potential, when establishing national (bio-)energy policies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Liquid hydrocarbon fuels obtained from the catalytic cracking animal fats and plant oils have become one kinds of the attractive fuels because of their possible environment benefits and the current concern over the depletion of fossil fuel sources. In this work, using the combined methods of one-pot synthesis and wetness-impregnation, some basic mesoporous molecular sieves K2O/MeO-SBA-15 (Me = Ca, Mg or Ba) were prepared, characterized and used in the catalytic cracking of rubber seed oil (RSO). The results indicated that the catalysts K2O/MeO-SBA-15 had better catalytic performances than MeO-SBA-15, assigning to their stronger basicity. The catalyst K2O/MgO-SBA-15 obtained with 15 wt% KNO3 impregnation concentration showed the excellent catalytic performance with about 93.2% conversion and 78.3% yield of liquid hydrocarbon biofuel. The obtained liquid biofuel had similar chemical composition to diesel-based fuels and showed good cold flow property, high calorific and low acid value. Importantly, the catalyst K2O/MgO-SBA-15 was of excellent reusability, and it was reused with negligible loss in its catalytic performance for five times, attributing to the MgO layer between silicon skeleton and potassium species which prevents the reaction between silicon in the framework and potassium species.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), oxy- and nitro-derivate PAH (OPAH and NPAH) emissions from a direct injection diesel engine fueled with conventional fossil diesel (D), waste cooking oil biodiesel (B100), and their two blends (B20 and B50) were compared. The results show that B100 can reduce low molecular weight PAHs such as naphthalene, acenaphthylene, and fluorene as much as 90% compared with diesel. However, the emissions of high molecular weight PAHs including benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, and benzo[a]pyrene decrease slightly when using B100. The emission levels for PAHs and OPAHs present comparable, while NPAH emission levels are five to ten times lower than those of PAHs and OPAHs. Compared with diesel, PAH and NPAH emissions significantly decrease. On the contrary, an increase trend of OPAH emission has been observed with adding biodiesel. For the specific parent PAHs and its oxygenated and nitrated derivatives, the fractions of parent PAHs gradually decrease with increasing biodiesel content in the blends, while the corresponding oxygenated and nitrated derivative fractions observably increase, especially for the high molecular weight compounds. Considering the increase of OPAH and NPAH fractions in total particle-phase PAHs when using biodiesel, in-depth biodiesel cytotoxicity assessment should be conducted. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Elemental carbon (EC) concentrations in the exhaust of a medium-speed marine engine was evaluated using thermal-optical analysis (TOA). Particulate matter (PM) samples were collected at 75% and 25% engine loads using residual and distillate fuels with sulphur contents of 2.5%, 0.5% and 0.1%, and a biofuel (30% of bio-component). The EC analysis of PM samples from a marine engine proved to be challenging. For example, transformations of structure of the sampled particles in the inert and the oxygen mode were observed for marine engine exhaust samples. The relationship between constituents present in the samples from the marine engine using different fuels, and phenomena observed in the thermograms are discussed. Temperature protocol selection and sample pre-treatment (extractions and drying) affected the reported EC mass. Modifications in the methodology were suggested to increase the accuracy of the analysis. Repeatability and reproducibility of the EC analysis was studied in the round-robin of three laboratories. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A techno-economic assessment of a novel biorefinery concept is carried out. It combines the hydrotreatment of vegetable oils (HEFA) with a power-to-gas (PTG) unit that provides the required hydrogen. Several scenarios are examined: the electricity supply for the PTG unit is varied from a grid-based supply to a renewable island solution; the hydrogen supply is varied from a PTG unit to conventional steam reforming; the utilised vegetable oil is varied from jatropha to rapeseed, palm and used cooking oil; the main product is varied from jet fuel to diesel. The HEFA-plant is assumed to process 500 kt of vegetable oil annually. In the reference scenario, jatropha oil is used as feedstock producing 227 kt a−1 of jet fuel. Per ton of processed oil, 1910 kWhel are used to produce 35.7 kg of hydrogen required for its treatment. By using different vegetable oils, both hydrogen demand and fuel output vary in a range of about ±10%. The overall energetic efficiency towards jet fuel is 41.6%. With a bandwidth between 1295 and 1800 EUR t−1 of jet fuel, the specific production costs are three to four times higher than the market price for fossil jet fuel. Operating the refinery in diesel-mode could lower the production costs by ca. 30%. More high-value, long-chained fuels are produced this way due to a lower cracking rate compared to the jet-mode. Investments of around 132 million EUR are required for the HEFA-plant in all scenarios. Investments for the PTG-plant lie around 82 million EUR if there is a constant electricity supply from the grid. They reach 246 million EUR if electricity is supplied in an island-solution based on fluctuating renewables demanding much higher hydrogen production and storage capacities. Total investments in the biorefinery reach 378 million EUR in this case. Despite high capital costs, the largest cost item is vegetable oil – similarly to a conventional HEFA plant. Supporting policy instruments such as subsidies or quotas for renewable jet fuel seem indispensable for an introduction of the PTG-HEFA technology in the short to medium term. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sugarcane leaves, a lightweight lignocellulosic biomass from a harvested crop, represent a feedstock for in situ pyrolysis to biofuels and valuable chemicals, facilitating the collection and transportation of pyrolyzed oil to industry. In this paper, the pyrolyzed products were separated into water/aqueous and bio-oil fractions, and the yield was characterized. Pyrolysis was performed in a screw-driven custom-built pyrolysis reactor. The effects of pyrolysis parameters, including the temperature (400–650 °C), feedstock feed rate (0.3–1.8 kg h−1), average size distribution (250 µm, 500 µm and 750 µm) and N2 sweeping gas flow rate (80–240 cm3 min−1) were investigated systematically. The results show that the temperature and residence time according to the N2 sweep gas also mainly affects the bio-oil yield and properties such as the acidity, heating value, viscosity and chemical composition, with the highest bio-oil yield (40.16 wt%) obtained at 500 °C, a feed rate of 0.4 kg h−1, an average biomass feedstock particle size of 500 µm, and an inert N2 flow rate of 120 cm3 min−1. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the chemical composition revealed aromatic derivatives, phenols, ketones, and oxygenated compounds of high molecular weight that might be useful chemical products. These results indicate that pyrolyzed oil cannot be utilized as a biofuel directly but instead must be pretreated. The oil should be treated by a co-catalytic pyrolysis process to be considered a potential source for energy and valuable chemicals. In addition, the biochar was analyzed to determine whether it can be used for the production of activated carbon. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Commercial scale production of microalgal based biofuels will likely require co-location with a carbon dioxide point source such as coal-fired power plants. Inorganic contaminants innate in coal will ultimately be introduced to the culture system with the potential to impact growth, conversion, and adversely impact the quality of biofuel and other microalgal derived products. Microalgae biomass (Nannochloropsis salina) cultivated in the presence of the inorganic contaminants As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sn, V and Zn was processed into biofuel through one of two different in-situ transesterification methods, 1) acid-catalyzed or 2) supercritical methanol transesterification. The acid catalyzed transesterification resulted in a recovery efficiency increase from 80.5 ± 6.7% for the control biofuel (uncontaminated biomass conversion) to 88.9 ± 6.9% for the biofuel containing inorganic contaminants. Supercritical methanol conversion displayed a similar trend corresponding to the recovery efficiency increasing from 98.5 ± 8.3% for the control biofuel to 100.3 ± 2.6% for the biofuel containing inorganic contaminants. Inorganic contaminant analysis was performed on all biofuel conversion products and co-products of both transesterification types. Results indicated minimal contamination was found in the biofuel resulting from acid catalyzed transesterification, while substantial contamination was found in the biofuel resulting from supercritical methanol transesterification. Significant amounts of contamination were found in the lipid extracted algae resulting from both types of transesterification. Results show coal flue gas integration with algal production could have negative impacts on yields from standard biofuel conversion processes and limit the end use of bio-based products. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Raw kaolinite mineral was modified by alkaline potassium hydroxide solution at 373.15 K for 8 h and calcinated at about 573.15 K to produce a new low cost and eco-friendly heterogeneous catalyst for efficient transformation of commercial waste cooking oil into biofuels (biodiesel). The synthetic catalyst was defined as K+-trapped kaolinite (Kaol/K+) and characterized by XRD, TEM, SEM, BET, and FT-IR in addition to the investigation of other properties as ion exchange capacity and total basicity. Different operating parameters were involved for the transesterification system for waste cooking oil in the presences of Kaol/K+ as a basic catalyst. 343.15 K temperature, 14:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, 180 min conversion time, and 15 wt% catalyst loading were defined as the best conditions for maximum production of biodiesel from waste cooking oil with yield percentage of 94.76%. The basicity and catalytic activity of kaolinite/K+ enhanced greatly with increasing the concentration of KOH solution up to 30% and then decreased again with the studied higher concentrations (35% and 40%). The catalyst can be reused for five runs using distilled water, methanol and acetone as washing reagents with clear preferences for organic solvents. The properties of the produced biodiesel in this study match the requirements of ASTM D-6571 specification and EN 14214 specification as the international standards for biodiesel in the world. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A methodology for the synthesis of gasoline-range fuels from carbon neutral resources is introduced. Sorbitol, a sugar-based compound, was employed as a raw material because the compound is readily obtained from cellulose. Gasoline-range hydrocarbons were produced via hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) on zirconium phosphate-supported Pd-bimetallic (Pt−Pd, Ru−Pd, Ni−Pd, Fe−Pd, Co−Pd, W−Pd) catalysts. Among the tested catalysts, the bimetallic W−Pd/ZrP catalyst exhibited the highest yield of gasoline products, peaking at ∼70%. However, with the bimetallic Fe−Pd and Co−Pd catalysts, high-octane gasoline products were made (research octane number (RON) of the products was higher than 100). The Fe−Pd catalyst also showed the highest initial activity for the HDO of sorbitol. This study demonstrates that HDO in the Pd-system is a promising option to produce high-quality gasoline-range hydrocarbons from lignocellulosic biomass. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Feedstock cost is one of the main considerations in biodiesel production and researchers intensively searching for a low cost feedstock in order to make the process viable. This study reports the use of Aglaia korthalsii seed oil as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production using waste marine barnacle as a solid catalyst. A. korthalsii with oil content of 16.2 ± 0.18 wt.% was subjected to transesterification using barnacle (a source of CaO) as a solid base catalyst. The catalyst was characterized using TGA, XRD and FESEM; upon calcination CaCO3 turned into CaO, the species that catalyze the transesterification reaction. Parametric optimization under Central Composite Design revealed that the optimal reaction conditions are as follow: 12.2:1 MeOH:oil molar ratio and 4.7 wt.% catalyst at 65 °C, 3 h reaction duration, under which A. korthalsii oil was successfully converted into methyl ester (ME) with highest conversion of 97.12 ± 0.49%. The catalyst could be reused for four times, maintaining methyl ester content at 95.83% and the product meets the key specifications for biodiesel. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The impact of engine operating cycle, Biodiesel blends and fuel impurities on soot production and soot properties are evaluated in the present work. To this end, soot were produced on engine test bench and then collected inside a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). Two engine cycles (a Natural Loading and an Accelerated Loading) were tested. A standard Euro VI fuel blended with 7% of Biodiesel (B7) and a pure Biofuel (B100 RME EN 14214) were used. This latter was additivated with potassium and phosphorus at a low (B100+) or at a high (B100++) concentration. Soot characterization through elemental analyses, nitrogen adsorption, Raman spectroscopy, TGA and TPO experiments show that the engine operating cycle impact the soot reactivity through modifications of their texture and structure. Test bench experiments also show that increasing Biodiesel blend from B7 to B100+ divides by five the soot production. Moreover, soot obtained with B100+ are more reactive because of higher oxygen and ash content. When the inorganic content of the fuel is increased, few effects on the soot production are observed but the soot reactivity is significantly increased. In fact, analyses highlight that impurities present in the fuel are retrieved inside the soot composition and then catalyze their oxidation. K has a beneficial effect on both passive and active regenerations. On the contrary, P inhibits the active regeneration but has a significant catalytic impact on the C–NO2–H2O reaction. Finally, a numerical simulation allows to extract the kinetic constants of real B7- and B100+-soot, whose values confirm the differences of the soot reactivity. © 2018 The Combustion Institute

AB  - Microalgae have been considered as one of the most promising biomass resources for the generation of biodiesel, whereas algal residues (AR) after lipid extraction need to be utilized to enhance its economy and sustainability. This study proposed an integrated biochemical method for microalgae Chlorella sp. processing to achieve a high energy yield (12.33 KJ g−1VS). The microalgae were first pretreated with mixed enzymes for lipid extraction. After that, the AR obtained from the lipid extraction of microalgae was co-digested with energy grass (GR) Pennisetum hybrid for methane production. Results indicated that the lipid yield from microalgae was enhanced by 54.45% with mixed enzymes pretreatment of cellulase, xynalase and pectinase compared to that without enzymatic pretreatment. The maximal methane yield (207.35 ± 15.66 mLCH4 g−1VS) of AR and GR co-digestion was obtained with the AR and GR VS ratio at 1:3. Energy yields evaluation based on the biodiesel and methane yields indicated that the energy yield for this two-step combined method was 169% higher than that for biodiesel alone. Thus, the proposed integrated approach was verified to be applicable for microalgae processing for energy production. © 2018

AB  - This article reports the preparation of cost-effective bio-hydroxyapatite (ram bone derived) supported mesoporous Cr heterogeneous catalysts and its performance in biodiesel production from used frying mustard oil (UFMO). The optimal catalyst (98.45 m2/g BET area; pore volume 0.0586 cc/g; modal pore diameter 19.3 nm and 0.78 mmol NH3/g catalyst acid-site concentration) demonstrated remarkable efficacy in sustainable synthesis of biodiesel from UFMO achieving maximum FAME content (96.85%) at optimal (predicted through D-optimal method) conditions: 4 wt% catalyst concentration, 8.0 methanol/UFMO molar ratio and 200 °C calcination temperature for catalyst preparation. Biodiesel production through concurrent transesterification-esterification (CTE) of UFMO could be augmented from 40.22% (conductive heating system) to 96.85% FAME yield using energy-proficient infrared radiation. Promising engine operation was recorded in terms of lower exhaust temperature at various blends of petrodiesel-product biodiesel in comparison with unaided petro-diesel. Assessment of exhaust emissions implied a significantly low CO (0.05%) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions (&lt;0.00002) for product biodiesel conforming to Euro-VI emission standards. Thus, the article demonstrates an inexpensive and efficient avenue for utilisation of waste resources to generate and utilise clean and renewable energy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Subcritical hydrothermal liquefaction of poplar was performed at 220–280 °C, and the liquid phase produced was extracted by ethyl acetate to obtain light oil (LO), which contained LO1 (water-soluble) and LO2 (ethyl acetate-soluble). The residue was further extracted with acetone to produce heavy oil (HO) and solid residue (SR). The highest bio-oil yield of 19.88% was obtained at 260 °C. The HO produced at 260 °C had the highest content of C (69.13%) and the higher heating value was 27.97 MJ/kg. The O/C and H/C ratios of LO were higher than those of HO due to less aromatics in LO. Oxidative inhibition rates of bio-oils, measured in DPPH-ethanol solution at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL, reached 60.76% for LO1 while 90.29% and 90.85% for LO2 and HO, respectively. The bio-oil with good antioxidant activity can be utilized as an additive in bio-diesel to improve oxidation stability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The consumption of plant seed oils and their derivatives is growing globally in order to protect the eco-system. The application of such plant-seed derived biofuels and lubricants are limited at lower temperatures by its high pour point and constrained at higher temperature due to its inadequate thermo-oxidative stability. Former studies have shown that the blending of natural additives with plant seed oil derivatives enhance their performance; therefore, in an attempt to enhance the properties of the canola biodiesel (CB) and its derivatives (epoxidized canola biodiesel and epoxidized canola biodiesel derived alkoxides) were blended at 2 wt% with natural additives viz. L-Ascorbic Acid 6-palmitate, caffeic acid and tannic acid. All the blends were evaluated for their thermo-oxidative stability, low-temperature properties, lubricity and rheological properties, and these properties were compared with those blended with synthetic additive tert-Butylhydroquinone as well as without any additives. The experimental outcomes of this study revealed that the additives have shown significant improvement in the performance of CB. Further, it was found that natural antioxidants enhances the thermal and oxidative stability, viscosity of the canola biodiesel. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae produces high amount of water-insoluble organic compounds, the biocrude oil. Using high-growth-rate Spirulina platensis as feedstock, product fraction distribution and biocrude oil chemistry from HTL at a temperature of 240–300 °C under acidic, neutral and alkaline condition were studied. Positive effects on biocrude oil yield were only found with KOH and acetic acid, and these effects were stronger under milder HTL conditions. FT-ICR MS showed that O 2 class in the biocrude was high due to higher carbohydrate in the biomass, numbers of N 3 O 5-6 species present in the sample from acetic acid run, indicating its less decarboxylation ability. GC–MS showed more ketones and amides were formed from fatty acids in catalytic HTL, and this effect was sensitive toward reaction temperature. GPC suggested more light volatiles were in biocrude from KOH run, while analysis from NMR, FT-IR and elemental confirmed its high oil quality. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the potential of six oleaginous eustigmatophytes for use as biorefinery feedstock for the co-production of palmitoleic acid (PA) and biodiesel under different initial nitrogen concentrations (INCs). Six eustigmatophytes were studied, the nitrogen deficiency strategy significantly stimulated the simultaneous hyper-accumulation of PA and lipids, and led to a desirable fatty acid profile (FAP), except in Vacuoliviride sp. and Nannochloropsis oculata. Particularly, Eustigmatos cf. polyphem exhibited great potential when supplied with 1 mM INC and yielded the highest PA (29.71% of dry weight (DW)) and lipid (72.01% of DW) contents, as their productivities increased to 96.26 and 232.79 mg/L/d, respectively. Furthermore, neutral lipids accounted for 91.82% of the total lipids and were rich in PA, and the favourable FAPs of C16-C18 (87.95%) and monounsaturated FAs (70.10%) ensured good biodiesel properties including the cetane number (55.69) and iodine value (92.81 gI 2 /100 g), and all met the standard requirements. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rapid industrialisation and hike in fuel prices has led to a growing concern for the development of alternative fuel from renewable sources. Biodiesel is one of the promising biofuels as a replacement to petroleum diesel in the future. The present study reports the synthesis of a strontium functionalised calcium oxide (Sr/CaO) catalyst via wet impregnation method for biodiesel production from Prunus armeniaca oil. The characterisation data suggested the formation of fine particles of Sr/CaO catalyst with high pore diameter after the solid phase reaction. Response surface methodology in conjunction with central composite design was applied for the development of a quadratic model to optimize the biodiesel yield. The optimal yield of 90.4% was obtained at the following reaction conditions: 1.75% (w/v) catalyst dose, 12:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, 60 °C reaction temperature and 140 min reaction time and the prepared catalyst could be reused for four times with slight loss in activity. The obtained result was found to be in agreement with the predicted values which verified the accuracy of the model. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Saccharides are important constituents in atmospheric aerosols but studies in northwestern China are still very limited. Here, we have measured anhydrosugars (levoglucosan, mannosan and galactosan), primary sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose and trehalose), and sugar alcohols (arabitol, mannitol, sorbitol and inositol) in ambient PM2.5 samples during summer and winter in Xi'an city, northwestern China. The abundance of total saccharides showed no clear seasonal variation, but apparent distinctions on the levels of the three categories and individual saccharide compounds were found. Primary sugars and particularly sucrose were dominant in summer. In contrast, levoglucosan was the predominant species in winter, contributing 60% of total saccharides. Source apportionment by positive matrix factorization revealed that airborne pollen was a major source of PM2.5 associated-saccharides in summer, accounting for 35% of total saccharides; while biomass burning activities contributed to 60% of the winter saccharides. Furthermore, an increasing trend of biomass/biofuel burning contribution to winter PM2.5 was observed in comparison with previous studies in Xi'an, suggesting a change in emission sources may be underway in northwestern China. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The energy requirements are globally on a rapid escalation, as technology advances, which is also true for a developing country like Nigeria, which is dependent on fossil fuels and its derivatives. Apart from its adverse effect on its economy, it has also negative impacts on the health and the environment, in general. However, investments in renewable energy are faced by the competitive oil prices, the very high investment cost for renewable energy, and high local electricity prices. This paper appraises the attractiveness of investing in renewable energy sources over the continued use of non-edible oil for electricity generation. Methods: This paper explores the application of biomass seed oil to produce a renewable fuel (biodiesel) using heterogeneous base catalyst. Meanwhile, two-step processes were employed to produce the biofuel. In the first step (esterification), the acid value of the oil was reduced to the recommended limit (FFA ≤ 1.5) using H2SO4, while in the second step (transesterification), the catalyst calcination of grounded Brette Pearl Spar Mable (BPSM) pre-soaked in methanol was used as a biobase for biodiesel production. For the optimization, minitab response surface (MRS) and artificial neural network (ANN) were employed to model and optimize the process variables responsible for the optimum production of the oil and the biodiesel. Results: The result presented showed that T. peruviana seed was found to be rich in oil with an average yield of 44.00% (w/w), and the oil was highly unsaturated with a high FFA. The maximum experimental biodiesel yield obtained was 86.00% at a catalyst amount of 4 g, a reaction time of 70 min, and a methanol/oil ratio of 0.1(v/v). This result was validated in triplicate under the same conditions, which yielded 85.70% (v/v) for MRS and 85.98% (v/v) for ANN. Furthermore, the optimization results also indicated that the p values (p &lt; 0.05) of the model terms were significant, and the accuracy of the models achieved by MRS and ANN based on R2 depict that both optimization tools gave good predictions of R2 (MRS: R2 = 99.98% and ANN: R2 = 99.97%). The properties of the biodiesel, as described in other earlier reports using the same feedstock with different catalysts, indicated that the produced biodiesel had properties which agreed to those reported in the literature. Conclusions: T. peruviana seed has proved to be a good biomass raw material for oil production, and its conversion to biofuel using a heterogeneous biobase catalyst showed its suitability as a renewable environmental friendly fuel. Government should invest in more sustainable sources of energy by imposing law for the use of non-edible oil or decreasing the price of electricity. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - The Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area is a unique case worldwide due to the extensive use of biofuel, particularly ethanol, by its large fleet of nearly 8 million cars. Based on source apportionment analysis of Organic Aerosols in downtown Sao Paulo, and using ethanol as tracer of passenger vehicles, we have identified primary emissions from light-duty-vehicles (LDV) and heavy-duty-vehicles (HDV), as well as secondary process component. Each of those factors mirror a relevant primary source or secondary process in this densely occupied area. Using those factors as predictors in a multiple linear regression analysis of a wide range of pollutants, we have quantified the role of primary LDV or HDV emissions, as well as atmospheric secondary processes, on air quality degradation. Results show a significant contribution of HDV emissions, despite contributing only about 5% of vehicles number in the region. The latter is responsible, for example, of 40% and 47% of benzene and black carbon atmospheric concentration, respectively. This work describes an innovative use of biofuel as a tracer of passenger vehicle emissions, allowing to better understand the role of vehicular sources on air quality degradation in one of most populated megacities worldwide. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Low-carbon transitions in whole systems (in energy, mobility, agro-food) are an important, yet understudied topic in socio-technical transition research. To address this topic, the paper builds on the Multi-Level Perspective, but stretches it to address developments in multiple regimes and multiple niche-innovations. This ‘zooming out’ strategy changes the conceptualisation of transition dynamics from bottom-up disruption (driven by singular niche-innovations) to gradual system reconfiguration, which represents a more distributed, multi-source view of change that includes cumulative incremental regime change, shifts in relative sizes of regimes, regime alignments, component substitution, and symbiotic adoption. To illustrate the reconfiguration approach and empirically explore the topic of whole system change, the paper investigates unfolding trajectories in UK passenger mobility. This analysis, which addresses developments in auto-mobility, train, bus and cycling regimes and five niche-innovations (biofuels, electric vehicles, smart cards, compact cities, home working), aims to assess if and how the mobility system is reconfiguring in low-carbon directions. It also aims to provide an interpretive assessment of the 12.7% decrease in domestic transport-related CO2-emissions between 2007 and 2013. This decrease is attributed to reduced auto-mobility (due to the financial-economic crisis), incremental engine efficiency improvements in new cars, some modal shift from cars to trains, and biofuels. Radical niche-innovations (smart cards, compact cities, electric vehicles) did not (yet) greatly contribute to emission reductions. CO2-emissions increased again since 2014, which suggests that further low-carbon transitions require deeper system reconfiguration. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs, biodiesel) was optimized from wet Nannochloropsis gaditana microalgal biomass (81.8 wt% water and 28.1 wt% saponifiable lipids, SLs, from the dry biomass). FAME production was carried out by direct acid-catalyzed methylation of the SLs from the microalgal biomass and FAME extraction with hexane. A three-variable, three-level Box-Behnken design (BBD) was applied to optimize the sulphuric acid (catalyst) concentration, the methanol/SL ratio and the hexane/SL ratio. The best FAME yield was obtained with a methanol/SL ratio of 254 mL/g, a sulphuric acid concentration of 3.7% (v/v) and a hexane/SL ratio of 107.7 mL/g at 100 °C and for 105 min. Under these conditions, 100% of the SLs were transformed into FAMEs. Finally, the FAME purity was increased from 78.7 to 86.8 wt% using an adsorption treatment with bentonite. © 2018

AB  - Nowadays, microalgae are widely discussed as a promising feedstock for biodiesel production due to the legitimate concerns about the consequences of using edible oils. Selection of the most suitable microalgal species relies on several key parameters such as growth rate, lipid productivity and fatty acid profile. In the present study, different species of Scenedesmus were isolated and compared for their efficiency as biodiesel feedstocks. S. obliquus showed the highest biomass productivity of 0.102 g CDW L−1 d−1 at stationary phase. However, S. intermedius showed the highest significant lipid content of 400.9 mg g−1 CDW. Regarding lipid productivity, S. obliquus was the most lipid productive strain at stationary phase with up to 24.94 mg L−1 d−1, representing 23.9% significant increase over that of S. intermedius. In addition, cetane number and iodine value of S. obliquus FAMEs were 54.12 and 110.37 g I2/100 g, respectively. Moreover, FAMEs of S. obliquus showed kinematic viscosity and specific gravity of 1.9–6.0 mm2 s−1 and 0.88 g cm−3, respectively, which are in accordance with the international standards. Among the different studied species of Scenedesmus, the present study nominated S. obliquus as a promising renewable feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The main objective of this investigation is to compare catalytic activity of three different catalysts derived from chicken waste. The prepared catalysts were characterized by DTG, SEM, BET, XRD, and FT-IR. The effect of catalysts (chicken manure, chicken bone, and egg shell) on biodiesel yield (from E. compressa algal oil) were evaluated by varying calcination temperature, reaction temperature, molar ratio, catalyst amount, mixing speed, reaction time, and water content in methanol. The maximum biodiesel yield was obtained for egg shell catalyst-95% while for chicken bone catalyst −94% and chicken manure catalyst −85% at 9:1 M, 5% (w/w) of catalyst amount, 65 °C, 2% water content, and 400 rpm for 3 h. The chicken bone catalyst is highly active in reaction but in presence of water content (max. 2%) in methanol egg shell shows higher biodiesel yield performance. The recovered catalyst can be used maximum three times with a slight deviation. The quality of biodiesel merged with standards value. The conversion of waste raw materials into valuable resources make this method a cost-effective and reveals a recyclable procedure for the production of biodiesel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Open racetrack flumes represent the most common reactor for algae cultivation in the biodiesel industry, however, despite numerous experimental and numerical studies into reactor modifications, conditions remain suboptimal for algal growth. In response, a full-scale racetrack flume was constructed at the Ecohydraulics and Ecomorphodynamics Laboratory at the University of Illinois. Experiments on the racetrack flume were conducted for various depth and velocity conditions, using acoustic doppler velocimetry and surface particle velocimetry to characterize mean and turbulent velocity statistics, and dissolved oxygen measurements to investigate the effect of turbulent structures on gas transfer at the water-air interface. Longitudinal bed modifications were introduced to induce secondary flows in the straight portions of the flume. Semicircular and triangular bars of two different sizes were tested in an effort to increase the transfer velocity at the free surface. A range of flow structures were observed including secondary currents of Prandtl's first and second kinds, vortex shedding off of bend vanes, and periodic oscillations in surface lateral currents. Findings indicate that bend dynamics introduce the strongest and most resilient flow structures, and any attempt to induce vertical mixing or accelerate transfer velocities at the free surface will need to utilize or overwhelm these existing structures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Non-food biomass production is developing rapidly to fuel the bioenergy sector and substitute dwindling fossil resources, which is likely to impact land-use patterns worldwide. Recent publications attempting to factor this effect into the climate mitigation potential of bioenergy chains have come to widely variable conclusions depending on their scope, data sources or methodology. Here, we conducted a first of its kind, systematic review of scientific literature on this topic and derived quantitative trends through a meta-analysis. We showed that second-generation biofuels and bioelectricity have a larger greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement potential than first generation biofuels, and stand the best chances (with a 80 to 90% probability range) of achieving a 50% reduction compared to fossil fuels. Conversely, directly converting forest ecosystems to produce bioenergy feedstock appeared as the worst-case scenario, systematically leading to negative GHG savings. On the other hand, converting grassland appeared to be a better option and entailed a 60% chance of halving GHG emissions compared to fossil energy sources. Since most climate mitigation scenarios assume still larger savings, it is critical to gain better insight into land-use change effects to provide a more realistic estimate of the mitigation potential associated with bioenergy. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - This article aims to study suitability and merits of employing a biofuel in methane-air jet flames for energy security and environmental sustainability purposes. A special biofuel (methyl decanoate, methyl 9-decenoate, and n-heptane) oxidation with 118 species reduced/skeletal mechanism and 837 reactions is combusted instead of methane. The biofuel was fed in the main jet inlet of the well-known Sandia flame D (SFD) while the hot pilot jet is still responsible for ignition. The open-source software OpenFOAM was used for simulating turbulent biofuel-air combustion. To check the accuracy of computational results, the system was initially validated with SFD experimental results and good agreements were found. After ignition, mean temperature distribution and species mean mass fraction at different distances in axial and radial directions were investigated. Results showed that the biofuel can be effectively used as an alternative to SFD not only for generating a reasonable temperature as methane does, but also for significantly reduction in principal greenhouse gas emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the performance of mesophilic continuous anaerobic co-digestion using oil-extracted microalgae (M) and glycerol (G) in co-digestion with chicken litter (CL). The process included the starting up and stabilization of continuous anaerobic bioreactors using CL as a feedstock and the corresponding adaptation to M-CL and M-G-CL feedstocks. The treatments were selected based on a previous report of our research team on Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP) evaluation, taking in consideration only the best M-G-CL feedstock ratios. The performance was evaluated by the Specific Methanogenic Activity (SMA); the best response (270.0 mL CH4 gVS added−1) was obtained with a triple co-digestion M-G-CL 30:3:67, which was 39.0% above the CL treatment. These findings have shown that the two main residuals from microalgae biodiesel production (G and M) can be used as a feedstock to improve methane production through anaerobic digestion. © 2018

AB  - Biodiesel is evolving to be one of the most employed biofuels for partial replacement of petroleum based diesel fuel, especially in recent years. The most widely used feedstocks for biodiesel production are vegetable oils. In this work, biodiesel production from castor oil has been synthesized by homogenous alkaline transesterification. The influence of catalyst concentration, methanol:oil molar ratio, reaction temperature and reaction time in the methyl ester content reached by castor oil transesterification have been evaluated. A yield of 95 wt% biodiesel was achieved at 1 wt% KOH, 60 °C, 9:1 methanol:oil ratio and 30 min reaction time. Transesterification at temperature 30 °C gave a yield compatibles with that obtained at 60 °C. The composition of the fatty acid methyl ester was determined by Gas Chromatography. The castor oil biodiesel produced was blended with different concentrations of petrodiesel to obtain B5, B10 and B20. The biodiesel properties and its blends were determined according to the standard test methods of analysis. The results showed that Castor oil biodiesel in the blends could lower the cloud point value, but simultaneously, increases the viscosity of the diesel–biodiesel blends. Thus, castor oil biodiesel with its very low cloud and pour points is suitable for using in extreme winter temperatures. © 2018 Egyptian Petroleum Research Institute

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics and the defoamer capacity of bio-oils obtained from textile sludge pyrolysis. The pyrolysis was carried out at two temperatures: 310 and 500 °C, and the bio-oils were analyzed after 7 days and after 2 months of storage under refrigeration. The structure of the bio-oils was determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and the extraction of polar compounds by solid phase micro extraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. According to the chromatography and FTIR results, aromatic hydrocarbons, amines, silicone, and organic sulphur compounds were present in the pyrolysis oils. The Bikerman test showed that 1 mL of bio-oil obtained from pyrolysis at 500 °C can break down a column of foam in less than 1 min, which is comparable to the results of commercial antifoams. According to these results, these oils can be used as defoamers, even at the textile plant itself. © 2018 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering

AB  - Furanic and phenolic compounds are problematic compounds resulting from the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel production. Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) is a promising technology to convert furanic and phenolic compounds to renewable H 2 . The objective of the research presented here was to elucidate the processes and electron equivalents flow during the conversion of two furanic (furfural, FF; 5-hydroxymethyl furfural, HMF) and three phenolic (syringic acid, SA; vanillic acid, VA; 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, HBA) compounds in the MEC bioanode. Cyclic voltammograms of the bioanode demonstrated that purely electrochemical reactions in the biofilm attached to the electrode were negligible. Instead, microbial reactions related to the biotransformation of the five parent compounds (i.e., fermentation followed by exoelectrogenesis) were the primary processes resulting in the electron equivalents flow in the MEC bioanode. A mass-based framework of substrate utilization and electron flow was developed to quantify the distribution of the electron equivalents among the bioanode processes, including biomass growth for each of the five parent compounds. Using input parameters of anode efficiency and biomass observed yield coefficients, it was estimated that more than 50% of the SA, FF, and HMF electron equivalents were converted to current. In contrast, only 12 and 9% of VA and HBA electron equivalents, respectively, resulted in current production, while 76 and 79% remained as fermentation end products not further utilized in exoelectrogenesis. For all five compounds, it was estimated that 10% of the initially added electron equivalents were used for fermentative biomass synthesis, while 2 to 13% were used for exoelectrogenic biomass synthesis. The proposed mass-based framework provides a foundation for the simulation of bioanode processes to guide the optimization of MECs converting biomass-derived waste streams to renewable H 2 . © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - There is a growing market demand for small-scale biomass gasifiers that is driven by the economic incentives and the legislative framework. Small-scale gasifiers produce a gaseous fuel, commonly referred to as producer gas, with relatively low heating value. Thus, the most common energy conversion systems that are coupled with small-scale gasifiers are internal combustion engines. In order to increase the electrical efficiency, the operators choose dual fuel engines and mix the producer gas with diesel. The Wiebe function has been a valuable tool for assessing the efficiency of dual fuel internal combustion engines. This study introduces a thermodynamic model that works in parallel with the Wiebe function and calculates the emissions of the engines. This “vis-à-vis” approach takes into consideration the actual conditions inside the cylinders—as they are returned by the Wiebe function—and calculates the final thermodynamic equilibrium of the flue gases mixture. This approach aims to enhance the operation of the dual fuel internal combustion engines by identifying the optimal operating conditions and—at the same time—advance pollution control and minimize the environmental impact. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This work reports on a preliminary study aimed at developing an industrial liquid fuel derived from charcoal and vegetable oil. Its relevance relies on the high energy potential of charcoal, its renewable nature, storage and transportation capacity in liquid form, as well as on the economic and environmental advantages derived thereof. The ability of a commercially available charcoal to be dispersed in three different organic solvents was assessed through the rheological characterisation of the resulting charcoal oil slurries (ChOS). The charcoal was ground in a conventional ball mill and dispersed with the aid of three different surfactants. The effects of the most relevant factors influencing the rheological properties of the suspensions were evaluated, including: (i) the solvent producing the lowest fuel viscosity (η) at a given charcoal content; (ii) the most efficient surfactant (and its amount) minimising the fuel viscosity (η) at a given solids fraction; and (iii) the charcoal content, which should be as high as possible. High-stability ChOS containing 62 wt% solids and 0.4 wt% surfactant, and exhibiting adequate flow properties and high calorific values, were successfully obtained. © 2017 Energy Institute

AB  - This study presents a techno-economic analysis and an environmental assessment, of the whole production chain (biomass production, sugar extraction, biomass pretreatment, sugars fermentation, and products recovery and purification), of a fully autarkic sugarcane-based biorefinery for biojet fuel production. All scenarios considered correspond to 1st/2nd generation integrated biorefineries (i.e. simultaneous use of sugarcane juice stream and lignocellulosic fractions) with a production scale of 208 kton (biojet fuel) yr−1. In this paper, we compared multiple options for the most relevant processing steps of the biorefinery: eight biomass pretreatment technologies (i.e. dilute acid, dilute acid + alkaline treatment, steam explosion, steam explosion + alkaline treatment, organosolv, alkaline wet oxidation, liquid hot water and liquid hot water + alkaline treatment); two biojet fuel production routes from sugars (i.e. ethanol to jet and direct fermentation); one biojet fuel production route from biomass (i.e. fast pyrolysis); two biojet fuel production routes from lignin obtained after biomass pretreatment (i.e. fast pyrolysis and gasification Fischer- Tropsch); and one alternative use for lignin (i.e. co-generation). From the combination of these key features, 81 scenarios are selected and compared. Furthermore, three potential technological improvements were analysed for selected scenarios: i) recovery of acetic acid and furfural (for cases with bagasse pretreatment); ii) production of succinic acid from a fraction of concentrated juice; iii) increase of operation time (from 200 to 320 days yr−1) by using sweet sorghum as cumulative feedstock. The different scenarios are compared first based on the minimum jet fuel selling price (MJSP) and then based on their environmental performance (i.e. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and non-renewable energy use (NREU)). Among the scenarios considering biomass pretreatment, the lower MJSP are obtained when 1G/2G sugars are upgraded via ethanol fermentation (ETJ) (i.e. SO2 steam explosion: 3409 US $.ton−1, and wet oxidation: 3230 US $.ton−1). Additional technological improvements may help to further reduce the MJSP either marginally (2%, by using 1G sugars for succinic acid production) or significantly (30%, by increasing the operation time). Thus, the lowest MJSP here calculated is 1725 US $.ton−1 (with 1G sugars to biojet fuel via ethanol, and bagasse to biojet fuel via fast pyrolysis). Finally, for all scenarios considered, the GHG emissions and NREU were found to be lower than 42.5 kg CO2eq.GJ−1 and 700 MJ GJ −1 respectively (except for scenarios with fast pyrolysis of bagasse where those figures were further reduced by 50% and 80% respectively). Although, the MJSP calculated for all scenarios are higher than those of the fossil jet fuel reference, the significant potential for environmental impacts reduction (in terms of GHG emissions and primary energy use) are encouraging for further research in costs reduction and technology development. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Rapidly increasing global energy consumption has caused depletion of fossil fuels, leading to the search of alternative energy resources. One of the potential solutions is utilizing algae biomass as the source of bioenergy. To fulfil the high biomass demands for biofuel production, it is of pivotal importance to develop feasible technologies to enable economic, efficient and high density cultivation of algae. Algae can be cultivated in either open or closed systems in the presence of nutrients and light intensity. The maximum yield, growth rate and composition of algae can be optimized according to cultivation conditions, such as temperature, pH, light intensity and nutrient concentration. The potential types of algae in contributing carbohydrate and lipids to produce biofuel such as biodiesel, bioethanol and bio-gas are reviewed. Economic feasibilities of algae based fuel production are discussed based on Life Cycle Analysis. Current challenges and future prospective are also presented to realize the use of algae as a feedstock for commercial and cost effective fuel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Etherification of furanic compounds such as furfuryl alcohol (FA) and 5-(Hydroxymethyl) furfural (5-HMF) to the corresponding ethers was successfully achieved over Zr-SBA-15 catalyst. For this purpose, various Zr-SBA-15 catalysts with different Zr/Si molar ratios in self-generated acidic environment were prepared by one-pot strategy in self-generated acidic environment. XRD analysis revealed the increase in the d-spacing from 9.021 nm for parent SBA-15 to 11.66 nm for Zr-SBA-15, confirming the incorporation of Zr into the framework without disturbing the mesoporous structure of SBA-15. For the lowest Zr concentration of 0.09 M, hexagonally ordered porous structure was found to be retained as confirmed by TEM while, increase in Zr/Si molar ratio to 0.14, resulted in loss of long range order mesoporosity. The presence of both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites in Zr-SBA-15 catalyst as evidenced by py-IR, were due to the introduction of Zr in the frame work of SBA-15. The co-existence of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites in Zr-SBA-15 was responsible to catalyze etherification of FA and esterification of levulinic acid producing 2-(Ethoxymethyl) furan and ethyl levulinate selectively, both of which are bio-derived fuel additives. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The increasing need for carbon-neutral, low-emission transportation sector has led to the development of advanced biofuels with tailor-made production and combustion processes. Even though the large-scale deployment of these advanced biofuels also increases the risk for their release into the environment, their toxic potency remains largely unknown. To identify hazardous biofuel candidates as early as possible, the fuel development process can be expanded by “Green Toxicology”. To demonstrate such early Green Toxicology testing, this study investigates the aquatic toxicity for the two biofuel candidates 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF) and 2-methylfuran (2-MF) on Daphnia magna. We performed the prolonged acute immobilisation assay (96 h) and the D. magna reproduction test. 2-MF induced acute effects on D. magna that were two orders of magnitude stronger than those of 2-MTHF. Furthermore, both substances affected the growth and reproductive output of D. magna in a 21 d reproduction test, with 2-MF already inducing effects with concentrations one to two orders of magnitude lower than those of 2-MTHF. Thus, our assessment of the aquatic toxicity suggests that further biofuel development should focus on 2-MTHF. Furthermore, the acute immobilisation test with D. magna was identified as a promising tool for a rapid and sensitive “Green Toxicology” screening of further biofuel candidates. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In arid and semi-arid climates, Balanites aegyptiaca (B. aegyptiaca) is a potential plant to produce oilseed-based biofuels. In this paper an optimization model for a wild biomass supply chain is presented. The model was developed to identify the optimal organization of the supply network that minimizes the cost of supplying the feedstock. It was applied to a case study on a B. aegyptiaca seed supply chain in Burkina Faso. Considering different means of transport and different pre-processing locations, the results show that in contexts such as Burkina Faso's, the most efficient option for the supply of B. aegyptiaca seeds is using animal drawn carts to transport the biomass from the harvest sites to the collection points. Feedstock pre-processing should take place before transport and an improvement in pre-processing operations by mechanical de-hulling could help reduce the cost price of the seeds. The results also show that more than 35% of the cost price of B. aegyptiaca seed is accounted for by transport costs. Pre-processing, handling, and storage costs account for about 50% of the cost of the seeds. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Microalgal biomass is currently recognized as a promising sustainable source for biofuel production and carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration. Utilization of biophysical models are emerging to access the real-time feasibility of microalgal technology. In this present work, a comprehensive mathematical model based on the site-specific meteorological variables is formulated using MATLAB ODE 45 s solver to estimate the microalgal productivity. The predictive model framework utilized material balance equations with basic laws of physics, known constants and conservative assumptions to evaluate the water temperature that influences the microalgal viability. The dynamic behaviour of algal ponds considering the operating variables like light intensity (including the effects of photoinhibition), water temperature, and design criteria like pond depth, microalgal concentration, was used to estimate the performance of T. pseudonana in open ponds. Maximum growth was projected in September accounting to the biomass and lipid productivity of 170.28 kg (dry mass) ha−1 d−1 and 39.42 l ha−1 d−1 respectively with a CO2 capture potential of 224.77 kg (CO2) ha−1 d−1 based on the influence of water temperature. Optimal pond depth and operational conditions to achieve the desired productivity for the specific site were estimated. The maximum annual areal productivity dropped by 19% from 62.18 tons (dry mass) ha−1 yr−1 due to photoinhibition. The simulated biophysical model as a tool could be used to evaluate the biokinetic processes affecting the algal pond performance for further facilitation of effective decision making on scaling up of microalgae cultivation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Developing the efforts to implement sustainability policies in the energy field requires the most accurate information on the potential of available resources to properly implement concrete policies. Total net energy yields are interpreted in isolation, and studies providing information on yields of specific energy crops in net values are relatively rare. This article, therefore, provides a tool based on methodology combining Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) approaches and a model implemented in a stochastic Petri net environment to support managerial decision-making at a national and regional level. This tool allows for the comparison of net yields of more energy crops used in Central Europe. Additional crops can be added to the model. For the purpose of comparison, it is also possible to customize the model parameters for particular crops and the way they are cultivated. In comparison with oilseed rape, sugar beet, and wheat, the model shows best results in terms of net energy yields for sugar beet. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Brewers’ spent grain (BSG) accounts for 85% of the total amount of by-products generated by the brewing industries. BSG is a lignocellulosic biomass that is rich in proteins, lipids, minerals, and vitamins. In the present study, BSG was subjected to pretreatment by two different methods (microwave assisted alkaline pretreatment and organosolv) and was evaluated for the liberation of glucose and xylose during enzymatic saccharification trials. The highest amount of glucose (46.45 ± 1.43 g/L) and xylose (25.15 ± 1.36 g/L) were observed after enzymatic saccharification of the organosolv pretreated BSG. The glucose and xylose yield for the microwave assisted alkaline pretreated BSG were 34.86 ± 1.27 g/L and 16.54 ± 2.1 g/L, respectively. The hydrolysates from the organosolv pretreated BSG were used as substrate for the cultivation of the oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides, aiming to produce microbial lipids. The yeast synthesized as high as 18.44 ± 0.96 g/L of cell dry weight and 10.41 ± 0.34 g/L lipids (lipid content of 56.45 ± 0.76%) when cultivated on BSG hydrolysate with a C/N ratio of 500. The cell dry weight, total lipid concentration and lipid content were higher compared to the results obtained when grown on synthetic media containing glucose, xylose or mixture of glucose and xylose. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report using hydrolysates of organosolv pretreated BSG for the growth and lipid production of oleaginous yeast in literature. The lipid profile of this oleaginous yeast showed similar fatty acid contents to vegetable oils, which can result in good biodiesel properties of the produced biodiesel. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Modeling efforts to understand the financial implications of microalgal biofuels often assume a static basis for microalgae biomass composition and cost, which has constrained cultivation and downstream conversion process design and limited in-depth understanding of their interdependencies. For this work, a dynamic biological cultivation model was integrated with thermo-chemical/biological unit process models for downstream biorefineries to increase modeling fidelity, to provide mechanistic links among unit operations, and to quantify minimum product selling prices of biofuels via techno-economic analysis. Variability in design, cultivation, and conversion parameters were characterized through Monte Carlo simulation, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify key cost and fuel yield drivers. Cultivating biomass to achieve the minimum biomass selling price or to achieve maximum lipid content were shown to lead to suboptimal fuel production costs. Depending on biomass composition, both hydrothermal liquefaction and a biochemical fractionation process (combined algal processing) were shown to have advantageous minimum product selling prices, which supports continued investment in multiple conversion pathways. Ultimately, this work demonstrates a clear need to leverage integrated modeling platforms to advance microalgae biofuel systems as a whole, and specific recommendations are made for the prioritization of research and development pathways to achieve economical biofuel production from microalgae. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Fuel economy standards, driver behavior, and biofuel mandates are driving a decline in the Gasoline-to-Diesel ratio (G:D) in U.S. refineries. This paper investigates the GHG implications associated with two methods available to shift refinery output: 1) refinery operational changes and 2) input crude slate variation. This analysis uses an open-source refinery GHG emissions model, PRELIM. Newly developed modeling capabilities and publicly available data are used to present Petroleum Administration for Defense District (PADD) level results (energy consumption and GHG emissions) for U.S. refineries. The results are indicative of negligible changes in the U.S. refining GHG emissions on a country level (∼3%), while variations up to 8% are observed within individual regions. Meeting the 2040 national G:D projections may require drastic changes to the current U.S. crude mix (e.g., more than 30% shift from the current U.S. crude mix), which could increase the U.S. refining GHG emissions by 25%. The analysis provides insights about future changes in refining GHG emissions due to a shift in product demand and a framework for additional analyses such as evaluation of crude market changes or biofuel blending on refining GHG emissions that can inform development of environmental regulations such as low carbon fuel standards. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biogas and biomethane (=purified biogas) are major renewable fuels that play a pivotal role in the evolving global energy economy. Here, we measure ultrafine particle (UFP; Dp (particle diameter) &lt; 100 nm) emissions from the combustion of biomethane and biogas produced from five different representative sources: two food waste digesters, two dairy waste digesters, and one landfill. Combustion exhaust for each of these sources is measured from one or more representative sectors including electricity generation, motor vehicles, and household use. Results show that UFP emissions are similar when using biomethane and natural gas with similar sulfur and siloxane content. Approximately 70% of UFPs emitted from water heaters and cooking stoves were semivolatile, but 30% of the UFPs were nonvolatile and did not evaporate even under extremely high dilution conditions. Photochemical aging of biomethane combustion exhaust and natural gas combustion exhaust produced similar amounts of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. The results of the current study suggest that widespread adoption of biogas and biomethane as a substitute for natural gas will not significantly increase ambient concentrations of primary and secondary UFPs if advanced combustion technology is used and the sulfur and siloxane content is similar for biogas/biomethane and natural gas. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel (BD) is often regarded as a carbon-neutral fuel. Many countries are investing resources in biodiesel technology development to respond to the need to improve energy sustainability and the threat of climate change. Since 2009, the South Korean Government has invested a considerable amount of money in developing marine BD (MBD) technology that converts carbon dioxide into diesel using marine microalgae cultivated in large quantities with the help of waste heat from nuclear power plants and/or coal-fired power plants. If the development is successful, 4800 tons of MBD a year, approximately 1820 cars fully fueled annually, will be produced from 2019. Furthermore, the South Korean Government is expected to continue to invest in MBD to improve the market share after 2019. Quantitative information about the public value of MBD technology development is widely demanded by the Government. This study aims to investigate the public value of MBD technology, the attributes of which it considers to be the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the mitigation of air pollutant emissions, new job creation, and the improvement of energy security. A choice experiment (CE) survey of 600 people was conducted during July 2016. The trade-offs among the attributes and the price were evaluated in the survey. The CE data were examined through a multinomial logit model. The marginal values for a 1%p reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, 1%p mitigation of air pollutant emissions, the creation of 100 new jobs, and an improvement of energy security caused by MBD technology development are computed to be KRW 1082.7 (USD 0.9), 918.1 (0.8), and 258.3 (0.2) per household per month, respectively. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The concern over extensive pollution, including anthropogenic carbon dioxide emission caused by the use of fossil fuels, results in the transition of the fuel mix of the world toward renewable energy sources. One of the most promising biofuels is biodiesel, which is renewable, nontoxic, biodegradable, safe to store, handle, and transport, and produces lower pollutant emissions (except oxides of nitrogen) compared to fossil diesel. However, one of the potential problems associated with biodiesel is the variability in its fatty acid methyl ester composition owing to larger variations in the feedstock used for its production. The biodiesel composition variations leads to variations in fuel properties, and thereby engine characteristics, demanding engine recalibration every time a new biodiesel fuel is introduced. In the present study, biodiesel-composition-based models are developed using artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of a light duty naturally aspirated and a heavy duty turbocharged engine fuelled with different types of biodiesel. The models provide predictive functions for estimating the engine performance, combustion, and emission parameters across a range of biodiesel composition, thus reducing extensive engine experiments. The predictions from the developed ANN models compare well with measurements with a higher regression coefficient of above 0.9 and less than 10% absolute error. Further, attempts are made to combine the developed ANN models with a genetic algorithm to arrive at an optimal biodiesel composition which could result in better fuel economy and lower oxides of nitrogen emission. The obtained results show that the total saturated methyl ester falls in the range of 36-43% by weight and that the total unsaturated methyl ester falls in the range of 55-63% by weight for the optimum biodiesel composition. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The anti-knock quality of fuels are of vital importance for improving spark ignition (SI) engine efficiency. 2-pheylethanol (2-PE) is one of potential high-octane booster, which can be derived from lignin as a biomass component. To ascertain the possibility of 2-PE as a bio-additive in SI engines, combustion characteristics and emission performance of 2-PE addition were investigated in a downsized gasoline engine. Blending 2-PE in gasoline resulted to a decrease in cylinder pressure and heat release rate. As increase of 2-PE addition, ignition delay and combustion duration of 2-PE-gasoline become postponed, combustion phasing is retarded， and COVIMEP increased signiﬁcantly. The reason is thought to be correlated with its relatively lower gas-phase reactivity and higher heat of vaporization. At elevated intake pressure, the number of knock cycles and MAPO significantly increased of SI engine，addition of 2-PE exhibits good knocking resistance because of its high octane number and physicochemical properties. For regulated gas emissions, 2-PE addition produces more unburned hydrocarbon, carbon oxide and less nitrogen oxides. The blending of 2-PE in gasoline tends to increase particle matter emissions and enlarge the particle size. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigates for the first time the combustion in a micro gas turbine (MGT) of a new bioliquid, a viscous biocrude, which is a liquefied wood (LW) produced via solvolysis of lignocellulosic biomass in acidified glycols. The test rig includes a modified fuel injection line, a re-designed combustion chamber and revised fuel injection positions. The main novelties of this work are: (1) producing of liquefied wood with pure ethylene glycol as a solvent, and methanesulfonic acid as a catalyst, to obtain a bio-crude with lower viscosity and higher lignocellulosics content than previous tested formulations; (2) upgrading raw liquefied wood by blending it with ethanol to further reduce the viscosity of the mixture; (3) utilizing a commercially available MGT Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) of 25 kW electrical power output, with notably reduced extent of adaptations to use the newly obtained fuel mixture. Fuel properties, and their impact on combustion performance using liquefied wood, are investigated by analyzing MGT performance and emissions response at different load and blend ratios. Emissions revealed that the presence of LW in the blends significantly affects CO and NOX concentrations compared to conventional fuels. CO roughly increased from 600 ppm (pure ethanol as fuel) to 1500 ppm (at 20 kW electrical power). The experimental study reveals that it is possible to achieve efficient MGT operation while utilizing high biocrude to ethanol ratios, but a number of adaptations are necessary. The achieved maximum share of liquefied wood in the fuel blend is 47.2% at 25 kW power output. Main barriers to the use of higher share of liquefied wood in these type of systems are also summarized. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The rapid industrialization and increase in the population has led to great energy demand in recent days. Various alternative sources of energy have been explored by researchers. Biodiesel is reported as best alternative renewable bioenergy. In the present work, mahua seed is a non-edible source used for extraction of biooil. The extracted biooil can be utilized for biodiesel production. The main objective was to study the effect of various extraction conditions and kinetics of extraction of biooil from mahua seeds. The suitable solvent ratios for extraction were compared among diethyl ether:ethanol, chloroform:methanol, chloroform:ethanol, iso-propanol:methanol in the proportions 3:1, 2:2 and 1:3 respectively. Experimental runs provided high biooil yield at temperature 50 °C and contact time 20 min. The extraction process was observed under the influence of an ultrasonic bath. The maximum biooil yield of 82% was obtained under the optimum conditions of temperature 50 °C, Contact time 20 min, seed to solvent ratio (diethyl ether:ethanol) 1:10(3:1) under ultrasonication. The properties such as density, viscosity, calorific value, cloud point, flash and fire point of biooil obtained has met the standard values. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The requirements for controlling particulate emissions in gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines, particularly in hybrid vehicles (where frequent cold-start event impact on both, particles characteristics and catalytic aftertreament efficiency), nesesitates the need for understanding their formation mechanism and their morphological characteristics. The findings described in this investigation have significance in the design of efficient Gasoline Particulate Filters (GPFs) and the development of computational models that predict particle filtration and oxidation processes. Morphological analysis of the particulate emissions from the combustion of commercial gasoline and two bio-alcohol blends: of 25% v/v ethanol in gasoline and 33% v/v butanol and 67% v/v gasoline, in a modern GDI engine has been carried out using a transmission electron microscopy. The primary particle size distribution from the combustion of butanol-gasoline blend was slightly smaller compared to gasoline, while the mean primary particle diameter was 3 nm smaller from the combustion of ethanol-gasoline fuel. This decrease in primary particle size for ethanol-gasoline blend was also reflected in a reduction of the mean radius of gyration and mean number of primary particles per agglomerate. The combustion of butanol-gasoline blend induced improved particle oxidation rates during the combustion process and post-oxidation stage, and led in 80% and 60% reduction in particle concentration in the engine exhaust when compared to the combustion of gasoline and ethanol-gasoline blend, respectively. Additionally, the estimation of the particle fractal dimension through the use of fractal equation, minimum bonding rectangle method and root form factor showed comparable results for butanol-gasoline and gasoline, with the particle agglomerates being more compact than the ethanol-gasoline fuel, where more chain like particles are seen. Therefore, particles emitted from the combustion of ethanol-gasoline fuel are easier to be trapped (lower fractal dimension) and present a higher reactivity (high surface/volume ratio) compared to particles emitted from gasoline combustion. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The extensive use of biodiesel as an alternate fuel has resulted in the oversupply of glycerine, leading to an increased demand to look for the use of glycerine as an alternate fuel. In this paper, multiple blends of diesel-biodiesel and their glycerine emulsions were compared to investigate the performance and emissions in a modern small diesel engine. A direct injection diesel engine was tested at different loads and speed conditions. Biodiesel was produced onsite and crude glycerine obtained as a by-product was purified using an orthogonal test method. Hydrophilic-lipophilic balance was formulated using two surfactants: Polyoxyethylene Sorbitan Monooleate and Sorbitan Monooleate, which were used in the emulsification process to attain desired stability of glycerin emulsion. Emulsion stability, mean particle droplet size, fuel properties, engine performance, and emissions were examined. Test results show that with the increase in glycerine concentration, brake-specific fuel consumption and brake-thermal efficiency increased. In terms of emissions, it was seen that carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon increased, and reductions in exhaust gas temperature and oxides of nitrogen were observed. In addition, there was a significant decrease in smoke (approximately 80%) with an increased concentration of glycerine at 3000 rpm, at high load. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. is recognized as one of the important non-edible tree borne oilseeds (TBOs) in India and many other tropical countries. J. curcas is a promising bioenergy crop as its seed oil is a suitable feedstock for biodiesel production. This study focused on a total of 19 J. curcas accessions for seed oil extraction, oil quality analysis and fatty acid composition. Most of the accessions showed more than 30% oil content with free fatty acid content ranging from 0.21 to 1.82%. The oil samples were transesterified efficiently to fatty acid methyl esters as evident from proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra. As revealed by gas chromatography, the contents of the four major fatty acids were found to significantly vary in the seed oils viz Palmitic acid (8.64–17.05%), stearic acid (4.34–7.94%), oleic acid (26.26–46.36%) and linoleic acid (28.72–53.78%). A number of seed oils showed high level of oleic acid (40.02–46.36%), and some other oil samples were rich in linoleic acid (∼45%). These J. curcas accessions appeared to be promising with regard to clonal propagation, field trials, large-scale plantations for biodiesel feedstocks, other industrial applications, and also as prebreeding materials in crop improvement programs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Ambient particles were clustered into 11 classes, which included elemental carbon (EC) mainly with sulfate (EC-S); EC with nitrate and sulfate (EC-SN); EC with obvious organic signals (ECOC); organic carbon (OC); biomass/biofuel burning particles (Biomass); Ammonium; particles with obvious Na, K (NaK) and sulfate (NaK-S), NaK with nitrate and sulfate (NaK-SN); iron-containing particles (Fe-rich); miscellaneous metal-containing particles (MiscsMetals) and Dust. Seasonal local sources, dominated air masses and distinct atmospheric processes all affected the concentrations of various particles and caused different diurnal changes. EC-SN during summer slowly increased in the afternoon and NaK-SN had a peak at noon during winter. Differences in size distribution of each particle type between seasons were discussed. All types of particles showed unimodal number size distributions, their peak radius ranked as follows: fall &lt; spring &lt; summer ≤ winter. OC during fall had higher number fractions of between 0.2 and 0.5 μm (&gt;20%) as a result from the decrease in temperature and increase in relative humidity (RH). The distributions of ECOC varied with seasons and were obviously influenced by EC and OC particles. Mixing states showed seasonal variations. In general, the fractions of particles mixed with secondary species were the highest/lowest in winter/fall. The effects of meteorological conditions on particles were investigated. With the increase of RH, the fractions of EC increased, and most particles mixed with more NH4 + and less C2H3O+. Characteristics of precipitation, such as duration and total rainfall amount, influenced particles. Enhanced secondary organic/inorganic species were found in particles during long-/short-term precipitation with intensities &lt;1 mm. Less NH4 +, C2H3O+ and HSO4 − were found during precipitation compared with non-precipitation days. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In order to reach the limits of CO2 emissions set by Kyoto protocol, the use of biofuels is gaining momentum. However, the biofuels contains alkali and alkaline earth metals (Na, K and Ca) and phosphorus (P) species, which could decrease the efficiency of the after-treatment system. The main aim of this study is to increase the knowledge of the effect of impurities contain on biofuel on the catalytic activity of the diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs). Both reference (PtPd/CeZrO2/La-Al2O3) and modified catalysts were synthesized, characterized by several techniques and tested, concerning their physico-chemical, redox and catalytic properties. Based on the characterization results, the catalyst crystalline structure did not change after the impurities incorporation, however, the specific surface area was decreased in all cases. NO adsorption strength was increased due to the low electronegativity of Na, K and Ca species, according to H2-TPR and NO-TPD analyses. XPS analysis confirmed the formation of cerium phosphate, which can stabilize the Ce3+ oxidation state related to its higher Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio, diminishing the catalytic redox activity. The physico-chemical and redox properties modifications after Na, K and Ca impurities addition diminished the CO and NO removal, however, the C3H6 conversion was improved. Besides, both CO and C3H6 oxidation were enhanced, while the NO to NO2 conversion decreased in presence of P species. © 2018

AB  - Ethyl levulinate (EL) will be biomass-derived compound, which could be transformed into a variety of valuable compounds. In this work, a series of alumina-coated silica SBA-15 catalysts were prepared via wet-impregnation method and were applied in the conversion of fructose into EL. These catalysts were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy; low and wide-angle XRD, N2 adsorption–desorption, ICP-OES, TEM, SEM, EDX and elemental mapping techniques. Among the catalysts, Al-5-SB catalyst with Al content of 2.2% showed the best results for EL production with the selectivity and yield 86% and 58%, respectively. The various parameters such as the temperature of the reaction, time of the reaction, catalyst amount and the initial amount of fructose were investigated. Moreover, an experimental design was used to find optimized reaction conditions so that 190 °C for the reaction temperature, 4 h for the reaction time, and 50 mg of the catalyst for EL production was selected. As well as, the reusability of the catalyst was studied and it was reused for four runs without significant change in its catalytic activity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper describes an upgraded concept of the sustainability metric named Sustainability Profit (SP) from various micro- and macroeconomic perspectives and how it can be used for the synthesis of production systems in order to increase their circularity. An upgraded concept of SP is presented from three different perspectives: a microeconomic one, representing the company level, a macroeconomic perspective, combining the company and country (government) levels, and a wider macroeconomic one, with the addition of individuals (employees). Basic indicators of circularity, which measure the share of materials and energy reuse, are incorporated in order to synthesize more sustainable systems involving reuse of materials and energy. The concept is demonstrated on two case studies of supply network synthesis. The first case study is a supply network of fossil and renewable electricity production from various energy sources with fixed electricity demand, and the second case study is a larger-scale, renewable-based supply network for producing food, biofuels and electricity, and is applied to Central Europe. The results indicate that, by maximizing SP using the upgraded concept, overall circularity is favoured, and trade-offs between different sustainability pillars are obtained. The study could further be extended to account for uncertainty and more detailed Eco- and Social profit analysis and circularity measures as a good decision support tool in evaluating sustainable production systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Due to scarcity of fossil fuel, the importance of alternative energy sources is ever increasing. The oleaginous microalgae have demonstrated their potential as an alternative source of energy, but have not achieved commercialization owing to some biological and technical inefficiency. Modern methods of recombinant strain development for improved efficacy are suffering due to inadequate knowledge of genome and limited molecular tools available for their manipulation. Results: In the present study, microalga Scenedesmus quadricauda LWG002611 was selected as the preferred organism for lipid production as it contained high biomass (0.37 g L-1 day-1) and lipid (102 mg L-1 day-1), compared to other oleaginous algae examined in the present study as well as earlier reports. It possessed suitable biodiesel properties as per the range defined by the European biodiesel standard EN14214 and petro-diesel standard EN590:2013. To investigate the potential of S. quadricauda LWG002611 in details, the genome of the organism was assembled and annotated. This was the first genome sequencing and assembly of S. quadricauda, which predicted a genome size of 65.35 Mb with 13,514 genes identified by de novo and 16,739 genes identified by reference guided annotation. Comparative genomics revealed that it belongs to class Chlorophyceae and order Sphaeropleales. Further, small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (18S rRNA) sequencing was carried out to confirm its molecular identification. S. quadricauda LWG002611 exhibited higher number of genes related to major activities compared to other potential algae reported earlier with a total of 283 genes identified in lipid metabolism. Metabolic pathways were reconstructed and multiple gene homologs responsible for carbon fixation and triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis pathway were identified to further improve this potential algal strain for biofuel production by metabolic engineering approaches. Conclusion: Here we present the first draft genome sequence, genetic characterization and comparative evaluation of S. quadricauda LWG002611 which exhibit high biomass as well as high lipid productivity. The knowledge of genome sequence, reconstructed metabolic pathways and identification of rate-limiting steps in TAG biosynthesis pathway will strengthen the development of molecular tools towards further improving this potentially one of the major algal strains for biofuel production. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The European Union (EU) stands at a crossroads regarding its biofuel policies. For more than a decade, the EU sought to create a market for and govern sustainable biofuels for the transport sector, even as debates over sustainability escalated. It did so by devising novel hybrid (public and private) governance arrangements. We took stock of the nature and outcomes of this experiment in hybrid biofuel governance. We relied on qualitative methods of analysis, whereby we reviewed and synthesized the evolution of EU biofuel governance arrangements over time, through detailed document analysis of secondary and primary literature, including EU and related policy documents and private certification scheme websites. Our analysis reveals that, instead of yielding an increasingly stringent sustainability framework, the hybrid EU governance arrangements resulted in a proliferation of relatively lax, industry-driven, sustainability standards, even as the notion of "sustainable biofuels" remained contested in public and political debate. These findings contribute to an ongoing debate about the merits of hybrid (public-private) governance arrangements, and whether a hybrid approach helps strengthen or weaken sustainability objectives. We conclude that a more stringent EU meta-standard on sustainability needs to be developed, to underpin future governance arrangements. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) process is a method for the conversion of alcohols to an alternative jet fuel blendstock based on catalytic steps historically utilized by the petroleum refining and petrochemical industry. This pathway provides a means for producing a sustainable alternative jet fuel (SAJF) from a wide variety of resources and offers a near-term opportunity for alcohol producers to enter the SAJF market and for the aviation sector to meet growing SAJF demand. Herein, the technical background is reviewed and selected variations of ATJ processes evaluated. Simulation and modeling were employed to assess some ATJ conversion schemes, with a particular focus on comparisons between the use of an ethanol or isobutanol intermediate. Although the utilization of isobutanol offers a 34 % lower conversion cost for the catalytic upgrading process, the cost of alcohol production is estimated to contribute more than 80 % of the total cost at the refinery. The cost of feedstock and alcohol production has a dominant effect on the overall process economics. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - The synthesis of biomass-derived ethers to be used as biofuels or biofuel additives has attracted much attention. Following the recently reported synthesis of etherified ester ethyl-4-ethoxy pentanoate (EEP) from γ-valerolactone (GVL) in ethanol catalyzed by H-beta zeolite, an alternative route to prepare EEP in high yield has been developed by reductive etherification of ethyl levulinate (EL) in ethanol at 140 °C under 0.5 MPa H2 with a silica-modified Pd/C catalyst. The ether production likely follows a tandem acetalization–hydrogenolysis process with ethyl-4,4-diethoxy pentanoate (EDEP) as the intermediate. The acetalization step can be favored by introducing acidic materials, such as SiO2–carbon or beta zeolite, as a cocatalyst. The combination of the Pd/SiO2-C and beta zeolite mixture leads to 100 % EL conversion and 93 % EEP selectivity under optimized reaction conditions. For the first time, the standard molar combustion enthalpy of as-prepared EEP is measured by using a static oxygen bomb, and the value of which is determined to be about −5658 kJ mol−1, which is much larger than that of GVL (−2650 kJ mol−1). © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Different proportions of bio-oil (5, 10, 15, and 20 wt%) were added into aged asphalt for its regeneration. Molecular dynamic simulations were used to measure the thermal and mechanical performances of bio-oil regenerated aged asphalt (BRAA). A new, simplified BRAA model was built to calculate the specific heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficient, elastic constant, shear modulus, bulk modulus, and Young's modulus. Simulation results showed that the thermal expansion coefficient (CTE α) of asphalt at 298 K decreased by 10% after aging. Bio-oil of 5 wt% could make the CTE α restore to the original level of base asphalt, while the addition of bio-oil would further decrease the specific heat capacity of aged asphalt. The shear modulus (G), Young's modulus (K) and bulk modulus (E) of asphalt increased after aging and decreased with the increasing amount of bio-oil. According to the calculated E/G value, the ductility of aged asphalt increased by 6.0% with the addition of 10 wt% bio-oil, while over 15 wt% bio-oil would make the ductility of BRAA decrease. In summary, the regeneration effects of bio-oil to the thermal expansion coefficient, flexibility, and ductility of aged asphalt had been proven, while excessive bio-oil would decrease the thermal stability of asphalt. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This work explores the influence of hydrogen and ethanol on improving engine's behavior of Maduca longifolia oil (MO) based dual fuel diesel engine. A mono cylinder diesel engine was tested in dual fuel mode of operation at the rated power output of 3.7 kW under variable hydrogen energy shares from 0 to the maximum allowable limit (until severe knocking i.e. upto 20%). The knock limit was further extended by injecting water and ethanol at the intake manifold and the engine's performance, emission and combustion characteristics were analyzed. In addition ethanol was also injected and introduced along with the intake air for comparison with hydrogen dual fuel mode. Dual fuel operation increased the BTE from 25.2% with neat MO to a maximum of 28.5% and 30% respectively with hydrogen and ethanol for the energy share of 15% and 38% where as the BTE was 30.8% with ND. The smoke opacity was reduced from 78% with neat MO to 58% for the hydrogen energy share of 15% which is the MEP (maximum efficiency point) whereas the smoke emission was noted as 51% with ND operation. However, hydrogen induction increased the NO (nitric oxide) emission. Injection of water and ethanol at the inlet was observed to extend the knocking limit with improved BTE. The BTE reached a maximum of 30.1% with 5% water and 30.8% with 10% ethanol injection. The MEPs were arrived as 31% and 30% hydrogen energy shares respectively with 5% water and 10% ethanol injection. It was concluded that hydrogen induction can be very effective in improving the diesel engine's performance when using MO as base fuel when operating on dual fuel mode. The performance could be improved by extending the knock limit by injecting ethanol and water along with hydrogen. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Biofuels such as renewable alkanes and higher alcohols have drawn considerable interests for the use in internal combustion engines. Especially, higher alcohols could be used as a blending agent for diesel fuels. Herein, carbon supported phosphated ruthenium-molybdenum (RuMoP) catalysts were employed in continuous trickle-bed reactor for converting sorbitol into renewable alkanes and higher alcohols. The results showed that RuMoP on an active carbon (AC) support presented a complete sorbitol conversion and high yields of alkanes and alcohols in gasoline and diesel range. Subsequently, carbon nanotube (CNT) supported RuMoP was prepared and studied in detail for comparison. RuMoP/CNT presented a low C−C bond cracking property in sorbitol conversion and high selectivity of C6 products in gas-phase (C6 alkane, 74.7 %) and oil-phase (C6 alkane and alcohols, 87.8 %). Finally, detailed characterizations (N2-adsorption, XRD, HRTEM, XPS, NH3-TPD, Py-IR spectrums, etc.) were performed over relevant catalysts (RuMoP/C and RuMoP/CNT) for correlating their catalytic and physicochemical properties. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - This paper quantifies and compares the life cycle GHG emissions and costs of production of diesel and jet fuel derived from municipal solid waste (MSW) in the United States via three thermochemical conversion pathways: conventional gasification and Fischer-Tropsch (FT middle distillate, MD), plasma gasification and Fischer-Tropsch (Plasma FT MD), and conventional gasification, catalytic alcohol synthesis, and alcohol-to-jet upgrading (ATJ MD). We use expanded system boundaries to capture the change in existing MSW use and disposal, and account for parameter uncertainty with Monte Carlo simulations. We estimate median life cycle GHG emissions of 32.9, 62.3, and 52.7 gCO 2 e/MJ for FT, Plasma FT and ATJ MD fuels, respectively, compared to a baseline of 90 gCO 2 e/MJ for conventional MD fuels. Median minimum selling prices are estimated at 0.99, 1.78, and 1.20 per liter with the probability of achieving a positive net present value of fuel production at market prices of 14%, 0.1% and 7% for FT, Plasma FT and ATJ MD fuels, respectively. If the societal perspective rather than an investor's perspective is evaluated, then the probability of positive net present value of fuel production increases to 93%, 67%, and 92.5% for the FT, Plasma FT, and ATJ MD fuels, respectively. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A critical challenge for the bioenergy research community has been producing drop-in hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals at yields sufficient to compete with their petroleum-derived counterparts. Biological production of highly reduced compounds poses fundamental challenges. Conversely, glucose, xylose, and sucrose can be fermented to ethanol at near-theoretical yields. Just as olefin crackers are often considered a gateway for petrochemical complexes that produce an array of downstream products, catalytic ethanol upgrading can potentially enable an entire biorefining complex able to produce renewable, low-carbon fuels and chemicals. By doping the Ta2O5/SiO2 catalyst with different transition metals, we show that Ostromyslensky catalysts can be utilized for direct conversion of ethanol to varying ratios of 1,3-butadiene (1,3-BD), dietheylether (DEE), and ethylene. These results are integrated into the first comprehensive analysis of ethanol conversion to 1,3-BD, DEE, and ethylene that incorporates empirical data with chemical process modeling and life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) assessment. We find that the suite of products can replace conventional rubber, plastics, and diesel, achieving as much as a 150% reduction in GHG-intensity relative to fossil pathways (net carbon sequestration). Selecting the route with the greatest ethylene and DEE output can maximize total potential emission reductions. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Improvement of processes that utilize renewable feedstocks to produce chemicals ordinarily derived from fossil carbon feedstocks is paramount to creating environmentally sustainable chemical and fuel industries. Catalytic conversion of biorefinery-derived ethanol via the Guerbet condensation has the potential to serve such a purpose. In this contribution, we demonstrate marked selectivity changes in the ethanol condensation over a copper-doped porous metal oxide catalyst upon a single exposure to ppm quantities of a soluble chloride source. Without this modification, ethyl acetate is the major product, with the others being n-butanol (principally) plus some 1-hexanol, butyl acetate, and ethyl butanoate. A single exposure to chloride increases activity and, more importantly, dramatically changes selectivity to give n-butanol and 1-hexanol as the largest products. X-ray diffraction and basicity measurements pre- and post-reaction were used to examine how chloride alters the properties of this Earth-abundant catalyst prepared by calcining a Cu-doped Mg/Al hydrotalcite. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The effect of support nature, SiO2 and γ-Al2O3, on physicochemical and catalytic properties of nickel phosphide catalysts in methyl palmitate hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) has been considered. Firstly, alumina-supported nickel phosphide catalysts prepared by temperature-programmed reduction method starting from different precursors (phosphate–Ni(NO3)2 and (NH4)2 HPO4 or phosphite–Ni(OH)2 and H3 PO3) were compared using elemental analysis, N2 physisorption, H2-TPR, XRD, TEM, NH3-TPD,27 Al and31P MAS NMR techniques and catalytic experiments. The mixture of nickel phosphide phases was produced from phosphate precursor on alumina while using of phosphite precursor provides Ni2P formation with the higher activity in methyl palmitate HDO. Besides, the comparative study of the performances of Ni2 P/SiO2 and Ni2P/Al2O3 catalysts demonstrates the apparent superiority of alumina-supported Ni2P in the methyl palmitate hydrodeoxygenation. Considering the tentative scheme of methyl palmitate transformation, we proposed that cooperation of Ni2P and acid sites on the surface of alumina provides the enhanced activity of alumina-supported Ni2P through the acceleration of acid-catalysed hydrolysis. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - In this article, we explore the opportunities and challenges of landscape approaches through the lens of responsible research and innovation (RRI).We use the case of transport biofuels to reflect on the capacity of landscape approaches to support the governance of emerging technologies. The case study, developed in the region of Sardinia, Italy, consists of a landscape design process for the implementation of biofuel technologies that rely on the use of non-food dedicated crops and agricultural residues. By using non-food feedstocks, the biofuel project aims to avoid competition with food production and achieve sustainability goals. Through the discussion of key dimensions of RRI in relation to this case, the article puts forward a set of critical aspects of landscape design processes that require further attention from theorists and practitioners in the field of landscape-based planning. These include the power imbalance that exists between the diverse actors involved in project activities, a need for improving the flexibility of the configuration of socio-technical systems, revising assumptions on 'valid' knowledge, and improving the deliberative component of planning processes. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The present work aims to investigate the effect of water addition to orange peel oil biodiesel (BD100) in a diesel engine to reduce the exhaust emissions. Fuel samples are prepared with different concentrations of water into biodiesel, 95% biodiesel + 5% water (BD95W5) and 90% orange peel oil biodiesel + 10% water (BD90W10). The water is added to biodiesel in presence of surfactant (Span-80). The experimental investigation on diesel engine reveals that the oxides of nitrogen emission and smoke emission are reduced for BD95W5 and BD90W10 compared to BD100 and diesel. In addition, the introduction of water to biodiesel in diesel engine reduces the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions noticeably. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The rotating packed bed (RPB) is a promising advanced reactor used in industrial gas-liquid two-phase reaction processes because of its high phase contact efficiency and mixing efficiency. Investigation of RPBs using CFD simulations will improve the understanding of physical behaviours of gas and liquid flows in such reactors. Currently, CFD simulations on the RPBs only focus on the volume of fluid (VOF) method. However, the VOF method is not suitable for simulations of pilot-scale 2D and 3D RPBs due to the limitations in computer resources, while the Eulerian method using a porous media model is a promising alternative method but it is rarely reported. The reason is that there are no suitable porous media models that accurately describe the drag force between the gas and liquid, the gas and solids and the liquid and solids due to the high porosity and the stacked wire screen packing used in RPBs. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose a new model for modelling RPBs. The new proposed model is based on the Kołodziej high porosity wire screen one-phase porous media model. In this work, two experimental counter-current gas–liquid flow cases from the literatures have been used for validating the CFD simulation results. Finally, the new model has been compared with the current porous media models for traditional spherical or structured slit packed beds, which are the Attou, Lappalainen, Iliuta and Zhang models. The simulation results show that the proposed new model is the most appropriate and accurate model for the simulation of RPBs among all the models investigated in this paper. © 2018 The Author(s)

AB  - In this work, the enzymatic hydrolysis of the crambe oil by using a commercial immobilized lipase Lipozyme RM IM was evaluated. The effect of the operational conditions, such as temperature, water/oil molar ratio, enzyme/substrate mass ratio and stirring speed were assessed based on the experimental designs. The experiments were performed in a closed and batch system with controlled temperature and stirring speed. In addition, the kinetics of the process was studied in the best operational conditions, wherein the experimental data were obtained and described by a mathematical model. The influence of the operational conditions was assessed based on the measured values of the free fatty acids (FFA) produced by the enzymatic hydrolysis. In 4 h of reaction, a yield of 42.6% was observed and the most significant operational conditions were the enzyme/substrate mass ratio and stirring speed. By the kinetic investigation, an initial reaction rate of 3.5 × 104 mol mL−1 h−1 and a maximum yield of 74% were observed after 40 h of reaction (in the equilibrium condition). The mathematical model was not only able to adequately describe the experimental data of FFA concentrations profiles but also showed predictive capacity to independents assays in different operational conditions. Therefore, based on the simulation analysis of the enzymatic hydrolysis of the crambe oil, the model can be useful for process optimization and phenomenological studies. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In the present study, tests were conducted to reduce CO 2 emissions from a single-cylinder CI engine using biofuels and an exhaust catalytic carbon capture system (ECCCS) to evaluate CO 2 sequestration of biofuels. Karanja oil is a second generation non-edible oil available abundantly in India. A Karanja oil methyl ester (KOME) operated CI engine emits higher CO 2 emissions due to the higher carbon content in its structure compared to diesel. Hence, the low carbon biofuel Orange oil (ORG) was blended on an equal volume basis with KOME. The blend reduced CO 2 emissions by 27% compared to KOME at 100% load condition. For further enhancement, acetone (A) was blended 20% by volume basis with the KOME-ORG blend. CO 2 emissions were reduced by about 30% for KOME-ORG + A20 blend compared to KOME at 100% load condition. Employing ECCCS along with KOME-ORG + A20 blend reduces CO 2 emissions further. CO 2 emissions are reduced by about 44% for KOME-ORG + A20 + Zeolite and reduced by about 32% for KOME-ORG + A20 + activated carbon. The results clearly indicate that KOME-ORG + A20 + zeolite is optimal among the blends based on carbon capture and maximum CO 2 sequestration. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

IHC and DEME acquired extensive knowledge during the build of LNG-powered trailing suction hooper dredgers Minerva and Scheldt River. This know-how played a key role throughout the development and construction of Spartacus. The four main engines of the vessel could run on LNG, marine diesel oil (MDO), and heavy fuel oil (HFO). The two auxilliary engines also incorporated dual-fuel technology. It also featured several other additional innovations, such as a waste heat recovery system and a one-man operated dredge control.

AB  - Biomass-derived bio-oil is a sustainable and renewable energy resource, and liquefaction is a potential conversion way to produce bio-oil. Emulsification is a physical upgrading technology, which blends immiscible liquids into a homogeneous emulsion through the addition of an emulsifier. Liquefaction bio-oil from food waste is characterized by its high pour point when compared to diesel fuel. In order to partially replace diesel fuel by liquefaction bio-oil, this study aimed to develop a method to simultaneously extract and emulsify the bio-oil using a commercial surfactant (Atlox 4914, CRODA, Snaith, UK). The solubility and stability of the emulsions at various operating conditions such as the bio-oil-to-emulsifier ratio (B/E ratio), storage temperature and duration, and co-surfactant (methanol) addition were analyzed. The results demonstrate that higher amounts of bio-oil (7 g) and emulsifier (7 g) at a B/E ratio = 1 in an emulsion have a higher solubility (66.48 wt %). When the B/E ratio was decreased from 1 to 0.556, the bio-oil solubility was enhanced by 45.79%, even though the storage duration was up to 7 days. Compared to the emulsion stored at room temperature (25 °C), its storage at 100 °C presented a higher solubility, especially at higher B/E ratios. Moreover, when methanol was added as a co-surfactant during emulsification at higher B/E ratios (0.714 to 1), it rendered better solubility (58.83-70.96 wt %). Overall, the emulsified oil showed greater stability after the extraction-emulsification process. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - To reduce the economic impact caused by the fossil fuel crisis and avoid relying on existing biofuels, it is important to seek locally available and renewable biofuel throughout the year. In the present work, a new light biofuel-Melaleuca Cajuputi oil (MCO)-was introduced to blend with refined palm oil (RPO). The physicochemical properties, combustion characteristics, engine performance, and exhaust emissions were comprehensively examined. It was found that the higher the percentage of MCO, the lower the viscosity and density of the blends obtained. Calorific value (CV) was increased with the increase of MCO fraction in the blend. Regression analysis has suggested that the blend of 32% (v/v) of RPO and 68% (v/v) of MCO (RPO32MCO68) is optimal to obtain viscosity and density in accordance with ASTM 6751/EN 14214 standards. The experimental results show that the in-cylinder pressure, brake torque, and brake power of the optimal blend were slightly lower than those of baseline diesel fuel. Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), carbon monoxide (CO), and unburnt hydrocarbon (HC) were found to be slightly higher compared to diesel fuel. Notably, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and smoke opacity were found to be decreased over the entire range of the test. Overall, the optimal blend of RPO32MCO68 has shown a decent result which marks it as a potential viable source of biofuel. © 2018 MDPI AG. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nearly 350 species of biodiesel feedstocks have been identified by many researchers for the past few decades. Unlike petroleum diesel, the biodiesel degrades rapidly and deterioration of its quality occurred while contacting with atmospheric oxygen. This main drawback of instability of fuel properties limited the commercial use of biodiesel in the global fuel market. To inhibit this oxidative degradation of biodiesel, the antioxidants are used. Comparing to other antioxidants, the synthetic antioxidants (phenolic) are more efficient. This study investigates the effects of commercially available and cheap synthetic antioxidants (TBHQ – tert-butylhydroxyquinone, PY – pyrogallol, PG – propyl gallate, BHT – butylated hydroxytoluene, and BHA – butylated hydroxyanisole) at 1000 ppm concentration on the fuel stability of Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel. The discrepancy in antioxidant activity has been characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy by analyzing the O–H and C–H molecular chains prevalence in the infrared spectrum region of 3000–3700 cm−1 and 2800–3000 cm−1. TBHQ at 1000 ppm dosed with C. inophyllum biodiesel improves the oxidation stability by 42.56%, storage stability by 36.57%, and thermal stability by 41.02% when compared to those of pure biodiesel (B100) without any antioxidant. The rank of antioxidants effectiveness with pure biodiesel is obtained as TBHQ &gt; PG &gt; PY &gt; BHT &gt; BHA. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - In this present investigation, lipid extraction was performed in marine macro algae Ulva fasciata using soxhlet and super critical fluid extraction apparatus. The ultrasonic pretreatment was done for the algal biomass. Extraction parameters for High extraction yield of algal oil were obtained at 5% moisture content, 0.25 mm particle size, 90 °C, 180 min time, 5:1 solvent-to-solid ratio and solvent flow rate 1 l/hr. After the optimization process 9.85% of oil extraction was obtained from Ulva fasicata algal biomass. The aromatic groups, indicating the presence of 12-Hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid was confirmed by FT-IR analysis. Thus the algal oil obtained from Ulva fasicata biomass can be used for the biodiesel production. The saturated fatty acid (SFAs) was found to be 75.43% in the produced algal oil. The properties like Acid value, Iodine number, specific gravity, Saponification value, calorific value, Flash point, Fire point and kinematic viscosity was also characterized. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Oilseed crops, including several mustards, are cultivated as biofuel sources worldwide. However, common mustard crops (e.g., the rapeseed Brassica napus) grow naturally in mesic temperate regions, which are expected to be impaired by global warming and increased aridity. In particular, increased aridity is predicted to reduce the oil concentration and seed yield of rapeseed crops. There is therefore an urgent need to identify alternative bioenergy crops that are preadapted to future climatic conditions. An alternative to conventional Brassica species for biodiesel production is the white mustard Sinapis alba, which is native to the circum-Mediterranean region and has a high seed lipid content. S. alba grows spontaneously in olive groves and other widespread Mediterranean crops; accordingly, it could be easily cultivated by companion planting to improve ecosystem function by decreasing soil loss, controlling microbial disease, and assisting in the maintenance of biodiversity. In this study, using species distribution modeling, we predicted climatically suitable areas for the cultivation of S. alba in Western Europe across the Mediterranean Basin under present climatic conditions and several climate change scenarios. We show that current climatically suitable areas for S. alba cultivation do not overlap with those for B. napus. Unlike B. napus, S. alba could be cultivated throughout most of the circum-Mediterranean region. According to our models, increases in aridity and annual mean temperatures will expand the climatically suitable areas for S. alba in the Mediterranean Basin. However, suitable areas for the cultivation of B. napus will decrease significantly in Western Europe. Our results indicate that S. alba is a strong, environmentally safe candidate for biofuel production throughout the Mediterranean Basin and other Western European countries, especially under climate change scenarios that are expected to impair current oilseed crops. © 2018 Jaime et al.

AB  - The main purpose of this study is to comprehensively investigate a biodiesel production system by transesterification of mutton tallow. To this end, an exergo-environmental life cycle assessment was applied. Exergetic investigation identifies the location, magnitude and sources of the thermodynamic inefficiencies in the biodiesel production process (the highest priority components for process improvement from the thermodynamic point of view). In contrast, environmental life cycle assessment identifies the environmental hot spot subsystems of the entire mutton tallow-to-biodiesel system (the highest priority life cycle steps for environmental improvement). The results obtained show that approximately 83.3% of the exergy fed to the process is recovered in the useful product (biodiesel). The transesterification reactor should have the highest priority for process improvement from the thermodynamic point of view. However, the environmental improvements of the entire biodiesel production system should be focused on minimizing methanol consumption. The net energy ratio of the system is approximately 2.3. Therefore, the biodiesel system presents a net energy gain. Using economic allocation instead of the mass-based approach leads to an increase in the life cycle indicators by approximately 11%. However, this difference is only 6.7% when considering energy allocation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this article, the effects of different biofuel–diesel blends on engine oil dilution and diesel oxidation catalyst performance during late post-injections were investigated. The engine tests were made with an off-road diesel engine under low load conditions at 1200 r/min engine speed. During the experiments, oil samples were periodically taken from the engine oil and later analyzed. Emissions and temperatures before and after the diesel oxidation catalyst were also measured. The fuels studied were fossil EN590:2013 diesel fuel, 30 vol.% biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester) and 30 vol.% hydrotreated vegetable oil, which is a paraffinic diesel fuel fulfilling the EN15940 specification. The novelty of the study is based on two parts. First, similar late post-injection tests were run with blends of both hydrotreated vegetable oil and fatty acid methyl ester, giving a rare comparison with the fuels. Second, oil dilution and the fuel exit rates during normal mode without the late post-injections were measured. The results showed the oil dilution and the diesel oxidation catalyst performance to be very similar with regular diesel and hydrotreated vegetable oil blend. With the fatty acid methyl ester blend, increased oil dilution, smaller temperature rise in the diesel oxidation catalyst and higher emissions were measured. This indicates that during diesel particulate filter regeneration by late post-injections, fatty acid methyl ester blends increase fuel consumption and require shorter oil change intervals, while hydrotreated vegetable oil blends require no parameter changes. © IMechE 2017.

AB  - Oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides DMKU3-TK16 (TK16), which was isolated from Thailand, is considered a promising lipid producer for biodiesel production. For future industrial applications of this strain, thermotolerant traits are highly desired for their potential to reduce cooling costs in a commercial fermenter. Here, by using an adaptive breeding strategy, we isolated a thermotolerant R. toruloides mutant, L1-1. The isolated L1-1 strain exhibited better growth and higher lipid production at 37°C, and it was found to have significantly higher oleic acid (C18:1) content and yield compared with the wild-type TK16 when cultivated at 37°C. This is the first study to isolate a thermotolerant strain from the oleaginous yeast R. toruloides. The information gained herein will provide new clues for engineering lipid production and for studying the thermotolerance of R. toruloides. © FEMS 2018. All rights reserved.

AB  - As the world confronts a surging price of fuel along with various environmental issues, researchers around the globe are scrambling to identify and develop potential biofuel feedstocks that fall outside the “food or fuel dilemma”. This justifies the need for non-edible oilseeds that can be used as sustainable feedstock for biofuel production. In this study, non-edible Ricinus communis seeds were utilized in the production of bio-based fuel to support the crusade for the use of renewable energy. Extraction of bio-oil from R. communis seeds was done through ultrasonic-assisted solvent extraction. The effects of n-hexane to biomass (HB) ratio, extraction time, and resonance amplitude on bio-oil yield were investigated. Optimization of bio-oil yield was done through central composite design of the response surface methodology. The optimum bio-oil yield was found to be 42% at optimum conditions of 10:1 HB ratio, 25 min extraction time and 50 μm resonance amplitude. Characterization of the extracted bio-oil revealed a density of 0.9 g mL−1, kinematic viscosity of 18.6 cSt at 40 °C, and higher heating value of 29.5 MJ kg−1. The Fourier Transform Infrared Radiation spectroscopy analysis of the bio-oil revealed that it contained ester functional groups. Gas chromatography analysis showed that the major fatty acids present in the bio-oil are palmitic (2.2%), stearic (2.4%), oleic (6.7%), linoleic (8.8%) and ricinoleic (77.1%). The R. communis bio-oil is enriched with unsaturated fatty acids while there is a relatively low content of saturated fatty acid accounting 87.8% and 11.3% of the total fatty acids composition, respectively. As confirmed by this study, the results indicate the potential of R. communis bio-oil as a source for biodiesel production. © 2018 Chinese Institute of Environmental Engineering, Taiwan

AB  - The idea of this innovative filter concept is to combine three individual flue gas technology treatment systems into one product to be more economic and efficient. The central part of the filter is a ceramic filter candle, which is used for common dust separation. The ceramic filter material is activated with modified catalysts to enable selective catalytic reduction at low temperatures (150–200 °C). To reduce acid components while simultaneously increasing dust separation, the activated filter candle surface is precoated with an absorbent. The developed filter is suitable for many applications, especially decentralized applications such as solid biomass combustion or utilization of biofuels in combined heat and power engines, which are target markets. The production of the filter material and the practical test using exhaust gas from a dual fuel engine operating with biofuels are described. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - The present research focuses on the analyzing the characteristics of bio-oil derived from intermediate pyrolysis of Aegle marmelos (AM) seed cake and its suitability for C.I. engine adaptation. Owing to the high volatile matter content of 73.69%, Aegle marmelos biomass was selected as the feedstock for this research. The intermediate pyrolysis was carried out at 600 °C in a 2-kg fixed bed type pyrolysis reactor at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and the obtained bio-oil was characterized by different analytical methods. As per American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards, physicochemical properties of the bio-oil were tested and it was observed that bio-oil is a highly viscous fluid with low calorific value. Analysis of bio-oil through FT-IR and GC-MS examination confirmed the presence of phenol, esters, alkyl, and oxygenated compounds. The performance and emission testing of direct injection diesel engine were conducted with various bio-oil blends and the results were compared with baseline diesel fuel. The experimental results showed that the addition of bio-oil decreased BTE (%) while increasing the BSEC (MJ/kW-h). At the same time, increasing the bio-oil ratio with diesel decreases dangerous emissions such as carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen emissions in the engine exhaust. According to engine test result, it was suggested that up to 20% of AM bio-oil (F20) can be employed as engine fuel for better engine operating characteristics. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The present study is aimed to analyze the combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of water-emulsified soybean biodiesel fueled diesel engine with alumina nanoadditive and the results compared with conventional diesel fuel (BD). Experiments were conducted in a single-cylinder, four-stroke, variable compression ratio, and natural aspirated diesel engine with an eddy current dynamometer at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. Water-soybean biodiesel emulsion fuel was prepared using a mechanical agitator, in which the water concentration was limited to 10%, whereas soybean biodiesel (SB) and surfactant concentrations were 89% and 1% by volume respectively. Alumina (Al) was chosen as a nanoadditive, and the mass fractions of 50 ppm and 100 ppm were blended with emulsion fuel using ultrasonicator and the physicochemical properties were measured. The physicochemical properties of water-emulsified biodiesel and nanoadditive included emulsified biodiesel are at par with EN14214 limits. The in-cylinder pressure (ICP) and net heat release rate (NHR) values of SB are 5.3% and 7.2% lower than BD respectively, whereas the water inclusion significantly increases the ICP and NHR values by 6.9% and 15.9% compared to SB. Brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of SB is higher than BD, and brake-specific energy consumption (BSEC) is lower than BD. An inclusion of 10% water in SB improves the BSFC and BSEC by 4% and 10.6% respectively compared to SB. The Al nanoparticle inclusion in water-emulsified soybean biodiesel further improves the combustion and performance parameters. The exhaust gas temperature (EGT) of sample fuels seems to be lesser than BD due to efficient combustion. As far as the emission characteristics are concerned, the SB promotes lower level of hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and smoke emissions with notable increases in oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. An inclusion of 10% water in SB reduces the NOx, HC, CO, and smoke emission by 21.2%, 16.7%, 16.9%, and 11.8% respectively under peak brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) condition. The addition of Al nanoparticle in biodiesel emulsion fuel further reduce NOx, HC, CO, and smoke emissions and marginally increases the CO2 emission. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This work presents the effect of the ternary oxygenated additive on diesel biodiesel blended fuel to evaluate the engine characteristics. The Calophyllum inophyllum trees being abundant in India can lessen the dependence on petroleum imports to a specific extent. Methyl tertiary butyl ether is used as an oxygenated additive for the ternary blends preparation as 5–20% by volume. Seven blends of neat baseline diesel, biodiesel (Calophyllum inophyllum Methyl Ester), a blend of diesel (50%)-biodiesel (50%), a blend of diesel (50%)-biodiesel-methyl tert-butyl ether (5, 10, 15, and 20%) are prepared which are tested on a single cylinder, constant speed diesel engine. The experimental results were revealed that the replacement of biodiesel by MTBE has shown a slight reduction in brake thermal efficiency with a slight increase in brake-specific fuel consumption. Further, the MTBE addition in ternary blends reduced the unburned hydrocarbon, CO, and NOx by 63.9, 6.4, and 3.37% respectively. In addition, the carbon dioxide emission is almost similar to diesel fuel at a higher addition of MTBE with diesel-biodiesel blend. In the combustion point of view, the addition of 5% MTBE resulted in 3.49 and 5.1% reduction of peak pressure and heat release rate are observed as compared to diesel fuel. Critical analysis in combustion aspects is also carried out and it is witnessed with prolonged ignition delay during MTBE addition with diesel-biodiesel blends. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biodiesel production from vegetable oils is not sustainable and economical due to the food crisis worldwide. The development of a cost-effective non-edible feedstock is essential. In this study, we proposed to use aquatic oomycetes for microbial oils, which are cellulolytic fungus-like filamentous eukaryotic microorganisms, commonly known as water molds. They differ from true fungi as cellulose is present in their cell wall and chitin is absent. They show parasitic as well as saprophytic nature and have great potential to utilize decaying animal and plant debris in freshwater habitats. To study the triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation in the aquatic oomycetes, the isolated water mold Achlya diffusa was cultivated under semi-solid-state conditions on waste sugarcane bagasse, which was compared with the cultivation in Czapek (DOX) medium. A. diffusa grown on waste sugarcane bagasse showed large lipid droplets in its cellular compartment and synthesized 124.03 ± 1.93 mg/gds cell dry weight with 50.26 ± 1.76% w/w lipid content. The cell dry weight and lipid content of this water mold decreased to 89.54 ± 1.21 mg/gds and 38.82% w/w, respectively, when cultivated on standard medium Czapek-Dox agar (CDA). For the fatty acid profile of A. diffusa grown in sugarcane bagasse and CDA, in situ transesterification (IST) and indirect transesterification (IDT) approaches were evaluated. The lipid profile of this mold revealed the presence of C12:0, C14:0, C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2, C20:0, and C21:0 fatty acids, which is similar to vegetable oils. The biodiesel properties of the lipids obtained from A. diffusa satisfied the limits as determined by international standards ASTM-D6751 and EN-14214 demonstrating its suitability as a fuel for diesel engines. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - There is an urgent need to address environmental problems caused by our transportation systems, which include the reduction of associated CO2 emissions. In the short term, renewable drop-in fuels are ideal, as they allow a direct integration into the existing infrastructure. However, preferably they would perform better than current alternatives (for example, bioethanol) and be synthesized in a more efficient way. Here we demonstrate the production of biogasoline with a direct upstream integration into processes in existing petrorefinery facilities that targets the 10% bio-based carbon in accordance with the current European Union directives (for 2020) for biofuels. To achieve this goal, we show the valorization of (hemi)cellulose pulp into light naphtha using a two-phase (H2O:organic) catalytic slurry process. A C5–C6 alkane stream, enriched with bio-derived carbon and compatible with further downstream petrorefinery operations for (bio)gasoline production, is automatically obtained by utilizing fossil light straight run naphtha as the organic phase. The ease of integration pleads for a joint petro/bio effort to gradually produce bio-enriched gasolines, wherein the chemical compounds of the bio-derived fraction are indistinguishable from those in current high-quality gasoline compositions. © 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Higher unburned hydrocarbon emissions are attributed to the relatively low temperature combustion of natural gas in compression ignition engines whereas the combustion of hydrogen in compression ignition environment results in higher NOX. These emissions characteristics are explained on the basis of different physio-chemical properties of the two gaseous fuel: higher Cp value in case of natural gas and higher diffusion coefficient, wider flammability limits and shorter quenching gaps for hydrogen are held responsible for these trends. This study assesses the potential of hydrogen being used in combination with natural gas with diesel and rapeseed methyl ester (RME) as pilot fuels. This type of fueling can be referred as ‘triple fueling of the compression ignition engines’ and has the potential to achieve a better trade-off between the higher NOX associated with hydrogen and higher hydrocarbon emissions associated with natural gas based dual fueling of compression ignition engines. The present study has investigated the potential of the triple fueling of the compression ignition engines so far the attainment of a better trade-off between NOX and hydrocarbon emissions are concerned. Comparing the specific NOX and hydrocarbon emissions in different cases reveals that a significant drop in specific hydrocarbon emissions can be achieved at the cost of a small increment in specific NOX. At both speeds (1000 rev/min and 1500 rev/min), the reduction in hydrocarbon emissions is more prominent at relatively lower loads, which can be a potential solution of reducing specific hydrocarbon emissions at lower loads in diesel engine operations. The stoichiometric equation for the triple fueling (Diesel or RME piloted mixture of natural gas and hydrogen) is also presented. © 2018

AB  - This work is all about utilization of more than two low carbon fuels in a diesel engine with a main objective of reducing harmful emissions. Initially, test engine was tested with a non-petroleum-based fuel namely mahua oil, under different load conditions. In the second phase of the work, test engine was modified into dual fuel mode with slight modification in the intake manifold for the admission of a low carbon high octane primary fuel namely ethanol. The engine was tested by varying the ethanol energy share (EES) from 5% to the point at which engine tends to knock at 100% and 40% of the maximum engine power output. Finally, an attempt was made to induct a zero carbon high octane fuel (i.e., hydrogen) in the intake manifold of the dual fuel engine operated with mahua and ethanol and tested for the behavior. Experimental results claimed that inclusion of ethanol improved the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) only at the higher loads. Optimized EES at 100% load conditions was identified as 15%. It is found that injection of ethanol significantly reduced the harmful emissions like smoke and oxides of nitrogen at the price of increased hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. It is also inferenced that BTE was improved further with the increases of hydrogen flow rate at peak load. Interestingly all the carbon-based emissions were drastically reduced with the inclusion of hydrogen. However, the oxides of nitrogen emission were found to be increased with increase of hydrogen flow rate. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In present study, biodiesel was produced from landfill waste-derived oil by chemical transesterification process, to evaluate its potential as a renewable energy source for the first time. The free fatty acid percentage (FFA) in landfill waste oil is considered to be high, which was reduced by treating it with two different acids as catalyst, muriatic acid and phosphoric acid, in order to build a comparison between fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) contents. Further, it was treated with a base catalyst potassium hydroxide (KOH) to produce the final product. The FAME value of landfill oil when treated with muriatic acid was found to be 92.59%. The quality of biodiesel produced was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC), which indicated above 25.7% of conversion of oil into biodiesel when muriatic acid was used as a catalyst. The properties of the produced biodiesel were found to be in good agreement with ASTM D 6751 and EN 14214 standards. Various test fuels were prepared for the engine test by blending 10%, 20%, and 100% of landfill waste biodiesel in diesel on volumetric basis and designated as B10, B20, and B100, respectively. The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of the engine was more while the exhaust emission was less except NOx with biodiesel and its blend (B10 and B20). Thus, landfill waste is a potential source of biodiesel, and blends of landfill waste up to 20% can be used for realizing better performance from the engine. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The present experimental work focuses on the influence injection pressure and toroidal re-entrant combustion chamber in a single cylinder diesel engine fuelled with ternary fuel (diesel-biodiesel-ethanol) blend. Ternary fuel (TF) is prepared by blending 70% diesel, 20% biodiesel, and 10% ethanol blends and its fuel properties were investigated and compared with diesel fuel. Since the physic-chemical properties of TF are well behind the diesel fuel, it is proposed to be blended with 20 ppm alumina nano additives which act as an ignition enhancer and catalytic oxidizer. The resulting fuel mixture (TF + 20 ppm alumina additive) is named as high performance fuel (HPF). Experimentations were conducted on HPF subjected to various injection pressures of 18 MPa, 20 MPa, 22 MPa, and 24 MPa respectively and are operated in toroidal re-entrant chamber geometry (TG) at an injection timing of 22 o bTDC. From experimentation, it was identified that, for TG-HPF, higher injection pressure of 22 MPa ensued highest BTE (Brake Thermal Efficiency) of 35.5% and lowest BSEC (Brake Specific Fuel Consumption) of 10.13 MJ/kWh owing to the pooled effect of higher swirl formation, improved atomization enhanced evaporation rate, and better air-fuel mixing. Emission wise TG-HPF operated at 22 MPa lowered the HC (hydrocarbon), CO (carbon monoxide), and smoke emissions by 18.88%, 7.19%, and 5.02%, but with marginally improved NOx (oxides of nitrogen) and CO 2 (carbon dioxide) emissions by 3.92% and 3.89% respectively. In combustion point of view, it is observed that injection pressure increased the cylinder pressure, heat release rate (HRR), and cumulative heat release rate (CHRR) by 5.35%, 5.08%, and 3.38% respectively indicating improved combustion rate as a result of enhanced atomization, evaporation, and high turbulence inducement. Overall, it is concluded that operating the ternary fuel at 22 MPa injection pressure at toroidal re-entrant combustion chamber results in improved performance and minimized emissions. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Corn kernel fiber ethanol that can be produced concurrently with corn starch ethanol has recently been approved as cellulosic biofuel in the USA, suggesting that fiber ethanol could be eligible for a higher credit price than conventional starch ethanol due to its anticipated lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A life-cycle analysis was conducted to quantify ethanol's GHG emissions. Here we show that fiber ethanol's life-cycle GHG emissions (36–39 g CO2e MJ−1) are close to meeting the US cellulosic biofuel's legislative mandate of 60% GHG emissions reduction relative to gasoline (~94 g CO2e MJ−1), with slightly lower emissions under the nth plant mature fiber technology than under the state of technology (SOT). The co-product, distiller's grain with solubles (DGS), can notably affect fiber ethanol's GHG emissions, and this impact may need to be further examined when evidence of DGS market impacts becomes available. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is expected to play an important role in decarbonizing our economy. In this modeling study, we assessed the future role of biobased chemicals and energy from this resource in the EU up to 2030. The study's general outcomes indicate that biobased heat remains the largest biobased sector over this period, and biobased chemicals remain the smallest. A significant share of EU-domestic lignocellulosic biomass potential remains unutilized, even when feedstock availability is restricted. The technology mix for biobased heat, power, biofuels, and chemicals remains relatively stable in all cases, with a strong role for biobased combined heat and power (CHP). Several specific ‘what if’ analyses were done. These show that both restriction of feedstock potential and active mobilization of available potential affect overall costs of biobased options, illustrating the relevance of specific policies in bringing biomass potentials to the market. In feedstock-restricted scenarios, specific attention to advanced lignocellulose-based fuel technologies is essential to meet biofuel ambitions. Another analysis indicates that both competition and synergy effects occur between energy and chemical applications of biomass. This illustrates that biorefining and co-production of biobased chemicals and energy in integrated biorefineries is a better and more robust business than separated production. Finally, an analysis of the dynamics between lignocellulosic and crop-based biofuels reveals that the current capacity of the latter creates a need for a specific subtarget for lignocellulose-based biofuels before they can enter the market, and that crop-based biofuels may be gradually phased out, but with significant additional costs. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - In this study, valorisation of high acid value waste cooking oil into biodiesel has been investigated. Non-catalytic transesterification using supercritical methanol has been used for biodiesel production. Four controllable independent process variables have been considered for analysis including methanol to oil (M:O) molar ratio, temperature, pressure and time. Uncommon effects of process variables on the reaction responses, e.g. biodiesel and glycerol yields, have been observed and extensively discussed. Response surface methodology (RSM) via Central Composite Design (CCD) has been used to analyse the effect of the process variables and their interactions on the reaction responses. A quadratic model for each response has been developed representing the interrelationships between process variables and responses. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) has been used to verify the significance effect of each process variable and their interactions on reaction responses. Optimal reaction conditions have been predicted using RSM for 98% and 2.05% of biodiesel and glycerol yields, respectively at 25:1 M:O molar ratio, 265 °C temperature, 110 bar pressure and 20 min reaction time. The predicted optimal conditions have been validated experimentally resulting in 98.82% biodiesel yield, representing 0.83% relative error. The quality of the produced biodiesel showed excellent agreement with the European biodiesel standard (EN14214). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The objective was to study changes in water-saturated biodiesel irradiated by electron beam and to analyse them considering the influence of absorbed dose. Based on obtained results it can be concluded that irradiation did not affect ester groups in FAME molecules, but strongly influenced on double bonds. Total ester content decreased linearly with the increase in absorbed dose, causing FAME not to meet the requirement of PN-EN 14214 concerning the ester content (96.5 wt%). Therefore, the use of ionizing radiation to improve biodiesel properties is unlikely, but it is worth to consider electron beam sterilisation of this biofuel. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - The objective of this two-year study (2016–2017 spring) carried out at the University of Nevada, Reno Main Station Field Laboratory, Reno, NV, was to evaluate the effects of nitrogen source, rate, and camelina cultivar on grain yield and potential biodiesel production irrigated with reclaimed water. Treatments were two sources of urea fertilizer [conventional urea (CU) and polymer-coated urea (PCU)], four N rates (0, 40, 80, and 120 kg N ha–1), and two cultivars of camelina (“Blaine Creek” and “Pronghorn”) arranged in a 4 × 2 × 2 factorial combinations with four replications each in a RCBD experiment. Plot size was 7.6 m long × 1.8 m wide, and camelina was seeded at a rate of 5 kg PLS seed ha-1. The quantity of light intercepted increased linearly from 44.9% to 65.9% as N application rate increased from 0 to 120 kg N ha–1, and it was greater for CU (59.6%) compared to PCU (54.0%) fertilized plots. There was a linear increased in grain yield ranging from 534 to 1,010 kg/ha as N application rate increased from 0 to 120 kg N ha-1. In Year 2, grain yield of Blaine Creek (898 kg/ha) was greater than that of Pronghorn (464 kg/ha). Also, there was a linear increase in estimated biodiesel from 51.2 to 94.2 L/ha as N application rate increased. For both grain and biodiesel production, there was no advantage of using controlled-release PCU fertilizer and 80 to 120 kg N ha–1 is sufficient for the cultivation of camelina in this environment. Based on the range of grain yield obtained in this study, camelina can be a potential alternative crop to integrate into the annual crop production cycle in water-limited environments like Nevada. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Many of the sustainability concerns of bioenergy are related to direct or indirect land use change (LUC) resulting from bioenergy feedstock production. The environmental and socio-economic impacts of LUC highly depend on the site-specific biophysical and socio-economic conditions. The objective of this study is to spatiotemporally assess the potential LUC dynamics resulting from an increased biofuel demand, the related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the potential effect of LUC mitigation measures. This assessment is demonstrated for LUC dynamics in Brazil towards 2030, considering an increase in the global demand for bioethanol as well as other agricultural commodities. The potential effects of three LUC mitigation measures (increased agricultural productivity, shift to second-generation ethanol, and strict conservation policies) are evaluated by using a scenario approach. The novel modelling framework developed consists of the global Computable General Equilibrium model MAGNET, the spatiotemporal land use allocation model PLUC, and a GIS-based carbon module. The modelling simulations illustrate where LUC as a result of an increased global ethanol demand (+26 × 109 L ethanol production in Brazil) is likely to occur. When no measures are taken, sugar cane production is projected to expand mostly at the expense of agricultural land which subsequently leads to the loss of natural vegetation (natural forest and grass and shrubland) in the Cerrado and Amazon. The related losses of above and below ground biomass and soil organic carbon result in the average emission of 26 g CO2-eq/MJ bioethanol. All LUC mitigation measures show potential to reduce the loss of natural vegetation (18%–96%) as well as the LUC-related GHG emissions (7%–60%). Although there are several uncertainties regarding the exact location and magnitude of LUC and related GHG emissions, this study shows that the implementation of LUC mitigation measures could have a substantial contribution to the reduction of LUC-related emissions of bioethanol. However, an integrated approach targeting all land uses is required to obtain substantial and sustained LUC-related GHG emission reductions in general. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - With broader application of biodiesel, reports about residues, varnish and other solid deposits in engines emerge more frequently. A thin film degradation test, originally developed for lubricant studies, was employed to investigate fuel vaporization, acid buildup and solubility of degradation products. Films of 25, 100 and 500 μm thickness of rapeseed and palm fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) as well as hexadecane were exposed to 50 °C and 90 °C for up to 3000 h in dry or humid atmosphere on steel surface. Hexadecane produced clean steel surfaces, while FAME films would leave at least 10% residues or more in thicker films. Simple soaking in acetone or tetrahydrofuran dissolved FAME films nearly completely, if degradation was shorter than 1000 h at 90 °C. But in non-polar solvents FAME films became insoluble after much less degradation. As little as 50 h degradation at 50 °C was enough to produce a viscous bottom layer, which would not dissolve in fresh FAME or heptane. Other solvents were tested as well, further showing that FAME degradation products are poorly compatible with fuel-like solvents, such as xylene, heptane or fresh FAME. Formation of immiscible bottom phase may promote buildup of residues, deposits and varnish in fuel systems. © 2018

AB  - The assessment of people's knowledge on biofuels is sporadic mainly due to a lack of an objective knowledge scale. We conducted large-scale mail surveys to fill the gap and assess people's knowledge of biofuels and the social-demographic characteristics related to this. We sent out mail surveys to 4733 valid addresses and received 1376 completed surveys. Biofuels knowledge was assessed with five items related to energy content, production capacity, and potential benefits and harm of biofuels, assigning + 1 or + 2 points for correct, and − 1 or − 2 points for incorrect answers depending upon respondents’ certainty about the answer, and 0 point for ‘I don't know’ responses. We constructed a summary index by summing the points scored on the five items. The mean score for the biofuels knowledge index was 2.25 ± 3.33 on the scale of − 10 to + 10 points. The multiple regression results showed that socio-demographic attributes are significant predictors of biofuels knowledge: men scored 1.65 points higher than women; for one level increment in education, respondents scored 0.26 points higher; and Democrats scored 1.34 points lower than others. Possible reasons for these results and their implications for policy and management to make cellulosic biofuels successful are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Grease trap waste has been considered as a cost-effective feedstock for biodiesel production due to its high lipid content and relatively low cost for collection. However, the costly pre-treatment of this contaminated resource is currently the barrier to the commercialization of biodiesel. This study analyses the economic feasibility of biodiesel production from grease trap waste collected in Adelaide (South Australia), focussing on the environmental service providers as the potential biodiesel producers. Based on the experimental results, two different production routes with the same capacity of around 4400 t/year were simulated using Aspen Plus® V8.8, these being; esterification without using acetone as a co-solvent (1); and esterification using a co-solvent of acetone-ethanol (2). The best production price of biodiesel obtained was US$1337.5/t which would indicate that grease trap waste may be a promising feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work assessed the economics and carbon footprint of alcohol (ethanol vs. n-butanol)-to-jet fuel production using eucalyptus for feedstock. Considering a risk-mitigating strategy of investing first in the alcohol plant (organosolv pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation) and waiting five years until the second investment (alcohol-to-jet plant), the minimum jet fuel selling price was similar in both ethanol and butanol cases (2.10 and 2.08 US$/l for 20% Internal Rate of Return, IRR). In contrast, according to a stochastic decision-making framework that had carbon footprint as one of the criteria, the ethanol pathway is more promising. Nevertheless, even optimistic assumptions (regarding e.g. lignin price, and the interval between project phases) were ineffective to prevent eucalyptus jet fuel from depending on price premium (>1.00 US$/l), which is needed for better returns than those from eucalyptus ethanol plants. Therefore, the feasibility of alcohol-to-jet fuel production in eucalyptus pulp mills depends on long-term, stable premium and subsidy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The new microalgae-to-biofuels chains for producing diesel and ethanol simultaneously are presented. The techno-economic analysis shows that the break-even prices of diesel and ethanol are estimated about US$0.49/kg and US$2.61/kg, respectively, the internal rate of return (IRR) is close to 29.21%, and the commercial prices and yield of products dominate the profitability of this project. According to life cycle analysis (LCA) standards, the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for producing diesel and ethanol are 0.039 kg CO2-eq/MJ FAME and 0.112 kg CO2-eq/MJ EtOH, respectively. It is verified that the process integration of the heat recovery scheme, the entrainer recovery tower, and CO2 recycling can effectively reduce life-cycle GHG emissions of this design. Through a specific optimization algorithm under different lipid contents and 180 scenario combinations for the cultivation and pretreatment processes, the compromise solutions between the maximum total revenue and the minimum environmental impact can be found. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - α-Linolenic acid (ALA) is an essential fatty acid which cannot be synthesized de novo in mammals and must be ingested regularly in the diet. In this study, a microalgal strain named HDMA-11 was isolated from Lake Ming, China, and was found to accumulate a high ALA content (39.2% of total lipids). Phylogenetic neighbor-joining analysis indicated that HDMA-11 belongs to the genus Monoraphidium (Selenastraceae, Sphaeropleales) and its 18S ribosomal DNA sequence seemed to be a new molecular record of a Monoraphidium species. The fatty acid profiles, biomass productivity and lipid content of HDMA-11 were also investigated in autotrophic conditions. The high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in HDMA-11, especially ALA, make it suitable as a source of nutritional supplementation for human health. Furthermore, HDMA-11 exhibited good properties for biodiesel production, characterized by high lipid content (28.5% of dry weight), moderate biomass productivity (31.5 mg L−1 day−1) and a promising lipid profile. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The information about diversity of spring and winter Camelina sativa germplasm in West Europe is limited despite the long tradition of growing this plant. Therefore the aim of the study was to assess the yield potential of Polish and Ukrainian genotypes of camelina in the Polish growing conditions. A field experiment was conducted in Poland from 2011 to 2016. The average yield of winter camelina genotypes was statistically higher than that of spring cultivars (1.9 vs 1.3 t/ha). The yield from currently grown Polish spring cultivars is much higher than the yield from Ukrainian cultivars. The average yield of five mutation lines exceeded 2 t ha−1 and it was greater than the yield of the donor cultivar ‘Przybrodzka’ which produced 1.9 t ha−1 on average. The 9 spring and 11 winter camelina genotypes were also analysed for their genetic similarity. The RAPD-PCR and SSR data were used for grouping genotypes with the UPGMA method. Apart from the ‘Kirgizskij’ cultivar, all the Ukrainian genotypes were included in one group. Apart from the ‘Przybrodzka’ cultivar, the Polish cultivars of spring and winter camelina were included in one similarity group and their genetic similarity coefficients ranged from 0.52 to 0.73. The genetic similarity of the Polish and Ukrainian spring genotypes was greater than the similarity of the winter genotypes and the camelina mutation lines. Camelina has great potential as an oilseed plant for the production of food, feed and biofuel also in a region where for three millennia Camelina oil was used as a food and technical. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - When a water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion droplet is heated, a phenomenon called micro-explosion (μ-exp) may occur. Micro-explosion can be defined as the burst of the continuous phase (i.e. oil) by the energy of evaporation of dispersed droplets (i.e. water) and the volume expansion that goes with it. In the paper are presented results that show a strong correlation between size average value (and distribution size) of water droplets and micro-explosion occurrence rate. Emulsion dispersed phase size, when using micro-channel techniques, depends highly on the emulsion composition and the energy provided to the system (Oil flow rate). A (3–18) μm diameter range was measured in the tests discussed in the paper. Micro-explosion occurrence can reach 70% for larger droplet sizes (about 20 μm). It declines to less than 20% for small sizes (between 5 and 10 μm). Influence of other parameters on micro-explosion occurrence like temperature heating or physical properties is also studied. Ohnesorge number seems to be an adequate parameter to study micro-explosion occurrence because of its direct relation with the relevant emulsion properties: droplet size, oil viscosity and interface tension. Micro-explosion rate achieves its maximum rate (60%) for Oh = 0.12, in other words, for emulsion where dispersed droplets move easily (low viscosity) with a great ability to coalesce (larger droplets and no surfactant). © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - This paper reports the synthesis of sulfonic acid functionalized Brønsted acidic ionic liquids (BAILs) using N,N-dimethyl acetamide [DMA]+, N-methylpyrrolidone [NMP]+ and 1-butyl-3-(4-sulfobutyl)imidazole [BBIM-BuSO3H]+ as cation, and methanesulfonyl [CH3SO3]− or (OTh−), trifluoromethanesulfonate [CF3SO3]− or (OTf−), and bis((trifluromethyl)sulfonyl)amide [(CF3SO3)2N]− or (NTf2 −) as anion source. The ionic liquids (ILs) demonstrated excellent catalytic performance in the valorization of waste streams of biomass to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF), a high-value platform chemical and a promising biofuel additive. Catalytic screening indicated that BAILs containing NTf2 anion exhibits superior performance, giving highest HMF yield. Strong electron withdrawing properties of the trifluoromethyl functionality of [NTf2]− anion is proposed for this high activity of these BAILs. Detailed studies using NMR reveal the reaction proceeds through the (i) depolymerization of cellulose into glucose, followed by (ii) glucose isomerization to fructose and then the product HMF is formed by (iii) triple dehydration of fructose to HMF. Direct conversion of mushroom to EMF is also observed in one-pot with high yield when ethanol is used as a solvent in access amount. DFT calculations elucidated that the catalytic performance of the ILs followed the order of their deprotonation energies (DPE) which can be correlated directly to the residual charge on the Brønsted acidic proton. This study of valorization of waste mushroom coupled with DFT calculations, revealing DPE as an important descriptor, is likely the first report of this kind. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Herein, the potato peels which are the huge household and agro-industrial disposable waste material have been evaluated as a promising and sustainable natural antioxidant for enhancing the oxidation stability of the biodiesel produced from Nahar (Mesua ferrea L.) oil. A sample of biodiesel without PPE (Potato peel extract) denoted as BP0 (0 ppm) and total of four treatments of biodiesel with PPE i.e., 100 ppm (BP1), 150 ppm (BP2), 200 ppm (BP3), 250 ppm (BP4) were prepared for evaluating the effectiveness of PPE in oxidation stability enhancement. The oxidation stability of all the samples was evaluated with the help of Rancimat instrument manufactured by metrohm. The results revealed that a minimum concentration of 150 ppm of PPE in Mesua ferrea L. biodiesel was capable of enhancing its IP (induction period) from 5.63 h to 6.21 h, which met the standard European (ENE14214) biodiesel specification for oxidation stability. Comparison of PPE with TBHQ (tert-butylhydroquinone) has also been accomplished to know the effectiveness of PPE against TBHQ. The results in this study have shown that PPE is equally capable of enhancing oxidation stability of Mesua ferrea L. biodiesel as compared to TBHQ. Hence, PPE can be used as natural antioxidant for biodiesel instead of using synthetic antioxidant TBHQ procured from non-renewable source. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The mechanism of rod-milling combined with torrefaction as well as its effects on physicochemical and fuel properties of wheat straw were investigated. Rod-milling and hammer-milling samples were torrefied under three temperatures (250, 275, and 300 °C) with a duration time of 30 min. The results indicated that combined rod-milling and torrefaction pretreatment (CRT) significantly elevated carbon content, higher heating value, fuel ratio, and reduced oxygen content and atomic H/C and O/C ratios in wheat straw. Moreover, CRT significantly reduced cellulose crystallinity, and increased the specific surface area and pore volume of wheat straw, which lowered the wheat straw's degrading pyrolysis temperature. These peak values appeared under 300 °C. Devolatilization index (Di) was improved by rod-milling pretreatment under identical torrefaction conditions except 275 °C. Therefore, the combination of rod-milling with torrefaction under 300 °C has the advantage of enhancing fuel properties of lignocellulosic biomass materials. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Domestic exposure to biomass smoke is associated with an increase in systolic blood pressure, pre-hypertension and increase in carotid intima media thickness of rural women in Southern Nigeria. More research is needed in this area to further evaluate this association.
Background: Rising prevalence of cardiovascular disease requires in-depth understanding of predisposing factors. Studies show an association between air pollution and CVD but this association is not well documented in southern Nigeria where the use of biomass fuels (BMF) for domestic purposes is prevalent. Purpose: This study aimed to explore the association between household BMF use and blood pressure (BP) and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) among rural-dwelling women. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 389 women aged 18 years and older. Questionnaires were used to obtain data on predominant fuel used and a brief medical history. Wood, charcoal and agricultural waste were classified as BMF while kerosene, bottled gas and electricity were classified as non-BMF. Blood pressure and CIMT were measured using standard protocols. Regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between fuel type and BP, CIMT, pre-hypertension and hypertension after adjusting for confounders. Results: There was a significant difference in the mean (standard deviation) systolic BP (135.3, 26.7 mmHg vs 123.8, 22.6 mmHg; p < 0.01), diastolic BP (83.7, 18.5 mmHg vs 80.1, 13.8 mmHg; p = 0.043) and CIMT (0.63, 0.16 mm vs 0.56, 0.14 mm; p = 0.004) among BMF users compared to non-BMF users. In regression analysis, the use of BMF was significantly associated with 2.7 mmHg higher systolic BP (p = 0.040), 0.04 mm higher CIMT (p = 0.048) in addition to increased odds of pre-hypertension (OR 1.67 95% CI 1.56, 4.99, P = 0.035) but not hypertension (OR 1.23 95% CI 0.73, 2.07, P = 0.440). Conclusion: In this population, there was a significant association between BMF use and increased SBP, CIMT and pre-hypertension. This requires further exploration with a large-scale longitudinal study design because there are policy implications for countries like Nigeria where a large proportion of the population still rely on BMF for domestic energy. © 2018

AB  - The global energy matrix is concentrated on non-renewable sources. Thus, in short time, the demand for energy could exceed its production. The use of renewable energy sources is paramount for the actions of current and future generations. Thus, the use of biodieselenergy has been pointed out a viable source for energy production with low concentrations of toxic pollutants. The use of renewable energy sources such as the safflower has been an interesting option. Safflower is a short cycle oil crop, with high production and optimum adaptation to Brazilian climate. This study aims to analyze the behavior from oil and biodiesel from four genotypes of safflower, making use of their physical and chemical aspects. The parameters adopted for oil analysis were viscosity, acid index, free fatty acid (FFA) and peroxide index. For biodiesel it verified its calorific value. Analyzing the results, it can be concluded that the genotypes connected with the oil showed adequate viscosity, low acidity, FFA and peroxides in the pattern within acceptable levels. In addition, biodiesel presented calorific value close to that found in mineral diesel, which indicates a good burning. The safflower oil is a promising source for the biodiesel production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Regardless of fragile biodiesel market of the present day, it is foreseen that biodiesel will draw a lot of public interest throughout the world in the not too distant future. Among different feed stocks available for biodiesel production, waste cooking oil is under a major prospective for large-scale biodiesel production as it can cut down the fuel costs than other alternative feed stocks. However, there are several barriers that hinder large-scale biodiesel production from waste cooking oil. Also, there might be contextual relationships among those barriers. In this perspective, this paper aspires to identify the most influential barrier and to describe the interactions among different barriers influencing biodiesel production from waste cooking oil. For this reason, an interpretive structural modeling approach is employed to determine relationships among barriers. MICMAC analysis has additionally been carried out to classify the barriers based on dependence and driving power. The results indicate that vehicle access problem, lack of processing technology, inconsistent supply quantity and inadequate production facilities are the top-level barriers. Also, the results show that lack of political will, lack of incentives and lack of policy implementation play a very important role in the effective implementation of biodiesel production from waste cooking oil. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The paper subsumes a framework that assesses health risk due to exposure to different fuel combustion through articulation of modern microscopic techniques, empirical equations, lung diagnostic tools and a pre-existing model that has been extrapolated to futuristic aspects (within controlled conditions). The framework was tested on 132 household cooks belonging to different age groups and using different types of fuel. The inhalable fraction released during fuel combustion varied in morphological characteristics and deposition site. Micrographs obtained using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis of (biomass smoke) soot indicates aggregate formation attributing to a higher level of health risk. Further, abnormal ventilatory function along with higher risk (RR > 1) was more evident within biomass fuel users. The condition further exacerbates while using dung cakes due to high levels of emissions (294.3 particles/liter) that deposit in the upper respiratory tract (0.0899). Further, the population attributable risk percent (79%) calculated on the basis of cooking behavior suggests a ‘rural culture’ health determinant as clean fuel usage is not practiced as an outcome of low literacy and poor income in the region. These preliminary findings highlight the drudgery of impuissant women who are exposed to high particulate emissions on a regular basis which results in reduced lung function. Nevertheless, further cogitation is required to eliminate the limitations in this study and explore further linkages between exposure and vulnerable group to generate meaningful policy recommendations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Emulsified biofuel (EB) has a relatively higher viscosity compared to conventional diesel; which affects the spray injection and restricts the maximum evaporation. The modification is necessary to standard engines in order to realize its application. This paper presents the effects of three dissimilar designs of piston-bowl geometry in the compression ignition (CI) engine to in-cylinder airflow characteristics improvement of the EB during injection. The three piston bowl geometry designs; open cylinder bowl (OCB), shallow depth re-entrance combustion chamber (SCC) and omega combustion chamber (OCC). ANSYS FLUENT 15 is utilized to run a three dimensional (3D) cold flow internal combustion (IC) engine simulation. The main parameters of this investigation; swirl, tumble and cross tumble ratios, as well as turbulence kinetic energy (TKE), with respect to crank angle. It shows that the SCC piston bowl design is the best due to significant effect on swirl, tumble, cross tumble ratios and TKE in the injection fuel region. It breaks up the length penetration of injection to mix with the surrounding air and capable to organize the distribution of the heavier molecules of the EB during the compression stage. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae oil can be converted into aviation fuel to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and decrease the carbon footprint. This could be a significant step toward sustainable energy resources that have the potential to produce ‘drop-in’ fuels. Algae-based fuels are potential substitutes for fossil fuels due to the quality of their crude oil. However, this is only possible if appropriate conversion processes are undertaken. Conversely, microalgae species have low lipid content and biomass harvesting is still an energy-demanding process. In this study, a conceptual design is developed for the conversion of microalgae oil to jet fuel. It is based on a process undertaken in the laboratory using a species named Nannochloropsis sp. Nutrients and CO2 were supplied to the growing culture for effective growth. Biomass harvesting was completed on the tenth day of the growth cycle. It was followed by physiological modification to improve lipid content. Finally, crude oil extraction was followed by bio-oil hydrocracking at 350 °C, and fractionation of cracked bio-oil between 70 and 300 °C to separate light-, middle-, and heavy-end hydrocarbons for use in the production of jet fuel. During simulation, reforming and upgrading processes were added to the design to enhance the quality of the jet fuel to be produced on large scale in the future. The study, including the results, suggests that it is technically feasible to convert microalgae oil into jet fuel because of the similarity between algae bio-oil and petroleum crude oil. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - 2-Methylfuran (MF), a promising biofuel candidate catalytically produced from biomass-based fructose, has attracted the attention of fuel researchers. However, there is limited data available for the laminar burning velocity, especially at high initial pressure conditions. In this work, the laminar burning velocity of MF-air mixtures at elevated initial pressures (T0 = 363 K; p0 = 0.1–0.4 MPa) was experimentally determined in a spherical outwardly expanding flame. Numerical simulation was also conducted in Chemkin using two detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms at elevated pressures (similar to the experiment condition: T0 = 363 K; p0 = 0.1–0.4 MPa) and elevated temperatures (T0 = 363–563 K; p0 = 0.1 MPa). Data from experimental and modelling studies were compared and discussed. The experimental results showed that at a given T0 and p0 the laminar burning velocity of MF-air mixtures reached peak values at equivalence ratios ϕ = 1.1–1.2, and it slowed down dramatically when the MF-air mixture was too rich or lean. Laminar burning velocity decreased with the increase in p0. The laminar flame speed of MF-air mixture from two chemical kinetic mechanisms exhibited a similar trend with experimental data; however, both the two mechanisms led to overestimation at the most initial conditions. Compared to the Galway mechanism, the Tianjin mechanism better predicted the laminar burning velocity of MF-air mixtures, especially at initial pressures of 0.1 and 0.2 MPa. The current MF mechanism needs further improvement to better predict the combustion of MF at high-pressure conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study extant, energy and exergy analysis of a CI engine running on PB20 (20% polanga biodiesel by volume blended with 80% diesel by volume) mixture of 20% polanga oil methyl ester (POME) with 80% diesel by volume) and diesel. The results of the study show that the heat loss percentage is maximum, and the exhaust loss percentage is minimum for the tested fuels in energy distribution. The percentage of exergy destruction is maximum, and exergy due to heat loss percentage is minimum for the tested fuels during exergy breakdown. PB20 provides 1.4% less energy to the engine than diesel fuel to give the same power. The rate of heat transfer for PB20 is more than that of diesel. Energy loss due to exhaust gas for PB20 is 13% less than that of diesel fuel. The exergy input is about 6–7% higher than the fuel energy input. Exergy destruction of diesel is more than that of PB20 by 3.18%. Exergy loss due to heat loss of PB20 is higher than that of diesel by 1.5%. Overall, the test results indicate that better combustion and efficiencies with less irreversibility are found with biodiesel. Uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis are carried out by considering the temperature parameter. The uncertainty lies between the true values. Thus, PB20 can be a partial replacement for diesel as a fuel. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Non-premixed flames are extensively used in different industrial combustion systems such as gas turbines and coal furnaces. Therefore, reliable theoretical modelling of these flames is indispensable. The purpose of this study is to develop a comprehensive analytical model for counter-flow non-premixed flames employing volatile biomass particles as the fuel. In order to present a promising and accurate analysis for the flame structure and propagation, preheat, drying, vaporization, reaction and oxidizer zones are presumed. In the current analytical modelling, a non-asymptotic approach is used. In this regard, finite thicknesses are considered for the drying and vaporization zones. Lycopodium particles and air are taken as the biofuel and oxidizer, respectively. It is assumed that the gaseous fuel yielded from lycopodium particles is methane. Dimensionless parameters are defined and then non-dimensionalized forms of governing equations including mass and energy conservation equations are derived taking into account appropriate boundary and jump conditions for each zone. The equations are solved by Mathematica and Matlab software. Eventually, the impacts of fuel and oxidizer Lewis numbers, mass particle concentration parameter, equivalence ratio, lycopodium initial temperature on the flow strain rate, flame temperature, flame position and gaseous fuel and oxidizer mass fractions are elaborately examined. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the range of opportunities and future prospects of presenting a blend of gasoline/ethanol fuel to run a gasoline engine. Biofuel's advantages involve emission of low quantities of contaminants to the atmosphere and its renewable character in order to trim down dependency on gasoline as a fuel. Analyses have been carried out to show the influence of compression ratio on engine performance and tailpipe emissions by using unleaded gasoline and gasoline blends with (10 and 20%) pure ethanol SI (spark ignition) engine having a variable compression ratio with the air-cooled single-cylinder engine. Experiments were conducted on five different compression ratios (CRs) of 4:1, 5.5:1, 7:1 8.5:1, and 10:1 with a wide-open throttle. Two combinations of blended fuels were compared to the unleaded gasoline. The results showed that the BMEP (brake mean effective pressure), BTE (brake thermal efficiency), and BSFC (brake specific fuel consumption) obtained with the use of gasoline blends at all CRs were generally higher in comparison to those of pure gasoline. In general, gasoline blends provided a lower exhaust emission compared to gasoline's emissions at all CRs. Furthermore, NOx emissions were affected much more than other exhaust emissions when changing the compression ratios compared to unleaded gasoline. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work describes the use of an ultrasound system for the enzymatic transesterification of oils using combi-lipases as biocatalyst. The reactions were carried out evaluating the individual use of waste oil and fresh soybean oil, and the immobilized lipases CALB, TLL, and RML were used as biocatalysts. It was performed in a mixture design of three factors to obtain the ideal mixture of lipases according to the composition of fatty acids present in each oil, and the main reaction variables were optimized. After 18 h of reaction, ultrasound provided a biodiesel yield of about 90% when using soybean oil and 70% using the waste oil. The results showed that ultrasound technology, in combination with the application of enzyme mixtures, known as combi-lipases, and the use of waste oil, could be a promising route to reduce the overall process costs of enzymatic production of biodiesel. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Microalgae are recognised as promising feedstock for biofuel production. The feasibility in commercial scale microalgae cultivation could be enhanced by incorporating palm oil mill effluent (POME) as culture medium, for greater biomass growth and lipid production, together with POME bioremediation. The polluting POME is generated massively in Malaysia. POME contains high concentrations of carbon and nutrients, thus it is suitable to be applied for microalgae cultivation. The approach on waste to energy should be advanced. We studied the effects of applying Pseudomonas sp. on Chlorella sorokiniana CY-1 cultivation in POME. Pseudomonas sp. was found effective in POME decolourisation prior to C. sorokiniana CY-1 cultivation. Yet, microalgae biomass and lipid productions were higher in the non-decolourised POME. Pseudomonas sp. was as well-being co-cultivated with C. sorokiniana CY-1 in ratios of microalgae versus bacteria of 1:1; 2:1 and 1:2. Biomass of 2.04 g L−1 and biomass productivity of 185.71 mg L−1 d−1 were attained in ratio of 1:1. Interestingly, the lipid content exhibited was excellent (16.04%), and about twofold higher than other ratios and the control (without bacteria). Fatty acids compositions were dominated by C16:0 (32.49%), C18:1 (24.06%) and C18:2 (20.28%), which were desirable fatty acids for biodiesel production. Effective POME bioremediation achieved with chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen and total phosphorus removal of 53.7, 55.6 and 77.3%, respectively. Co-cultivation of microalgae and bacteria can be applied in the POME treatment plant. This allows satisfactory biomass and excellent lipid yields for biofuel production, as well as effective wastewater bioremediation. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This article reviews the recent advances in the development of zeolite catalysts for biomass valorization processes to produce both biofuels and/or bio-based chemicals, which is an emerging and fast expanding field. The work deals with different types of feedstocks, including vegetable oils, lignocellulose and sugars, as well as with a number of relevant intermediates and platform molecules. Transformation of biomass into valuable products is hindered by a number of factors, mainly related to its complex composition, as biomass typically consists of bulky molecules with high oxygen content. Accordingly, biomass processing usually requires the combination of multiple steps and severe conditions, hence concepts like atom efficiency, product selectivity, and catalyst deactivation become of special relevance. A great progress has been achieved in the past years engineering the properties of zeolites for being adapted to the challenges associated to biomass valorization. The possibility of tailoring the main physicochemical properties of zeolites has become now a reality, being the major reason that explains the success achieved by this class of materials in a growing variety of biomass conversion pathways, as those described in this work: catalytic cracking and pyrolysis, hydrotreatments, with special relevance for hydrodeoxygenation processes, as well as in a high number of condensation, isomerization, and dehydration reactions. Thus, the development of hierarchical zeolites, exhibiting enhanced accessibility, and the possibility of introducing and combining in a controlled way different types of active sites (Brønsted and Lewis acid centers, basic sites, and metal phases) are the main basis of the excellent performance of zeolites in numerous biomass conversion routes. © 2017 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - Abstract: Biofuels are a promising alternative to fossil fuels that addresses the associated environmental concerns and satisfies growing global energy demand. In this study, safflower seeds were used to produce multiple biofuels with an integrated biorefinery perspective. The safflower oil was used for biodiesel production while the resultant seed cake was employed in subsequent ethanol production. Pretreatment of the residual solid is necessary in order to improve the ethanol production yield. Contrasting costly chemical pretreatments, the seed cake was instead pretreated using incomplete anaerobic digestion to remove hemicellulose, increase cellulose accessibility for fermentation, and produce methane. The seed cake produced 124.8 ml/g-VS of methane after 20 days of anaerobic digestion. The digestate (biologically pretreated seed cake) produced 92 g ethanol/kg solid, in stark contrast to 42 g ethanol/kg solid from untreated seed cake. This ethanol was later utilized in biodiesel production. The safflower oil produced 85.9% biodiesel via ethanolic transesterification at optimum conditions. From the integrated biorefinery perspective, the seed cake from 1 kg of safflower seeds produced 70 l of methane at NTP and 51.0 g of ethanol—surpassing the 47.6 g of ethanol stoichiometrically necessary to complete transesterification of safflower oil. Thus, this ethanol could be recycled, largely decreasing the need for an external stream of ethanol for biodiesel production. The incomplete anaerobic digestion is an effective and environmentally friendly way to improve the ethanol production from the safflower seed cake with biomethane as an additional valuable byproduct.

AB  - Background: Aliphatic hydrocarbons of microbial origin are highly interesting candidate biofuels because these molecules are identical or very similar to the main components of petroleum-based gasoline and diesel fuels. The high-GC Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus is capable of naturally synthesizing long-chain, iso- and anteiso-branched alkenes which are formed via the head-to-head condensation of fatty acid thioesters by a dedicated enzyme system. The present study describes the relation we observed between olefin production and cell buoyancy in Micrococcus luteus and the use of this phenotype to simply and efficiently separate cells from a mixture based on their hydrocarbon content. Methods: We generated M. luteus mutants producing different amounts of olefins and used them in mixing and sedimentation experiments, olefin content analysis by GC-MS and in equilibrium centrifugation in Percoll gradients. Results: We found well-detectable differences in the buoyant densities of the examined strains, which correlated with the amounts of hydrocarbons produced by the cells. We also demonstrate how our observations can be used to simply and efficiently fractionate cells based on their hydrocarbon content. Conclusions: In summary, we show that cultures of M. luteus cells sediment at distinct rates depending on the amounts of alkenes produced. Our results indicate that buoyant cell density is the primary cause for the observed differences in sedimentation behaviour. The simple separation strategy described here can be a valuable tool in various mutagenesis and enrichment protocols, aimed at generating and isolating strains with increased olefin productivity. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper aims to evaluate the feasibility of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Radiata pine with black liquor from an existing Kraft pulp mill. The biomass into the HTL process was assumed at 2000 t/day and converted into bio-crude through the HTL process and upgraded to produce a gasoline and diesel blend. The HTL process was scaled-up based on an existing published patent. Mass and heat balance of the process was obtained through the process simulator, Aspen Plus. Process Integration was carried out to minimise the hot and cold utility of the process. The production rate of the process is 78.7 kt/y of fuel. The minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) was estimated at 0.95 USD/LGE (litre gasoline equivalent). A sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the MFSP in 2017 and to study the changes of MFSP due to the uncertainty in the capital cost estimation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-oil is a complex real fuel, considered as a carbon-neutral alternative to hydrocarbons in the transport sector, which is composed of hundreds of compounds, mostly oxygenated. Pyrolysis oil has high acidity, low thermal stability, low calorific value, high water content, high viscosity, and poor lubrication characteristics. Therefore, its use in transportation is limited. These characteristics make it totally different from petroleum fuels affecting the combustion process. Blends of bio-oil/diesel/alcohols are viable short-term alternatives to utilize an important fraction of these oils. In the present work, pyrolysis was performed on torrefied coconut endocarp and the collected bio-oil was analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Based on the GC/MS analysis, three different blends of toluene, ethanol, and acetic acid representative of the real fuel chemistry were proposed as the surrogates to carry out combustion studies. The objective of this paper is to develop a chemical kinetics mechanism for toluene/ethanol/acetic acid blend oxidation. This will be done by combining the chemical model of Huang et al. [Energy Convers. Manage. 2017, 149, 553] for toluene and that of Christensen and Konnov [Combust. Flame 2016, 170, 12] for ethanol/acetic acid reactions. The resulting chemical model consisting of 180 species and 1495 reactions will be validated by performing combustion zero- and one-dimensional simulations for toluene/ethanol/acetic acid blends by studying constant-volume autoignition and laminar flame speed. Then, as Huang et al.'s original model was developed and validated for diesel/n-butanol blends, autoignition delays and laminar flame speed simulations of bio-oil/diesel/n-butanol are presented. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biomass catalytic pyrolysis vapor upgrading is an important way for converting biomass to high-value chemical products. Studies on pyrolysis behavior and products distribution of biomass are of great importance to the research on the interactions and catalytic conversion mechanism between model components of biomass and catalyst. At the same time, aromatic hydrocarbon compounds was the important chemical in nowadays, catalytic pyrolysis process produces a highly oxygenated bio-oil containing over 100 different compounds. The selectivity of fast pyrolysis can be greatly enhanced through the use of a catalyst, in particular with HZSM-5 zeolite which gives the highest selectivity toward mono-cyclic platform aromatics (such as benzene, toluene, xylene and ethyl benzene) essential to the chemical industry. Despite this high selectivity, a significant fraction of the freed-stock's renewable carbon is lost to coke and char, two undesired byproducts. Coke formation has been attributed to the polymerization of small oxygenates on the external surface of the zeolite and to the formation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons through condensation reactions inside the micropores. So in order to improve selectivity toward desired products of aromatic and lower the formation of coke, the mesoporous HZSM-5 was synthesized by desilication method. In this paper, we used alkali treatment of commercial HZSM-5 zeolites using K 2 CO 3 solutions to introduce mesopores into microporous system, and to investigate the effects of alkali concentration (0.2-0.6 mol/L) on aromatics yield and selectivity, The pyrolysis of experimental sample (pine, cellulose and lignin) was conducted in a fixed bed reactor with the conditions of pyrolysis temperature of 450℃, and catalytic temperature of 550℃, the ratio of biomass to catalyst of 1:2. Materials and products characteristics were investigated with various testing approaches, such as elements analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area and pore size analyzer (BET), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), temperature programmed desorption (NH 3 -TPD) and gas chromatography mass spectrograph (GC-MS) to study the effect of desilication on the structure, acidity, pore size and performance of aluminum-rich ZSM-5 as well the product distribution of pyrolysis bio-oil. The results showed that alkali treatment of HZSM-5 can remove the extra-framework Si species to enhance the diffusion property, and at the same time, creation the mesopores, and the pore diameter of mesopores increased with the increase of K 2 CO 3 concentration however, the total acid amount decreased. Detailed characterization of the obtained zeolite catalysts indicated that mild desilication conditions significantly affect the elemental composition, crystallographic structure, microporosity, and distribution of aluminum atoms in framework and extra framework sites. The number of accessible Brønsted acid sites increased as a result of the enhanced mesoporosity. At the same time, the concentration of alkali solution, the corrosion degree, the degree of desilication and desilication, and the mesoporous degree increased, as such the hysteresis phenomenon became more and more obvious. Moreover, the hierarchical HZSM-5 catalyst produced more aromatic hydrocarbons and less coke formation in CFP of lignin and lignocelluloses' biomass that contained the lignin component than that of the control HZSM-5, which effectively improved the selectivity for naphthalene family products (methylnaphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene) in the bio-oil and decreased the content of aromatic hydrocarbons larger than C10. The highest aromatic yield (82.81%) and lowest coke yield (28.06%) were obtained in CFP of pine wood with mildly desilicated zeolite treated with 0.5mol/L K 2 CO 3 solution. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - Graphene and carbon nanotubes have drawn interest across many disciplines due to their remarkable properties. We investigated the effects of graphite oxide (GO), single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles on the combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of a four-stroke single cylinder light-duty diesel engine under various engine loads. Shortened ignition-delay (ID) by up to 10.3%, advanced combustion phasing (up to 18.5%), shortened combustion duration (up to 14.6%), improved brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) by up to 15.2%, reduced CO emission (up to 23.4%), and lowered UHCs emissions (up to 24.1%) were achieved with the addition of SWCNTs nanoparticle at 25 ppm dosing ratio. SWCNTs and GO additives could be effective approach for lowering emissions in diesel engine applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays, biodiesel is seen as an alternative fuel to diesel fuel due to its many advantages such as higher density, cetane number and flash point. Although several methods are available for estimating fuel properties of biodiesel-diesel fuel blends, there is still the lack of works on the comparison of regression models and artificial neural networks (ANN) in predicting viscosities of the blends. Therefore, in this work, (1) optimum reaction parameters providing the lowest viscosity were determined for methanolysis of waste cooking oil, (2) waste cooking oil methyl ester was synthesized based on the determined optimum parameters, and it was mixed with diesel fuel on different volume ratios (3) viscosity measurements of the prepared blends were made at the temperature ranges between 273.15 K and 373.15 K, (4) changes in viscosity versus temperature and biodiesel fraction in blend were investigated and the rational model was proposed, finally (5) the predictive capability of rational model was compared to the three-term Vogel model, Bingham model and ANN by fitting to viscosity data measured by the authors and by Geacai et al. According to results, the measured values by the authors and Geacai et al. are the most accurately predicted by the rational model. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae cultivation in wastewaters has been identified as the solution for economical microalgae cultivation. This study investigated the feasibility of using POME for Chlorella sp. cultivation to yield biomass and lipids, as it generates massively in Malaysia which ranked world palm oil exporter. The optimal POME concentration and pretreatment strategy were applied to promote biomass and lipid productivities. Chlorella sorokiniana CY-1 attained maximal of 11.21% of lipid content with 2.12 g L−1 of biomass concentration when cultivation in acid-heat pretreated 30% (v/v) POME. This provides relatively higher yield than those reported values on POME. Pretreatment was found effective to enhance biomass productions, as it converts lignin in POME into reducing sugars to serve as the supplement. The pollutants removal efficiencies were 62.07% for TN, 47.09% for COD, and 30.77% for TP. This contributes towards greater feasibility in microalgae cultivation for biofuel productions and as well towards environmental sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Non-catalytic transesterification has been recognised as an effective technique for biodiesel production. It has many advantages over conventional catalytic transesterification, where it eliminates the difficulties of catalysts preparation and separation. It also produces high biodiesel yield in shorter reaction time. However, it requires harsh operating conditions at high reaction temperature and pressure, in addition to using large excess of methanol. In an attempt to mitigate these problems, a process design/integration for biodiesel production has been performed. The process has been subjected to both mass and energy integration to minimise fresh methanol requirements and to minimise heating and cooling energies, respectively. A new graphical Pinch Analysis method has been used to evaluate the energy performance of a literature design for the current process. It has been subsequently used to develop an optimum heat exchanger network (HEN) for the process by matching of process streams. Also, the design made by using an automated commercial simulation (Aspen Energy Analyzer) has been evaluated using the same graphical method. The produced HEN design from graphical method has achieved the optimum results with respect to energy targets. © 2018

AB  - Air pollutants derived from diesel engines have more and more dangerous effect on the nature and on the built environment as well. One of the most important emission-component of a diesel engine running on conventional diesel is particulate matter. For measuring particulate matter there are many different widely used measurement methods. Using biofuel in diesel engines also causes emission of particulate matter. The basic aim of our work was to investigate and to evaluate the conventional biodiesel's and the new type TBK-Biodiesel's effect on the particulate relevant emission of a compression ignition engine. Particulate relevant emission mean in this case the four different measurement methods like filter smoke number, opacity, particulate mass and particulate number. With a rising blending rate of the - in internal combustion engine useable - bio derived fuels (standardized biodiesel and non-standardized TBK-biodiesel) to fossil diesel the particulate relevant emission of the engine changes significantly. The tendencies in particulate relevant emission with growing blending rate are different among the measurement methods. Because of this situation biofuels cannot be evaluated clearly compared to fossil diesel in point of view of particulate relevant emission. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work addresses the co-valorisation in supercritical water of bio-oil obtained from the fast pyrolysis of wood and crude glycerol yielded as a by-product during biodiesel production. The experiments were conducted at 380 °C and 230 bar for 30 min with a Ni-Co/Al-Mg catalyst, analysing the effects on the process of the catalyst loading (0–0.25 g catalyst/g organics) and feed composition (each material alone and all possible binary mixtures). The yields to gas, upgraded bio-oil (liquid) and solid varied as follows: 4–87%, 0–46% and 0–18%, respectively. A synergistic interaction between crude glycerol and bio-oil took place during the upgrading process, which allowed the complete and simultaneous transformation of both materials into gas and liquid bio-fuels with a negligible solid formation. The compositions of the gas and the upgraded liquid can be easy tailored by adjusting the catalyst amount and the composition of the feed. The gas phase was made up of H2 (7–49 vol.%), CO2 (31–56 vol.), CO (0–7 vol.%) and CH4 (6–57 vol.%) and had a Lower Heating Value (LHV) ranging from 8 to 22 MJ/m3 STP. The upgraded bio-oil consisted of a mixture of carboxylic acids (0–73%), furans (0–7%), phenols (0–85%), ketones (0–22%) and cyclic compounds (0–53%). The proportions of C, H and O in the liquid shifted between 66–77 wt.%, 7–11 wt.% and 15–25 wt.%, respectively, while its Higher Heating Value (HHV) ranged from 29 to 34 MJ/kg. An optimum for the simultaneous production of gas and liquid bio-fuels was achieved with a solution having equal amounts of each material and employing a catalyst amount of 0.25 g catalyst/g organics. Under such conditions, 37% of the bio-oil was transformed into an upgraded liquid having a HHV (32 MJ/kg) two times higher than the original material (16 MJ/kg) with a negligible solid formation; the rest of the bio-oil and all the crude glycerol being converted into a rich CH4 (55 vol.%) biogas with a high LHV (21 MJ/m3 STP). This represents a step-change in future energy production and can help to establish the basis for a more efficient and sustainable biomass valorisation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The technical feasilibity of integrating ABE fermentations with organophilic pervaporation has been described and demonstrated numerous times. However, engineering guidelines for integration of pervaporation with fermentation are currently not available. A novel calculation procedure to size pervaporation units in function of carbohydrate concentration in the feed is elaborated in detail. The overall energetic and economic outlook are less investigated and remain unclear. Furthermore, the effect of permeate pressure and cooling are frequently ignored. Therefore, the advantages and economic outlook of such an integration are estimated and calculated for fermentative n-butanol production at a capacity of 100 ktonnes per year. Biobutanol production costs for two cases were calculated. The base-case consists of a multi-stage acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation with default downstream processing. The alternative is a continuous hybrid process where default downstream processing is complemented with organophilic pervaporation for recovery of solvents during the fermentation. Bare pervaporation module costs were estimated to ensure improved economics in comparison to the base-case. Equal installed costs for both cases are reached at a pervaporation module purchase price of 176 € m−2 for a composite POMS membrane. To derisk this potential large scale organophilic pervaporation application, a module purchase price of 50–100 € m−2 should be targeted. © 2018 The Author(s)

AB  - Biodiesel prepared from animal fat has been gaining increasing interest in the last few years. The main drawback of biodiesel is its poor low-temperature performance, which limits its use in cold climates. This study proposes a method of improving the low-temperature properties of young Camelus dromedaries (Hachi) fat biodiesel (HB) and improving select fuel properties [e.g., the cetane number (CN) and oxidative stability (OS)] of Citrullus colocynthis biodiesel (CCB), which has a high iodine value (IV). HB and CCB were blended in different volume ratios (100:0; 80:20; 60:40; 40:60; 20:80, and 0:100) and the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) composition and fuel properties of the biodiesel blends were evaluated according to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) methods The correlation of the cloud point (CP), pour point (PP), cold filter plugging point (CFPP), kinematic viscosity (KV), CN, IV, and OS with the ratio of saturated to unsaturated FAMEs was determined. HB improved all the studied fuel parameters of CCB, and the international standards (ASTM D-6751 and EN 14214) were met. It is shown that the fuel properties of the biodiesel blends can be predicted using the FAME composition. The results of our study demonstrate that blending the biodiesel from Hachi fat and C. colocynthis seed oil provides a suitable alternative to biodiesel prepared using food crops. © 2018

AB  - In this study, fruit oil of Lindera glauca was investigated for the first time as a promising non–conventional feedstock to produce biodiesel, which was performed using a two–step catalyzed process on a laboratory scale. L. glauca fruit has high oil content (43.35 ± 3.24%), and its oil has low acid value (2.18 mg KOH g−1). The fatty acid composition of LG oil mainly includes oleic acid (36.34% ± 1.1%), linoleic acid (10.53% ± 0.4%), palmitic acid (17. 30% ± 0.7%) and decanoic acid (15. 80% ± 0.5%). Four important factors for reaction conditions were repeatedly tested to obtained the optimum conditions, i.e., molar ratio of 10:1 (methanol/oil), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) concentration (1.50% w/w), reaction temperature (60 °C), and the reaction times (60 min), with a mean of 95.6% of biodiesel production. The main properties of LG biodiesel were conformed to EN 14214–08, ASTM D6751–10 and GB/T 20828–2014 standards, especially the oxidative stability (16.8 h) and Flash point (158 °C) were excellent. These results obtained in this work can provide important information for developing this non-food feedstock. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Current EU directives demand increased use of renewable fuels in the transportation sector but restrict governmental support for production of biofuels produced from crops. The use of intercropped lucerne and wheat may comply with the directives. In the current study, the combination of ensiled lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) and wheat straw as substrate for hydrogen and methane production was investigated. Steam-pretreated and enzymatically hydrolysed wheat straw [WSH, 76% of total chemical oxygen demand (COD)] and ensiled lucerne (LH, 24% of total COD) were used for sequential hydrogen production through dark fermentation and methane production through anaerobic digestion and directly for anaerobic digestion. Synthetic co-cultures of extreme thermophilic Caldicellulosiruptor species adapted to elevated osmolalities were used for dark fermentation. Results: Based on 6 tested steam pretreatment conditions, 5 min at 200 °C was chosen for the ensiled lucerne. The same conditions as applied for wheat straw (10 min at 200 °C with 1% acetic acid) would give similar sugar yields. Volumetric hydrogen productivities of 6.7 and 4.3 mmol/L/h and hydrogen yields of 1.9 and 1.8 mol/mol hexose were observed using WSH and the combination of WSH and LH, respectively, which were relatively low compared to those of the wild-type strains. The combinations of WSH plus LH and the effluent from dark fermentation of WSH plus LH were efficiently converted to methane in anaerobic digestion with COD removal of 85-89% at organic loading rates of COD 5.4 and 8.5 g/L/day, respectively, in UASB reactors. The nutrients in the combined hydrolysates could support this conversion. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the possibility of reducing the water addition to WSH by 26% and the phosphorus addition by 80% in dark fermentation with Caldicellulosiruptor species, compared to previous reports. WSH and combined WSH and LH were well tolerated by osmotolerant co-cultures. The yield was not significantly different when using defined media or hydrolysates with the same concentrations of sugars. However, the sugar concentration was negatively correlated with the hydrogen yield when comparing the results to previous reports. Hydrolysates and effluents from dark fermentation can be efficiently converted to methane. Lucerne can serve as macronutrient provider in anaerobic digestion. Intercropping with wheat is promising. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The thermotolerant methylotrophic yeast Ogataea polymorpha has been regarded as an important organism for basic research and biotechnological applications. It is generally recognized as an efficient and safe cell factory in fermentative productions of chemicals, biofuels and other bio-products. However, it is difficult to genetically engineer for the deficiency of an efficient and versatile genome editing technology. Results: In this study, we developed a CRISPR-Cas9-assisted multiplex genome editing (CMGE) approach including multiplex genes knock-outs, multi-locus (ML) and multi-copy (MC) integration methods in yeasts. Based on CMGE, various genome modifications, including gene deletion, integration, and precise point mutation, were performed in O. polymorpha. Using the CMGE-ML integration method, three genes TAL from Herpetosiphon aurantiacus, 4CL from Arabidopsis thaliana and STS from Vitis vinifera of resveratrol biosynthetic pathway were simultaneously integrated at three different loci, firstly achieving the biosynthesis of resveratrol in O. polymorpha. Using the CMGE-MC method, - 10 copies of the fusion expression cassette P ScTEF1 -TAL-P ScTPI1 -4CL-P ScTEF2 -STS were integrated into the genome. Resveratrol production was increased ∼ 20 fold compared to the one copy integrant and reached 97.23 ± 4.84 mg/L. Moreover, the biosynthesis of human serum albumin and cadaverine were achieved in O. polymorpha using CMGE-MC to integrate genes HSA and cadA, respectively. In addition, the CMGE-MC method was successfully developed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Conclusions: An efficient and versatile multiplex genome editing method was developed in yeasts. The method would provide an efficient toolkit for genetic engineering and synthetic biology researches of O. polymorpha and other yeast species. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Synthetic membranes usually suffer from a ubiquitous trade-off between permeability and selectivity. Carbon nanotube (CNT)-based hybrid materials have shown attractive properties in high-performance membrane preparation; however, the aggregation of random CNTs in polymer remains a great challenge. Herein, the aligned and open-ended CNT/(polydimethylsiloxane) PDMS membranes are controllably fabricated to form a hamburger-like structure that possesses nanochannels (â10 nm) in the intermediate layer as well as angstrom cavities in the embedded PDMS. These aligned CNT membranes surpass the filling content limitation of the nonaligned CNT/PDMS membrane (37.4 wt % versus â10 wt %), leading to excellent mechanical properties and a multiplying performance increase of mass flux and selectivity for the separation of alcohols. The membranes break the permeability-selectivity trade-off with both parameters remarkably increasing (maximum 9 times) for bioalcohol separation. The established pervaporative-ultrafiltration mechanism indicates that the penetrant molecules preferentially pass through CNT internal nanochannels with increasing membrane permeability, thereby paving a way to nanoscale design of highly efficient channeled membranes for separation application. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Duckweeds (Lemnaceae) are efficient aquatic plants for wastewater treatment due to their high nutrient-uptake capabilities and resilience to severe environmental conditions. Combined with their rapid growth rates, high starch, and low lignin contents, duckweeds have also gained popularity as a biofuel feedstock for thermochemical conversion and alcohol fermentation. However, studies on the acidogenic anaerobic digestion of duckweed into carboxylic acids, another group of chemicals which are precursors of higher-value chemicals and biofuels, are lacking. In this study, a series of laboratory batch experiments were performed to determine the favorable operating conditions (i.e., temperature and pH) to maximize carboxylic acid production from wastewater-derived duckweed during acidogenic digestion. Batch reactors with 25 g/l solid loading were operated anaerobically for 21 days under mesophilic (35 °C) or thermophilic (55 °C) conditions at an acidic (5.3) or basic (9.2) pH. At the conclusion of the experiment, the dominant microbial communities under various operating conditions were assessed using high-throughput sequencing. Results: The highest duckweed-carboxylic acid conversion of 388 ± 28 mg acetic acid equivalent per gram volatile solids was observed under mesophilic and basic conditions, with an average production rate of 0.59 g/l/day. This result is comparable to those reported for acidogenic digestion of other organics such as food waste. The superior performance observed under these conditions was attributed to both chemical treatment and microbial bioconversion. Hydrogen recovery was only observed under acidic thermophilic conditions, as 23.5 ± 0.5 ml/g of duckweed volatile solids added. More than temperature, pH controlled the overall structure of the microbial communities. For instance, differentially abundant enrichments of Veillonellaceae acidaminococcus were observed in acidic samples, whereas enrichments of Clostridiaceae alkaliphilus were found in the basic samples. Acidic mesophilic conditions were found to enrich acetoclastic methanogenic populations over processing times longer than 10 days. Conclusions: Operating conditions have a significant effect on the yield and composition of the end products resulting from acidogenic digestion of duckweed. Wastewater-derived duckweed is a technically feasible alternative feedstock for the production of advanced biofuel precursors; however, techno-economic analysis is needed to determine integrated full-scale system feasibility and economic viability. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The photoenzymatic decarboxylation of fatty acids to alkanes is proposed as an alternative approach for the synthesis of biodiesel. By using a recently discovered photodecarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64A (CvFAP) we demonstrate the irreversible preparation of alkanes from fatty acids and triglycerides. Several fatty acids and their triglycerides are converted by CvFAP in near-quantitative yield and exclusive selectivity upon illumination with blue light. Very promising turnover numbers of up to 8000 were achieved in this proof-of-concept study. © 2018 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

AB  - The smoke point of several fuel mixtures was measured using a smoke meter defined by American Society for Testing Material D1322. The threshold soot index (TSI) was calculated to compare the sooting tendency of fuels. Two aviation biofuels produced by hydroprocessing of coconut oil, four jet range normal paraffins (n-paraffins), iso-octane, and propylbenzene were used to investigate the effects of chain length of n-paraffins, iso-paraffins, and aromatics on the sooting tendency. The results show that the effect of propylbenzene on the smoke point of the mixtures is dominant compared to that of the chain length of n-paraffins and the fraction of iso-paraffins. The differences in the sooting tendency among these n-paraffins are insignificant. In addition, blending aviation biofuels with Jet A1 leads to a decrease in the sooting tendency. Aromatics in Jet A1 play an important role on the sooting tendency of the mixtures of aviation biofuels and Jet A1. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - While compared to conventional petroleum fuel Vegetable oil is better in some parameters, because it has many parameters much closer to conventional petroleum fuel. In this study, oil which is extracted from cashew nut shell called Cardanol has been selected as the source of biofuel. Cashew-nut shell, which is the waste product of the cashew processing industries. Cashew nut shell liquid oil will be extracted by using a pyrolysis process. Cardanol oil can be used as an alternative source for the conventional diesel fuel, because of its properties is fulfilling the requirements. Except for viscosity, all the factors were matched with the biofuel requirements. B100 (100% cardanol) will have a higher viscosity such as 31.9cSt at 30oC. So, 100% cardanol oil cannot be used as a biofuel, it must be blended with diesel to change its viscosity. For that, the cardanol will be blended with diesel in different ratios such as D80-C20, D60-C40, and D40-C60. In all the ratios, the viscosity wasmeasured and finallyD60-C40blendhasgiventhe optimized results. B40 is the optimized blend which is utilized to carry out the performance characteristics and this blend has better ability to replace the diesel. © TJPRC Pvt. Ltd.

AB  - The dependence of fresh-water for biomass growth is a major drawback in third generation microalgae biofuels, which need to be replaced with alternate sources. Optimizing nutrient concentrations already present in wastewater and its utilization towards microalgae growth could be a sustainable approach. In the present study, native microalga Chlorella thermophila (MF179624) was isolated and identified as model strain to optimize low-nutrient content campus sewage wastewater (CSW) using central composite design (CCD) followed by steepest ascent method (SAM). In consideration to the statistical optimization, addition of 325 mg L-1 and 1.8 g L-1 of KH2PO4 and NaNO3 resulted in 60% enhancement of biomass yield (2.59 g L-1) with two fold lipid productivity (81.38 mg L-1 d-1). In addition, substantial nutrient removal of ammonia (98.48 ± 1.52%), nitrate (86.37 ± 3.73%), phosphate (73.83 ± 4.28%), along with COD (82.53 ± 4.37%) were achieved. Further, TGA, FTIR, and 1H-NMR based characterization of lipid revealed its potential as a biofuel feedstock. To confirm that, two-step acid-base catalytic transesterification reaction was performed, which resulted in 474.42 mg L-1 FAME yield containing 85.14% C16 and C18. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The transportation sector is an important sector for one country. It almost controls the economy of the country. But as the transportation sector is increasing day by day the pollution level is also increasing. There is a massive increase in the consumption of the fuel. It was estimated that about 90% of the transport sector is run by fuels that were derived from oil. As we are using the gasoline and diesel fuel, it’s contributing more to the pollution. The transport sector contributes to the increasing greenhouse gases, air pollution, smog and global warming. These pollutions are harming the environment as well as the human health. To curb with the increasing pollution we need to switch to alternate fuels such as biofuels, battery and fuel cells, which could power the transport sector. The paper focuses on the emissions that are caused by the hybrid vehicles and the biodiesel vehicles. The amount of NOx, CO, CO2 and HC emissions that are generated by the different vehicle and comparing them with the daily used vehicles. © IAEME Publication.

AB  - Current EU policy calls for decreased emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) by i.e., replacing fossil fuel in the transportation sector with sustainable biofuels. To avoid indirect land use change (iLUC), the EU at the same time strives to limit the use of crops and to increase the use of residues. In this study we compare climate impact and production cost for biogas and ethanol based on wheat grain and straw, respectively, in a Swedish context. The economic competitiveness for ethanol from straw vs. grain is evaluated based on the mandatory emission reduction for fossil vehicle fuels implemented since July 2018 in Sweden. The result of this study clearly shows that biogas and ethanol from straw have the lowest GHG emissions regardless of the calculation method used, although biofuels from grain also fulfill EU GHG reduction criteria even when suggested iLUC factors are included. It was also shown that the cost of producing straw-based biofuels was higher, thus there is a trade-off between climate impact and costs. The GHG reduction mandate adopted in Sweden partly compensates for this, but is not enough to make ethanol from straw competitive from an economic perspective. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Although many types of heterogeneous catalysts have been applied to the transesterification reaction, some of them are unsuitable for industrial applications due to their high price and the extra preparation required to synthesize them. Calcium methoxide is a low cost, strong base with high catalytic activity and is thus commonly used in the biofuels synthesis process during the transesterification reaction. The objective of this study was to determine the optimized conversion in the transesterification reaction of waste cooking oil (WCO) for biodiesel production by using a homogenizer with a calcium methoxide catalyst. It was shown that the optimal reaction conditions are a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 6:1, 4 wt % Ca(OCH3)2, a reaction temperature of 65°C, a rotation speed of 7000 rpm, and a reaction time of 90 min. The conversion rate under these conditions reached 90.2%. Ca(OCH3)2 thus has potential as a catalyst for industrial use. In addition, with a homogenizer system, the reaction time for synthesizing calcium methoxide catalyst can be reduced by half compared to that for conventional water-bath heating. In addition, the large amount of waste water required in the oil-water separation step can be reduced by using calcium methoxide instead of a homogeneous catalyst, significantly reducing manufacturing costs. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The global clean energy supply has drawn tremendous attention toward alternative resources for biofuel. Microalgae are proving a potential source due to their high oil content and rapid biomasss production, but it still challenging to find potential species and produce biomasss at low-cost. The present work describes the sucessful collection, isolation, and identification of Mexican native microalgae species from eutrophic water. Morphological studies were conducted by analyzing the size and shape of pyrenoids, cell walls, nuclei, and mucilages with the help of light microscopy, and molecular analysis was performed using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS, 18-28S rRNA) gene partial sequence followed by phylogenetic analysis. Three species isolated from eutrophic water (Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella saccharophila and Scenedesmus dimorphus), two standard culture media (Bold's Basal Medium (BBM) and Murashige and Skoog), and partially treated wastewater (TEC) were used in this study to select native potential microalgae for low-cost biomass and lipid production. The biomasss and lipid accumulation was nearly similar between BBM and TEC. It was concluded that it is feasible to use wastewater (TEC) to cultivate these native algae to treat wastewater for removal of nutrients and produce lipid at a lower cost than standard medium. Furthermore, the native species can be used without seasonal acclimatization. It is necessary to conduct further experiments to optimize the culture condition and maximize biomasss production in order to scale the production to an industrial level. © 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers..

AB  - Catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) has emerged as an attractive process for the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into renewable fuels and products. Considerable research and development has focused on using circulating-bed reactors with zeolite catalysts (e.g., HZSM-5) for CFP because of their propensity to form gasoline-range aromatic hydrocarbons. However, the high selectivity for aromatics comes at the expense of low carbon yield, a key economic driver for this process. In this contribution, we evaluate non-zeolite catalysts in a fixed-bed reactor configuration for an integrated CFP process to produce fuel blendstocks from lignocellulosic biomass. These experimental efforts are coupled with technoeconomic analysis (TEA) to benchmark the process and guide research and development activities to minimize costs. The results indicate that CFP bio-oil can be produced from pine with improved yield by using a bifunctional metal-acid 2 wt% Pt/TiO2 catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor operated with co-fed H2 at near atmospheric pressure, as compared to H-ZSM5 in a circulating-bed reactor. The Pt/TiO2 catalyst exhibited good stability over 13 reaction-regeneration cycles with no evidence of irreversible deactivation. The CFP bio-oil was continuously hydrotreated for 140 h time-on-stream using a single-stage system with 84 wt% of the hydrotreated product having a boiling point in the gasoline and distillate range. This integrated biomass-to-blendstock process was determined to exhibit an energy efficiency of 50% and a carbon efficiency of 38%, based on the experimental results and process modelling. TEA of the integrated process revealed a modelled minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of $4.34 per gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE), which represents a cost reduction of $0.85 GGE-1 compared to values reported for CFP with a zeolite catalyst. TEA also indicated that catalyst cost was a significant factor influencing the MFSP, which informed additional CFP experiments in which lower-cost Mo2C and high-dispersion 0.5 wt% Pt/TiO2 catalysts were synthesized and evaluated. These materials demonstrated CFP carbon yield and oil oxygen content similar to those of the 2 wt% Pt/TiO2 catalyst, offering proof-of-concept that the lower-cost catalysts can be effective for CFP and providing a route to reduce the modelled MFSP to $3.86-3.91 GGE-1. This report links foundational science and applied engineering to demonstrate the potential of fixed-bed CFP and highlights the impact of coupled TEA to guide research activities towards cost reductions. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This study investigates fine particulate matter (PM2.5) bound persistent organic pollutants (POPs) emitted from a diesel generator fueled with three waste cooking oil-based biodiesel (WCO-biodiesel) blends (W0 (pure diesel), W20 (WCO-biodiesel/diesel = 20%/80% (v/v)), and W40). These POPs are polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Experimental results indicate that the mass concentrations of PM2.5-bound PCDD/Fs, PCBs, PBDD/Fs and PBDEs in the engine exhaust are 2.15–3.65, 16.7–35.4, 25.8–46.5 and 303–440 pg Nm–3, respectively, at 1.5–3.0 kW loads for using W0, while the corresponding toxic equivalent (TEQ) concentrations of the above PM2.5-bound pollutants are 0.282–0.527, 0.038–0.051 and 0.064–0.093 pg WHO2005-TEQ Nm–3, respectively (excluding PBDEs, which still have no toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) for TEQ calculation). Using W20 and W40 reduced the mass and TEQ emission concentrations of PM2.5-bound PCDD/Fs, PCBs, PBDD/Fs and PBDEs in comparison with W0. The reductions of mass concentrations in exhausted PM2.5 were in the order PBDEs &gt;&gt; PBDD/Fs &gt; PCBs &gt; PCDD/Fs, while the decrease in toxic concentration followed the order PCDD/Fs &gt; PBDD/Fs &gt; PCBs. Thus, adding WCO-biodiesel to the fuel mixture in generator engines lowers the adverse effects of PM2.5 emissions on the environment and human health. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.

AB  - Uncertainty has been cited as one possible explanation for the lackluster performance of the Renewable Fuel Standard, which was enacted to encourage investment in the production of advanced biofuel. The unpredictability of conventional fuel markets makes the revenues and costs associated with biofuel production uncertain. In addition, policy uncertainty, in the form of annual revisions and adjustments to the program, make the cost of complying with the Renewable Fuel Standard uncertain. This paper is the first to decompose the aggregate uncertainty facing biofuel producers and isolate the effect of fuel market uncertainty and policy uncertainty on the decision to enter and exit the biofuel market. Results indicate that the uncertainty in the conventional fuel markets and the uncertainty in status of the Renewable Fuel Standard program influence incentives to enter and exit the biofuel market in different ways. Annual adjustments to the standard coupled with the unpredictable expiration and reinstatement of blender tax credits can work to discourage investment in biofuels and undermine effectiveness of the program. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recycling waste cooking vegetable oils by reclaiming and using these oils as biodiesel feedstocks is one of the promising solutions to address global energy demands. However, producing these biodiesels poses a significant challenge because of their poor physicochemical properties due the high free fatty acid content and impurities present in the feedstock, which will reduce the biodiesel yields. Hence, this study implemented the following strategy in order to address this issue: (1) 70 vol% of waste cooking vegetable oil blended with 30 vol% of Calophyllum inophyllum oil named as WC70CI30 used to alter its properties, (2) a three-stage process (degumming, esterification, and transesterification) was conducted which reduces the free fatty acid content and presence of impurities, and (3) the transesterification process parameters (methanol/oil ratio, reaction temperature, reaction time, and catalyst concentration) were optimized using response surface methodology in order to increase the biodiesel conversion yield. The results show that the WC70CI30 biodiesel has favourable physicochemical properties, good cold flow properties, and high oxidation stability (22.4 h), which fulfil the fuel specifications stated in the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards. It found that the WC70CI30 biodiesel has great potential as a diesel substitute without the need for antioxidants and pour point depressants. © 2018

AB  - Reliance on fossil fuel energy resources has become economically costly and environmentally unsustainable. With the rapid depletion of fossil fuels due to increased demand, the need for alternative fuel from biological resources has gained importance. Although a wide range of alternative energy sources are being experimented, biodiesel from sustainable resources has gained widespread acceptance and importance. Third generation biofuels from microalgae are particularly promising in their yield and application. The present study aims at tapping the highly competent native microalgal species for biodiesel production. Microalgae from kitchen waste water was isolated and characterized as Leptolyngbya sp. by 16S rRNA sequencing. Chlorella vulgaris was taken as a standard for comparison of growth, biochemical and biodiesel producing ability. The microalgal cultures were grown under controlled conditions and their growth rate and lipid productivity were assessed. Temperature stress (heat shock stress) was induced to understand the effect of rising global temperature on microalgae. The biochemical parameters were analyzed under normal and stressed conditions for both the microalgae. Leptolyngbya sp. had better lipid productivity compared to Chlorella vulgaris. The lipids obtained from microalgae were chemically transesterified to biodiesel. Again it was Leptolyngbya sp. that had a higher biodiesel yield. Biodiesel blends were made from the biodiesel thus obtained along with commercial diesel. The properties of Biodiesel 20, Biodiesel 50 and Biodiesel 100 proved them to be suitable for commercial applications. The present work opens up new avenues for native microalgae with potential for biodiesel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper investigated the effect of Na, Mg Ba and Na, K in the conversion of the metal soaps extracted from macauba pulp oils into bio-oil through fast pyrolysis (200 °C min−1). The influence of the acidity of the raw material (high and low acidity, 93 and 7 mg KOH/g respectively) through the thermal decomposition process was also studied. These parameters were evaluated according to the production of bio-oil checking yields and their potential as a renewable fuel and to produce chemicals for industrial propose. Based on the TGA results the metal soaps were submitted to fast pyrolysis at 550 °C producing three fractions, i.e. liquid (bio-oil + water), gas and solid, which presented different yields depending on the metal used. The yields were: bio-oil (35–54% w/w), water content (8–12% w/w), gas (25–35% w/w) and solid (10–30% w/w). The bio-oils are comprised mainly of a homologous series of hydrocarbons from carbon number C6 to C17 and also from some oxygenated compounds. The content of hydrocarbons (70–80% relative area) and oxygenated compounds (20–30% relative area) present in the bio-oils depend upon the metal soap. The bio-oils obtained from magnesium soaps yielded the highest content of diesel fraction hydrocarbons. The differences in the content and chemical composition of the bio-oils showed that the metal and the counter ion used have a catalytic effect of promoting changes in the cracking process. On the other hand, the acidity of the raw material did not cause changes in the thermal decomposition process. Furthermore, some physicochemical properties were obtained for bio-oils and compared with ANP (National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels, Brazil) specification for diesel fuel. The bio-oils obtained could be categorized as green diesel and could be used as blends. The solid fraction is comprised mainly of carbonates and oxides of the metal used and also by the remaining salts used in the saponification process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this investigation, the effect of operating parameters on product distribution for the conversion of water hyacinth into most valuable product bio oil as well as char and gases are investigated. To observe the parametric effect on product distribution, the temperature was varied 300–600 °C, heating rate 10–50 °C/min, particle size of the feed &lt;0.5–2.5 mm and carrier gas nitrogen flow rate 0–12 lpm. The highest bio-oil yield of 44.9 wt% was obtained at 350 °C, 30 °C/min, particle feed size less than 0.5 mm and 6 lpm. The results show that the product yield is strongly influenced by the temperature variation whereas weakly affected by the heating rate. The biomass and the products were characterized by ultimate, proximate, DTG, FTIR, 1H NMR, and GC–MS. Syngas evolution increase with the increase of temperature except CO2. The quality of bio-oil is perspective as a source of value-added chemicals and char is a promising source for the production of carbonaceous materials as well as solid fuel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to their renewable and sustainable nature, biodiesel blends boost studies predicting their stability during storage. Besides chemical degradation, biodiesel is more susceptible to biodegradation due to its raw composition. The aim of this work was to evaluate the deteriogenic potential (growth and degradation) of Pseudallescheria boydii and Meyerozyma guilliermondii in degrading pure diesel (B0), pure biodiesel (B100), and a B10 blend in mineral medium during storage. The biodeterioration susceptibility at different fuel ratios and in BH minimal mineral medium were evaluated. The biomass measurements of P. boydii during 45 days indicated higher biomass production in the B10 blend. The growth curve of M. guilliermondii showed similar growth in B10 and B100. Although there was no significant production of biosurfactant, lipase production was detected in the tributyrin agar medium of both microorganisms. The main compounds identified in the aqueous phase by GC-MS were alcohols, esters, acids, sulfur, ketones, and phenols. The results showed that P. boydii grew at the expense of fuels, degrading biodiesel esters, and diesel hydrocarbons. M. guilliermondii grew in B100 and B10; however, degradation was not detected. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The pyrolysis of the lignocellulosic biomass is a promising process to produce biofuels or green chemicals. Specific analytical methods have to be developed in order to better understand the composition of biomass and of its pyrolysis products and therefore to optimize the design of pyrolysis processes. For this purpose, different biomasses (Douglas and Miscanthus) and one biochar were analyzed by laser desorption/ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (LDI FT-ICR MS). This method allowed the biomass and biochar to be analyzed without any sample preparation and with a spatial resolution of about 100 μm. The influence of LDI conditions (laser wavelength and laser irradiance) and the nature of the biomass and biochar on the obtained mass spectrum were investigated. The nature and origin of the observed ions highly depended on LDI conditions. In the softest laser–biomass interaction conditions (low laser irradiance), the detected ions were related to the nature of the investigated biomass. Indeed, the main part of the detected species came from the different biomass subunits and was produced by photolysis of covalent bonds. When more severe laser irradiation conditions were used, the obtained mass spectra gathered the ions relative to (i) the chemical components of the investigated samples, (ii) the recombination products of these species in the gas phase after their ejection from the sample surface, and (iii) the compounds produced by laser pyrolysis of the sample. This was expected to be useful to mimic thermal pyrolysis. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2018, American Society for Mass Spectrometry.

AB  - The capacities of fatty esters and commercial biodiesel (i.e., mixture of fatty esters with fossil diesel) for solubilizing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were investigated and were attributed to the property of fatty esters forming aggregates and internally accommodating such compounds. Different systems formed by solely fatty esters and commercial biodiesel were investigated to study the effect of the structure of fatty esters on the solubility of PAHs. In the presence of ethyl oleate, the solubility of naphthalene increased by 23 ± 1.3%, that of phenanthrene by 1.4 ± 0.7%, and those of anthracene and pyrene by 1.1 ± 0.6%. The maximum solubility values of PAHs indicated that fatty esters exerted a positive effect on solubility in the same way as a surfactant (ionic and neutral). In the presence of a mixture of fatty esters, the maximum concentration of naphthalene solubilized was 105.5 ± 2.5 mg/L, a 3.7-fold increase compared to its solubility in water. The same behavior was observed for other compounds like pyrene and phenanthrene. However, they were dissolved in different proportions due to the different physico-chemical properties and chemical structure of each compound. Considering the presence of PAHs in fossil diesel, the potential of fatty esters was assessed when mixed with fossil diesel, commercial available as biodiesel, which showed increase in the solubility of PAHs in the aqueous phase. In the absence of fatty esters, when only fossil diesel was present, the maximum concentrations of naphthalene and phenanthrene were 136.3 ± 3.9 and 1.28 ± 0.07 μg/L, respectively, while the maximum values in the presence of a blend of fossil diesel and biodiesel were 437.6 ± 16.7 and 26.8 ± 4.5 μg/L for naphthalene and phenanthrene, respectively. Therefore, it was reasonable to affirm that fatty esters interfered in the solubilities of PAHs, which might be associated with the formation of aggregates. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper investigates the performance and emission analyses of a turbo-charged diesel engine fuelled with pre-mixed and post-mixed hybrid biodiesel blends at varying load condition thereby maintaining injection timing, injection pressure and speed constant at 230bTDC, 220 bar and 1500 RPM. The experimental result depicted that post-mixed biodiesel blends (POBD 20) showed higher brake specific energy consumption and exhaust gas temperature by 4.6% and 2.02% than that of diesel while brake thermal efficiency was reduced by 5.68%. However, engine overall performance of post-mixed biodiesel blends (POBD 20) was found to be comparable with diesel and other prepared test fuel blends. Similarly, comparing exhaust emissions, oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide were on its higher side by 2.64% and 2.43% than normal diesel fuel. On the contrary, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon and smoke opacity for POBD 20 were found to be 36.87%, 51.5% and 23.2% lower than conventional diesel fuel. From the above study, it is finally concluded that POBD 20 blend may be used as an alternative optional fuel that can substitute present diesel fuel without much engine modification and exhaust related problems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuels mitigate and offset greenhouse gases. A long-term levelized cost of energy (LCOE) estimation for biofuels in China was carried out, using a novel probabilistic model to analyze the likelihood of biofuels economically outrunning fossil fuels. This model calculated LCOE based on five uncertain input parameters fed into a Monte Carlo simulation, namely, discount rate, firm size, feedstock price, product yield and catalyst/enzyme cost, while key assumptions were used to determine their probability distributions. Model results show that the mean levelized costs of most biofuel technologies will fall below 9500 Chinese Yuan per ton by 2030 and below 9000 Chinese Yuan per ton by 2050; it is highly possible for most biofuel technologies to gain economic feasibility and competitiveness by around 2025–2030 in China. The LCOE reduction of 1.5-generation (1.5G) biofuels is feedstock-driven, while that of 2nd-generation (2G) biofuels is technology-driven. Meanwhile, 1.5G biofuels are more sensitive to crude oil price changes than 2G biofuels, with a drop in crude oil price having a greater effect on 2G biofuels than a rise. On average, every 10% rise in crude oil price accelerates their economic feasibility by 2–3 years, while every 10% drop delays this feasibility by 3–5 years. © 2018

AB  - Today, the increase in the production and consumption of biofuels such as biodiesel in the transportation sector is considered an appropriate solution to decrease the consumption of fossil fuels and their consequent pollutions. However, in order to increase energy efficiency and minimize energy losses and waste materials, the biodiesel production processes require the particular revisions and modifications. In the present study, the exergy analyses of the mechanical stirrer (MS), ultrasonic cavitation (UC) and hydrodynamic cavitation (HC)-based biodiesel production processes were performed and the results were compared together, in order to improve the efficiency of the biodiesel production process. To compare the results, three parameters of the exergy waste emission, the exergy destruction, and the exergy efficiency were used. The results indicated that both the cavitation processes lead to improved exergy efficiency in the biodiesel production. However, the HC process proved to be a more appropriate option to replace the conventional biodiesel production process equipped with stirred-rank reactors (the MS process) due to eliminating the main waste streams, decreasing exergy destruction to half, and increasing exergy efficiency by 6.2%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Selective conversion of carbohydrates to fuels and fine chemicals is of great importance for biorefinery. However, development of efficient solid acidic catalysts which perform stably for this process is still challenging. Herein, we reported a novel carbon-based solid acidic catalyst, prepared via hydrothermal carbonization of glucose followed by magnetization of Fe3O4 and sulfonation of H2SO4, which can serve as an efficient and recyclable catalyst in the catalytic dehydration of fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and subsequent etherification of 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) with ethanol from various carbohydrates. The effects of reaction conditions (temperature, time, solvents, catalyst amount, and γ-valerolactone (GVL) concentration) were optimized affording to a maximum EMF yield of 67.4 % at 120 °C, 55 wt % catalyst loading based on starting fructose and 60 vol.% of GVL in ethanol after 24 h of reaction. Noticeably, GVL promotes the formation of EMF and HMF reducing the extent of side reactions. Recycling experiments showed that the catalyst could be easily separated with a magnet and reused up to 4 consecutive times without significant loss of activity. The present work opens a way to synthesize reusable and cost-effective solid acidic catalysts from biomass wastes and may contribute to a holistic approach for biomass valorization. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The practical energy minimization algorithm (EMA) is introduced here to determine if a water distribution system (WDS) can be less energy dependent. The EMA is a simple algorithm that can be used by practitioners in the planning and management of WDS. The EMA employs the Jatropha Curcas (JC) tree as a source of oil for fueling water pumps. The EMA is demonstrated on a WDS in Senegal, West Africa, and calculates the level of JC production required to be self-sufficient in fueling the water system to meet drinking, sanitation, and JC irrigation requirements. It was found that the EMA successfully showed that the demonstration WDS can be energy self-sufficient to provide recommended amounts of drinking water for the people and enough irrigation for the JC trees, but only if greywater was used to supplement the irrigation and if a mechanical press was used in lieu of a hand press to extract the oil from the JC leaves. An adequate amount of oil was thus produced to power the required mechanical press as well. Payback periods of significantly less than the life of the required equipment indicate the viability of JC oil as fuel and the feasibility of having an energy independent WDS. © IWA Publishing 2018.

AB  - The conversion of the biomass-derived lipid, lignocellulosic and carbohydrate resources into renewable platform intermediates, chemicals and biofuels has been lately increasing in interest. The mechanistic reaction pathways, like hydro-deoxygenation, decarboxylation and hydrocracking, of the selected palmitic acid, as a model fatty acid, over Ni/ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts were studied. The ZSM-5 material with different Al/Si molar ratios was synthesized via a green template-free hydrothermal synthesis procedure, treated and subsequent functionalised with various Ni metal loadings. However, Ni/Al molar ratio was kept stoichiometric (Ni/Al = 0.5). The characteristic physicochemical properties of composite catalysts were studied by numerous characterization techniques, such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning-, as well as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (SEM/HRTEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). NiO with an average particle size of 10–20 nm was found on ZSM-5 support. The relative Ni/Al atom fraction in Ni/ZSM-5 systems influenced their Lewis/Brønsted acidic sites, as well as the external exposed area of prepared heterogeneous structures. Furthermore, the mentioned morphological parameters affected predominant catalytic routes. Species’ production mechanism, as a consequence of Lewis/Brønsted centre weak/strong acidity, as well as their integral concentration, was proposed, mirroring the observed process kinetics, selectivity and turnover. It was demonstrated that the main obtained products were esters, aldehydes, alcohols, hydrocarbons and gases (CO2, CO…), produced by deoxygenation (e.g. decarbonylation), hydrogenation and cracking, less, though, through isomerisation. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - To supplement the increasing energy demands and cope with the greenhouse gas emissions, biofuels generated from lignocellulosic biomass are gaining widespread attention. In this study, wheat straw was used as a candidate lignocellulosic biomass to produce hydrogen fuel through hydrothermal gasification. The fluid phases of water investigated for gasification included subcritical (300 and 370°C) and supercritical (450 and 550°C) phases. Along with the effects of temperature (300-550°C), the influences of feed concentration (20-35 wt%) and reaction time (40-70 minutes) were comprehensively studied for wheat straw gasification in subcritical and supercritical water. To maximize hydrogen and total gas yields, the effects of two metal catalysts (eg, Ru/Al2O3 and Ni/Si-Al2O3) were examined. Hydrogen and total gas yields, as well as lower heating values of the gas products, were comparatively evaluated during the subcritical and supercritical water gasification of wheat straw. Supercritical water gasification of wheat straw at 550°C with 20 wt% feed concentration for 60 minutes of reaction time resulted in higher yields of hydrogen (2.98 mmol/g) and total gases (10.6 mmol/g). When compared to noncatalytic gasification, catalytic gasification using 5 wt% loading of Ru/Al2O3 and Ni/Si-Al2O3 enhanced the hydrogen yields up to 4.18 and 5.1 mmol/g, respectively, along with respective total gas yields of 15 and 18.2 mmol/g. Nonetheless, wheat straw-derived biochar produced at high supercritical water temperatures also retained high carbon content and calorific value. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - For algal biofuels to become a commercially viable and sustainable means of decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, growers are going to need to design feedstocks that achieve at least three characteristics simultaneously as follows: attain high yields; produce high quality biomass; and remain stable through time. These three qualities have proven difficult to achieve simultaneously under the ideal conditions of the laboratory, much less under field conditions (e.g., outdoor culture ponds) where feedstocks are exposed to highly variable conditions and the crop is vulnerable to invasive species, disease, and grazers. Here, we show that principles from ecology can be used to improve the design of feedstocks and to optimize their potential for “multifunctionality.” We performed a replicated experiment to test these predictions under outdoor conditions. Using 80 ponds of 1,100 L each, we tested the hypotheses that polycultures would outperform monocultures in terms of the following functions: biomass production, yield of biocrude from biomass, temporal stability, resisting population crashes, and resisting invasions by unwanted species. Overall, species richness improved stability, biocrude yield, and resistance to invasion. While this suggests that polycultures could outperform monocultures on average, invasion resistance was the only function where polycultures outperformed the best single species in the experiment. Due to tradeoffs among different functions that we measured, no species or polyculture was able to maximize all functions simultaneously. However, diversity did enhance the potential for multifunctionality—the most diverse polyculture performed more functions at higher levels than could any of the monocultures. These results are a key finding for ecological design of sustainable biofuel systems because they show that while a monoculture may be the optimal choice for maximizing short-term biomass production, polycultures can offer a more stable crop of the desired species over longer periods of time. © 2018 The Authors GCB Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The primary objective of this work was to enhance the performance and emission of the computerized variable compression ratio (VCR) diesel engine fuelled with pentanol/Calophyllum inophyllum (CI)/diesel fuel blends. Based on the prerequisite for the current research, response surface methodology (RSM), an optimization technique, was adopted for the process parameters compression ratio (CR), load and fuel blends, and the optimized responses like brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrocarbon (HC), and smoke were revealed with the help of Derringer’s desirability approach. From the results, it is notified that pentanol-fuelled engine showed better performance and emissions at 17.5 CR, P20C20 (pentanol 20%+Calophyllum inophyllum 20%+diesel 60%) blend and 2.5 bmep (brake mean effective pressure) load conditions. The observed mathematical models and validation experiments show that the VCR diesel engine exhibits maximum efficiency and minimum emissions at the optimized input parameters. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The present work analyzes the effect of antioxidants on engine combustion performance of a multi-cylinder diesel engine fueled with PB30 and PB50 (30 and 50 vol.% palm biodiesel (PB)). Four antioxidants namely N,N′-diphenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine (DPPD), N-phenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine (NPPD), 2(3)-tert-Butyl-4-methoxyphenol (BHA), and 2-tert-butylbenzene-1,4-diol (TBHQ) were added at concentrations of 1000 and 2000 ppm to PB30 and PB50. TBHQ showed the highest activity in increasing oxidation stability in both PB30 and PB50 followed by BHA, DPPD, and NPPD respectively, without any negative effect on physical properties. Compared to diesel fuel, PB blends showed 4.61–6.45% lower brake power (BP), 5.90–8.69% higher brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), 9.64–11.43% higher maximum in cylinder pressure, and 7.76–12.51% higher NO emissions. Carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), and smoke opacity were reduced by 36.78–43.56%, 44.12–58.21%, and 42.59–63.94%, respectively, than diesel fuel. The start of combustion angles (SOC) of PB blends was − 13.2 to − 15.6 °CA BTDC, but the combustion delays were 5.4–7.8 °CA short compared to diesel fuel which were − 10 °CA BTDC and 11°CA respectively. Antioxidant fuels of PB showed higher BP (1.81–5.32%), CO (8.41–24.60%), and HC (13.51–37.35%) with lower BSFC (1.67–7.68%), NO (4.32–11.53%), maximum in cylinder pressure (2.33–4.91%) and peak heat release rates (HRR) (3.25–11.41%) than baseline fuel of PB. Similar SOC of − 13 to − 14 °CA BTDC was observed for PB blended fuels and antioxidants. It can be concluded that antioxidants’ addition is effective in increasing the oxidation stability and in controlling the NOx emissions of palm biodiesel fuelled diesel engine. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - With an appropriate treatment, cellulose, as one of the main constituents of biomass, is a rich source of chemicals and fuels. Pyrolysis is a method whereby bio-oils can be formed at moderate temperatures and with the addition of a catalyst the composition of the bio-oil can be enhanced. Nanostructured ZnO is a mild catalyst for the pyrolysis of cellulose to bio-oils and with the addition of copper to the structure of ZnO the catalytic properties can be improved. The pyrolytic degradation of cellulose over ZnO/Cu doped nanocatalysts has been studied over the temperature range 400–800 °C with calculation of kinetic parameters. The results showed that with ZnO/2% Cu and ZnO/7% Cu, which had been heat-treated at 1000 °C, the yields significantly increased at 600 and 700 °C and the main components were aldehydes. In contrast, ZnO/Cu nanocatalysts prepared at 200 °C mostly generated ketones. The increasing amount of copper increased or decreased the content of some components at specific temperatures. The results demonstrated that ZnO/Cu nanocatalysts with different proportions of copper prepared and heat-treated at different temperatures affected the composition of the bio-oil. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Diesel exhaust emissions (DEE), being one of the main causes of ambient air pollution, exert a detrimental effect on human health and increase morbidity and mortality related to cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate potential adverse effects of exhausts emissions from B7 fuel, the first-generation biofuel containing 7% of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), and SHB20 fuel, the second-generation biofuel containing 20% FAME/hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), after a whole-body exposure with and without diesel particle filter (DPF). The experiment was performed on 95 male Fischer 344 rats, divided into 10 groups (8 experimental, 2 control). Animals were exposed to DEE (diluted with charcoal-filtered room air to 2.1–2.2% (v/v)) for 7 or 28 days (6 h/day, 5 days/week) in an inhalation chamber. DEE originated from Euro 5 engine with or without DPF treatment, run on B7 or SHB20 fuel. Animals in the control groups were exposed to clean air. Our results showed that the majority of haematological and biochemical parameters examined in blood were at a similar level in the exposed and control animals. However, exposure to DEE from the SHB20 fuel caused an increase in the number of red blood cells (RBC) and haemoglobin concentration. Moreover, 7 days exposure to DEE from SHB20 fuel induced genotoxic effects manifested by increased levels of DNA single-strand breaks in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Furthermore, inhalation of both types of DEE induced oxidative stress and caused imbalance of anti-oxidant defence enzymes. In conclusion, exposure to DEE from B7, which was associated with higher exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, resulted in decreased number of T and NK lymphocytes, while DEE from SHB20 induced a higher level of DNA single-strand breaks, oxidative stress and increased red blood cells parameters. Additionally, DPF technology generated increased number of smaller PM and made the DEE more reactive and more harmful, manifested as deregulation of redox balance. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work was aimed to study droplet combustion which was a foundation of spray combustion. Combustion characteristics of BUT00 (pure biodiesel) and BUT50 (50% n-butanol and 50% biodiesel by mass) were investigated using droplet suspension technology under 1 bar and 900 K. One flame was observed for BUT00 while two flames were observed for BUT50. The flame of BUT00 underwent successively faint luminosity, bright luminosity, soot aggregate and soot spread. The first flame of BUT50 was faint and the second one was similar to that of BUT00 because they were caused by n-butanol and biodiesel combustion respectively. Before the auto-ignition of BUT00, (D/D0)2 was approximately unchanged at 1.0 and similarity degree (SD) was higher than 97%. Temperature growth rate (TGR) decreased first quickly and then slowly. After the auto-ignition of BUT00, (D/D0)2 sharply decreased and SD was in the range of 90–97%. The flame heating led to the increase of TGR. For BUT50, obvious fluctuations were found in (D/D0)2, SD and TGD. The SD of BUT50 was generally lower than 97%. The (D/D0)2 of BUT50 included transient heating, fluctuation evaporation and equilibrium evaporation phases. Some characteristic parameters were deterministic although (D/D0)2 in fluctuation evaporation phase was a non-deterministic process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The real-world exhaust emissions and fuel consumption of on-road diesel vehicles, fueled by waste cooking oil biodiesel blends, were measured using a portable emission measurement system (PEMS). Two light-duty diesel trucks (LDDTs) and two heavy-duty diesel trucks (HDDTs) filled with four mixed fuels with blend ratios of 0% (neat diesel), 5% (B5), 20% (B20), and 100% (B100) (biodiesel in traditional fossil diesel) were tested. The results show that the total fuel consumption (biodiesel + traditional fossil diesel) did not clearly decrease, but blending biodiesel into traditional fossil diesel could clearly decreased the consumption of traditional fossil diesel, reduce the countries’ dependence on oil imports. Converting waste cooking oil into biofuel and blending with diesel is a three-win alternative, dealing simultaneously with greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, food security, and energy security. The CO, HC, NOX and PM2.5 emissions for all of the tested vehicles decreased with increasing biodiesel content in the blend, with the exception of PM2.5 and NOX for D3, the NOX emissions showed a decrease with increasing biodiesel content in the blend for most vehicles in this study. The effect of emission reduction for all biodiesel blending proportions under highway (HW) condition is better than that under Non-highway (NHW) condition. The degree of reduction in CO, HC, NOX, and PM2.5 emission increased with increasing biodiesel content in the blend under HW section. Under the NHW section, the emission factors for lower biodiesel blend proportions (below 12.5%) especially for B5 were higher than those for neat diesel. The biodiesel blend reduced CO, HC, NOX and PM2.5 emissions compared with neat diesel under different driving modes except for individual condition (especially for B5 under acceleration mode). Increasing the biodiesel content of the blend lowered the CO, HC, NOX, and PM2.5 emissions for acceleration and deceleration modes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Researchers examined how nozzle design influences the combustion and emissions of a 10 kW, pure fast pyrolysis oil (FPO) flame from a swirl burner within an insulated combustor using an internally mixed air-blast nozzle. No other studies are known that conducted a detailed investigation of the effect of nozzle design on the combustion and emissions of a pure FPO spray flame. FPO (also called bio-oil or pyrolysis liquid biofuel) is a biofuel made from waste wood, but its properties, especially its high water content, make efficient combustion challenging. Combustion experiments showed how carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, nitric oxide (NO) emissions, carbonaceous residue, flame stability and nozzle coking were influenced by the nozzle's mixing chamber diameter and outlet number/diameter, angle and total area. Ultimately, an optimized nozzle was designed that achieved a self-sustaining FPO flame with excellent stability, low emissions and low coking; it also operated under “cold-start” conditions and at steady-state conditions, did not require a pilot flame to maintain a stable, seated flame. The results show that with careful nozzle design, FPO is able to perform very effectively in burners and can therefore help to facilitate the replacement of fossil fuels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The many simultaneous processes occurring within in a diesel engine make difficult a thorough understanding of the mechanisms responsible for reduction of soot and/or NOX when an oxygenated compound is added to diesel fuel. Thus, in order to explore the use of oxygenated compounds as biofuels/additives, it is interesting to study their conversion under well-controlled laboratory conditions, together with kinetic studies that help to interpret and understand the reaction schemes that occur during such processes. The aim of this work has been to contribute to the knowledge of the dimethoxymethane (DMM) pyrolysis, one of the oxygenated compounds proposed in literature as alternative fuel. In this way, the influence of pyrolysis temperature (1075–1475 K) and inlet fuel concentration (33,333 and 50,000 ppm DMM) on the sooting propensity of DMM, soot reactivity and its properties is analyzed. Therefore, this work includes pyrolysis experiments under different experimental conditions, focusing on the gas-phase analysis and the soot formation, together with a gas-phase model. Additionally, the interaction of soot with O2 and with NO has been studied, and since soot properties are important on the oxidation rate, selected soot samples have been characterized by different instrumental techniques (elemental analysis, physical adsorption with N2, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy). © 2018

AB  - Camelina is an oil seed crop that belongs to the Brassica family (Cruciferae). Camelina meal is a by-product from the biofuel industry that contains on average 38% crude protein and between 10 to 20% of residual fat, which limits the inclusion levels of camelina meal in dairy cow diets as the main protein supplement. Thus, we conducted a solvent extraction on ground camelina seed on a laboratory scale. The objectives of this study were (1) to assess the effects of replacing canola meal (CM) with solvent-extracted camelina meal (SCAM) in lactating dairy cow diets; and (2) to determine the effects of SCAM on microbial fermentation and AA flow in a dual-flow continuous culture system. Diets were randomly assigned to 6 fermentors in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square with three 10-d experimental periods consisting of 7 d for diet adaptation and 3 d for sample collection. Treatments were 0, 50, and 100% SCAM inclusion, replacing CM as the protein supplement. Diets contained 55:45 forage:concentrate, and fermentors were fed 72 g of dry matter/d equally divided in 2 feeding times. On d 8, 9, and 10 of each period, samples were collected for analyses of pH, volatile fatty acids (VFA), N metabolism, NH3-N digestibility, and AA flow. Statistical analysis was performed using the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), and linear and quadratic effects of SCAM inclusion were assessed. Total VFA concentration and pH were not affected by diets. Molar proportion of acetate decreased, whereas molar proportion of propionate increased with SCAM inclusion. Total branched-chain VFA concentration was the least in fermentors fed diet 0, and greatest in fermentors fed diet 50. Digestibility of NDF decreased in fermentors fed SCAM diets, and dry matter, organic matter, and crude protein true digestibility were similar across diets. Concentration of NH3-N linearly decreased, and non-NH3-N linearly increased with SCAM inclusion. Bacterial efficiency (calculated as g of bacterial N flow/kg of organic matter truly digested) tended to be greater in fermentors fed diet 100. Outflow of Arg linearly increased with SCAM inclusion, whereas overall AA flow was not affected by diet. In conclusion, replacing CM with SCAM increased propionate molar proportion and non-NH3-N flow, and decreased NH3-N flow and concentration, which may improve animal energy status and N utilization. Inclusion of SCAM did not change most AA flow, indicating that it can be a potential replacement for CM. © 2018 American Dairy Science Association

AB  - We carried out oligomerization of ethylene using nickel supported on an acidic zeolite β (Ni-Hβ) catalyst in a laboratory-scale packed bed reactor for the synthesis of liquid hydrocarbons in milliliter quantities. We evaluated the effect of several process variables (temperature, pressure, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), and nickel loading) on the ethylene conversion, liquid hydrocarbon/coke yield, and oligomeric product selectivity. Increases in pressure resulted in higher ethylene conversion, leading to a liquid yield of 13.0 wt%, with 10.0 wt% coke at 65 bar. As the pressure increased to 65 bar, the selectivity towards octenes reached 10%, along with a decrease in C4 to 34%, which suggested that higher pressures promoted butene dimerization. Under the conditions studied, a minimum temperature of 120 °C was required to produce liquid hydrocarbons. The liquid yield increased with temperature, with a maximum of 17.0 wt% at 190 °C. Higher temperatures led to the formation of odd-numbered oligomers primarily due to acid-catalyzed cracking reactions. In the range of WHSV tested, a moderate 2.0 h−1 resulted in a local maximum of 10.6 wt% of liquid hydrocarbon yield. A moderate nickel loading of 3.4 wt% also resulted in the highest liquid yield (10.6 wt%) out of the three loadings tested. The results strongly suggest that the ionic form of nickel is much more active catalytically than the NiO form. The variation in nickel loading revealed the importance of having a synergistic balance of nickel and acid sites on the catalyst to maximize ethylene conversion and maintain high liquid hydrocarbon yield. The results from this work formed the basis for pilot scale runs carried out at the Southwest Research Institute (SWRI) for the Advanced Hardwood Biofuels (AHB) project. The pilot runs highlighted the need for efficient removal of ethanol from the ethylene feed after the dehydration process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Two challenges that have motivated researchers are the mitigation of emissions and a reduction in the reliance on diesel fuel. A potential replacement for diesel is biodiesel, which is derived from animal fat or vegetable oil. The large number of studies on the performance and emission characteristics of biodiesel is notable. In such studies, the noise emissions have seldom been disregarded or treated as a trivial matter. Extending the previously published research by the authors, an experimental investigation was carried out to study the effects of new fuel types on the noise emissions. Blends of Jatropha methyl ester (JME) biodiesel suspended with zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles along with hydrogen (H2) in dual-fuel mode were used as fuel for an experimental diesel engine test rig. The noise levels in decibels (dB) under variations in the biodiesel percentage, nanoparticle size, and flow rates of H2 at different loads were recorded. It was observed that 20% and 30% JME biodiesel blends suspended with ZnO nanoparticles of 40 nm in size have superior noise attenuation. To avoid a strenuous experimentation, an artificial neural network model was developed for noise prediction with a regression coefficient of 0.9992. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to important advantageous of non-premixed flames such as controllability and safety, a proper investigation can be highly beneficial for application of these flames in medical and power generation industries. The current paper attempts to provide a promising analytical model for non-adiabatic counter-flow diffusion flames propagating through volatile biomass particles using an asymptotic method. In order to offer a reliable model for analysis of the flames, a multi-zone flame structure including preheat, drying, vaporization, reaction and oxidizer zones, is considered. In this work, lycopodium particles and air are taken as biofuel and oxidizer, respectively. For following the influences of effective dimensionless numbers, such as fuel and oxidizer Lewis numbers on the flame structure, dimensionalized and non-dimensionalized forms of mass and energy conservation equations are derived for each zone. In order to observe the heat loss effects, a linear term is added to the energy conservation equation. The conservation equations are solved by Mathematica and Matlab software applying accurate boundary and jump conditions. Finally, variations of flame temperature, flame front position, gaseous fuel and oxidizer mass fractions with fuel and oxidizer Lewis numbers, mass particle concentration, particle size, equivalence ratio and heat loss effect are elaborately elucidated. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, a novel route was proposed for microalgae biofuel production by catalytic upgrading of Chlorella hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) derived biocrude. Al-SBA-15, CuO/Al-SBA-15, ZuO/Al-SBA-15, and CuO-ZnO/Al-SBA-15 catalysts were synthesized in a facile, one-pot way, and tested for methyl palmitate decarboxylation and biocrude upgrading without H2 addition. These modified SBA-15 catalysts enhanced alkane selectivity of methyl palmitate decarboxylation from 7.6 wt% up to 79.6 wt% at 340–350 °C. FT-IR, TG and GC–MS characterizations were employed to identify the composition and properties of the upgraded bio-oils. Compared with thermal upgrading, modified SBA-15 catalysts enriched the yield of low boiling point compounds, and the content of heavy bio-oil (&gt;400 °C) declined from 9.57 wt% to 1.89 wt%. Hydrocarbon yield was greatly enriched on the catalysts, and aromatics predominant on Al-SBA-15 while aliphatics abundant on metal oxide(s) supported catalysts. The hydrocarbon yield was increased from 25.1 wt% (thermal) to 65.7 wt% on the CuO/Al-SBA-15. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, attention was directed at the interactions between Li-doped ZnO systems and rye cereal. The interaction of cereal grains and straws with the transition metal ions is of biochemical importance primarily due to the presence of those complexes in biological systems. Metal/cereal chemistry plays a crucial role in the cross-linking of various biomolecules, and formed systems seem to be promising for various applications, such as material for the production of carbonizate and gaseous substances, which allows for the preparation of second generation biofuels. In the study of cereal/metal complexes, thermogravimetric measurements were performed in order to explain the influence of ZnO and Li2xZn1−xO oxides on the thermal decomposition of rye grains in relation to their application for biofuel production. The possibility of generation of volatile products and carbonizate was considered. The characterization of carbonizate and volatile products was made. The catalytic properties of Li2xZn1−xO phases in the decomposition of cereal grains were confirmed through thermal analysis. The thermal degradation of rye grains was catalyzed by Li-doped ZnO systems. Superior degradation to volatile products depended upon both the botanical origin of the cereal and the catalyzing system. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - A bottleneck in the production of biodiesel from microalgae is the dewatering and lipid extraction process which is the dominant energy penalty and cost. A novel biodiesel production platform based on vortex fluidic device (VFD)-assisted direct transesterification (DT) of wet microalgal biomass of Chloroparva pannonica was developed and evaluated. Fatty acid extraction and fatty acid to FAME conversion efficiencies were used at different parameter settings to evaluate performance of the processing technology in confined and continuous mode. A response surface method based on Box-Behnken experimental design was used to determine the effects of water content, the ratio of biomass to methanol and residence time in the VFD. Average extraction efficiencies were 41% and conversion efficiencies >90% with the processing technology showing a broad tolerance to parameter settings. The findings suggest that VFD-assisted DT is a simple and effective way to produce biodiesel directly from wet microalgae biomass at room temperature. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The bio-oil, produced via fast pyrolysis of biomass, can be used as substitute for transportation fuels after its subsequent upgrading. However, conventional upgrading of bio-oil faces serious problems of rapid catalyst deactivation and low conversion efficiency, due to the high unsaturation degree of bio-oil. In this study, the mild hydrogenation of simulated bio-oil over monometallic catalysts (Pd and Pt) and bimetallic catalysts (Pt-Fe, Pd-Fe, Pt-Ni and Pd-Ni) was performed, in order to increase the saturation degree. It was found that the addition of Ni could significantly facilitate the conversion of phenols. The maximum conversion of guaiacol and phenol over Pt-Ni/SiO2 catalyst reached 97.8% and 99.6%, respectively. The introduction of Fe improved the conversion of AcOH by promoting the protonation of carbonyl group. Complete conversion of AcOH was achieved over Pt-Fe/SiO2 catalyst. The upgraded product, of which the activity was significantly improved, was ready for subsequent upgrading for liquid fuel production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A combined Lewis-Brønsted acid ethanolysis of sugars was thoroughly investigated with the aim of producing ethyl levulinate (EL) in a single step. Ethanolysis carried out at 453 K for 4 h using H2SO4 (1 wt%) and AlCl3·6H2O (30 mol % with respect to sugars) produced a yield of 60 mol % of EL respect to glucose and starch. Such optimised conditions were positively applied directly on different food waste, preliminarily characterised and found to be mainly composed by simple (10–15%) and relatively complex sugars (20–60%), besides proteins (6–10%) and lipids (4–10%), even in their wet form. The catalytic system resulted robust enough to the point that the copresence of proteins, lignin, lipids and mineral salts not only did not negatively affect the overall reactivity, but resulted efficiently converted into soluble species, and specifically, into other liquid biofuels of different nature. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article analyses the integration of distributed biocrude production facilities using fast pyrolysis with solar photovoltaic (PV) for dispatchable electricity production. The strong growth of intermittent electricity generation from solar PV and wind is leading to a greater need for energy storage at grid scale and dynamic demand management. Various forms of energy storage, including electrochemical (e.g. batteries), mechanical (e.g. flywheels) and gravitational (e.g. pumped-hydro), are being developed. This work studies the issues of integrating fast pyrolysis of biomass to produce biocrude that can be readily stored in tanks and combusted to produce electricity when required to supplement the electricity generation from a solar PV unit to meet an arbitrary energy demand curve. The use of biomass pyrolysis in this application has a range of benefits, including the flexibility to augment intermittent renewables, the integration of more bioenergy into the electricity sector and the creation of commercial quantities of biocrudes that can be refined into renewable transport fuels such as jet fuel for which few other alternatives exist. Biocrudes, especially partially upgraded, can be stored and used when required in engines and gas turbines, making them a suitable fuel for augmenting the intermittent nature of solar and wind projects. The development of the distributed 100% renewable power stations using a mix of biomass/ biocrude and solar PV and/or wind would also increase the certainty of supply, knowledge of quality and price of raw biocrudes that can also be used to supply a centralized biorefinery, thereby substantially reducing the risk of investing in new biorefinery capacity. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Camelina sativa (false flax or gold-of-pleasure) is an Old World oilseed crop that fell out of use in the mid 20th Century but has recently gained renewed interest as a biofuel source. The crop is hexaploid, and its relationship to its diploid and polyploid congeners has remained unresolved. Using 54 accessions representing five species sampled across Camelina's center of diversity in Turkey and the Caucasus, we performed phylogenetic and genetic diversity analyses using RADseq genotyping and ITS sequencing. Flow cytometry was performed to assess relationships between genome size and phylogenetic groupings. Accessions fell into distinct, highly-supported clades that accord with named species, indicating that morphological characters can reliably distinguish members of the genus. A phylogenetically distinct lineage from Turkey may represent a currently unrecognized diploid species. In most analyses, C. sativa accessions nest within those of C. microcarpa, suggesting that the crop is descended from this wild hexaploid species. This inference is further supported by their similar genome size, and by lower genetic diversity in C. sativa, which is consistent with a domestication bottleneck. These analyses provide the first definitive phylogeny of C. sativa and its wild relatives, and they point to C. microcarpa as the crop's wild ancestor. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Controlled autoignition delay is considered a very promising new technology, having the potential of combining low fuel consumption with low pollutant emissions. In this study, the effect of pure diesel fuel and biodiesel B20 (20% rapeseed oil mixed with 80% diesel fuel, by volume) on ignition delay period, at different engine speeds, under full load operating conditions, has been investigated experimentally and numerically. For this purpose, two models were proposed. The experimental results were compared with the ignition delay predicted by some correlations and by the considered models. The results showed that the ignition delay period of biodiesel B20 is shorter than that of pure diesel fuel at similar operating conditions. Regarding pure diesel fuel, the ignition delay periods are in good accordance with Arrhenius type correlations, whereas for biodiesel B20 the correlation results are significantly different than the experimental data. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - This paper deals with the effects of adding Jet A-1 fuel to ethanol (E) in proportions of 20/80 vol% in biofuel homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion. Experiments were performed with a four-stroke direct injection (DI) diesel engine, the first cylinder of which was converted to operate in HCCI mode with various air/ethanol and air/Jet20E80 mixtures characterized by relative air:fuel ratios of λ=3.01-2.02 and 3.84-1.90 and externally prepared in the intake manifold at the inlet air temperature of 100°C. We studied the effects of Jet20E80 fuel blends on start of combustion (SOC), maximum heat release rate, burn angle mass burn fraction (MBF) 50, combustion duration, maximum in-cylinder pressure, and temperature indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP), thermal efficiency, coefficient of variation (COV) of maximum in-cylinder pressure and IMEP, as well as smoke and exhaust emissions. The air/Jet20E80 mixture improved HCCI combustion-phasing control, suggesting higher engine efficiency and ecological benefits. The start of combustion (SOC) occurred 2.2 crank angle degrees (CAD) later in the cycle, which enhanced the maximum heat release rate and the peak in-cylinder pressure by 37.2 and 23.1% and IMEP and thermal efficiency by 49.0 and 16.0%, respectively. The IMEP coefficient of variation decreased to its lowest level, 3.73%, when running with the richest air/Jet20E80 mixture, λ=1.90, at a constant speed of 1,400 rpm. The production of NOx and total unburned hydrocarbon (THC) emissions decreased 2.8 and 1.3 times, while smoke and CO emissions were 2.5 and 1.6 times higher than the amounts that HCCI combustion of neat ethanol produces under these conditions. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Microalgae could be of importance for future biodiesel production as an alternative for a third generation of biofuels. To select the most appropriate strain for biodiesel production, three microalgae species, namely Isochrysis sp., Nannochloropsis maritima and Tetraselmis sp., isolated from Tunisian coast, were biochemically characterized. Initially, gas chromatography analysis showed that Isochrysis sp. and N. maritima contained 5- and 10-fold total fatty acids, respectively, more than Tetraselmis sp. Then, the two microalgae Isochrysis sp. and N. maritima were subject to random mutagenesis using ultraviolet-C radiation. Subsequently, a total of 18 mutants were obtained from both species. The neutral lipid evaluation on said 18 mutants allowed the retention of only 7 to further fatty acid characterization. Finally, gas chromatography revealed that the mutant 5c Isochrysis sp. was characterized by a high level of saturated fatty acids (52.3%), higher amount of monounsaturated fatty acids (29.3%), lower level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (18.4%) and a significant 1.3-fold increase in its C16–C18 content compared to the wild-type strain, which would make it an interesting candidate for biofuel production. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Combined heat and power (CHP) generation can meet winter heating demands. Therefore, biomass CHP plants are more suitable for the development of biomass energy in village and town systems in cold regions. Transportation cost is one of the factors that determine operating costs. In this study, potential biomass energy is estimated based on the distribution of various types of crops. The locations and service areas of biomass CHP plants are determined using geographic information system analysis tools based on population distribution and energy demand data. Equations that contain multiple interference factors are used to calculate the raw material supply area and transportation cost for a biomass CHP plant to generate an optimal transportation route within a region. The analysis results show that biomass CHP plants are only suitable for village and town systems with a relatively low population density (PD). The curve of the supply area versus the PD of the village and town system (PDVTS) has an inverse-S shape. The transportation cost increases exponentially as the PDVTS increases. Biomass CHP plants can achieve higher efficiency in transportation costs when built in areas with a PDVTS ≤ 65 people/km2. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There have been significant advances in understanding ignition behavior of oxygenated biofuels (mainly alcohols) and their blends with conventional fuel components. However, the oxidation behavior of lignocellulosic derived furanic compounds blended with hydrocarbons has received little attention. The present work is an experimental and numerical investigation of 2-methylfuran (2-MF) combustion and its blend with n-heptane. These results are compared with pure n-heptane results to better understand 2-MF reactivity. Ignition delay times of pure 2-MF and the 2-MF/n-heptane (50/50 2-MF/n-heptane molar %) blend in air were measured in three different facilities; a rapid compression machine and two different shock tubes. Experiments were performed in the temperature range of 861–913 K at a pressure of 20 bar for stoichiometric pure 2-MF. The ignition delay times of 2-MF/n-heptane blends were measured in the temperature range of 672–1207 K, at pressures of 10 and 20 bar, and at equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5. A comprehensive chemical kinetic model containing low- to high-temperature chemistry of 2-MF and n-heptane was formulated based on a combination of available 2-MF and n-heptane mechanisms and available theoretical studies on 2-MF form literature. The developed detailed kinetic model was validated against the ignition delay data measured in this work as well as against high-temperature shock tube ignition delay, flame speed, and flame species data from literature to ensure the competence of the model. The proposed mechanism predicts the measured and literature data to a reasonable extent. To elucidate fuel specific oxidation pathways, reaction path analyses were performed at various conditions. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses on the ignition delay times were conducted and the dominant reaction pathways in the oxidation of pure and binary mixtures at high, intermediate, and low temperatures were identified. It is found that the competition between n-heptane and 2-MF for ȮH radicals inhibits the consumption of n-heptane and promotes the consumption of 2-MF. This work provides the first insight into the global low-temperature oxidation behavior of a second generation furanic blended with a hydrocarbon. © 2018 The Combustion Institute

AB  - Stable species and saddle points on the C5H11O potential energy surface relevant for 1-pentanol pyrolysis and combustion have been determined starting from the terminal adduct of the OH + 1-pentene reaction. A large number of stationary points were explored automatically with the KinBot software at the M06-2X/6-311++G(d,p) level. The kinetically relevant stationary points have been further characterized using UCCSD(T)-F12a/cc-pVTZ-F12//M06-2X/6-311++G(d,p) quantum chemistry calculations. The entrance channel consists of a barrierless outer transition state leading into a van der Waals well followed by a submerged saddle point, overall described with an effective two-transition-state model. The master equation has been solved to obtain pressure- and temperature-dependent rate coefficients for all reactions on the potential energy surface in the 300–2500 K temperature range and 0.01–100 atm pressure range. The newly obtained rate coefficients have been implemented in a kinetic model for the thermal decomposition of 1-pentanol diluted in a nitrogen stream. We measured the conversion of major species using gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector, and two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometric and flame ionization detectors in the effluent of a flow reactor at 0.17 MPa between 913 and 1023 K. Comparison of the simulated versus the experimental data acquired in this work shows that the reactions found by KinBot, for which earlier only poor estimates existed, are of significant importance to correctly describe conversion and product selectivities. It proves to be possible to generate adequate chemical models automatically provided that the underlying high-level ab initio data is computationally affordable. © 2018 The Combustion Institute

AB  - The use of pure vegetable oils in Micro Gas Turbine can damage the injection system or the combustion chamber causing undesired vibrations. An ideal solution would consist in having an available tool able to forecast and/or follow in real time the vibrational state of the combustion device. The present paper describes tests performed on a low emission Micro Gas Turbine for power generation, fueled with different liquid fuels, including commercial diesel oil and its blends with pure rapeseed oil. A particular attention was paid both on the emissions and on the measurements of the micro vibrational distributions and their correlation under the different fueling conditions using a new signal processing based on a nonlinear method and chaos analysis. We observed that the overall behavior of the MGT fueled with the blends was good, and the emission concentrations of CO, NOx and Total Particle Matter were comparable to the pure diesel oil ones. Moreover, the chaos analysis and the proposed methodology came out as a possible tool for the real-time characterization of the combustion process of the MGT and to individuation of the fuel supplied. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Climate change has the potential to affect crop prices and price volatility. However, the economic models used in prior assessments largely do not include known, automatic, stabilizing factors. Crop storage can stabilize prices and U.S. crop policy tends to provide support that moves opposite prices. We quantify effects of circa 2050 climate forcing on the inter-annual variability of U.S. Corn Belt corn and soybean yields using statistical crop models and climate scenarios from regional and global climate models. Climate change generally reduces mean yields and increases the inter-annual variability of yields in the Midwestern U.S. Using these yield impacts and an economic model with automatic market stabilizers, we find only modest increases in price volatility. Although individual producers and states are negatively affected by the yield reductions, the aggregate effect for all corn and soybean producer returns can be positive because of price increases. Moreover, agricultural policies based on price levels or revenue variation offset some of the impacts of market variation on farm income. Our results differ from other recent results and temper concerns that increasing climate instability necessarily translates to greater uncertainty about agricultural commodity uses, including as food and biofuels, in the near future. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sustainable production of renewable fuels has become an imperative goal but also remains a huge challenge faced by the chemical industry. A variety of low-value, renewable sources of carbon such as wastes and by-products must be evaluated for their potential as feedstock to achieve this goal. Hydrogenation of blends comprising waste animal fat (≤70 wt%) and low-value fluid catalytic cracking light cycle oil (≥30 wt%), with a total aromatic content of 87.2 wt%, was studied on a commercial sulfided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst. The fuel fraction in the diesel boiling range was separated by fractional distillation from the organic liquid product obtained from the catalytic conversion of the blend of 70 wt% waste animal fat and 30 wt% light cycle oil. Diesel fuel of the best quality was obtained under the following reaction conditions: T = 615–635 K, P = 6 MPa, LHSV = 1.0 h−1, H2/feedstock ratio = 600 Nm3/m3. The presence of fat in the feedstock was found to promote the conversion of light cycle oil to a paraffinic blending component for diesel fuel. Thus, a value-added alternative fuel with high biocontent can be obtained from low-value refinery stream and waste animal fat. The resultant disposal of waste animal fat, and the use of fuel containing less fossil carbon for combustion helps reduce the emission of pollutants. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article presents a design study and the development of a low-cost production process for obtaining bio-oil from sugarcane bagasse by using a Circulating Fluidized Bed reactor (CFBr). The reactor had a diameter of 4 in. and a height of 4.5 m. In addition, sand with a diameter of 249 μm was used as the bed material. Sugarcane bagasse was used as the raw material for the bio-oil production. This bio-oil production system had a feed rate of between 18 and 45 kg/h. The outstanding design of this system consisted of the production of a bio-oil with high efficiency by using the following: (1) a gas combustor used in gas turbine engine, (2) a non-condensable gas recovery for use in the process, and (3) a feeder and pre-heat exchanger before condenser unit. The experiment was performed at a superficial velocity of between 5 and 7 m/s, with a bed temperature ranging from 440 to 520 °C, and with a bed inventory at 0.5 and 4.5 kg. From the experiment, it was found that this system could produce a maximum yield of bio-oil of 78.07 wt% at the bed temperature of at 480 °C. In addition, the superficial velocity, the bed inventory, and feed rate were 7 m/s, 4.5 kg, and 30 kg/h, respectively. The properties of the bio-oil, such as its heating value, viscosity, density, and pH were measured at 18,483 kJ/kg, 24.54 cSt, 1274 kg/m3, and 2.4, respectively. The chemical components of bio-oil were also investigated by GC–MS. In this system, the cold efficiency and total energy conversion to bio-oil production were 46.06% and 32.94%, respectively. From a cost analysis of bio-oil production, the results showed that the cost production was 0.353 $/l. In addition, the results revealed that the bed temperature, the solid re-circulating rate, and the suspension density had significantly and directly affected the yield of bio-oil production. Furthermore, the oxygen in the exhaust gas from the combustion system and the non-condensable gas from the process had been shown to have a direct effect upon the properties of the bio-oil. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Iranian energy sector has recently discovered a great interest in the concept of renewable and clean energy. The interest is motivated primarily by concerns about greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and global climate change, as well as the desire to find alternative and sustainable energy sources and create potential job opportunities related to these new technologies for future generations of Iranians. This study supports the search for alternative, sustainable energy sources by assessing okra's usability as a biofuel. Okra is an annual, warm season crop that provides a rich source of industrial oil and protein. According to our investigation, the seeds of Iranian okra ecotypes that have an oil content of 20% could produce up to 325 kg/ha oil yield. Our study on Iranian okra seed oil showed that, the most dominant fatty acids of are linoleic acid (C18:2) (38–40%), Palmitic acid (C16:0) (29–30%), and Oleic acid (C18:1) (19–22%). The biodiesel derived from okra via a transesterification reaction using an ultrasonic system could meet ASTM D6751 standards with satisfactory results in methyl ester content (more than 96%), viscosity (2.3–2.4 mm −2 /S, and flash point (155–158 °C)). Because of its high oil yield, quality, and large ecological adaptation window, okra is a strong contender to provide a new source of non-edible oil for biodiesel production in bioenergy farms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

The effects of microwave irradiation temperature, irradiation time, and concentration of hydrochloric acid on product distribution from co-pyrolysis and the relative contents of the major components in bio-oil were investigated. A maximum bio-oil yield of 40.00 wt.% was obtained at 200 °C for 60 min with 0.5 M hydrochloric acid. As pretreatment temperature, reaction time and acid concentration increased, respectively, the relative contents of phenols, diesel fraction (C12 + aliphatics), and other oxygenates decreased. The gasoline fraction (including C5–C12 aliphatics and aromatics) ranged from 55.77% to 73.30% under various pretreatment conditions. Therefore, excessive reaction time and concentration of acid are not beneficial to upgrading bio-oil. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The fruit and vegetable markets produce large amounts of waste each year, and the disposal of these wastes is costly, both financially and environmentally. The use of juice industry wastes for biofuel production is very important in terms of potential alternative renewable energy sources (bioethanol, biogas, and biodiesel). In this study, the theoretical biofuel quantities that can be produced from the waste potential generated during the production activities in a food industry (fruit juice) operating in Turkey are calculated. About 127 t of bioethanol can be obtained from these wastes. Using wastes as alternative biofuel is beneficial in terms of lawfully reducing sources of wastes and reducing wastewater burden on biological treatment plants. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The thermal cracking of waste cooking oil (WCO) via pyrolysis was performed using a laboratory scale fixed-bed reactor. The effects of the final pyrolysis temperature (from 550 °C to 800 °C) and the heating rate (5 °C/min, 15 °C/min, 20 °C/min, 25 °C/min) on pyrolysis products distribution has been investigated and a maximum bio-oil yield of 80 wt% has been obtained at 800 °C and 15 °C/min. The bio-oil fuel properties shows that this pyrolytic oil has high caloric value (HHV around 8843 kg/Kcal) promoting its use as a liquid fuel but some other properties (high acidity index around 126.8 mg KOH/g sample and high viscosity about 8.95 cSt) need to be upgraded. The GC/MS characterization of the bio-oil highlights its high molecular complexity allowing it to be used as source of chemical products and of active molecules. The syngas heating value (reaching 8 MJ/kg) is suitable for its application as source of energy for the pyrolysis reactor. The remaining biochar is suitable for application as fertilizer since it is rich of iron and organic carbon. The stochiometric model of WCO pyrolysis has been established basing on the pyrolysis products yields, the CHNS-O composition of raw material and remaining biochar, and the syngas chemical composition. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Using food waste hydrolysate as medium for culturing oleaginous microorganism is a dual-purpose strategy for relieving environmental burdens both in food waste disposal and energy crisis. The pure culture of one oleaginous microorganism when single waste as culture media has shortages such as high operation cost, low lipid production and low substrate utilization. Mix-culture of yeast and microalgae in this work enhanced this process result in better waste treatment, higher lipid production and shorter cultivation time. Compare to pure culture of Rhodosporidium toruloides, the nitrogen utilization rate, reducing sugar utilization rate and lipid production increased by 23%, 17% and 12%, respectively, and the cultivation time shorten by 40%, in mix-culture of Rhodosporidium toruloides and Chlorella vulgaris. The results showed that the mix-culture of yeast and microalgae using food waste hydrolysate as culture medium would be a good strategy for both waste disposal and biofuel production. © 2018

AB  - In this study, a method for assessing the costs of biodiesel production from waste frying oils in Beirut, Lebanon, was investigated with the aim of developing an economic evaluation of this alternative. A hundred restaurant and hotel enterprises in Beirut were surveyed for promoting them in participating in the biodiesel supply chain, and for data collection on waste frying oils generation, disposal methods and frequency, and acquisition cost. Also, waste frying oils were collected and converted into biodiesel using a one-step base catalyzed transesterification process. Physicochemical characteristics of the produced biodiesel were conforming to international standards. Data produced from laboratory scale conversion of waste frying oils to biodiesel, as well as data collected from the only biodiesel plant in Lebanon was used to determine the production cost of biodiesel. Geographic Information System was used to propose a real-time vehicle routing model to establish the logistics costs associated with waste frying oils collection. Comparing scenarios of the configuration collection network of waste frying oils, and using medium-duty commercial vehicles for collection, a logistics cost of US$/L 0.08 was optimally reached. For the calculation of the total cost of biodiesel production, the minimum, average, and maximum values for the non-fixed cost variables were considered emerging 81 scenarios for possible biodiesel costs. These were compared with information on the commercialization of diesel in Lebanon for the years 2011 through 2017. Although competitive with petroleum diesel for years 2011 to 2014, the total biodiesel cost presented less tolerance to declining diesel prices in the recent years. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the acquisition cost of waste frying oils is the key factor affecting the overall cost of biodiesel production. The results of this study validate the economic feasibility of waste frying oils' biodiesel production in the studied urban area upon enforcement of low waste frying oils' acquisition costs, and can help spur food service enterprises to become suppliers of biodiesel production feedstock and support a healthy development of the biodiesel industry in Lebanon. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The green algae Botryococcus braunii produces a high amount of extracellular hydrocarbon, making it a promising algae in the field of bio-fuels production. As it mainly produces squalene like hydrocarbons, cosmetic industries are also interested in its milking. Pulsed electric fields (PEF) are an innovative method allowing oil extraction from micro-algae. In common algae accumulating hydrocarbon inside cytoplasm (Chlorella vulgaris, Nannochloropsis sp., etc), electric fields can destroy cell membranes, allowing the release of hydrocarbon. However, for B.braunii, hydrocarbons adhere to the cell wall outside of cells as a matrix. In a previous article we reported that electric fields can unstick cells from a matrix, allowing hydrocarbon harvesting. In this work, we deeper investigated this phenomenon of cell hatching by following 2 parameters: the conductivity of the medium and the cultivation duration of the culture. Cell hatching is accurately evaluated by both microscopic and macroscopic observations. For high conductivity and a short time of cultivation, almost no effect is observed even after up to 1000 PEF pulses are submitted to the cells. While lower conductivity and a longer cultivation period allow strong cell hatching after 200 PEF pulses are applied to the cells. We identify 2 new crucial parameters, able to turn the method from inefficient to very efficient. It might help companies to save energy and money in case of mass production. © 2018

AB  - Utilization of waste resources to cultivate microalgae for biofuel production has the potential to improve the economics along with sustainable reuse of discarded nitrogen and phosphorous sources. The present investigation aims to cultivate an oleaginous microalga (Chlorella minutissima) in stagnant non-potable pond (SNP) water collected from different seasons (summer, winter and rainy) for biomass and lipid synthesis. The C. minutissima showed enhanced biomass productivity (245 mg/L/d) and lipid content (47 %) when grown in SNP water as compared to basal media, synthetic wastewater and recycled media respectively. The adaption in the SNP media by C. minutissima was attributed to an increase in cell size (∼2 folds) with decrease in total protein content (∼2 folds) and total carbohydrate content (∼1 fold) respectively. The fatty acid profile indicated the presence of C16:0, C16:2, C18:0, C18:1 and C18:2 as major methyl esters in the derived biodiesel. Further, the measured biodiesel properties such as specific density (0.90 g/cm3), kinematic viscosity (3.24 mm2/s), flash point (143 °C), iodine value (40.14 g I2/100 g) and acid value (3.24 mgKOH/g) abided by the ASTM D6751-02 and EN14214 standards. Therefore, such kind of SNP's have dual advantage; microalgal cultivation for biodiesel production and providing economical solution for bioremediation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study was devoted to an exergetically investigation and optimization of the operating conditions of an easy-to-scale-up continuous reactor applied for solketalacetin synthesis as a green fuel additive from glycerol-derived monoacetin in the presence of Purolite PD 206 catalyst. The process consisted of two steps, i.e., monoacetin synthesis by glycerol esterification with acetic acid followed by solketalacetin synthesis through reaction of the produced monoacetin with acetone. The main goal of this research was to assess the effects of reaction temperature (20–80 °C), acetone to monoacetin molar ratio (1–5), catalyst loading (0.5–2.5 g), feed flow rate (0.2–1 mL/min), and pressure (0–120 bar) on the exergetic performance parameters of the second stage of the process. Response surface methodology (RSM) was also used to optimize the operating conditions of the reactor by maximizing functional exergetic efficiency (FEE) and minimizing normalized exergy destruction (NED), simultaneously. Overall, feed flow rate had the highest impact on the exergetic performance parameters of the reactor while these indicators were not significantly influenced by pressure. RSM successfully modeled both exergetic parameters with an R2 higher than 0.99. Reaction temperature of 30.8 °C, acetone to monoacetin molar ratio of 2.7, catalyst loading of 1.6 g, feed flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, and pressure of 14.5 bar yielding FEE of 20.39% and NED of 0.90 were determined as the best operating conditions of the reactor. According to the results archived, process yield alone could not stand as the primary objective for making decisions on the optimal operating conditions of the chemical reactors, further highlighting the significance of taking energetic parameters into account in parallel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The current experimental study is an effort to reduce the engine out emissions from compression ignition (CI) engines powered by a combination of renewable liquid and gaseous fuels. Hydrogen (H2) is a clean burning fuel and seems a very popular gaseous fuel for CI engine applications as it can replace large amount of liquid-injected pilot fuels in dual fuel (DF) engines. The study investigates the effect of hydrogen fuel flow rate (HFFR) along with honge biodiesel (BHO) or cotton seed biodiesel (BCO), fuel injection timing (IT) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on engine performance, engine out emissions and combustion of a DF engine. In the first part the maximum possible HFFR was obtained for smooth operation of DF engine. In the second part the liquid fuel IT for better brake thermal efficiency (BTE) was obtained. In the third part the effect of EGR on the performance of DF engine was studied. The study showed that the maximum possible HFFR was 0.22 kg/h with a knock free operation. The fuel IT of 27° before top dead center (bTDC) at a fuel injection pressure (IP) of 240 bar yielded better results. When EGR of 15% was inducted, 23–24% lower BTE, 22–28% higher smoke, 38–40% higher hydrocarbon (HC), 31–38% higher carbon monoxide (CO) were noticed with biodiesel fuels (BDFs) at optimum operating conditions for 80% load. But the oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions from the engine decreased by 26–28% with BDFs at optimum operating conditions for 80% load as compared to the CI mode. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Polyoxymethylene dimethyl ethers (PODEn) are an excellent biofuel with no C–C bond and substantial soot-reduction potential. The effects of BMEPs on the characteristics of combustion performance and emissions in a four-cylinder direct injection diesel engine with n-butanol/diesel/PODE3–4 blends were investigated. Mechanism of the PODE blends on soot reduction is discussed. The experimental results indicate that upon adding PODE3–4 to the blend of n-butanol with diesel can improve the thermal efficiency and combustion efficiency with an increment in the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC). As the BMEP increased, a decreasing trend was observed in the emissions of soot, CO, and THC, while increasing NOx formation. Under a BMEP of 1.2 MPa, the soot emissions from the combustion of BD20, BDP10, and BDP20 reduced by 61.5%, 80.7, and 91.1%, respectively, compared to that from pure diesel. Under equal BMEP value, adding PODE3–4 to n-butanol/diesel blend reduced the soot, CO and THC emissions, and the lowest soot and THC emissions were found for BDP20, followed by BDP10, BD20, and D100. The number concentration of the accumulated particulate matter as well as the mass concentration of total particulate matters can be decreased by adding PODE3–4. The chemical kinetics simulation results reveal that C–O bonds break and CH2O is first produced in the pyrolysis of PODEn; as the value of n increases, more CH2O is produced and further oxidized to form HCO, which is finally transformed into CO and CO2, avoiding the production of soot precursors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Process design and techno-economic analysis of a pilot bio-jet fuel production facility were investigated using Aspen plus software and net present value method (NPV). This process include two-step hydrothermal decomposition of corncob to furfural (steam stripping of hemicellulose) and Levulinic acid (LA, acidic hydrolysis of cellulose), oxygenated precursor production via aldol condensation reaction of furfural and LA, and the subsequent hydro-processing for oxygen removal. Lab experiments on the major area of the process were carried out. The yields of furfural, LA, oxygenated precursor and bio-jet fuel-range hydrocarbons (C8–C15) were 59.5% (based on hemicellulose), 34.4% (based on cellulose), 75% (based on furfural and LA input) and 51 wt% (based on precursor) respectively. These values were used as the input information for the process simulation of a first-of-a-kind pilot facility for 1.3 ML/a bio-jet fuel production using this pioneering technology. The mass and energy analysis from Aspen plus model shows that the bio-jet fuel yield was 0.125 tonne/tonne dried corncob. 31.0% of carbon atoms and 47.6% of potential energy from carbohydrate compounds of corncob leave as bio-jet fuel. The estimated consumption of water, steam and electricity is relatively high of 12.3 kg, 63.7 kg and 1.22 KW h respectively due to small simulation scale and lack of process optimization. The total capital cost was ca. $3.96 MM for the 1.3 ML/a facility, of which 28% of equipment investment is spent for oxygenated precursor production. The total operation expense (OPEX) is $1.18/L bio-jet fuel, including variable and fixed costs. Expenses on corncob, catalytic catalyst and H2 contribute 23%, 19% and 16% respectively. Single point sensitivity analysis of the major breakdown of OPEX shows that catalyst lifetime is the priority factor. Economy of scale of minimum selling price of bio-jet fuel (MSPB) for different capacity facilities (1.3 ML/a, 6.5 ML/a and 13 ML/a) was investigated using different discount and tax rates, of which the lowest MSPB was $0.74/L with a subsidy of $0.31/L at 10% discount rate. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: Microalgae have a high potential as a feedstock for the production of biofuels, either indirectly, through the extraction of lipids, which can be transformed into biodiesel, or directly via whole cell conversion using hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Both approaches have disadvantages, due to the high cost of cultivating microalgae with sufficient lipid content (>40%), while the whole cell conversion produces low quality oils, which require significant further upgrading. This work investigated the possibility of realising the benefits of both processes, by studying the liquefaction reaction of a lipid-extracted algae hydrolysate. Methods: In order to enhance oil yields, the reaction was conducted in the presence of varying loadings of iso-propyl alcohol (IPA) and applied two waste steel furnace residues as potential liquefaction catalysts. Results: Primarily, The lipid extraction process needs to be optimized to reduce the amount of acid contaminant within the liquefaction medium. For the HTL process, the addition of 50 vol% IPA resulted in remarkably high oil yields of up to 60.2 wt% on an organic basis, whereas the two furnace residues had no positive effect on the product distribution, and instead favoured the formation of solid reaction products. Nevertheless, the results suggested that the presence of iron potentially reduced the nitrogen and oxygen content of the bio-oil. Conclusions: As such, HTL is a suitable method for valorising lipid-extracted algal biomass, where the bio-oil yields can be enhanced substantially by using IPA in conjunction with the water. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - In this study, highly upgraded bio-oil was produced by microwave–metal interaction pyrolysis of water hyacinth biomass. A copper coil was used as a microwave receiver and heat generating antenna. The pyrolysis of biomass was carried out with and without using a cement catalyst. The fractional amounts of the as-produced bio-oil, biogas, and biochar were determined in terms of catalyst mass, reaction time, and the gauge of the copper coil antenna. In cement catalyzed pyrolysis, the water hyacinth was converted into 20% bio-oil and 31% combustible gases with overall conversion efficiency of 66%. In the case of uncatalyzed pyrolysis, the overall conversion efficiency remained below 60% with 10% bio-oil. The biomass to catalyst ratio of 5:1, 25 min of reaction time and 2.5 mm gauge of wire were predicted as optimum conditions for the pyrolysis process. The bio-oil was further analyzed through chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) while the gaseous products were analyzed through chemical testing and combustibility analysis. Significant difference in the chemical composition of the bio-oils, produced using catalytic and noncatalytic microwave–metal interaction pyrolysis, was noticed in these investigations. The oil product of the catalyzed and uncatalyzed pyrolysis contained 11.6% and 9.418% hydrocarbons, respectively. Similarly, oxygen content in the oil was measured about 14.73% and 16.66%, respectively. Also, unlike the thermal or thermo-catalytic pyrolysis, the bio-oil product of the microwave–metal interaction pyrolysis was found immiscible with water. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Buildings account for one third of the world's energy consumption, 70% of which is devoted to heating and cooling. To increase the share of renewables in the energy consumption of buildings, it is necessary to research and promote new sources of green energy. World production of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) was 47.34 million tons in 2016, with a harvested area of 26.20 million hectares, and the main producing countries being Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and Argentina, which produce about half of world production of sunflower seed. The sunflower husk, which represents a percentage by weight of 45%-60% of the seed depending on the sunflower variety, is widely used for the production of feed; however, its energy use is very scarce. The objectives of this study were to analyse the energy properties of sunflower husk as a solid biofuel and to carry out an energy, environmental, economic and operational analysis of a thermal installation fed with this by-product of the sunflower oil industry. The results show that this agro-industrial waste has a Higher Heating Value (HHV) of 17.844 MJ/kg, similar to that of other solid biofuels currently used. In addition, replacing a 430 kW fuel oil boiler with a biomass boiler of the same capacity fed by this biofuel can avoid the emission of 254.09 tons of CO2 per year, as well as obtain an annual energy saving of 75.47%. If we consider the production of sunflower seeds in each country and the sunflower husk were used as biofuel, this would result in a CO2 saving of more than 10 per thousand of the total emissions emitted. The results of this work contribute to the standardization of this by-product as a solid biofuel for thermal energy generation due to its potential to reduce CO2 emissions and increase energy efficiency. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Biodiesel production by performing the oleic acid esterification reaction in a new reactor system, realized by coupling the batch reactor with a tubular permeoselective membrane, has been investigated. Such reactor configuration was adopted to remove the water produced as by-product during the reaction thus increasing the oleic acid conversion and the alkyl ester production. The activity of acid catalysts and zeolites was evaluated in presence of methanol and ethanol. The membrane resulted much more selective towards water separation when ethanol was used, allowing to force thermodynamic equilibrium at higher conversion values. Very interesting results in terms of oleic acid conversion were achieved with both methanol and ethanol (96% and 98% respectively) in presence of a commercial Amberlyst-15 catalyst, at 80 °C, at a low membrane surface to gas volume ratio (0.20 cm−1) and low acid/alcohol molar ratio (2/1 and 1/1 respectively). Over zeolite samples, conversion values higher than 60% were obtained at 100 °C after 5 h in the esterification reaction performed in vapor permeation configuration. © 2018

AB  - Vapor-liquid equilibrium data of fuel mixtures are of major importance for both fuel production as well as combustion. However, the measurement of vapor-liquid equilibrium data usually requires significant experimental effort. The experimental effort is particularly high if multicomponent mixtures are of interest, as experimental effort rises strongly with a rising number of components. In this work, we efficiently characterize the vapor-liquid equilibrium of a quaternary model biofuel and its binary subsystems. For this purpose, we employ the recently developed milliliter-scale Raman Spectroscopic Phase Equilibrium Characterization (RAMSPEQU)-setup. Vapor pressures are collected at T = 283–333 K, and isothermal pTx-data for mixtures at T = 303.2 K resulting in a pressure range of p = 2.8–81.9 kPa. The PCP-SAFT equation of state is used for thermodynamic modeling. Our binary data agrees well with experimental data from literature. The quaternary phase behavior is predicted with very good accuracy using PCP-SAFT with parameters adjusted to pure substance and binary mixture data only. The milliliter-scale setup allows us to characterize the phase equilibria with just 22 ml (binary) and less than 105 ml (quaternary) of the respective mixtures. The agreement of predicted and experimental quaternary phase equilibrium data indicate the reliability of the employed method for multicomponent vapor-liquid equilibrium measurements. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biomass-derived fuels are emerging alternatives to fossil fuels because of their renewability and better carbon balance. Fuel researchers from Zhejiang University have developed and improved a catalytic method of converting rice husk to biofuels mainly composed of ethanol, ethyl acetate, and acetone. Optimization of the catalytic production process so that the final fuel has good combustion characteristics is something that requires detailed investigation. This study evaluates the laminar burning features of two fuels produced by the catalytic reaction. These two fuels are ETEAAC211 and ETEAAC121 (ETEAAC211, 50 vol % ethanol, 25 vol % ethyl acetate, and 25 vol % acetone; ETEAAC121, 25 vol % ethanol, 50 vol % ethyl acetate, and 25 vol % acetone). The experiment was conducted in outward propagating spherical flames at T0 of 358 K, P0 of 0.1 MPa, and equivalence ratios (φ) of 0.7-1.4. Moreover, the flame intrinsic hydrodynamic and thermal diffusion instabilities are assessed and discussed. It was noticed that the peak laminar burning velocity of the fuels occurred at φ of 1.1. The hydrodynamic instability reached its peak at φ of 1.1 as a result of the thin flame thickness and the high density ratio of burned/unburned mixtures. The Markstein length decreased with the equivalence ratio. However, the Markstein length decreased below zero at φ of 1.4 for ethyl acetate and ETEAAC121, showing the increased thermal diffusion instability as the equivalence ratio increases. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The stability of biofuels toward oxidation is currently one of the major challenges for its widespread use. In fact, insoluble deposits issued from biofuels degradation can cause several types of damages with the blockage of injectors, filters, and lines in contact with the fuel, seriously compromising the operation of the engines and aircraft turbines. The aim of this work was to characterize a surrogate biofuel (90% n-dodecane and 10% methyl oleate) under different oxidation conditions (110, 130, and 150 °C, and ranging from 0 to 5 h) under constant oxygen pressure, in order to follow nucleation and growth mechanisms of primary insoluble deposits precursors. Therefore, advanced scattering techniques were implemented, such as small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS), in addition to more conventional molecular characterization approaches based on gas chromatography. Epoxides and ketones were produced through oxidation at different rates depending on temperature, thus highlighting different kinetic phases. Scattering techniques allowed us to observe aggregates in fatty acid mono-alkyl esters oxidized products for the first time, with a number of aggregations ranging from 1 in mild conditions up to ∼25 in severe conditions. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The production of biofuels from renewable biomass resources is an attractive way to mitigate CO2 emissions and alleviate the shortage of fossil fuels. A novel green one-pot synthesis of biodiesel from Ricinus communis seeds by basic heterogeneous catalysis is reported in this work. The direct transesterification (one-step process) of the seeds with methanol in the presence of homogeneous (HCl and NaOH) or heterogeneous (Na2ZrO3) catalysts was evaluated. Additionally, the comparison of the conventional (two-step process) transesterification against the direct transesterification reaction was analysed. The conventional transesterification of Ricinus communis oil with acidic (HCl/CH3OH, 5% v/v) and basic (NaOH/CH3OH, 5% w/w) homogeneous catalysts showed conversions of the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) &gt; 97% at 6 h and 3 h, respectively. Moreover, direct transesterification was carried out using a basic Na2ZrO3 catalyst. The maximum FAME yield was 99.99% at 4 h of reaction time and 5 wt % catalyst. Finally, Green Metrics Parameters of biodiesel showed that heterogeneous direct transesterification resulted in a seven times greener synthesis compared to conventional process. This novel heterogeneous one-step process is almost ten times less hazardous than the conventional process and five times less harmful than the homogeneous one-step reaction. No n-hexane is required for oil extraction. Thus, methanol as a reactant and as a solvent increased the greenness of the heterogeneous process, and the resulting biodiesel shows good purity and composition. In addition, no water is required to purify the biodiesel. According to these results, heterogeneous direct transesterification is a promising alternative for more sustainable, cleaner and efficient biodiesel production that is crucial to developing new technologies (by chemo-selectivity). © 2018

AB  - In connection with the threating environmental pollution and stringent emission norms, the present experimental research studies the effect of utilizing cerium oxide nanoparticle mixed with an emulsion of nerium oleander biofuel (ENOB) on a compression ignition (CI) direct injection (DI) diesel engine. The whole probe was persuaded using a mono-cylinder 4-stroke direct injection CI engine. A novel nerium olender biofuel was extracted and esterified. Later it was converted into the emulsion of nerium oleander biofuel, that ensued in diluted oxides of nitrogen and in reduced smoke opacity emission. However it produced a marginal penalty of CO and HC emission when equated with neat nerium oleander biofuel. Subsequently, the nano particle blended emulsion of nerium oleander biofuel depicted dramatic diminution in CO, smoke opacity, HC, and NOx emission when equated with standard fossil diesel, neat nerium oleander biofuel and an emulsion of nerium oleander biofuel at various power outputs. It was concluded that the nano emulsion of nerium oleander biofuel could be used in direct injection, compression ignition engines without any hardware alterations in the engine. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Butanol has been regarded as an important bulk chemical and advanced biofuel; however, large scaling butanol production by solventogenic Clostridium sp. is still not economically feasible due to the high cost of substrates, low butanol titer and yield caused by the toxicity of butanol and formation of by-products. Renewed interests in biobutanol as biofuel and rapid development in genetic tools have spurred technological advances to strain modifications. Comprehensive reviews regarding these aspects have been reported elsewhere in detail. Meanwhile, more wild type butanol producers with unique properties were also isolated and characterized. However, few reviews addressed these discoveries of novel wild type solventogenic Clostridium sp. strains. Accordingly, this review aims to comprehensively summarize the most recent advances on wild type butanol producers in terms of fermentation patterns, substrate utilization et al. Future perspectives using these native ones as chassis for genetic modification were also discussed. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - This study aims to investigate the effect of durability on the regulated and unregulated emissions, as well as the power and fuel economy performance of a biodiesel-powered engine equipped with a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) and a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system based on a 500-h durability test. Furthermore, a BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) test was employed to analyze the specific surface area changes of the DOC and SCR. Results show that after the durability, the power performance improved and the brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) reduced due to the running-in effect. Although the deterioration of the DOC and SCR after the durability resulted in an increase in the carbon monoxide (CO), total hydrocarbon (THC) and nitrogen oxide (NOX) emission factors of the biodiesel-powered engine based on European steady state cycle (ESC) by 41.3%, 36.1% and 39.2%, respectively, these emissions were still below China-Ⅴ limits. For unregulated emissions, the reduced BSFC caused by the durability led to a decrease in the carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, but the durability resulted in higher aldehyde emission. The BET specific surface areas of the DOC and SCR decreased by 40.2% and 35.0%, respectively after the durability, which accounted for their catalytic performance deterioration. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - It is known that biodiesel and bioethanol are viable alternative fuels to replace diesel for compression ignition engines. In this study, an experimental investigation is carried out to evaluate the performance and exhaust emissions of a single cylinder diesel engine fuelled with biodiesel-bioethanol-diesel blends. The engine performance parameters evaluated are the brake speciﬁc fuel consumption and brake thermal efﬁciency whereas the exhaust emission parameters evaluated are carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and smoke opacity. Kernel-based extreme learning machine is used to predict the engine performance and exhaust emission parameters of the fuel blends at full throttle conditions. Based on the experimental results, the brake specific fuel consumption is lower while the brake thermal efficiency is higher for the biodiesel-bioethanol-diesel blends. The carbon monoxide emissions and smoke opacity are also lower for these fuel blends. The mean absolute percentage error of the brake specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and smoke opacity is 1.363, 1.482, 4.597, 2.224, and 2.090%, respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that K-ELM is a reliable method to estimate the engine performance and exhaust emission parameters of a single cylinder compression ignition engine fuelled with biodiesel-bioethanol-diesel blends to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lemon peel oil is one of the renewable and biodegradable biofuel for diesel engine applications due to its low viscous nature. This study aims to observe the performance and emission characteristics of a common rail direct injection diesel engine at various fuel injection strategies under different loading conditions. An open type electronic control unit is used to control the fuel injection timing, injection rate and split injection at various injection pressures. In this research work, 20% lemon peel oil-diesel blend (by volume) is injected at a pressure of 400 bar, 500 bar and 600 bar with 10% pilot injection by volume and the results are compared with diesel fuel at same injection conditions. Further, pilot injection quantity of lemon peel oil blend is varied by 20% and 30% of total volume of fuel injected at 600 bar injection pressure. Finally, the experimental work is carried out in common rail direct injection diesel engine fuelled with lemon peel oil blend under 10% cooled exhaust gas recirculation condition. The study reveals that the brake thermal efficiency is improved with increase in injection pressures and pilot injection rates. However, this trend has been changed during 10% EGR addition for lemon peel oil blend operation at 30% pilot injection rate. The combustion characteristics are improved for lemon peel oil blend for 600 bar injection pressure with 20% and 30% pilot injection rates compared to 10% pilot injection rate. The higher pilot injection rate has shown significant reductions in carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon and smoke emissions. However, the emission results are reversed with 10% exhaust gas recirculation at 600 bar injection pressure of lemon peel oil blend. There is a significant reduction in NOx emission for low injection pressure of lemon peel oil blend at 10% pilot injection rate. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) can chemically convert sewage sludge (SS) into a crude bio-oil (biocrude) and other by-products. This work systematically elucidates how the yields and compositions of different products (e.g., gases, biocrude and solids) vary with temperature (260–350 °C) in SS HTL with 10 min of residence time. The results show that increasing temperature improved the biocrude quality and the gas yield, declined the water-soluble substance yield, the solid yield, and the TOC (total organic carbon) content in aqueous phase, while the biocrude yield and the NH3-N (ammonia nitrogen) content in the aqueous phase first raised and then decreased, and reached the maximum values at 340 °C. After SS HTL at 340 °C, light biocrude, light solids, water-soluble organic matters accounted for about 54.4, 50.5, 88.9 wt% of total biocrude, solids and water-soluble substances, respectively. The N and S contents in the light biocrude almost halved compared with those in the heavy biocrude. The light solids contained a higher C content but lower Al, Si, Ca and Fe contents than did the heavy solids. &gt;93.0 wt% of Cu, Zn and Cr remained in the solids in contrast to 0.5–1.0 wt% in the aqueous phase and 0.2–4.7 wt% in the biocrude. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The environmental load of continuous bioenergy production from palm oil (Elaeis guineensis) included with a proposed 10 ha of microalgae production system were assessed to be implemented in Indonesia. Material and energy balances, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, nutrient requirement and also water scarcity during bioenergy production cycle were evaluated. The integrated system was developed for 60 tons h−1 of fresh fruit bunch (FFB) processing capacity of a conventional mill. Aggregate of energy-profit ratio from the proposed system was 5.20, which indicates a positive balance. The total water footprint for each palm oil and microalgae cultivation was 3.18 and 2.85 m3 kg−1 of biodiesel production, respectively. Microalgae mix-culture has the potential to treat organic compounds from palm oil mill effluent (POME) and combined with flue gases from biomass and biogas power plant as the alternative nutrient sources contributed to net-reduction of GHG emission for 158.8 tons ha−1 of microalgae culture, annually. The integrated system produced 26,471 tons of biodiesel that included 223 tons from microalgae and contribute to 39.90% of total GHG emission reduction from diesel fuel substitute. Additional co-product of 520.33 tons year−1 of animal feed from defatted biomass also possible to be produced and have potential for environmental benefits. © 2018

AB  - Hydrogenated Catalytic Biodiesel (HCB), with excellent volatility and cetane number while without contain oxygen and aromatic hydrocarbons, have great potential to improve engine performance and emission characteristics. In this study, the effect of HCB/Diesel blended fuels properties (by mass fraction of biodiesel in diesel) on spray combustion characteristics was investigated at inert and reacting conditions in a constant volume combustion chamber. Laser (532 nm) Mie-scattering, OH∗ chemiluminescence and high-temperature luminosity were used to capture the spray liquid length, flame lift-off length and ignition delay simultaneously with the help of two intensifier charge coupled device cameras and a high speed Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor camera. Encouraging results were obtained at different ambient conditions (temperatures, densities, oxygen concentration) and injection pressures. The results showed that fuels with high cetane number generate shorter ignition delay, and faster auto-ignition results in a shorter flame lift-off length. A new theory was used to interpret the effect of cetane number on lift-off length. Under reacting conditions, the combustion heat release shorten spray liquid length apparently as compared with the results under inert conditions. The liquid length was slightly affected by the injection pressure and oxygen concentrations under both reacting and inert conditions, while the flame lift-off length is significantly influenced by ambient parameters and injection pressure. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ([Bmim][HSO4]) was employed to catalyze the in-situ transesterification of wet Nannochloropsis oceanica. Algal cell wall was dissolved by [Bmim][HSO4] according to TEM analysis of untreated Nannochloropsis sp. cells and lipid extracted algae (LEA). The temperature and time are favorable to biodiesel production in 100–200 °C, time of 0–70 min, with methanol: algae, however, it decreased to 10.64% at time of 90 min. The biodiesel and energy production of [Bmim][HSO4] catalyzed in-situ transesterification varied due to the competition of catalytic property and algal dissolution ability with variation of water content. The catalytic property of [Bmim][HSO4] was the dominate parameter affecting biodiesel production, therefore, total energy production of in-situ transesterification, as a parameter of biodiesel production, was slightly increased from 13.12 kJ to 14.51KJ with water content of wet algae varied from 0 to 15 wt%. However, it decreased to 8.37 at water content of 20 wt% due to the weakened algal dissolution ability, which was proved by the decrease of hydrogen bond acceptor capacity(β) from 0.942858 to 0.942851 in water content of 0–30 wt%. The decomposition of carbohydrates and proteins in IL – water mixtures enhanced biodiesel production according to elemental analysis of LEA. © 2018

AB  - Membranes made from cellulose acetate grafted with imidazolium or ammonium ionic liquids (ILs) containing different anions were considered for ethyl tert-butyl ether biofuel purification by pervaporation. The new cellulosic materials were obtained after bromide (Br−) exchange by different anions (Tf2N−, BF4 −, AcO−). IL structure-membrane property relationships revealed that the membrane properties were strongly improved by varying the anion structure, molecular size and hydrogen bonding acceptor ability β in the Kamlet-Taft polarity scale. The grafted ammonium IL with AcO− anion combined the highest parameter β with big cation/anion sizes and finally led to the best membrane properties with a normalized pervaporation flux of 0.41 kg/h m2 (almost 20 times that of virgin cellulose acetate) for a reference thickness of 5 μm and a permeate ethanol content of 100%. Such properties thus corresponded to an outstanding separation factor at 50 °C. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A comprehensive comparison of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) to the pyrolysis of duckweed was conducted to determine the yields and components of the crude bio-oils and their distillates. The upgrading behaviors of the distillates were thoroughly investigated with the use of used engine oil as a solvent. With all other variables fixed, HTL produced crude bio-oil with a lower H/C ratio (1.28 ± 0.03) than pyrolysis did (1.45 ± 0.04). However, its distillates had a higher H/C ratio (1.60 ± 0.05) and total yield (66.1 ± 2.0 wt%) than pyrolysis (1.46 ± 0.04 and 47.2 ± 1.4 wt%, respectively). Phenolics and nitrogenous heterocycles constituted relatively major proportions of the two crude bio-oils and most of their distillates. Obvious differences in molecular composition between the two crude bio-oils and their distillates were ascribed to the distinct impacts of HTL and pyrolysis and were affected by the distillate temperature. Co-hydrotreating with used engine oil (UEO) provided the upgraded bio-oils much higher H/C ratios (~1.78 ± 0.05) and higher heating values (~45.5 ± 1.4 MJ·kg−1), as well as much lower contents of N, O and S compared to their initial distillates. Aromatics and alkanes constituted a large proportion in most of upgraded bio-oils. N removal from the pyrolysis distillates was easier than from the HTL distillates. Distinct differences in yields and molecular compositions for the upgraded bio-oils were also attributed to the different influences associated with the two conversion routes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work deals with the production of a high added value ether used as additive in aviation fuel. The ether was synthesized from the iso-amylenes present in the C5, the five-carbon isomer cuts in petroleum distillates and the iso-amyl alcohol found in the fusel oil of the alcohol industry. Qualitative analyses like mass spectrometry and nuclear proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed the formation and structure of the proposed semi-renewable ether, the high molecular weight di-amyl ether (DAE). Optimization of the reaction parameters resulted in a conversion of the 48%, molar fraction, iso-amylenes when using an adiabatic profile reactor. By using this ether production and purification process, the final product showed 98% w/w of purity. The synthesized di-amyl ether presented physicochemical properties similar to the commercial aviation kerosene. The physicochemical properties evaluation performed in the mixtures of di-amyl ether in aviation kerosene showed relevant improvements, such as reduction of the freezing point and increase of the oxidation reaction rate. The results showed this novel fuel has great potential to be used in gas propulsion turbines in commercial flights and is also strategic for military aircraft. © 2018

AB  - In this paper, we analyzed changing comovement relationship between prices of crude oil and food crops/food index using a detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA) approach proposed by Podobnik and Stanley (2008). In order to detect the changing nature of cross-correlation coefficient over time, we estimated the detrended cross-correlation coefficient on a rolling window and found that cross-correlations were negative before 2004 for most of the items but they increased considerably after the surge in crude oil price in 2007 that caused diversion of food grains for production of biofuels. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Using a six-cylinder turbocharged common rail compression ignition engine, this study investigated the effect of oxygenated fuels on transient and steady-state performance. This paper considers the effect of oxygenated fuels on both cold- and hot-start operation. A range of fuel oxygen contents between 0% and 13.57% was derived from diesel, waste cooking biodiesel and two other blends, containing triacetin as a fuel additive. A custom test was designed to investigate engine performance parameters using acceleration, load increase and steady-state modes of operation. For each fuel, the cold-start test was conducted after an overnight engine-off time. In this study, different parameters related to engine performance were studied, such as engine coolant and lubricant temperatures and their rise rate, boost pressure, injected fuel, turbocharger lag, engine speed and torque, start of injection, maximum in-cylinder pressure, maximum rate of pressure rise, cyclic variability, FMEP, mechanical and thermal efficiencies, and BSFC. In comparison with hot-start, the cold-start results indicated a higher injected fuel, indicated torque, maximum in-cylinder pressure, maximum rate of pressure rise, FMEP, BSFC and CoV of IMEP, and a lower SOI, ME and BTE. During cold-start, using oxygenated fuels, instead of diesel, resulted in a lower rate of lubricant temperature rise and a higher BSFC, while decreasing the FMEP. Using oxygenated fuels, instead of diesel, during the idle and transient modes resulted in lower indicated torque and maximum in-cylinder pressure under cold-start whilst, under hot-start, it resulted in higher indicated torque and maximum in-cylinder pressure, because during hot-start, the fuel oxygen is significantly influential in torque build-up during turbocharger lag. While, during cold-start there are some other influential factors. In addition, oxygenated fuels—compared to diesel—experienced higher CoV of IMEP during cold-start while, during hot-start, they had lower values. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) is a rapidly evolving social impact assessment tool that allows users to identify the social impacts of products along with their life cycles. In recent years, S-LCA methodologies have been increasingly applied to energy systems and resources with notable success yet with limited reliability and even less flexibility or geographic specificity. In response, this study develops a novel assessment tool, named the GreenZee model, to reflect the social impacts of products and their sustainability using local currency units. The model is developed through evaluating both qualitative and quantitative inputs that capture the perceived monetary value of social impacts. To demonstrate the operationalization of the model, we explore a hypothetical case study of the biodiesel industry in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada. Results indicate that biodiesel production in NL would have positive socio-cultural impacts, high cultural values, and would create employment opportunities for locals. Overall, the GreenZee model provides users with a relatively simple approach to translate a variety of qualitative and quantitative social impact inputs (as importance levels) into meaningful and understandable financial outputs (as strength levels). We argue that building and testing models such as the GreenZee are crucial to supporting more flexible approaches to life cycle assessments that need to address increasingly complex social categories, cultural values, and geographic specificity. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - In 2015, California established a mandate that requires on-road greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to be reduced by 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. We explore the feasibility of meeting this goal by large-scale commercialization of drop-in biofuels. Drop-in biofuels, although not clearly defined, are a class of fuels that can be produced from biomass and blended with either crude oil or finished fuels without requiring equipment retrofits. This article focuses on thermochemical routes at or near commercialization. We provide a bottom-up, spatially explicit cost analysis to evaluate whether California can meet its 2030 GHG reduction target with drop-in fuels alone. A takeaway from our analysis is that drop-in fuels, if their performance is consistent with small-scale and simulated results, can be viable low-carbon substitutes for gasoline and diesel. We find that California can meet, and even exceed, its 2030 GHG emissions target for on-road vehicles with drop-in biofuels alone, but this requires use of biomass resources located outside the state. Meeting the 40% reduction target in a cost-effective manner requires pyrolysis of herbaceous agricultural residues (96% of total fuel output) and the conversion of woody residues via methanol-to-gasoline (4%). This scale of production would require 58 million metric tons of biomass feedstock, or 20% of total available biomass residues in the United States. For comparison, California is responsible for 11% of transportation-related petroleum consumption in the US. The approximately 5 billion gallons (19 billion liters) per year of drop-in fuel would displace 30% of gasoline and 60% of diesel demand in California. If electricity offset credits are eliminated, the target can be met with a similar scale of production, but methanol-to-gasoline becomes the dominant route (>99%), biomass requirements increase by 33%, and average production costs increase by 20%. Following this policy pathway would increase national biofuel production by 30% relative to 2015 production levels. © 2018 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Catalytic etherification of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) with isobutene (IB) to a biodiesel additive, that is, 5-(tert-butoxymethyl)-furfural (tBMF), is studied on the Aquivion® perfluorosulfonic acid resin (PFSA) modified mesoporous silica (Aquivion®/m-SiO2) solid acid. Mesoporous silica, composed of amorphous silica-particle aggregates, is synthesized by the sol–gel method using the amphiphilic Aquivion® PFSA as both the acidic and the template reagent. The silica surface is then modified by the Aquivion® resin, leading to the hybrid Aquivion®/m-SiO2 solid acid bearing highly accessible sulfonic acid sites and adequate porous structure. The catalytic properties, including composition, thermal stability, acidity, porosity, and morphology, are characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, solid-state NMR spectroscopy, XPS, TGA/DTG, elemental analysis, potentiometric titration, N2 physisorption, SEM, and TEM. The influence of different reaction parameters, such as catalyst dosage, reaction time and temperature, reactants composition, and solvent, is investigated. The optimal Aquivion®/m-SiO2 catalyst (10 wt.-%), with an accessible acidity of 45 µmolH+ gcatal. –1 demonstrates 78 % conversion of HMF and 66 % yield of tBMF, in the presence of THF, after 3 h at 90 °C, whereas the yield of byproduct 5,5′-[oxy-bis(methylene)]bis-2-furfural (OBMF), generated by the oligomerization of HMF, is lowered to 4 %. The developed catalyst demonstrates good stability after regeneration for five consecutive cycles. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Crude rubber seed oil (CRSO) is a promising but currently underutilized biodiesel feedstock alternative, extracted by pressing the seeds of the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). Rubber trees are cultivated across more than 11.4 million hectares worldwide, mainly in Southeast Asia. Despite their suitability as a biodiesel feedstock source, rubber seeds are currently treated as waste in the monocultural plantation system. To date, no assessments have been performed to examine the potential impact of rubber seed-based biodiesel production on GHG emissions. This study analyses the global warming potential of rubber seed methyl ester (RSME) production in Southeast Asia. The functional unit used is 1 MJ of biodiesel. A sensitivity analysis assesses the influence of key parameters (e.g., rubber seed yield) on the GHG mitigation potential. A scenario analysis evaluates the effect of using RSME by-products for energy generation. In comparison to fossil diesel, RSME has a carbon mitigation potential of 67 g CO2.eq. MJ-1, based on allocation by mass. On the condition of compliance with international sustainability standards that call for deforestation-free value chains, the generation of RSME biodiesel on rubber tree plantations in Southeast Asia would have a total mitigation potential of around 2.8 million tonnes of CO2 eq. per year. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Furanic diethers are considered as one of potential biofuels or green solvents. 2,5-Bis(methoxymethyl)furan (BMMF), diether of 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) with methanol, is difficult to effectively synthesize in traditional homogeneous catalytic systems due to active groups of BHMF. In this case, HCl and AlCl3, representatives of Brønsted and Lewis acid, are separately employed to explore catalytic performance in BHMF etherification. We also demonstrated that Lewis and Brønsted acid not only synergistically catalyze the etherification but also take respectively charge of main and side reactions. Subsequently, the catalytic performance of ZSM-5 and modified ZSM-5 proved this conclusion. High yield and selectivity of BMMF catalyzed by 1.5%Sn-ZSM-5 was obtained, about 95%, which may be attributed to suitable Brønsted and Lewis acidity as well as pore structure. This suggests that synthesis of BMMF by using solid acid is possible in the future industrialization. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, we develop an alternative Fuel-based Oil and Gas inventory (FOG) of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from oil and gas production using publicly available fuel use records and emission factors reported in the literature. FOG is compared with the Environmental Protection Agency's 2014 National Emissions Inventory (NEI) and with new top-down estimates of NOx emissions derived from aircraft and ground-based field measurement campaigns. Compared to our top-down estimates derived in four oil and gas basins (Uinta, UT, Haynesville, TX/LA, Marcellus, PA, and Fayetteville, AR), the NEI overestimates NOx by over a factor of 2 in three out of four basins, while FOG is generally consistent with atmospheric observations. Challenges in estimating oil and gas engine activity, rather than uncertainties in NOx emission factors, may explain gaps between the NEI and top-down emission estimates. Lastly, we find a consistent relationship between reactive odd nitrogen species (NOy) and ambient methane (CH4) across basins with different geological characteristics and in different stages of production. Future work could leverage this relationship as an additional constraint on CH4 emissions from oil and gas basins. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This research work examined how biodiesel produced from frying oils affects the physicochemical properties of its mixtures with conventional heating oil. Through the characterization of biodiesel blends and heating oil, the purpose is to produce an improved heating oil that will meet the specifications of the existing legislation for heating oil, while positively contributing to reducing the production of pollutants. The percentage of biodiesel added to a conventional diesel fuel contributes to the reduction of the pollutants produced during combustion. The examined biodiesel is considered the residual product, which was produced at a factory in Cyprus, and was deemed unsuitable for export, because it does not meet the legal requirements. Using specific volumes of these mixtures, twelve parameters were determined in order to investigate the effect of the mixtures: kinematic viscosity, sulfur content, micro carbon residue (MCR), distillation curves, density, cloud point (CP), fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) content, heat of combustion, iodine value (IV), cetane index (CI) after distillation, oxidation stability, and cold filter plugging point (CFPP). A number of fuel properties including the kinematic viscosity, MCR, distillation temperature—up to 80% distillate—and density showed an increase as the percentage of FAMEs raised from 2.5 to 50%, while others showed a mixed behavior (e.g., IV, CP, CI, CFPP), and the rest an inverse trend (e.g., sulfur content, heat of combustion and oxidation stability). An efficient potential utilization of a residual domestic product is proposed, while the pollutants that accumulate on the urban atmospheres during the winter months, due to increased heating needs of homes and other public or private buildings, will be significantly reduced. © 2018 by the authors Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) was chosen for conversion of microalga to biocrude in this study. HTL route holds advantage as it eliminates time consuming and high cost processes like centrifugation, lipid extraction, esterification and transesterification reactions, washing, phase separations involved in making biofuel from microalgae. HTL of microalgae gives biocrude oil which can be used for heating applications or can be further upgraded and refined to make diesel, gasoline like fuels. In this study, microalga Chlorella Vulgaris was grown in 20 L of photobioreactors. 0.936 g/L biomass was obtained for microalgae. 250 mg/L ferric chloride was used to harvest microalgae biomass. Wet harvested biomass was sun dried and slurry with 16.6% solid content was used as feedstock for HTL reaction. Microalgae slurry was processed at 150 bar pressure and 283°C temperature for 45 minutes in Parr reactor. Biocrude oil obtained had calorific value of 30 MJ/kg. GCMS study of biocrude oil revealed hydrocarbons ranging between C7H10-C19H30. Lab scale experimental results were compared with model developed to simulate HTL. In lab scale experiments 30% biocrude oil was obtained while modelling results indicated 38.2% biocrude oil formation. Based on biochemical contents of microalga, model predicts biocrude and other product formation, such as organic compounds in aqueous phase. It also helps to understand formation of nitrogenous compounds. Based on lab scale HTL experiments a pilot plant scale up is proposed to study techno-economic viability of an integrated process including open-raceway ponds and a HTL process for making biocrude oil from microalga. © 2018, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - An experimental study was carried out on a large stationary compression ignition engine to evaluate the long-term compatibility and durability issues associated with the use of crude palm oil as fuel. Two different preheating temperatures (60 and 80 °C) were adopted to assess the potential improvements related to lower fuel viscosity. The results obtained, in terms of in-cylinder carbon deposits and engine wear, were compared with the results obtained using ordinary diesel fuel. For each fuel and preheating temperature, the engine was operated for 300 consecutive h, during which several engine lubricant samples were collected and analysed to determine soot and fuel contaminations, viscosity alterations, and the presence of different wear-related metals (measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy). At the end of each 300 h endurance test, the carbon deposits were scraped from engine cylinders and examined through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). It was found that the use of crude palm oil caused a remarkable increment of in-cylinder deposits formation compared with ordinary diesel. The lubricant analysis also revealed a faster viscosity degradation and consequent stronger engine wear, above all with the lower preheating temperature. The results obtained confirmed that continuous engine operation (i.e., without a complete lubricant change) should be carefully reduced when fuelling with crude palm oil. Moreover, the findings obtained herein confirmed the favourable impacts of fuel preheating at 80 °C compared to 60 °C, i.e., reduced carbon deposits by 27% and extended engine operation time by 30%. © 2018, Green Wave Publishing of Canada.

AB  - A sustainable chitosan (CS)-derived magnetic solid acid catalyst (CS-Fe3O4@SO3H) incorporated by Lewis and Bronsted acid sites was synthesized in an eco-friendly manner through the preloading of iron on CS and one-pot low-temperature carbonization/sulfonation. The carbonization/sulfonation of CS-Fe3O4 using p-Toluenesulfonic acid (p-TSA) at 140 oC resulted in the loss of ammonia in some extent and provided bifunctional sites on the catalyst. This heterogeneous catalyst was found to be highly selective for the conversion of xylose and arabinose to furfural (FF) and subsequent tri(furyl)methane (TFM) formation by the condensation with furan in the same reaction vessel without any purification. The outcome of optimization under different reaction parameters showed that only 20 wt.% of CS-Fe3O4@SO3H catalyst resulted in 81% TFM yield from xylose while arabinose gave a 70% TFM yield in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO):water with high selectivity. This green protocol provides an easy isolation of products and minimizes the formation of polymerized by-products. The catalyst can be readily recovered and efficiently reused for three consecutive catalytic cycles without any significant loss on product yields. © 2018, Green Wave Publishing of Canada.

AB  - The European Union aims to promote the use of biofuels. A very widespread alcohol-based biofuel is ethanol. The utilization of ethanol is common in spark ignition engines, but the use of ethanol in compression ignition engines is very problematic. A more suitable alcohol-based biofuel for compression ignition engines is butanol. This contribution deals with the effect of n-butanol as an admixture in diesel fuel on the pressure inside the combustion chamber during NRSC engine test. The results showed a decrease in maximum pressure by approx. 7% and in mean effective pressure by approx. 8.5% at 20% concentration of n-butanol in the fuel. When using the n-butanol–vegetable-oil–diesel fuel blend, it is possible to reduce the pressure decrease, while utilizing the cleansing properties of butanol. © 2018, VUC Praha, a.s..

AB  - Carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and industrial processes accounted for approximately 78% of the total increase in greenhouse gas emissions from 1970–2010. The economic advantages of reducing fossil fuel combustion and improving air quality, including a reduction in chronic diseases and their associated health care costs, and the economic opportunities associated with the development of alternative energy sources are undoubtedly one of the main initiatives to be defined by governments in the sphere of public health. The objective of this study is to estimate the impact of the addition of different levels of biodiesel to diesel for automotive use on public health, considering changes in the ambient concentration of fine particles. Considering the two most populous metropolitan areas in Brazil, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, for a period of 11 years (2015–2025), by increasing the percentage of biodiesel to 20% (B20), it is estimated that there would be 13,000 fewer deaths and a gain generated from the avoided lost productivity of more than US$ 816 million. A total of 28,000 hospitalizations through the public health system would be avoided, generating a cost savings of US$ 25 million. Against the backdrop of a lack of policies and initiatives to combat air pollution, the magnitude of the results points to the importance of such a study in guiding the decisions of government officials with regard to how a city intervention—the addition of biodiesel to improve air quality—will bring a consequent benefit in the area of health. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.

AB  - The use of palm oil and diesel blended with ethanol, known as a microemulsion biofuel, is gaining attention as an attractive renewable fuel for engines that may serve as a replacement for fossil-based fuels. The microemulsion biofuels can be formulated from the mixture of palm oil and diesel as the oil phase; ethanol as the polar phase; methyl oleate as the surfactant; alkanols as the cosurfactants. This study investigates the influence of the three cosurfactants on fuel consumption and exhaust gas emissions in a direct-injection (DI) diesel engine. The microemulsion biofuels along with neat diesel fuel, palm oil-diesel blends, and biodiesel-diesel blends were tested in a DI diesel engine at two engine loads without engine modification. The formulated microemulsion biofuels increased fuel consumption and gradually reduced the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions and exhaust gas temperature; however, there was no significant difference in their carbon monoxide (CO) emissions when compared to those of diesel. Varying the carbon chain length of the cosurfactant demonstrated that the octanol-microemulsion fuel emitted lower CO and NOx emissions than the butanol-and decanol-microemulsion fuels. Thus, the microemulsion biofuels demonstrated competitive advantages as potential fuels for diesel engines because they reduced exhaust emissions. © 2018 Korean Society of Environmental Engineers.

AB  - This study develops life cycle water footprints for the production of fuels and chemicals via thermochemical conversion of algae biomass. This study is based on two methods of feedstock production – ponds and photobioreactors (PBRs) – and four conversion pathways – fast pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), conventional gasification, and hydrothermal gasification (HTG). The results show the high fresh water requirement for algae production and the necessity to recycle harvested water or use alternative water sources. To produce 1 kg of algae through ponds, 1564 L of water are required. When PBRs are used, only 372 L water are required; however, the energy requirements for PBRs are about 30 times higher than for ponds. From a final product perspective, the pathway based on the gasification of algae biomass was the thermochemical conversion method that required the highest amount of water per MJ produced (mainly due to its low hydrogen yield), followed by fast pyrolysis and HTL. On the other hand, HTG has the lowest water footprint, mainly because the large amount of electricity generated as part of the process compensates for the electricity used by the system. Performance in all pathways can be improved through recycling channels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is playing an important role in transport sector as a substitute for petroleum fuels. The present study diagnoses the use of phenolic biofuel blends namely, cardanol at higher fuel injection pressure on the performance and exhaust emissions of a direct injection, 4-stroke, single cylinder compression ignition engine. In this study, biofuel blends used with three different percentage composition of cardanol such as B10M10, B20M10 and B30M10. The results are compared with base line diesel operation at 180 bar standard injection pressure. The experimental results show better engine performance and exhaust emission characteristics for the biofuel blends at 220 bar injection pressure. Biofuel blend B20M10 gives better performance and emission results when compared to B30M10, and there is not much difference in the results when compared to B10M10. B20M10 blend gives slightly lower brake thermal efficiency (BTE), sharp reduction in carbon monoxide (CO), unburnt hydrocarbon (HC) and smoke emissions and drastic increase in oxides of nitrogen emissions (NOx), when compared to baseline diesel operation. ©, Copyright Association of Energy Engineers (AEE).

AB  - In 2015, the Worldatlas recorded 50 countries whose source of income is fossil fuel and its derivatives. Surprisingly, these countries solely depend on this source of energy up to 100% (Omar, Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia) because of technology improvement. It's so sadden that apart from its adverse effect on the economics of the countries, fossil fuels harmful effects on the universe cannot be overlooked. Meanwhile, the use of renewable energy as a replacement for fossil fuel and its derivatives are faced by the high oil price, high cost of investment for alternative energy, and unfathomed electricity prices. This research work evaluates desirability of making use of alternative source of energy sources by making use of biomass oil over the use of fossil fuel and its derivatives for electricity generation. Lucky nut is an agricultural non edible seed that was employed as raw material for biofuel production. The non-edible oil was extracted from the seeds and the oil was further converted to Lucky nut biofuel via a heterogeneous based catalyst produced from calcinated pearl spar. For modelling and optimization, design expert coupled with genetic algorithms were used to generate experimental designs so as to correlate the variable factors considered for production. The extraction of Lucky nut seed revealed the optimum production yield of 50.80% (v/v) and the oil is highly unsaturated. Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectrophotometer analyses and scanning electron microscope (SEM) of the calcined catalyst obtained from pearl spar showed the major component found in the pearl spar was K with relative abundance of 58.48%, which favoured the yield of Lucky nut biodiesel (91.00% (v/v)). Based on predicted values, the optimum validated Lucky nut biodiesel by RSMED and ANNED were 89.68% (v/v) and 92.87% (v/v), respectively. Produced properties of biofuel conformed to the biofuel standard. The study concluded that Lucky nut seed is a good source of oil, and its transformation to alternative fuel via a using calcined catalyst proved its fitness as a replacement for fossil fuel. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - In this work, we present mixed integer linear programming methods for the synthesis of processes that involve complex reaction networks. Specifically, we consider the modeling of reactors and interconnecting streams in systems where the composition of the reactor inlet streams can vary substantially, thereby making the determination of the limiting component as well as the calculation of the stream heating/cooling and power requirements challenging. First, towards the modeling of reactors, we develop an extent-based method which detects the limiting reactant of each reaction occurring in parallel with others, based on the inlet flows of the reactants. Second, we develop a computationally tractable method for the calculation of the work and heating/cooling duty needed to condition any stream of a process based on simple calculations that can be performed offline. Finally, we present how the two aforementioned components can be integrated in an optimization model generated based on a process superstructure. We demonstrate the application of the developed methods for the synthesis of a biorefinery. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Liquid fuels sourced from fossil sources are the dominant energy form for mobile transport today. The consumption of fossil fuels is still increasing, resulting in a continued search for more sustainable methods to renew our supply of liquid fuel. Photosynthetic microorganisms naturally accumulate hydrocarbons that could serve as a replacement for fossil fuel, however productivities remain low. We report successful introduction of five synthetic metabolic pathways in two green cell factories, prokaryotic cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae. Heterologous thioesterase expression enabled high-yield conversion of native fatty acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) into free fatty acids (FFA) in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 but not in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii where the polar lipid fraction instead was enhanced. Despite no increase in measurable FFA in Chlamydomonas, genetic recoding and over-production of the native fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP) resulted in increased accumulation of 7-heptadecene. Implementation of a carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) and aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (ADO) dependent synthetic pathway in Synechocystis resulted in the accumulation of fatty alcohols and a decrease in the native saturated alkanes. In contrast, the replacement of CAR and ADO with Pseudomonas mendocina UndB (so named as it is responsible for 1-undecene biosynthesis in Pseudomonas) or Chlorella variabilis FAP resulted in high-yield conversion of thioesterase-liberated FFAs into corresponding alkenes and alkanes, respectively. At best, the engineering resulted in an increase in hydrocarbon accumulation of 8- (from 1 to 8.5 mg/g cell dry weight) and 19-fold (from 4 to 77 mg/g cell dry weight) for Chlamydomonas and Synechocystis, respectively. In conclusion, reconstitution of the eukaryotic algae pathway in the prokaryotic cyanobacteria host generated the most effective system, highlighting opportunities for mix-and-match synthetic metabolism. These studies describe functioning synthetic metabolic pathways for hydrocarbon fuel synthesis in photosynthetic microorganisms for the first time, moving us closer to the commercial implementation of photobiocatalytic systems that directly convert CO 2 into infrastructure-compatible fuels. © 2018 International Metabolic Engineering Society

AB  - In thisstudy, catalytic effect of intrinsic inorganics was evaluated by comparing pyrolysis end products obtained from pyrolysis of olive pomace (OP) in three different initial weights (30,100 and 200 g). Pyrolysis of OP with higher weights led to self-catalyzing pyrolysis resulting in approximately 20% bio-oil quantity increment when pyrolyzed OP weight increased from 30 g to 200 g. Additionally, both intrinsic inorganic percentages remained in pyrolysis chars and organic compounds in pyrolysis liquids altered with pyrolyzed OP weights. While the lowest inorganic percentage in chars was found at the pyrolysis of the highest OP weight, the highest belonged to 30 g OP pyrolysis. Moreover, while oxygenated compounds, namely aldehydes and ketones, in pyrolysis bio-oil decreased explicitly at 200 g OP pyrolysis, variety in alkane and alkene compounds enhanced at higher weights OP pyrolysis. Finally, the effects of temperature, heating rate and retention time on pyrolysis products were evaluated. Results showed that liquid products increased at 5 °C/min heating rate and decreased at 1 °C/min heating rate as pyrolysis temperature increased from 450 to 600 °C in the pyrolysis without retention time.

AB  - This study presents supply scenarios of nonfood renewable jet fuel (RJF) in the European Union (EU) toward 2030, based on the anticipated regulatory context, availability of biomass and conversion technologies, and competing biomass demand from other sectors (i.e., transport, heat, power, and chemicals). A cost optimization model was used to identify preconditions for increased RJF production and the associated emission reductions, costs, and impact on competing sectors. Model scenarios show nonfood RJF supply could increase from 1 PJ in 2021 to 165–261 PJ/year (3.8–6.1 million tonne (Mt)/year) by 2030, provided advanced biofuel technologies are developed and adequate (policy) incentives are present. This supply corresponds to 6%–9% of jet fuel consumption and 28%–41% of total nonfood biofuel consumption in the EU. These results are driven by proposed policy incentives and a relatively high fossil jet fuel price compared to other fossil fuels. RJF reduces aviation-related combustion emission by 12–19 Mt/year CO2-eq by 2030, offsetting 53%–84% of projected emission growth of the sector in the EU relative to 2020. Increased RJF supply mainly affects nonfood biofuel use in road transport, which remained relatively constant during 2021–2030. The cost differential of RJF relative to fossil jet fuel declines from 40 €/GJ (1,740 €/t) in 2021 to 7–13 €/GJ (280–540 €/t) in 2030, because of the introduction of advanced biofuel technologies, technological learning, increased fossil jet fuel prices, and reduced feedstock costs. The cumulative additional costs of RJF equal €7.7–11 billion over 2021–2030 or €1.0–1.4 per departing passenger (intra-EU) when allocated to the aviation sector. By 2030, 109–213 PJ/year (2.5–4.9 Mt/year) RJF is produced from lignocellulosic biomass using technologies which are currently not yet commercialized. Hence, (policy) mechanisms that expedite technology development are cardinal to the feasibility and affordability of increasing RJF production. © 2018 The Authors GCB Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Almost the complete amount of jet fuel available on the global market is produced from fossil crude oil being an exhaustible raw material. Furthermore its use is inherently connected with emissions of the greenhouse gas CO2. To cope with this, several processes for the production of alternative aviation fuels were developed including the use of biomass as a renewable feedstock. Since biomass from cultivation farming is in competition with food and fodder production, the preferred raw material would be residues from agriculture and forestry or municipal waste, also microalgae can be used. Independent of the raw material, the conversion of biogenic feedstock into alternative jet fuel is based on microbial, thermal and/or chemical breakdown of larger (bio)-molecules into smaller ones, followed by the catalytic formation of fuel molecules and hydrogenation. An overview on the production of different alternative bio-based jet fuels is given including a survey about producers and capacities, focusing on already certificated bio-based jet fuels. In addition to that, a comparison of fundamental combustion properties between Jet A-1 and different alternative jet fuels is presented: Laminar burning velocities and ignition delay times, each measured for two synthetic jet fuels based on fossil resources (coal-to-liquid—CtL and gas-to-liquid—GtL) as well as for two biofuels (farnesane and an Alcohol-to-Jet fuel—AtJ). Measurements of the burning velocities were performed at a preheat temperature of 473 K and pressures of 1 and 3 bar by variation of the fuel–air-equivalence ratios φ. Ignition delay times were determined for φ-values of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0, at an initial pressure of about 16 bar and temperatures ranging between 800 and 1700 K. It turns out that with respect to the characteristic combustion properties tested the considered alternative fuels have a combustion behavior similar to Jet A-1. © 2018, Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.

AB  - This study aims to produce high quality bio-oil by microwave co-pyrolysis of torrefied biomass (rice straw) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) using ZSM-5 as a catalyst. A central composite experimental design was used to optimize the reaction condition by response surface methodology analysis. The effects of reaction temperatures and catalyst dosages on the product yield and chemical selectivity of bio-oil were investigated. Results suggested that bio-oil obtained from torrefied biomass contained a lower water content compared with the control.The major chemical compounds of bio-oil were hydrocarbons, ketones, phenols, esters and alcohols (∼80%).Bio-oils with high hydrocarbon content (∼40% in the bio-oil) were obtained in the development of this experiment. Quadratic models were used to predict the bio-oil yield and chemical selectivity of the bio-oil obtained during the reactions. © 2018

AB  - The present study was undertaken to investigate engineering properties (viz. mass, density, volume, porosity, surface area, specific surface area, coefficient of friction, angle of repose, mechanical properties and colour) and chemical characteristics (moisture, oil and protein content) of Karanj (Pongamia pinnata) seeds and kernels. The length (l), width (w) and thickness (t) values indicated that the kernels are more spherical than the seeds. Average sphericity values of seeds and kernels were, 0.42 and 0.63, respectively. Although bulk densities did not vary, the true density of kernels was almost 2.5 times that of seeds. Kernels exhibited less coefficient of friction compared to seeds over different surfaces. Oil and protein content of kernels were found to be 35 and 18%, respectively. Mechanical properties in terms of rupture force (RF, N), hardness (H, N mm−1), deformation (RD, mm) and energy for rupture (ER, N mm) were measured. While RF and ER were marginally more for seeds, kernels were harder as registered from the H values. Pearson correlation coefficient indicated high (r = 0.847 at p &lt; 0.001) correlation between t and unit weight (wt) of seeds. Statistically significant (R2 &gt; 0.9, p &lt; 0.001) linear models could also be developed for kernels with t and wt as dependent variables, respectively. © 2018, NAAS (National Academy of Agricultural Sciences).

AB  - Most of the commercially available pyrolysis plants use fluidized bed technologies where bio-oil is the major product and the biochar produced is combusted for process heat. However, auger-based technologies are now gaining importance because of their small to medium scale of operation and decentralized nature where biochar is obtained as a by-product. One of the factors which may greatly influence the techno-economic viability of such decentralized plants is making high-grade carbon from pyrolytic biochar. In the present study, Jatropha and Karanja oil seed cake-based biochar is obtained as a by-product in a pilot-scale (20 kg/h) direct gas-fired auger pyrolysis process at 500 °C under fast pyrolysis conditions that is originally aimed at maximizing the bio-oil yield. The biochar has low surface area and porosity. To value add to this carbon, downstream physical and chemical activation are carried out in an externally heated laboratory-scale reactor. CO2 activation resulted in the formation of activated carbon with BET surface area up to ~ 200 m2/g with marginal improvement in porosity, while K2CO3 activation enhanced the surface area to as high as 2400 m2/g along with substantial enhancement of porosity. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Bio-jet fuel is increasingly attracting attention in attempts to reduce the environmental impacts of aviation fuels. Feedstocks like camelina, jatropha and algae have been extensively studied, and exhibit fair performance in producing low-density hydrocarbon biofuels, mainly from triglyceride lipids. Grindelia squarrosa is a promising feedstock since the primary diterpenoid, grindelic acid with the branched tricyclic structure, is the major component in its biocrude. Herein, a heterogeneous bi-functional catalyst, palladium with the reductive properties supported on tungstate zirconia with acidic properties and good stability in hydrothermal media, was used for the conversion of Grindelia squarrosa biocrude to potential bio-jet fuels. Different solid acid catalyst supports and a variety of reaction conditions, such as temperature, catalyst loading, hydrogen pressure, and reaction time, were systematically investigated. At the optimum conditions, the oxygen content deceased from 18.1 % in the Grindelia squarrosa biocrude feedstock to 5.6 % in the final product, and is ready for further industrial treatment. The upgrading method utilized in this work can produce jet fuel precursors for synthesizing high-density cyclic hydrocarbons. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - A new approach to pyrolysis is demonstrated that uses microwave heating combined with an external liquid media at atmospheric pressure. The liquid acts as the inerting medium instead of the traditional inert gas, and also acts as a heat-sink to maintain the external temperature at the normal boiling point of the liquid. The ability to regulate the external temperature using a liquid offers significant advantages over established pyrolysis technologies and is only possible due to the selective and volumetric heating that occurs with microwaves. The new concept overcomes many of the challenges encountered in traditional and gas-based microwave pyrolysis processes, producing a bio-oil that naturally partitions into a sugar-rich aqueous phase and a phenol-rich organic phase. Energy requirements are as low as 2 kJ/g for 50% volatilisation, comparable to microwave pyrolysis using inert gases. It is shown that the new concept works effectively with both microwave-transparent and microwave-absorbent solvents. The liquid media also acts to eliminate arcing and prevent carbonaceous residues from forming, phenomena which have so far proved challenging for the scale-up of microwave pyrolysis processes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microalgal isolates (Chlorella sp. and Spirulina sp.) and yeast isolates (Candida albicans and Saccharomyces sp.) were employed as the resources of biodiesel production and silver nanoparticle synthesis. The prominent peaks of the FTIR spectrum accustomed the efficient lipid property. The developed profile containing fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) displayed the elevated amount of both saturated (C15:0, C17:0, C21:0) and unsaturated (C17:1, C18:2, C20:4) fatty acids. The physicochemical properties analyzed by using Biodiesel analyzer V1.1.software, confirmed the competency of the isolates for sustainable biodiesel production. Biosynthesis of silvernanoparticles (AgNPs) were accomplished extracellularly by using supernatant of microalgal and yeast culture. The maximum absorbance at 420 and 421 nm under UV–visible spectra showed the presence of nanoparticles. The purity of the synthesized AgNPs were analyzed by XRD analysis. The elemental silver presence was affirmed by EDAX, SEM and AFM, the results revealed spherical crystalline shaped nanoparticles of size ranging from 2.0 to 7.3 nm. The antimicrobial efficacy of the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) against various clinical pathogens which includes Bacillus sp., E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus sp. and Staphylococcus aureus were observed. However, enhanced antimicrobial activity was displayed by the AgNPs, produced by Candida albicans (12 mm) against Bacillus sp., and E.coli, the nanoparticle produced by Chlorella sp. showed the least antagonistic activity (07 mm). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cyanobacteria can directly channel atmospheric CO 2 into a wide range of versatile carbon products such as fatty acids and fatty alcohols with applications including fuel, cosmetics, and health products. Works on alcohol production in cyanobacteria have so far focused on either long (C12-C18) or short (C2-C4) chain-length products. In the present work, we report the first synthetic pathway for 1-octanol (C8) biosynthesis in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, employing a carboxylic acid reductase and C8-preferring fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase. The first engineered strain produced 1-octanol but exhibited poor productivity and cellular health issues. We therefore proceeded to systematically optimize the strain and cultivation conditions in order to understand what the limiting factors were. The identification of optimal promoters and ribosomal binding sites, in combination with isopropyl myristate solvent overlay, resulted in a combined (C8–OH and C10–OH) titer of more than 100 mg/L (a 25-fold improvement relative to the first engineered strain) and a restoration of cellular health. Additionally, more than 905 mg/L 1-octanol was produced when the strain expressing sfp (phosphopantetheinyl transferase) and car (carboxylic acid reductase) was fed with octanoic acid. A combination of feeding experiments and protein quantification indicated that the supply of octanoic acid from the introduced thioesterase, and possibly also native fatty acid synthesis pathway, were the main bottlenecks of the pathway. © 2018

AB  - Waste chicken eggshells were used to derive two catalysts labeled in this study as Eggshell-CaOC-H-D and Eggshell-CaDG. Both these catalysts were characterized by FTIR, XRD, BET, SEM, and basic strength was determined by the Hammett indicator method. The transesterification of waste cooking oil was carried out to compare the catalytic activity of Eggshell-CaDG and Eggshell-CaOC-H-D. The effect of various reaction parameters-methanol molar ratio, temperature, speed of agitation, and catalyst loading on the progress of the reaction was also tested to produce higher biodiesel yield. Eggshell-CaDG catalyzed reaction produced 96.07% biodiesel under the optimized reaction conditions of methanol molar ratio 10:1, catalyst loading 1.50 wt%, temperature 60 °C and speed of agitation 300 rpm with a reaction time of 50 min. Whereas, Eggshell-CaOC-H-D was yielded 93.10% biodiesel for the optimized operating parameters-methanol molar ratio 12:1, 400 rpm, 65 °C, catalyst loading of 3 wt% in the reaction time of 90 min. The reusability for both the catalysts was tested up to five cycles and found that biodiesel yield was decreased with successive cycles. The activation energies of the Eggshell-CaDG and Eggshell-CaOC-H-D were found to be 31.39 and 54.05 kJ mol−1, respectively. The physicochemical properties of the biodiesel were also found as per the ASTM standard range. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The appropriate system is needed to produce a scalable and economically viable renewable energy from biomass. The objective of this study is to improve the quality of bio-oil, in terms of Organic Liquid Product (OLP), water content, acidity, favourable fractions, as well as gasoline-range chemicals. The influence of a staged layered catalyst system consists of a mesoporous catalyst, Al-MCM-41, and a microporous catalyst, HZSM-5, on the bio-oil quality was investigated. Additionally, the effect of reaction temperatures in the range of 400–600 °C with the optimum staged catalyst system on the catalytic pyrolysis product was analysed. The experiments of lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis were performed using a fixed bed reactor equipped with oil condensers and a gas collection sample bag. The quality of bio-oil produced from the thermal pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, catalytic pyrolysis with single catalysts, catalytic pyrolysis with the staged catalyst system, as well as catalytic pyrolysis with mixed catalyst system was studied. The results show that Al-MCM-41 with HZSM-5 in the staged catalyst system enhanced the production of favourable compounds: hydrocarbons, phenols, furans, and alcohols. The favourable compounds yield that boosted 5.25–6.43% of that with single HZSM-5 catalyst was produced with HZSM-5:Al-MCM-41 mass ratio of 3:1 and 7:1. The pyrolysis and catalysis temperature of 500 °C with HZSM-5:Al-MCM-41 ratio of 3:1 obtained the optimum quality of bio-oil with 11.08 wt.% of OLP, 76.20% of favourable fractions, 41.97 wt.% of water content, low TAN of 43.01 mg-KOH/g, high deoxygenation, as well as high gasoline-range production of 97.89%. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - First-generation bioethanol production from fermentation is a widely applied technology, with the United States of America and Brazil being the global leaders. However, several concerns regarding the widespread production of biofuels have arisen, particularly its environmental impacts. To address this issue, this study details the environmental impacts of the production of fist-generation bioethanol from sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) in a pilot scale facility, using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. Cultivation and transformation of sweet potato into bioethanol are considered in the system boundaries. The background data for the life cycle inventory were mainly obtained from the Ecoinvent 3.1 database and considered both literature and field data. The SimaPro software was used to perform the impact assessment considering the CML IA baseline 3.02 method. Three different agricultural waste scenarios are also considered and compared to evaluate the best-case scenarios. In addition, sensitivity analysis and comparison with other similar studies are thoroughly explored. Overall, the analyzed production system has lower impacts than indicated in similar studies, but considering its pilot scale, improvement of its environmental impacts is necessary, which might be addressed with larger scale and centralized support systems regarding transportation and other aspects. Based on the results, several recommendations to decrease environmental impacts are also listed. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Algae hold great potential as a source of renewable fuel due to their ability to produce refinery-compatible diesel and jet fuel precursors. Significant effort has been made to maximize productivity under photoautotrophic growth conditions; however, little progress has been made to discover and understand reduced carbon assimilation pathways or enzymatic degradation of complex carbon substrates in algae. We purport that utilization of plant-based carbon substrates in addition to photosynthesis (mixotrophic growth) for biochemical assimilation into biomass, biofuels, and bioproducts, can increase cultivation productivity and improve the economic viability of algal-derived biofuels. Herein we report that a freshwater production strain of microalgae, Auxenochlorella protothecoides UTEX 25, is capable of directly degrading and utilizing non-food plant substrates, such as switchgrass, for cell growth. Glycome profiling of plant substrates before and after addition to A. protothecoides cultures demonstrates the utilization of xyloglucans. Genomic, proteomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed the identity of many enzymes that are hypothesized to be involved in complex carbohydrate degradation, including several family 5 and 9 glycosyl hydrolases. This work paves the way for future designer engineering of plant‑carbon utilization to further improve productivity of algal production strains. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - EN 14103:2003 and EN 14103:2011 were developed in order to determine fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) content of biodiesel. The internal standards (IS) of biodiesel include methyl heptadecanoate (MHD) and methyl nonadecanoate (MND), respectively. However, since these ISs are also present in bovine tallow methyl esters (BTME) or overlapping peaks, they have not been efficient. This work proposes an improved BTME determination method by using hexadecyl propanoate (HDP) as an IS. For this purpose, an analytical methodology by Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) was developed and validated, where HDP demonstrated selectivity in retention time between peaks C16:1 and C18:0 for coconut and soybeans methyl esters and BTME, as well as resolution >1.5 for the BTME in split mode 30:1. Trueness in the determination of BTME content using the HDP as an IS was statistically equivalent to confidence interval of 95% for the null hypothesis statistic test, even when only 20% of the HDP was utilized in comparison with the IS concentrations defined by EN 14103:2003 and EN 14103:2011. This allowed the biodiesel analysis to be performed five times more with 1 g of HDP. Furthermore, the method developed enabled us to reduce the analysis time by 21.6%, without prejudice to the integration of peaks (C6:0 to C24:1). Regarding the repeatability and intermediate precision tests, results of RSD (%) ≤ 2% were reached. Additionally, the method developed has proved to be robust. HDP is a long-chain fatty alcohol ester absent from feedstocks used in biodiesel synthesis. It presents all of the characteristics for a good IS, ideal for application via internal standardization method, as recommended by EN 14103. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work investigates the experimental study to examine the operation characteristics of a neat neem oil methyl ester (BD100) along with silver oxide nano-particles as a metal-based additive in various mass fractions. Silver oxide nano-particle is mixed into 100% of BD100 at 5 and 10 ppm. The experimental investigation on diesel engine reveals that the addition of silver oxide nano-particles to BD100 resulted in enhancement of brake thermal efficiency (BTE) with a reduction in brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC). The tested emission parameters such as CO, HC, NOx, and smoke were decreased by 12.22, 10.89, 4.24, and 6.61% for BD100+ Ag2O (5 ppm) and 16.47, 14.21, 6.66, and 8.34% for BD100 respectively when compared to BD100. Overall, improvement in ignition characteristics of the engine was finer by adding 5 and 10 ppm of silver oxide nano-particle to BD100 on account of the enhanced surface area to volume ratio. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Heavy-duty engines are type approved on engine dynamometers. However, the in-service conformity or in-use compliance is conducted on the road over driving patterns, conditions and payloads defined in the regulation using Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS). In Europe PEMS testing is currently applicable to gaseous emissions only, but the introduction of solid particle number (SPN) PEMS is under discussion for heavy-duty vehicles. Although SPN PEMS testing is required for light-duty vehicles, the robustness and the accuracy of the systems for the different conditions of heavy duty vehicles (e.g. higher exhaust gas temperatures, high content of bio-fuels, CNG engines) needs further investigation. This paper describes the experimental assessment of four SPN PEMS models by comparing them to reference regulated laboratory systems. One of the SPN PEMS was circulated to most laboratories. The tests were conducted by heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers in Europe. The results showed that the PEMS measure within 40–65% of the laboratory standards with only minor robustness issues. Thus, they can be included in the in-service conformity regulation taking into account their measurement uncertainty. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - New integrated biorefinery (IBR) concepts are being investigated to co-produce hydrocarbon fuels and high-value bio-based chemicals to improve the economic viability of IBRs, to enhance biomass resource utilization efficiencies, and to maximize potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. Unlike fuel-only biorefineries, IBRs may co-produce a significant amount of bio-based chemicals, whose emission implications for specific biorefinery products and the biorefinery as a whole need to be evaluated. We discuss this in principle and apply three sets of co-product handling methods to conduct life-cycle analysis (LCA) of modeled IBRs with co-production of two bioproduct examples – succinic acid and adipic acid – alongside a renewable diesel blendstock fuel product. The LCA results for the specific co-product handling methods that were examined shed light on potential artifacts of product-specific LCA with selected co-product methods. We discuss the advantages and limitations of each method and conclude that (i) a system-level or ‘black-box’ LCA allocation method is too simplistic to reflect appropriately the GHG burdens of distinctly different processing trains for fuels and chemicals in the IBR context, and (ii) the displacement method is the only co-product handling method that accounts fully for the emission effects of both the fuel product and the non-fuel bio-based co-products in the IBRs within the context of the existing fuel-focused GHG regulatory framework. Alternatively, biorefinery system-level LCA combines benefits of individual products to offer a complete picture. This system-level LCA approach offers a holistic LCA without somewhat arbitrary decisions either on an allocation basis or by the selection of an evaluation metric based on specific products. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - For the past few years, the energy-intensive renewable fuels are introduced to solve our depleted fossil fuels, power and/or clean air requirements. In view of that, in the current study a couple of new ternary blended fuels in renewable bases is examined, for the first time in the internal combustion engines, as possible alternatives of fossil fuels. Bio-methanol was mixed with iso-butanol and gasoline in one blended fuel (iBM), and bio-ethanol was mixed with n-butanol and gasoline in the other one (nBE) at rates 3–10 vol% biofuels. The two ternary blended fuels were compared with each others as well as with the neat gasoline for the fuel energy efficiencies and pollutant emissions in a gasoline-fueled engine. The fuel energy efficiencies include output torque (Torq), brake power (BP), volumetric efficiency (VE), in-cylinder pressure (ICP) and exhaust gas temperature (EGT), while the pollutant emissions include CO, CO2 and UHC (unburned hydrocarbons). Experimental results indicated that the two tested fuel blends can achieve the goal of more green sustainability, as compared to conventional neat gasoline fuel. The superior engine emissions were presented by iBM fuel blends, which imply 31%, 19% and 32% lower than the CO, CO2 and UHC emissions of neat gasoline. However, there are slight advantages on engine performance at using neat gasoline than the iBM and nBM ternary fuel blends. The study also indicated that the addition of iso-butanol–bio-methanol to gasoline results a higher engine performance than the addition of n-butanol–bio-ethanol to gasoline by about 0.9%, 6.2%, 2.6 and 1.47%, for EGT, ICP, BP and Torq, respectively. The nBE blended fuel showed a small descend in engine performance, compared to neat gasoline, by about 2.4%, 3.4%, 5%, 5.2% and 1.9% for VE, EGT, ICP, BP and Torq, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Novel polygeneration concepts based on catalytic hydropyrolysis and hydrodeoxygenation are presented and compared via process simulation and thermodynamic analysis. These systems process and convert biomass into high-quality bio-oil and fuels such as synthetic natural gas (SNG), molecular hydrogen (H2) and methanol (MeOH). Twelve system layouts were evaluated and compared with regards to their energy demands and performances. Detailed thermodynamic models were developed, considering the different technological alternatives for the valorisation of bio-char, removal of carbon dioxide, fuel upgrading and water electrolysis, as well as the opportunities for energy integration. The results show that the standard system, which produces only bio-oil, reaches an energy efficiency of 61% (LHV). This value can be increased by 7–28%-points when co-producing SNG, 10–21%-points when producing H2, and 10–19%-points when producing MeOH. The highest values are achieved by co-production of SNG as light hydrocarbons are produced in the hydropyrolysis, and limited processing is therefore required to reach the desired product quality. High system efficiencies are possible mainly because of the high efficiency of the core hydropyrolysis process. Carbon conversion efficiencies are highest when generating SNG or MeOH and reach a maximum when electrolysis and char gasification are implemented (98% and 95%). The performance of these polygeneration systems is strongly impacted by the type of CO2-separation process and electrolyser - these processes have a strong influence on the power and heating demands, as well as on the potential energy savings and waste heat valorisation. © 2018

AB  - One of the major challenges in the production of biodiesel is the immiscibility of oil and methanol. The extent of dispersion between the two phases controls the mass and heat transfer rates and consequently the rate of the transesterification reaction. In this study, we report a novel design of a batch agitated vessel used for the production of biodiesel from palm oil. The new reactor is provided with static stainless steel mesh screen baffles to promote dispersion between the two immiscible reactants. The effect of the key parameters was investigated. The reaction yield was expressed in terms of FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) concentration. The optimum transesterification reaction conditions that yielded the highest biodiesel yield (97%) were as follows: methanol to oil molar ratio of 6:1, a reaction temperature of 60 °C, a one percent (wt.%) NaOH solution, a mesh screen size of 12″ and an agitation speed of 250 rpm. In order to test whether the produced biodiesel can replace diesel oil in combustion engines we evaluated the biodiesel quality, the engine performance and the emission characteristics of a B20 (20% biodiesel and 80% petroleum diesel) blend. A reduction in carbon monoxide and a marginal increase in nitrogen oxides emissions was observed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Current research reports the synthesis of in-situ TiO2/RGO nanocomposite and used as a heterogeneous catalyst for the transesterification of waste cooking oil into biodiesel. The prepared catalyst was characterized viz. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques conforming the successful formation of nanocomposite. The effects of various reaction parameters used for transesterification were examined to optimize the reaction conditions. The best operational conditions were oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:12 at 65 °C with 1.5 wt% catalyst loading and reaction time of 3 h. The catalyst showed good catalytic activity in biodiesel production and biodiesel conversion of 98% was obtained under optimum reaction conditions. Biodiesel conversion was confirmed by Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR), Carbon Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (13C NMR) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) techniques. The excellent catalytic activity of TiO2/RGO could be attributed to the enhanced surface area of the composite. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lemon peel oil (LPO) is considered to be a viable alternative fuel for diesel engine applications due to its wider availability, renewable nature, easy extraction process, almost equivalent calorific value as neat diesel, and low viscosity. The present work aims to investigate the effect of novel emulsified LPO in a diesel engine in order to reduce the NOx emission without compromising the engine performance. A new ionic surfactant is introduced in the present study, namely methyl-dihydroxy propyl imidazolium chloride due to its higher hydrophilic-lipophilic balance value which helps to prepare stable water in oil emulsion. Also, Span 80 has been selected as another suitable surfactant for water in oil emulsion. Four emulsified fuel samples have been prepared using LPO, water, and different concentrations of surfactants. All the fuel samples are tested for their stability through gravitational technique for 7 days. Among the emulsified samples, 92% LPO + 5% water + 2% Span 80 + 1% methyl-dihydroxy propyl imidazolium chloride by volume (LPOE2) and 93.5% LPO + 5% water + 1.5% surfactant Span 80 by volume (LPOE4) have showed better stability when compared to other emulsion fuel samples. It is also revealed that the stability of LPO emulsion is improved by the addition of two emulsions. The experimental results showed that the brake thermal efficiency of LPO emulsion is reduced to 29.87 from 34.58% of pure LPO at full load condition. Oxides of nitrogen emission and smoke emission are reduced by 21–32 and 6–15% for the LPO emulsion samples compared to pure LPO. Moreover, the diesel engine operation with emulsified form of LPO increases the HC emission about 0.1 g/kWh for LPOE4 and 0.15 g/kWh for LPOE2 fuels from 0.053 g/kW for pure LPO at maximum power output condition. The reformulation of LPO into emulsified form increases the CO emission by 25–53% compared to pure LPO. Moreover, the reformulation of LPO into emulsions has resulted in lower cylinder pressure and heat release rate compared to pure LPO and diesel fuels. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Catalytic co-pyrolysis of grape seeds and waste tyres was performed in a fixed-bed reactor using calcined calcite as a catalyst. The organic phase obtained was analysed for its further application as a potential and stable drop-in fuel. Remarkable positive effects were achieved after the joint incorporation of both waste tyres and calcined calcite to grape seeds in the process. More specifically, the addition of considerable amounts of waste tyres (between 20 and 40 wt%) with a constant ratio of feedstock to calcined calcite of 1 were considered the optimal experimental conditions to promote positive synergistic effects on bio-oil yields and its characteristics as a fuel. Thus, when the proportion of waste tyres in the feed reached 40 wt%, the organic phase yield was considerable improved, reaching up values higher than 73 wt%, significantly greater than those obtained from conventional pyrolysis (61 wt%). Moreover, oxygen content was reduced to 4.2 wt%, minimizing any problems related to corrosivity and instability. HHV was enlarged from 15.3 up to 27.3 MJ/kg, significantly increasing the value of the resulting bio-oil. pH values and specially total acid number were also improved reaching values down to 1 mg KOH/gbio-oil in all cases. Additionally, a more valuable chemical composition was achieved since the production of aromatic and cyclic hydrocarbons was maximized, while a significant reduction in phenolic compounds was achieved. Moreover, bio-oil sulphur content was drastically reduced in comparison with the pyrolysis of waste tyres by itself from 0.6 down to 0.2 wt%. The role of calcined calcite was directly related to the promotion of dehydration reactions of acids and phenols in order to generate hydrocarbons. On the other hand, radical interactions between the biomass and waste tyres pyrolysis products played a fundamental role in the production of more valuable compounds. Finally, the CO2 capture effect produced a more environmentally friendly gas while maintaining its calorific value. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The transportation demand in India is increasing tremendously, which arouses the energy consumption by 4.1 to 6.1% increases each year from 2010 to 2050. In addition, the private vehicle ownership keeps on increasing almost 10% per year during the last decade and reaches 213 million tons of oil consumption in 2016. Thus, this makes India the third largest importer of crude oil in the world. Because of this problem, there is a need of promoting the alternative fuels (biodiesel) which are from different feedstocks for the transportation. This alternative fuel has better emission characteristics compared to neat diesel, hence the biodiesel can be used as direct alternative for diesel and it can also be blended with diesel to get better performance. However, the effect of compression ratio, injection timing, injection pressure, composition-blend ratio and air-fuel ratio, and the shape of the cylinder may affect the performance and emission characteristics of the diesel engine. This article deals with the effect of compression ratio in the performance of the engine while using Honne oil diesel blend and also to find out the optimum compression ratio. So the experimentations are conducted using Honne oil diesel blend-fueled CI engine at variable load conditions and at constant speed operations. In order to find out the optimum compression ratio, experiments are carried out on a single-cylinder, four-stroke variable compression ratio diesel engine, and it is found that 18:1 compression ratio gives better performance than the lower compression ratios. Engine performance tests were carried out at different compression ratio values. Using experimental data, regression model was developed and the values were predicted using response surface methodology. Then the predicted values were validated with the experimental results and a maximum error percentage of 6.057 with an average percentage of error as 3.57 were obtained. The optimum numeric factors for different responses were also selected using RSM. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Pyrolysis of biodiesel at high temperatures may result in the formation of transient and stable free radicals immobilized on particulate emissions. Consequently, free radicals adsorbed on particulates are believed to be precursors for health-related illnesses such as cancer, cardiac arrest, and oxidative stress. This study explores the nature of free radicals and particulate emissions generated when Croton megalocarpus biodiesel is pyrolyzed at 600 °C in an inert environment of flowing nitrogen at a residence time of 0.5 s at 1 atm. The surface morphology of thermal emissions were imaged using a field emission gun scanning electron microscope (FEG SEM) while the radical characteristics were investigated using an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer (EPR). A g-value of 2.0024 associated with a narrow ∆Hp-p of 3.65 G was determined. The decay rate constant for the radicals was low (1.86 × 10−8 s−1) while the half-life was long ≈ 431 days. The observed EPR characterization of Croton megalocarpus thermal particulates revealed the existence of free radicals typical of those found in coal. The low g-value and low decay rate constant suggests that the free radicals in particulates are possibly carbon-centered. The mechanistic channel for the formation of croton char from model biodiesel component (9-dodecenoic acid, methyl ester) has been proposed in this study. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The main aim of the present research is to effectively utilize the biofuel along with nano additive (Cymbopogon flexuosus biofuel with cerium oxide) powered with a coated and uncoated diesel engine. The work is further extended to study the thermal–stress analysis of the coated engine, to empathize the physical mechanism underlying the impact of coated engine on the engine behavior. In connection with this, for the present work, a novel biofuel and oxygenate additive was preferred. Biofuel- Cymbopogon flexuosus was extracted through the steam distillation technique and oxygenate additive - cerium oxide nano additive was synthesized using combustion technique. Focusing on the coating material, YSZ (Yttria-stabilized zirconia) is preferred, as it is highly used in the high-temperature application and were evaluated based on the thermal–stress analysis. From the simulation study using FEA (finite element analysis), the average temperature, and thermal stress were higher and heat flux, were noted to be lower for coated piston, confirming the substantial improvement in thermal efficiency in the experimental study. As a next step, YSZ was coated on the engine piston, valves and cylinder head by plasma spray coating technique. From the experimental assessment of test samples such as D100, B100, B25, in a uncoated engine and B25 + (A) - Cymbopogon flexuosus biofuel – 25% and diesel – 75% + 20 ppm cerium oxide nano additive) in a coated and uncoated engine. It was identified that the thermal efficiency of the engine was enhanced by 1.75% as on compared with the conventional engine for the modified fuel blend. In the emission point of view, fuel-based emissions such as hydrocarbon; carbon monoxide and smoke were reduced with a penalty of increased oxides of nitrogen emission. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The work analyses process intensification in production of fermentative biofuel (bioethanol) in a multi-staged membrane integrated bioreactor system from sugarcane juice (SCJ) using Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCIM 3205). Membrane based clarification, sterilization and concentration of sugar cane juice could replace several energy-intensive and polluting steps of conventional production schemes. Integration of traditional bioreactor with membrane-based devices for downstream purification of bioethanol enabled the system for recycling of cells and residual sugars to the fermentation unit through largely fouling free cross flow microfiltration and nanofiltration membrane modules. The new process design is characterized by high yield (0.48 g/g), productivity (14.6 g/L/h) and concentration capability (97.6 g/L) using concentrated SCJ of 22 wt% under high cell density in a flexible, compact, eco-friendly and modular plant. The final membrane distillation stage concentrated ∼98% pure ethanol in a solar-driven direct contact membrane distillation configuration using PTFE/PET hydrophobic membrane with enhanced flux with vis-à-vis the existing processes. A rectangular flat sheet cross flow membrane module in counter-current flow mode of hot and cold streams was employed. The membrane-based system achieves quite high levels of process intensification essential to sustainable operation at industrial scale. The achieved process intensification in the new system has been analysed vis-a-vis the existing conventional systems in terms of eco-friendliness, flexibility, cost of equipment and production, consumption of energy and material, profitability, E-factor, atom efficiency and business sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Micro-algae are photosynthetic organisms, which represent a promissory renewable raw material for biofuels production, since they can be cultivated in non-fertile lands, avoiding the competition with food crops for land use. From micro-algae, oil can be obtained oil that can be converted to biodiesel, green diesel and biojet fuel. In particular, the renewable aviation fuel is one of the less explored biofuels; nevertheless, for the aviation sector, this is the best alternative to reduce CO2 emissions, allowing its sustainable development. In order to produce hydrocarbons in the boiling point range of jet fuel, we need to transform the micro-algae oil. A number of research projects report the use of micro-algae oil for the production of biojet fuel through the hydrotreating process. However, the application of process intensification strategies for the hydroprocessing of micro-algae oil has not been reported. Therefore, in this work we propose the modeling, simulation and intensification of the hydrotreating process to produce biojet fuel, considering micro-algae oil as raw material. The hydroprocessing of micro-algae oil is modeled in Aspen Plus processes simulator, based on data from an experimental study recently reported. The produced renewable hydrocarbons are purified through conventional and intensified distillation sequences; thereby, conventional and intensified hydrotreating processes are defined and evaluated in terms of total annual costs, CO2 emissions and biojet fuel price. Simulation results show that the implementation of intensification strategies leads to the production of biojet fuel with reduced carbon dioxide emissions, 34% less, and a competitive price per liter, 78% cheaper than fossil jet fuel price. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Household cookstove emissions are an important source of carbonaceous aerosols globally. The light-absorbing organic carbon (OC), also termed brown carbon (BrC), from cookstove emissions can impact the Earth's radiative balance, but is rarely investigated. In this work, PM2.5 filter samples were collected during combustion experiments with red oak wood, charcoal, and kerosene in a variety of cookstoves mainly at two water boiling test phases (cold start CS, hot start HS). Samples were extracted in methanol and extracts were examined using spectrophotometry. The mass absorption coefficients (MACλ, m2 g−1) at five wavelengths (365, 400, 450, 500, and 550 nm) were mostly inter-correlated and were used as a measurement proxy for BrC. The MAC365 for red oak combustion during the CS phase correlated strongly to the elemental carbon (EC)/OC mass ratio, indicating a dependency of BrC absorption on burn conditions. The emissions from cookstoves burning red oak have an average MACλ 2–6 times greater than those burning charcoal and kerosene, and around 3–4 times greater than that from biomass burning measured in previous studies. These results suggest that residential cookstove emissions could contribute largely to ambient BrC, and the simulation of BrC radiative forcing in climate models for biofuel combustion in cookstoves should be treated specifically and separated from open biomass burning. The radiative forcing of light-absorbing OC from cookstove emissions need to be considered in climate models, and should be treated separately from open biomass burning. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The potential of liquid biofuels (like bioethanol and biodiesel) to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transportation sector has generated a great deal of interest in the last few years, with particular attention being given to Jatropha methyl ester (JME). Jatropha curcas (Jc)—a species native to Mexico—shows some promise as a source of oil for biodiesel. A few studies on biodiesel production from Jc have been conducted in Mexico, but just one study involved a life cycle assessment (LCA) of JME. At the international level, most studies dealing with Jc focus on the biodiesel industrial process, while in this paper we also look in detail at the agricultural production phase. This case study provides preliminary results on GHG emissions and energy balances of JME production in Mexico, applying the LCA methodology recommended by the European Renewable Energy Directive (RED). Four production systems (JME 1–4) were studied, resulting in GHG mitigation of between 41 and 53% with regards to diesel if no direct land-use change (dLUC) change occurs. However, when accounting for GHG emissions arising from direct land-use change (dLUC), total emissions increase from 40 to 508 kg CO2e/GJ. The differences between dLUC on tropical dry forest and dLUC on grassland are of lesser importance than those between systems with and without dLUC. Using JME from plantations on lands, previously not cultivated, leads to GHG emissions three or six times higher than using fossil diesel. These results are an approximation to the environmental and energetic impacts of JME production in Mexico. Further studies should be performed before implementing more plantations to produce biofuel from J. curcas. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Herein we present a high yield 2-methylfuran production process with the required features to be implemented in a future integrated biorefinery. The strategy is based on the right solvent selection, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, which i) can be used to extract the reactant, furfural, from the aqueous solution obtained after corncob biomass hydrolysis; ii) allows for highly selective 2-methylfuran production form furfural with up to 80% yields and iii) presents suitable biofuel properties in the gasoline range. Using this innovative approach, two energy intensive separation steps are avoided: the initial furfural purification and the final solvent/product complete separation. Further benefits of this process arise from the developed low-cost, selective, and reusable Cu-Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recently, diesel/biodiesel/alcohol blend fuels have attracted tremendous attention as a potential alternative fuel in internal combustion engines, because of their beneficial effects on pollution emission and engine performance. However, there are few chemical mechanisms to forecast combustion characteristics of the ternary blends, especially for those blending with long-chain alcohols, such as butanol and pentanol. The objective of this paper is to develop a combined reduced combustion mechanism for the combustion simulation of diesel/biodiesel/alcohol (up to n-pentanol). This new combined mechanism, consisting of 229 species and 902 elementary reactions, was constructed by integrating two separated reduced mechanisms; one is the PRF-alcohols’ mechanism (Liu et al., 2016), and another is the biodiesel mechanism (Luo et al., 2012). The new combined mechanism reproduced well predictions of fuel ignition and flame speed compared with those obtained using the original ones. Extensive validations were performed against various experimental data for 0-D homogenous systems, 1-D freely propagating premixed flames and 3-D spray combustion flames. The proposed combined mechanism was shown to be versatile and robust, successfully integrating the biodiesel reaction mechanism and the long-chain alcohol reaction mechanisms into a single reaction scheme. Coupling with advanced simulation technology, it could be a powerful numerical tool in the design and optimization of new generation engines which are fueled with clean alternative fuels, especially when concerning long-chain alcohols. In addition, the effects of adding biodiesel and different kinds of alcohols on fundamental combustion characteristics of diesel/biodiesel/alcohol blend fuels were investigated using the proposed combined mechanism. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Different dehydrating methods combined with torrefaction were investigated to find the underlying mechanism that how dehydration process influence the degree of hornification. Hybrid pennisetum was selected as the experiment material. Oven-dried sample (ODS), crushed dried sample (CDS), and sun-cured dried sample (SDS) were torrefied under the temperature of 275 °C and 300 °C with the duration time of 60 min. The results showed that, changes in elevated carbon content and higher heating value (HHV) and reduced oxygen content of SDS were the most obvious under identical torrefaction conditions. Fuel ratio of SDS was enhanced most under 300 °C. It also had the highest devolatilization index (Di). The combination of sun-cured dried with torrefaction under 300 °C caused lowest degree of irreversible hornification happened during dehydrating process, and different hornification degrees caused by different dehydrating methods effect the enhancement of fuel properties of lignocellulosic biomass material. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, nitrogen was used to replace oxygen through biomass N-enriched pyrolysis in a fixed-bed reactor to obtain N-containing chemicals and N-doped biochar. Influence of NH3 concentration on the formation mechanism of N-species and electrochemical performance of N-doped biochar was investigated in depth. Results showed that increasing NH3 concentration promoted bio-oil and gas generation, and increased H2, CH4 and CO yield at the diminishing of CO2. Simultaneously, bio-oil showed lower oxygen content with non-methoxy phenols and N-heterocyclics as the main components, and the maximums were 57.73% and 16.21% at 80 vol% NH3 concentration, respectively. With regard to solid N-doped biochar, nitrogen content (4.85 wt%), N-containing groups and specific surface area (369.59 m2/g) increased greatly, and excellent electrochemical property (120 F/g) was shown with NH3 concentration increasing. However, NH3 conversion efficiency decreased gradually with NH3 increasing, and 40 vol% may be the optimum NH3 concentration for biomass N-enriched pyrolysis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of corn stovers with ceramic ball heat carriers in a dual concentric rotary cylinder reactor was studied to explore the product yields and characteristics in response to temperature. The reactor was confirmed to successfully scale up to a 25 kg/h pilot plant, with its performance being excellent. The highest bio-oil yield of 48.3 wt% at 500 °C was attained with the char and gas yields being 26.8 and 24.9 wt%. Phenols content was reduced from 22.3% to 18.9% when elevating temperature from 450 until 600 °C, with guaiacols and alkyl phenols being the predominant compounds, while ketones accounted for 15.8-23.0% and their content showed a continuous increase, with hydroxyacetone being the paramount ketonic one. Acetic acid was the dominant acidic compound with its peak content of 9.4% at 500 °C. The char characteristics in response to temperatures were determined for subsequent processing and high value-added utilization. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A multigeneration system is proposed to recover waste heat from a genset driven by a diesel engine, and capture CO2 in its emissions for microalgae growth. Scenedesmus sp. and an algae mixture were separately cultivated in 20-L jugs by supplying two CO2 sources: air and diesel engine emissions. Microalgae growth rates were determined from absorbances and analyzed to construe whether emissions in lieu of air enhanced the microalgae growth. Also, a mini-photobioreactor (mPBR) was employed to grow local algae mixture with air and emissions as CO2 sources. The experimental results demonstrated that diesel engine emissions increased the growth of both Scenedesmus sp. and local algae mixture. The multigeneration system thermal efficiency was defined as the sum of the total electrical power produced for cultivation in PBR, biomass harvesting, flocculation, separation, drying and oil extraction, followed by biodiesel production via transesterification reaction, plus the waste heat recovery and the heat generation rate potential of the produced biodiesel, divided by the heat input rate due to the combustion of consumed diesel fuel. In the absence of waste heat recovery, maximum thermodynamic efficiency of the system was 26%, while it increased to 36.2% with waste heat recovery and microalgae biodiesel, i.e., by 39.2%. © 2018

AB  - Butanol-acetone (BA) mixture is considered a green energy resource because it releases fewer emissions than other fuels. BA can produce via fermentation from biomass (agricultural waste and residues) that is non-edible. The benefits of butanol have been supported by many studies as additive fuel for conventional diesel due to its exceptional fuel properties such as high burning velocity and heating value. However, the cost of butanol production is the main issue of using it as a fuel because of high recovery and production costs. It is cheaper to produce BA than butanol because it is not necessary to separate the butanol from other chemicals in the biofuel. Many researchers have investigated the fermentation process to produce a fuel mixture of acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) with a 3:6:1 ratio. However, a number of studies demonstrate the drawbacks of using ethanol as an additive for diesel engines because of unsuitable properties for diesel engine such as lower heating value, cetane number and corrosion behaviour so BA with no ethanol is a better additive for diesel than ABE. This paper investigates the effect of using a butanol/acetone (BA)-diesel blend on exhaust gas emissions and engine performance. The test was performed for different blend ratios of BA to diesel (10BA90D, 20BA80D and 30BA70D) at engine speeds of 1400, 2000 2600 RPM in a single-cylinder diesel engine. This study has shown that brake power (BP) is maximum at 10% BA at all engine speed, approximately 5% higher than D100. The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of 10% BA was comparable with D100 at all engine speeds, but was slightly increased by 6% and 8% at all engine speeds when the BA ratio was 20% and 30% respectively. CO emission levels have a significant decrease for all BA blend with a maximum 64% reduction than D100; CO2 emission was correlated with BP; NOx decreased at all BA blend with a maximum 10% reduction than D100; and the exhaust gas temperature decreased for all BA blend by 15.6% compared to D100. BA is shown to be a good renewable fuel additive to diesel because it can improve energy efficiency and reduce pollutant emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We report on experimental evidence of the existence of a new self-sustaining low-temperature multistage warm diffusion flame, existing between the cool flame and hot flame, at atmospheric pressure in the counterflow geometry. The structure of multistage warm diffusion flames was examined by using thermometry, laser-induced fluorescence, and chemiluminescence measurements. It was found that the warm diffusion flame has a two-staged double flame structure, with a leading diffusion cool flame stage on the fuel side and a second intermediate stage on the oxidizer side, with strong heat release in the second stage that can be comparable to that of the first stage. The results demonstrate that the spatially-distinct multistage character is due to the low-temperature fuel reactivity that allows for the production of reactive intermediates in a leading cool flame. These intermediates are then oxidized, on the oxidizer side, in a second stage via intermediate-temperature chemistry. In the case of dibutyl ether, the low-temperature peroxy branching pathway supports the first cool flame oxidation stage and produces intermediates such as alkyl and carbonyl radicals. The alkyl and carbonyl radicals then react with the hydroperoxyl radical and molecular oxygen to form the second oxidation stage. A detailed analysis revealed that ozone addition in the oxidizer promotes the second stage oxidation by increasing both the radical pool population and the flame temperature, but does not fundamentally change the multistage flame structure. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that with the increase of fuel concentration, a single-stage cool flame can ignite to a warm flame or a hot flame. Moreover, a warm flame can extinguish into a cool flame or ignite to a hot flame when the fuel concentration is substantially reduced or increased, respectively. Finally, under certain conditions, a hot flame can extinguish directly into either a warm flame or a cool flame. Hence, the results suggest that the multistage warm flame can act as a critical bridge between cool flames and hot flames and that it is a fundamental burning mode characteristic of low-temperature non-premixed combustion. The multistage warm diffusion flame is particularly relevant to combustion in highly turbulent flow fields and in microgravity environments, owing to the possibility of long residence times. © 2018 The Combustion Institute

AB  - Cell wall disruption is an essential downstream processing step for improving the efficiency of lipid extraction from microalgae. Enzyme-assisted extraction of lipid from microalga Scenedesmus sp. with cellulase, xylanase and pectinase, using various parameters, such as enzyme concentration, temperature, pH and incubation time, was optimized by central composite design (CCD) coupled with response surface methodology (RSM). Both the lipid extraction from microalgae and the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) production under optimal conditions showed a ∼twofold in the yields compared to the control group with no enzymatic treatment. SEM images, FTIR measurement, XPS and HPLC analysis showed that the enzymatic pretreatment caused significant alterations in the cell wall structure of microalgae. And the disruption of microalgal cell walls was primarily attributed to the breakage of β-glucosidic linkages in cellulose and hemicellulose. The study showed a promising approach can lead to an improvement in the lipid extraction yield from microalgae and further provide valuable information for the use of enzymes in microalgal processes. © 2018

AB  - In the current scenario, the global researchers are focused on multidimensional fossil fuel facts, namely, depletion of fuels, energy crises, and emission threats. Hence, this condition of biofuel has potential worldwide acceptance. This research work uses the novelty of biofuel and biofuel emulsion, for the fuelling of IC engines for experimental analysis. The main objective of this work is to reduce harmful engine emissions, namely, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and smoke. The new feedstock of novel biofuel was obtained by solvent extraction method and which is now called raw Borassus Flabellifer Oil (BFO). Raw oil directly introduced in IC engine showed enhanced emission threats during last decade. Fuel modification is an attractive solution to avoid this threat. Emulsion technique is considered as a propitious method for alternative fuel. BFO emulsion fuel was prepared by adding 5% water and 2% of span80 surfactant by volume. Using emission reduction agent called antioxidant L-ascorbic acid as an additive in BFO emulsion fuel for scavenging the nitrogen radicals. The test result was analyzed in terms of combustion, performance and emission characteristics on a single cylinder DI diesel engine with raw BFO, emulsified BFO and additive mixed emulsified BFO respectively. Reduced emission of nitrogen oxide, smoke, hydrocarbon, and carbon monoxide by the use of additive mixed emulsified BFO fuel was observed. This includes improved engine efficiency, heat release rate, peak pressure and energy consumption than raw BFO and emulsified BFO. © 2018 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control

AB  - Biodiesel is a promising fuel which shows potential and gradually received attention as a best alternate feedstock for diesel engine. Previous investigations have shown that use of double biofuels in a diesel engine can be a promising aspect for complete elimination of diesel from compression ignition engines which will decrease our dependency on fossil fuels. The tribological performance of injection system is primarily based on the lubricity characteristics of the fuel. So, it is imperative to a more diversified research about the impact of using double biofuels in engine. In the present investigation, different biodiesel-oil blends were investigated using the ASTM D6079 by the reciprocatory friction monitor. The effect of temperature variation on lubricity characteristics was also studied. The biodiesel-oil blends shows improvement in results as compared to diesel. Biodiesel is prone to oxidation due to availability of unsaturation in their moieties. The effects of oxidation on lubricity characteristics were also studied. It was also found that the operating conditions collectively affected the lubricity characteristics of tested feedstocks. © IMechE 2017.

AB  - This paper describes the biodiesel production from waste cooking oil (50% (v/v) olive oil/sunflower oil) in an oscillatory flow reactor (OFR) in batch mode. We mainly focused on the characteristics of the biodiesel and its performance as a fuel. First at all, we verified that biodiesel yield in OFR was higher than in stirred tank reactor (STR) under the same experimental conditions, and that composition and properties of the resulting biofuel did not depend on reactor type. Besides, biodiesel production in OFR took half the time than in STR. Subsequently, we modify some OFR operational parameters to assess their influence on biodiesel yield. The most suitable conditions were found to be 6:1 methanol to waste cooking oil molar ratio, 0.67 Hz oscillation frequency and 30 min reaction time. Finally, the biofuel obtained was tested in a 2.0 TDI 140 hp EURO4 engine installed on an engine test bench. Specific fuel consumption, particle size distribution and concentration of exhaust gas sample pollutants and were analysed running with commercial diesel, 50% (v/v) diesel/biodiesel blend (B50) and biodiesel (B100) in order to ensure the viability of using this biofuel in vehicle engines. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Consumption of fossil fuels is an important issue which is to be addressed for better tomorrow due to its dreadful implications on the environment and its depleting nature is also a concern. Hence, the need of more diversified research in alternate sources arises, even to the point of complete elimination of diesel from compression ignition (CI) engines by using dual fuels; a mixture of high and low viscous fuel. In the present study, aamla seed oil biodiesel (AB) and eucalyptus oil (EU) blends were used as fuels for CI engine. Aamla seed oil was chemically modified with transesterification process. Results demonstrated that use of dual fuel can give satisfactory performance in a standard diesel engine without any tweaking in the engine. From all the tested fuel blends, result shows that a blend of 70% Aamla biodiesel- 30% Eucalyptus oil (AB70EU30) was found to be optimum blend and has potential to replace diesel completely. The performance and combustion characteristics of the engine fuelled with AB70EU30 were found almost in line with diesel. In addition, tailpipe emissions carbon monoxide (CO), unburnt hydrocarbon (HC) and smoke were found to be lower whereas nitrogen oxides emission was found to be almost equivalent with diesel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays, energy is the most challenging issue in the world. Although nanotechnology has been promising in offering huge developments in various fields, there are still concerns about the potential threats of nanotechnology products and applications. The concerns are mostly about the possible entrance of nanoparticles into body and their toxicity. As metallic and metal oxide nanoparticles might have toxic effects on living organisms, the use of biocompatible nanoparticles can considerably reduce these concerns. In this research, a combination of diesel-biodiesel-water-biodegradable nanoparticles was used to optimize fuel consumption, reduce pollutants, and enhance diesel engine performance for first time. Carbon quantum dot nanoparticles were synthesized through the hydrothermal method using orange peel and were then characterized thoroughly. Water and quantum dot nanoparticles were added to the B15 fuel (diesel fuel containing 15% biodiesel) in various concentrations. Then, engine performance experiments were performed using a single cylinder engine to investigate functional parameters and assess exhaust pollutants. The obtained results showed that the addition of water and quantum dot nanoparticles to the B15 fuel causes an increase in engine torque and power and decreases the brake specific fuel consumption. This is due to the better mixing of the fuel and air in combustion chamber and provision of more oxygen. It was also revealed that the use of emulsion nanofuels decreases the emission of unburned hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides (NOx). By employing the B15W5-CQD60 fuel (B15 fuel containing 5% water and 60 ppm carbon quantum dots), diesel engine power at the rate of 2700 rpm was increased by 21% compared with the B15 pure fuel. Furthermore, using the B15W10 fuel (B15 fuel containing 10% water), NOx emission was decreased by 25% on average compared with the B15 pure fuel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Global biodiesel production grew by 23% per year between 2005 and 2015, leading to a very strong expansion of the sector in a decade and, at the same time, the interest in the use of liquid biofuels/biodiesel in compression ignition engines has grown quickly. Taking into account that the use of biodiesel in IC engines directly affects their coolant temperature, with impact on performance, in this study an experimental campaign has been carried out on a 4-strokes single cylinder engine, aimed to assess whether the use of nanofluids, instead of water, could be a valuable solution to reduce peak engine temperature. Such nanofluids were characterized by higher thermal conductivity compared to conventional fluids, due to CuO nanoparticles added at different concentrations within the base fluid. Measurements of temperature were recorded at steady and unsteady conditions, by proper thermocouples located around the exhaust valve seat in the cylinder head and in the exhaust valve spindle. Particularly, temperatures of the exhaust valve spindle and exhaust valve seat in the cylinder head were measured at part and full engine loads, using water as coolant and then CuO based nanofluids. Experimental results showed that, at 100% engine load in unsteady conditions, it was possible to achieve a temperature reduction up to 13.6% on the exhaust valve seat and up to 4.1% on the exhaust valve spindle, when nanofluid at 2.5% volume concentration was used. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study investigated the effect of graphene oxide (GO) nanoparticles, as novel fuel additives, on the engine performance and emission characteristics of a diesel engine. The GO nanoparticles were mixed with B0, B10, and B20 Ailanthus altissima biodiesel blends. The graphene oxide nanoparticles, at concentrations of 30, 60, and 90 ppm, were dispersed into each fuel blend by ultrasonication. Throughout this study, engine testing was performed at a constant speed of 2100 rpm and loads of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. Performance and emission characteristics, including power, torque, specific fuel consumption (SFC), exhaust gas temperature (EGT), and CO, CO2, unburned-hydrocarbon (UHC), and NOx emissions, were investigated. study revealed that, under the same conditions, most performance characteristics, such as power, torque, and EGT, significantly increased through the addition of GO to fuel blends, while SFC significantly decreased. The GO-nanoparticle additives facilitated significant reductions in CO and UHC emissions (approximately 7–20% and 15–28%, respectively); however, under the same conditions, slight increases in CO2 and NOx emissions (approximately 6–10% and 5–8%, respectively) were observed. On the basis of the experimental results, we conclude that fuel blends composed of nanographene oxide, Ailanthus altissima biodiesel, and diesel can be introduced as environmentally friendly fuels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Neutralization of the bio-oil pH has been shown to generate a neutralized bio-oil aqueous phase (NBOAP) that includes most of the acidic components and a neutralized bio-oil organic phase (NBOOP) that includes hydrophobic organics, such as phenols. NBOOP can be used for fuel production, while NBOAP can be fed to microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) for hydrogen production. After pH neutralization, some organic acidic components remain in NBOOP. This work is focused on capturing acidic compounds from NBOOP through water extraction and electrosorption, and demonstrating hydrogen production via MECs. Capacitive deionization (CDI) is proven effective in capturing ions from NBOOP-contacted water and NBOAP via electrosorption. Captured acidic compounds enable the MEC application to effectively produce renewable hydrogen. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 49.2%, 61.5%, and 60.8% for 2, 4, and 10 g/L-anode/day loading were observed, corresponding to a total COD degradation of 0.19 g/L, 0.79 g/L, and 1.3 g/L, respectively. A maximum hydrogen productivity of 4.3 L-H2/L-anode/day was obtained. Major compounds in the water phase such as fatty acids, sugar derivatives, furanic and phenolic compounds were converted to hydrogen with an efficiency of 80–90%. This approach may lead the entire biomass pyrolysis process to be an overall carbon-neutral process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Currently, butanol obtained by fermentation is considered as potential biofuel. In this work, it has been simulated and optimized a process to produce acetone, butanol and ethanol by means of lignocellulosic material. To accomplish this task, initially, it was planned the raw material selection, followed by the simulation in MATLAB of simultaneous saccharification, fermentation and separation reactor (SFS) and finally, the stream coming from fermentation was purified. The separation stage was selected from three different options to purify that effluent. The entire process was evaluated under a robust optimization process considering environmental, economic and energetic objective functions by means of a hybrid stochastic method, differential evolution with tabu list. The obtained results showed that the best scheme to produce and purify butanol was the SFS-3C, which considers thermally coupled columns to purify acetone, butanol and ethanol. In general terms, it was obtained as result 0.138 $/kgbutanol, 0.132 points/kgbutanol and 66.8 regarding to the total annual cost, environmental impact and exergy efficiency, respectively. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The aim of this study is to elucidate the sustainability-related strategies on the biofuel industry. Our empirical analysis is based on a time series data set covering diesel demand in Greece over the period 1978–2014 and on the basis of these estimates we make forecasts for biodiesel consumption in the coming years (2015–2030) under three alternative scenarios. Our approach utilizes unit root testing to investigate possible co-integrated relationships among the sample variables. The empirical findings indicate that diesel demand is income and price inelastic in both the long and the short run, while biodiesel demand seems to have an upward trend over the simulated period. We argue that the importance of biofuel in the Greek energy balance will change the form of the existing business strategies towards issues such as sustainability, green entrepreneurship and corporate social responsibility to achieve the environmental goals set by the EU Energy Roadmap 2050.

AB  - Glycerol as raw material for further use within biorefineries has been evaluated by reviewing and comparing several processes, mostly from the literature but also a few developed for this work. The evaluation of these processes for transforming glycerol into fuels and chemicals includes their economics and the influence of main process design parameters. The possibility of reusing those chemicals within the biorefinery complex provides further integration possibilities. Various chemical complexes have been described from the literature, and a new process to obtain acrolein is developed. On the one hand, high added-value products allow a biodiesel production cost rather competitive. However, this reduces the integration opportunities and even the fuel yield from oil. On the other hand, for biorefineries to be attractive, a combination of yield and economics needs to be achieved. It looks like a distributed production is so far preferable, based on the current studies. But a more comprehensive supply chain study should be developed to evaluate and integrate biodiesel production plants and processes in a territory. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Purpose: Diminishing fossil resources and environmental concerns associated with their vast utilization have been in focus by energy policy makers and researchers. Among the different scenarios put forth to commercialize biofuels, various biorefinery concepts have aroused global interests because of their ability in converting biomass into a spectrum of marketable products and bioenergies. This study was aimed at developing different novel castor-based biorefinery scenarios for generating biodiesel and other co-products, i.e., ethanol and biogas. In these scenarios, glycerin, heat, and electricity were also considered as byproducts. Developed scenarios were also compared with a fossil reference system delivering the same amount of energy through the combustion of neat diesel. Materials and methods: Life cycle assessment (LCA) was used to investigate the environmental consequences of castor biodiesel production and consumption with a biorefinery approach. All the input and output flows from the cultivation stage to the combustion in diesel engines as well as changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) were taken into account. Impact 2002+ method was used to quantify the environmental consequences. Results and discussion: The LCA results demonstrated that in comparison with the fossil reference system, only one scenario (i.e., Sc-3 with co-production of significant amounts of biodiesel and biomethane) had 16% lower GHG emissions without even considering the improving effect of SOC. Moreover, resource damage category of this scenario was 50% lower than that of neat diesel combustion. The results proved that from a life cycle perspective, energy should be given priority in biorefineries because it is essential for a biorefinery to have a positive energy balance in order to be considered as a sustainable source of energy. Despite a positive effect on energy and GHG balances, these biorefineries had negative environmental impacts on the other damage categories like Human Health and Ecosystem Quality. Conclusions: Although biorefineries offer unique features as promising solutions for mitigating climate change and reducing dependence on fossil fuels, the selection of biomass processing options and management decisions can affect the final results in terms of environmental evaluations and energy balance. Moreover, if biorefineries are focused on transportation fuel production, a great deal of effort should still be made to have better environmental performance in Human Health and Ecosystem Quality damage categories. This study highly recommends that future studies focus towards biomass processing options and process optimization to guarantee the future of the most sustainable biofuels. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - There are many alternate fuels such as biodiesel and alcohols which has been commercialized in the industrial sector as well as in the transportation sector. In this context, cottonseed oil and isobutanol renewed our interest. Experiments are carried out on the single cylinder four strokes diesel engine capable of producing the power output of 5.2 kW and test is carried at the speed of 1500 rpm and under varying the load condition for the blends of cottonseed oil and isobutanol with diesel prepared by the volume basis i.e., B10, B10 + 5%, B10 + 10%, B20, B20 + 5% and B20 + 10%. The result shows that the addition of cottonseed oil increases the brake thermal efficiency with the reduction in the specific fuel consumption and exhaust gas temperature. Increasing the amount of the cottonseed oil in the blend also reduces the emission parameter such as CO, CO2, NOX and O2 with increase in HC emission. The addition of the isobutanol in the cottonseed oil blend diesel fuel has similar effect to that of addition of pure cottonseed oil in varying proportion that increases the brake thermal efficiency with the reduction in the specific fuel consumption and exhaust gas temperature. © 2017 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University

AB  - This study is based on three essential considerations concerning biodiesel obtained from waste cooking oil: diesel engine emissions of biodiesel produced from waste cooking oil, its potential in Turkey, and policies of the Turkish government about environmentally friendly alternative fuels. Emission tests have been realized with 35.8 kW, four-cylinder, four-stroke, direct injection diesel tractor engine. Test results are compared with Euro non-road emission standards for diesel fuel and five different blends of biodiesel production from waste cooking oil. The results of the experimental study show that the best blends are B10 and B20 as they show the lowest emission level. The other dimensions of the study include potential analysis of waste cooking oil as diesel fuels, referring to fuel price policies applied in the past, and proposed future policies about the same issues. It was also outlined some conclusions and recommendations in connection with recycling of waste oils as alternative fuels. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - A method for conversion of furfural, widely available platform chemical from biomass, to ethylcyclopentane, is reported. Ethylcyclopentane is a cyclic alkane with a relatively high octane number (RON 67, bp 103 °C) and could potentially serve as a drop-in biofuel. The synthetic route includes a transformation of furfural to 1-(furan-2-yl)propan-1-ol that is further subjected to Piancatelli rearrangement to give 5-ethyl-4-hydroxycyclopent-2-en-1-one. The subsequent hydrodeoxygenation affords ethylcyclopentane in 48% isolated yield. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The paper deals with the issue of greenhouse gas emissions that are produced by the road freight transport sector. These emissions affect the structure of the ozone layer and contribute to the greenhouse effect that causes global warming-issues that are closely associated with changing weather patterns and extreme weather events. Attention is drawn to the contradictions linked to FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Esters) biofuels, namely the fact that although their use generates almost zero greenhouse gas emissions, their production requires high levels of energy consumption. The first part of the paper deals with the theoretical basis of the negative impacts of transport on the environment and the subsequent measurement of the extent of the harmful emissions generated by the road freight transport sector. In the methodical part of the paper, the calculation procedures and declared energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions generated by transport services are analyzed according to the EN 16258 standard. The experimental part of the paper focuses on the application of the methodology to a specific shipment on a specified transport route, where the total energy consumption and production of greenhouse gas emissions is determined. These calculations are based on comprehensive studies carried out for a particular transport company that assigned the authors the task of determining to what extent the declared energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions change when the type of fuel used is changed. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The use of liquid or gaseous biofuels in reciprocating internal combustion engines (ICEs) is today a relevant issue as these systems are largely diffused for both steady power generation and transportation due to their flexibility and easiness of use. The improvement and perfect control of the combustion process under non-conventional fueling is mandatory to achieve high-energy efficiency without substantial changes to the architecture or the fuel supply system. In this perspective, the detailed characterization of multiphase reacting systems achievable though computational fluid dynamics (CFD) may give a decisive contribution. However, the assessed combustion models used for fossil fuels (diesel oil, gasoline, methane), tuned on the ground of a massive amount of experimental data, often results poor in predicting the actual behavior of renewable fuels whose composition and properties may change also according to technology for their production. Present work aims at filling some existing gaps in biofuel combustion modeling by performing investigations on two representative engine cases, for their characterization and performance enhancement. Two approaches are followed, namely through reduced chemical kinetics coupled with turbulence within a coherent flame schematization, and through a turbulent species transport approach with detailed kinetics. Simulations are first carried out on a compression ignition (CI) ICE. The formulation of a 3D CFD model is described to reproduce the performance of this engine in a dual-fuel mode with premixed syngas from biomass gasification and a biodiesel pilot injection leading to self-ignition. Pollutants formation and energy efficiency are calculated as syngas amount and the biodiesel start of injection (SOI) are varied. Attention is then focused on the implementation of renewable alcohol fuels (ethanol and butanol), as these lasts are receiving large interest due to low production costs. A validated reduced kinetic mechanism for PRF-ethanol-butanol combustion performs well in multi-component oxidation conditions, as well as in neat fuel oxidation conditions, in terms of ignition delay time, laminar flame speed and HCCI combustion conditions. The paper shows that CFD, even at different level of approximation, may describe into detail the combustion process and provide important guidelines for the design of new generation ICEs fuelled by biofuels. © Copyright © 2018 Costa and Piazzullo.

AB  - To move biobutanol toward a commercialized biofuel, its production process should be developed based on renewable and cost-effective carbon sources. In this study, it was shown that cotton, a commodity that typically ends in landfill sites or incinerators, can be utilized as a feasible source after the phosphoric acid-acetone process. The treatment with phosphoric acid (19 g/g) resulted in 94% cotton dissolution after 60 min, and the addition of acetone (41 g/g) was accompanied by 97% precipitation. Enzymatic hydrolysis of regenerated cellulose (15 filter paper unit per mL (FPU/mL)) followed by fermentation by Clostridium acetobutylicum resulted in 5.4 g/L acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE). In this process, 208 g acid and 138 FPU cellulase were used for production of each g ABE. Increasing enzyme dosage to 25 FPU/g resulted in 79% higher butanol production (161 g ABE/kg). Through cyclic acid re-concentration, phosphoric acid consumption decreased to 82 g/g ABE. Furthermore, by applying an additional dilute phosphoric acid pretreatment, the enzyme consumption reduced to 113 FPU/g ABE. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to enhance lutein accumulation and to explain the reasons for the difference in lutein accumulation under photoautotrophic and heterotrophic conditions, different culture modes and the associated transcriptome profiles were investigated in Auxenochlorella protothecoides. The heterotrophic-photoautotrophic transition culture mode was investigated for lutein accumulation, changing from organic carbon to increase biomass in dark fermentation to irradiation under nitrogen rich conditions. This strategy increased the lutein content 10 times along with chloroplast regeneration and little biomass loss in 48 h. The highest lutein productivity and production in the heterotrophic-photoautotrophic transition culture reached 12.36 mg/L/day and 34.13 mg/L respectively within seven days. Furthermore, compared to the photoautotrophic conditions, most genes involved in lutein biosynthesis and photosystem generation were down-regulated during heterotrophic growth. By contrast, two β-ring hydroxylases were transiently upregulated, while violaxanthin de-epoxidase and zeaxanthin epoxidase were mostly downregulated, which explained the extremely low lutein content of heterotrophic cells. Nevertheless, the lutein proportion in total carotenoids reached nearly 100%. This study is the first to our knowledge to report on a comparative transcriptome analysis of lutein biosynthesis, and it provides a promising strategy to boost lutein production in A. protothecoides. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This experimental study is conducted to investigate the combustion, performance and emissions of a diesel engine fueled with different alternative fuels under five engine loads and at an engine speed of 1800 rpm. Seven fuels, including diesel (D), waste cooking oil biodiesel (B), methanol (M), ethanol (E), 2-propanol (Pr), n-butanol (Bu) and n-pentanol (Pe)) were used to produce six blended fuels, labelled as DB, DBM, DBE, DBPr, DBBu and DBPe. Each blended fuel has the same oxygen content of 5.0% and very close carbon and hydrogen contents and LHV. According to the average results of five loads, the blended fuels in general cause to (a) increases in peak HRR (except DB), ignition delay (except DB), COVIMEP (except DBM), COV Max(dP/dθ) (except DB and DBM) and BSFC; (b) slight decrease in duration of combustion (except DB); and (c) similar peak in-cylinder pressure and BTE (except DBM and DBBu) compared to diesel fuel. Moreover, all the blended fuels lead to reductions in CO2 (except DB), CO, HC, NOX (except DB), PM, total number concentration (except DBPr) and geometric mean diameter, compared to diesel fuel. Overall, DBM shows the highest BTE, the lowest BSFC, and the lowest CO2, CO, HC, PM, NOX (after DBPr), COVIMEP and COV Max(dP/dθ) (after DB), while DB has the lowest influence, among all the tested blended fuels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pyrolysis oil of rubber seed oil (RSO) was upgraded by methyl esterificationusingSO42−/ZrO2 solid acid as catalyst. The activity and reusability of SO42−/ZrO2 solid acid were investigated and the experiment indicated that the esterification rate could reach 99.62% and was still above 95% in the third reaction. The component of SO42−/ZrO2 solid acid changed little after the third used. The properties of the obtained biofuel were studied and the results showed they were superior to pyrolysis oil and biodiesel, and similar to 0# diesel. The methyl esterification reaction kinetics was researched.

AB  - In this study, biodiesel production from castor oil has been investigated. Five independent variables including; methanol to oil (M:O) molar ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, time and stirring rate have been chosen to investigate their effect on biodiesel yield. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) via Rotatable Central Composite Design (RCCD) has been used to evaluate the influence of the independent variables on the reaction response. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) has been used to investigate the adequacy of the predicted model. The optimum conditions for 97.82% biodiesel yield have been achieved at M:O molar ratio of 5.4:1, potassium hydroxide (KOH) catalyst concentration of 0.73%, temperature of 64 °C, time of 2.5 h and stirring rate of 320 rpm. The predicted optimum conditions have been validated with 0.59% relative error from experimental results. The kinetic calculations concluded that reaction is pseudo second order with reaction rate constant, activation energy and frequency factor of 0.16 M−1 min−1, 21.95 kJ/mol and 6.02 M−1 min−1, respectively. Finally, a case study investigating the performance and emissions on a direct injection (DI) diesel engine fuelled by biodiesel/petro-diesel blends (5, 10, 15 and 20% v:v) has been performed concluding significant reduction of greenhouse and toxic gases. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A plant converting sugarcane bagasse to liquid fuels through thermal liquefaction in an Australian setting was modelled in ASPEN Plus. Ethanol was investigated as a liquefaction solvent due to its effect of higher yields and higher biocrude heating value compared to water (i.e. hydrothermal liquefaction). The plant produced 0.67 kg biocrude per kg dry feed, which was further processed to 0.46 kg liquid fuels per kg of dry feed for a total of 25.8 million L/y of biofuel product. Ethanol losses incurred the highest share in operating costs, although there are opportunities for cost reduction around lower solvent to biomass ratio. Over the plant life and with a corporate tax rate of 30%, it was determined that the minimum selling price for the fuel products is US$ 0.99/L, which was comparable to other liquefaction studies using water as solvent. It was demonstrated that continuous operation mode was economically more advantageous than semi-batch production. Product price, hydrodeoxygenation conversion efficiency and plant capacity were determined to be the factors to which NPV is most sensitive, while biocrude yield and hydrodeoxygenation conversion efficiency were the key factors in decreasing the minimum selling price of the product to a level that can be competitive. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The conclusions from life cycle assessment of algal biofuels (e.g., biodiesel, renewable diesel) vary significantly due to both modeling and inherent technological uncertainties. The inherent uncertainties of US-based algal biofuels production were investigated by eliminating modeling uncertainty via comprehensive harmonization through a meta-analysis. Following harmonization, the cumulative fossil energy consumption (MJ/MJ), global warming potential (g CO2-eq/MJ) and water consumption (m3/MJ) of different algal biofuel process trains were investigated through a stochastic life cycle model. By focusing on the inherent differences of current technologies, this study identified (1) the differences in impact results between different process trains (i.e., different combinations of technology choices along the fuel production life cycle), (2) high impact hotspots, and (3) possible low impact process trains, all of which are crucial to further improve the sustainability of algal biofuels. The median (range) values of the three indicators for the most common algal biodiesel process train are 3.5 (2.9-4.2) MJ/MJ, 99 (55-151) g CO2-eq/MJ and 0.08 (0.07-0.09) m3/MJ, with corresponding inter-quartile ranges being 63%, 46% and 43% less than the literature values, respectively. The median (range) values of the three indicators for the most common algae renewable diesel process train are 1.7 (1.4-2.2) MJ/MJ, 84 (60-112) g CO2-eq/MJ and 0.04 (0.03-0.05) m3/MJ, with the corresponding reductions in inter-quartile range by 83%, 83% and 84%, respectively. Although neither of the median global warming potential results for algal biofuels met the mandatory thresholds in the Renewable Fuel Standard (45 g CO2-eq/MJ), it is possible to meet the requirement by integrating low impact technology options into the process trains. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The solubility and crystallisability of a range of binary mixtures of n-hexadecane (C16H34) and n-octadecane (C18H38), as the predominant alkanes present in hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), from three representative fuel solutions (dodecane, toluene and kerosene) is presented. The dissolution (saturation) and crystallisation (supersaturation) points of the solutions are measured using poly-thermal methods utilising turbidometric detection over four concentrations from (192 g/l to 400 g/l). The data reveals the existence of more soluble, less stable crystal structures that form from the alkane mixtures, when compared to the stable triclinic crystal structures formed from the single solute component solutions. An increased carbon chain length results in lower solubility for all three solvents and the solvent type is not found to have any significant effect on the solid forms produced from the mixtures. van't Hoff analysis reveals the solvent type to influence the solute solubility with the closest to ideal behaviour being dodecane followed by kerosene and toluene, respectively. This finding is further supported by the calculated dissolution enthalpies and activity coefficients, which are the lowest in dodecane followed by kerosene and toluene. Larger values of activity coefficients are observed for compositions with molar fraction (y) = 0.1, 0.5–0.7 C18H38 which reflect the complex multi-phase formation in the solutions when compared with the more simple binary melt crystallisation system. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Oxygenated biofuels have become one of the research focuses of engines due to their renewability and improvement in combustion. There has been some studies concentrating on the dual fuel RCCI mode or blended combustion mode using biofuels in engines and valuable progress has been obtained. However, the comparison between biofuel RCCI and blended combustion modes has been rarely reported. Therefore, in current work, experimental study was conducted on a single-cylinder engine to investigate the differences between the two combustion modes fueled with biodiesel/n-butanol at different EGR rates (0%, 30%, 50%), n-butanol ratios (20%, 50%, 80%), injection timings and engine loads (low, medium, high). Results show that the ignition delay of blended mode is longer than that of RCCI mode, and more sensitive to n-butanol ratio and EGR rate. The optimum EGR rate is 30% considering efficiency and emissions for both combustion modes. Blended fuel mode can maintain high efficiency at all test loads and n-butanol ratios, the maximum indicated thermal efficiency (ITE) is up to 47.5%, while RCCI only shows comparable efficiency at high load. The problem of high maximum pressure rise rate (MPRR) that blended fuel mode faces can be addressed by retarded combustion phasing. Under current research conditions, blended fuel mode usually presents lower soot, HC, CO emissions and slight higher NOx compared with RCCI mode. Generally, blended mode has better performance when MPRR problem is addressed while RCCI mode shows the potential in load extension due to the low MPRR and flexible split ratio and injection timing. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper investigates the environmental and economic performance of the power production from biogas using Life Cycle Assessment, Life Cycle Costing and Cost Benefit Analysis methodologies. The analysis is based on a commercial thermophilic biogas plant located in Spain where is installed a Combined Heat and Power system that produces electricity that is sold to the grid. Power generation has been assumed as the only function of the biogas system, expanding the system boundaries to include the additional function related to the end-of-life management of the biowastes. Thus environmental burdens from the conventional management of residues were calculated separately and subtracted. The base scenario involves using agri-food waste, sewage sludge and pig/cow manure as substrates. This situation is compared against an alternative scenario where the production of synthetic fertilizer is surrogated by the digestate. The results have shown that the most impacting activities in all impacts categories of power production are primarily attributable to the operation and maintenance of the biogas plant except for water resource depletion and climate change. The avoided emissions associated with the conventional management of pig/cow manure more than offset GHG emissions of the biogas system resulting in a negative impact value of −73.9 g CO2 eq/kWh in the base case scenario. The normalized results show that local impact categories such as primarily human toxicity, fresh water ecotoxicity and particulate matter are the most significantly affected by the biogas system while global impact categories as climate change and ozone depletion are less severely affected. The operation and maintenance phase is also shown to be the largest contributor after the life cycle cost analysis, followed by the construction and dismantling of the biogas plant and the profitability of the project is primarily related to the income obtained from the management of the biowastes used as substrates. © 2018

AB  - Rapid industrialization and population growth have increased the world's energy demands, resulting in a shortage of conventional fossil fuels. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop sustainable and renewable forms of energy. Microalgae have emerged as a potential feedstock for biofuel production. Under stress conditions, lipid production is enhanced in algal cells due to changes in the lipid biosynthetic pathways that produce neutral lipids. In this study, we examined the physiological and biochemical effects of salinity stress (0.00, 0.01, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 M) on the freshwater microalga Scenedesmus obliquus XJ002. We found that the biomass and the content of chlorophyll a, b and carotenoids decreased with increasing NaCl concentration. NaCl stress damaged the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) and the PSII (photosystem II) reaction center and subsequently suppressed electron transport at the donor and receptor sides of the reaction center, influencing the absorption, transfer, and application of light energy. Additionally, the total lipid content of cells was significantly increased under NaCl stress treatment. The highest lipid content (32.26%) was found in cells cultured in the presence of 0.20 M NaCl, which was about 2.52-fold higher than that of cells grown in medium lacking NaCl (12.82%). In addition to providing insight into the physiological and biochemical responses of S. obliquus XJ002 to salinity stress, these findings show that lipid production, and hence biofuel feedstock production, can be boosted by adjusting salt levels in the growth medium. © 2018

AB  - Experimental human exposure studies are an effective tool to study adverse health effects from acute inhalation of particulate matter and other constituents of air pollution. In this randomized and double-blinded crossover study, we investigated the systemic effect on bioactive lipid metabolite levels after controlled biodiesel exhaust exposure of healthy humans and compared it to filtered air at a separate exposure occasion. Eicosanoids and other oxylipins, as well as endocannabinoids and related lipids, were quantified in plasma from 14 healthy volunteers at baseline and at three subsequent time points (2, 6, and 24 h) after 1 h exposure sessions. Protocols based on liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) methods were developed to detect temporal changes in circulating levels after biodiesel exhaust exposure. The exhaust was generated by a diesel engine fed with an undiluted rapeseed methyl ester fuel. Among the 51 analyzed lipid metabolites, PGF2α, 9,10-DiHOME, 9-HODE, 5-HETE, 11-HETE, 12-HETE, and DEA displayed significant responsiveness to the biodiesel exhaust exposure as opposed to filtered air. Of these, 9-HODE and 5-HETE at 24 h survived the 10% false discovery rate cutoff (p &lt; 0.003). Hence, the majority of the responsive lipid metabolites were monohydroxy fatty acids. We conclude that it is possible to detect alterations in circulating bioactive lipid metabolites in response to biodiesel exhaust exposure using LC-MS/MS, with emphasis on metabolites with inflammation related properties and implications on cardiovascular health and disease. These observations aid future investigations on air pollution effects, especially with regard to cardiovascular outcomes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bio-based chemicals can be produced from furfural through hydrotreatment. In this study, 2-methylfuran (MF), a potential biofuel component, was produced with Pt, Ru, and Ni catalysts supported on wood-based activated carbons. The catalytic hydrotreatment experiments were conducted in a batch reactor at 210–240 °C with 2-propanol as solvent and 40 bar H2 pressure. Two types of activated carbon supports were prepared by carbonization and activation of lignocellulosic biomass (forest-residue-based birch and spruce from Finland). Both types of activated carbons were suitable as catalyst supports, giving up to 100 % furfural conversions. The most important factors affecting the MF yield were the metal dispersion and particle size as well as reaction temperature. The highest observed MF yields were achieved with the noble metal catalysts with the highest dispersions at 240 °C after 120 min reaction time: 3 wt % Pt on spruce (MF yield of 50 %) and 3 wt % Ru on birch (MF yield of 49 %). Nickel catalysts were less active most likely owing to lower dispersions and incomplete metal reduction. Interesting results were obtained also with varying the metal loadings: the lower Pt loading (1.5 wt %) achieved almost the same MF yield as the 3 wt % catalysts, which can enable the production of MF with high yields and reduced catalyst costs. Based on this study, biomass-based renewable activated carbons can be used as catalyst supports in furfural hydrotreatment with high conversions. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - This study reports the synthesis of a nanocomposite comprised of graphene (G) supported manganese dioxide (MnO2) incorporated into the network of polythioaniline (MnO2-G/PTA). The hybrid composite was applied as an electrode material for the development of a bioanode. The bioanode was fabricated by the electrochemical entrapment of ferritin (Frt) as mediator and glucose oxidase (GOx) enzyme in the matrix of the as-synthesized MnO2-G/PTA deposited on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface. The structural features and electrochemical behaviour of the modified electrodes were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results unfolded that the hybrid electroactive support (MnO2-G/PTA) employed for the immobilization of the enzyme (GOx) established an appropriate electrical cabling between the redox enzyme (GOx) and the electrode surface with the assistance provided by the biocompatible mediator (Frt) working to enhance the electrical signals. The developed GCE/MnO2-G/PTA/Frt/GOx bioanode attained a maximum current density of 3.68 mAcm−2 at 35 mM glucose concentration at a scan rate of 100 mVs−1. Thus, the MnO2-G/PTA/Frt/GOx modified electrode possesses high potential and good biocompatibility for bio-electricity production from glucose. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Currently, algal fuel research has commenced to shift toward genetically engineered mutants able to express and excrete desired products directly into the culture. In this study, a mutant strain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, engineered for bisabolene (alternative biodiesel) excretion, was cultivated at different illumination and temperatures to investigate their effects on cell growth and bisabolene production. Moreover, a kinetic model was constructed to identify the desirable conditions for biofuel synthesis. Three original contributions were concluded. First, this work confirmed that bisabolene was partially synthesized independently of biomass growth, indicating its feasibility for continuous production. Second, it was found that while bisabolene synthesis was independent of light intensity, it was strongly affected by temperature, resulting in conflicting desirable conditions for cell growth and product synthesis. Finally, through model prediction, optimal operating conditions were identified for mutant growth and bisabolene synthesis. This study therefore paves the way toward chemostat production and process scale-up. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Life cycle analysis was conducted with a focus on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of renewable gasoline and diesel produced by the integrated hydropyrolysis and hydroconversion (IH2) and the new IH2 plus Fischer-Tropsch (IH2 Plus cool GTL) processes. This new process has a primary objective of increasing the yield of biofuel relative to original IH2 process (increase of 26% to 38% wt) by processing the C1-C3 gas co-products through an integrated Fischer-Tropsch unit to produce liquid-range hydrocarbon biofuel. For both biofuel processes, woody biomass residues (forest logging and saw mills) and algae were investigated as feedstocks. The effect of the electricity generation mix of different states in the U.S. was also examined for algae cultivation. For woody residues as feedstock, life cycle GHG emission savings of about 86.8% and 63.3% were calculated for the IH2 and optimized-IH2 Plus cool GTL hydrocarbon biofuel, respectively, relative to fossil-derived fuel. For algae as feedstock, emission increases of about 140% and 103% were calculated for the IH2 and optimized-IH2 Plus cool GTL, respectively, relative to fossil-derived fuel. The electricity grid mix of the biorefinery location significantly impacts the GHG emissions of the processes for algae feedstock. GHG savings of about 42% can be potentially achieved if the plant was located in an area with a low GHG intensity grid. This study has shown that a significant biofuel yield boost can be achieved while retaining high GHG savings by using IH2 Plus cool GTL for a woody feedstock. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A robust method is needed to achieve high yield all-catalytic conversion of recalcitrant lignocellulosic biomass to transportation fuels while maximizing carbon utilization from raw substrates. To accomplish this, we developed an integrated strategy that combines homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions with a treatment-extraction step to coproduce 2-methylfuran (MF) and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) directly from hardwood poplar while maintaining high catalyst activity. In the first step, poplar wood chips were treated with dilute FeCl3 in THF-water at subpyrolytic temperature to yield 93.5% furfural (FF) from xylan and 66.0% 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from glucan. Concurrently, a highly pure lignin powder was obtained from the liquor by precipitation upon room temperature vacuum recovery of THF from the water. Afterward, FF and HMF were extracted from water into an organic phase consisting of toluene and 1,4-dioxane treated with Ca(OH)2. A second hydrodeoxygenation reaction using Cu-Ni/TiO2 catalyst yielded 87.8% MF from FF and 85.6% DMF from HMF. Characterization of the lignin product showed its molecular weight to be reduced by an order of magnitude from its native state as well as complete removal of its native β-aryl ether linkages without hydrogen input or further heterogeneous catalytic processing. A 60% cumulative yield of MF, DMF, and lignin products from the available carbon (xylan+glucan+lignin) in poplar was achieved, rivaling more mature cellulosic ethanol strategies.

AB  - Bio-oil produced from fast pyrolysis of biomass is a promising substitute for crude oil that can meet climate change mitigation goals, but due to its high oxygen content, it requires upgrading to remove oxygen in order to be used as a transportation fuel. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is one means of upgrading fast pyrolysis oil; however, its main limitation is its large hydrogen requirement. We evaluate an alternative electrochemical deoxygenation (EDOx) method that uses catalytic electrode membranes on a ceramic, oxygen-permeable support to generate hydrogen in situ for deoxygenation at the cathode and oxygen removal at the anode. We analyze the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and scale effects of gas-phase upgrading of pyrolysis oil [300 t/day (MTPD)] using different configurations of EDOx and compare it with the large-scale HDO process (2000 MTPD). We observe that the EDOx configurations have lower total GHG emissions of 5-8.4 and 7.4-11 g of CO2 equiv/MJ for vehicles operated with diesel and gasoline, respectively, compared to HDO (39 g of CO2 equiv/MJ). Furthermore, the EDOx processes offers potentially 10 times more small-scale pyrolysis upgrading facilities in the United States compared to HDO, suggesting that small-scale on-site EDOx processes can reach more inaccessible forest biomass resources.

AB  - Rapeseed plantation biodiesel production systems require the transportation of goods, like raw materials, machines and tools, and products between various conversion stages of agricultural as well as industrial subsystems. Each transportation step requires the consumption of some energy. This consumption decreases the net amount of energy delivered out of the biofuel production system, and consequently decreases the energetic efficiency of the system. The majority of studies on biofuel sustainability are done by means of the LCA method with the use of a data average for some region and period of time. Such analyses do not reveal the possible causes of the conclusions determined. The present work deals with computer modelling of the influence of the energy consumed on those transport routes on the energetic efficiency of the production system. The model enables determination of the effects caused by changes introduced to technological parameters. The effects caused by variation of fuel consumption, the load capacity of transportation means, size of plantation, distribution and sizes of individual fields, distances between fields, plantation yield, and finally the distance between the plantation and the industrial facility are studied using the numerical model developed earlier. This approach is aimed towards identifying the reasons for the behavior of a system controlled by many somewhat coupled variables. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Industrial enzymes can be used to improve the digestibility of livestock feed components, thereby increasing the nutritional value of the feed, and allowing farmers to change and cost-optimize the feed composition. The purpose of this study was to investigate the environmental impacts of adding a starch-degrading enzyme (amylase) to feed for Brazilian chicken production. A lifecycle assessment covering all significant processes in the value chain as well as all significant impact categories was used as analytical tool. The application of amylase increases the energy value of corn in chicken feed and allows saving of costly fat in the feed. In Brazil, the saved fat is used either for biodiesel production or as a replacement for other fats in cleaning and hygiene products. The study showed that approximately 6% of greenhouse-gas emission from Brazilian chicken production could be avoided using the amylase. Using the amylase increases the contribution to nutrient enrichment by 0.6% when the excess fat is used for biodiesel. The use of amylase has little impact on agricultural land use, water consumption and acidification. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - In this paper, glycerol esterification with acetic acid (AA) was studied on several solid acid catalysts: Al2O3, Al-MCM-41, HPA/SiO2, HBEA, Amberlyst 15 and Amberlyst 36 with the aim of determining the reaction conditions and the nature of the surface acid sites required to produce selectively triacetylglycerol (triacetin). The acidity of the catalysts (nature, density and strength of acid sites) was characterized by temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 and FTIR of adsorbed pyridine. Al2O3 (Lewis acidity) did not show any activity in the reaction. In contrast, highest activity and selectivity to the triacetylated product (triacetin) were obtained on catalysts with Brønsted acidity: Amberlyst 15 and Amberlyst 36. The effect of temperature and molar ratio of AA to glycerol was studied, and the results showed that both parameters have a significant impact on the production of the desired product. Glycerol conversion rate and selectivity to triacetin increased when temperature or AA to glycerol molar ratio were increased, reaching a triacetin yield on Amberlyst 36 of 44% at 393 K and AA to glycerol molar ratio of 6. Deactivation and reusability of Amberlyst 36 were evaluated by performing consecutive catalytic tests. The presence of some irreversible deactivation due to sulfur loss was observed. In addition, the feasibility of using crude glycerol from biodiesel production as reactant was also investigated. Conversion of crude pretreated glycerol yielded values of triacetin and diacetin similar to those obtained with the commercial pure glycerol although at a lower rate. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper discusses an evaluation of the environmental impacts of a Municipal Solid Waste Management System using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), with a view to the proposal of improvement actions, the support of decision-making processes, and the establishment of public policies. This study was developed based on an analysis of the solid waste management system of the city of Sorocaba, Brazil (600,000 inhabitants). The LCA was performed using the CML baseline 2000 method of impact assessment. The system consists primarily of the ordinary collection and disposal in a landfill of 488 tons/day of solid wastes containing more than 40% of organic matter and a selective collection which diverts only 17 tons/day of the wastes from landfilling. It was found that emissions of methane in the landfill are responsible for 62% of all the impacts, followed by the transport of ordinary wastes (34.2%). Actions such as increased recycling and the development of composting, anaerobic digestion and incineration of waste would significantly reduce the amount of landfill waste, and hence, the impacts of landfilling. The burning of methane and the use of biofuels by the fleet should be immediately implemented to reduce the impacts provided by this waste management system. © 2018 Widener University School of Civil Engineering.

AB  - Biodiesel has recently attracted much interest as an appropriate alternative for the fossil diesel which is mostly consumed in the transportation sector. Meanwhile, Jatropha Curcas L. has emerged as one of the most promising biofuel feedstocks due largely to its salient features such as compatibility with arid and semi-arid lands. In this regard, this paper unveils a two-stage stochastic programming model for the design of an integrated green biodiesel supply chain network from Jatropha Curcas feedstocks. The concerned biodiesel supply chain design is an environmentally friendly mixed-integer linear programming, multi-period and multi-product model. Furthermore, a flexible stochastic programming approach is developed and applied to the supply chain network model. This proposed approach is indeed an extension of a two-stage scenario-based stochastic programming approach which incorporates min-max relative regret in a soft worst-case framework. Given the natural variability of long-term decision-making, fuel demand and Jatropha Curcas trees yielding are hemmed in by uncertainty in this model. The performance of the proposed framework and biodiesel supply chain network design is corroborated through ten realizations and a myriad of various analyses in a real case study of Iran. The derived results and their analyses acknowledge the efficiency and applicability of the model. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Utilization of fly ash, a byproduct of coal combustion in thermal power plants, is a sustainable use of waste for power generation. Discarding fly ash as waste in landfills/ash ponds may not only be regarded as a loss of valuable land and essential nutrients, but also pose a significant health hazard due to fine air-borne particles and leaching of heavy metals. The presence of essential macro- and micronutrients and its porosity make fly ash an excellent soil amendment for plant growth as an organic nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) supplementation. As harmful heavy metals make fly ash unsafe for agronomy, bioenergy crop plantation and energy generation from different thermochemical conversions of the biomass would be an ideal method for coal fly ash utilization through which carbon-neutral fuel can be generated from fossil fuel, thus reducing climate change impact. This review summarizes the development of bioenergy plantation and silviculture at fly ash dumpsites with an integrated phyto-bio-rhizo-mycoremediation approach and assesses utilization of the valuable biomass for thermal energy, electricity, and biofuel generation with inclusion of a SWOT analysis (a strategic technique typically used to help identify the strength, weakness, opportunities, and threat). Bioenergy crop production through integrated phytomanagement can generate billions of dollars of wealth from waste and provides a sustainable solution for fly ash management, with environmental, economic, and social benefits. © 2018 Soil Science Society of China

AB  - This study reports the synthesis, physicochemical characterization by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and solid-state MAS NMR (1H, 23Na, 29Si and 119Sn MAS NMR) of a metallo-stannosilicate and its application as a heterogeneous catalyst for biodiesel production via ethanolysis and methanolysis routes using edible, non-edible an waste oils as feedstocks. XRD characterization of the metallo-stannosilicate has revealed a typical structure of mixed octahedral-pentahedral-tetrahedral material with an orthorhombic unit cell (a = 14.522°C, b = 12.469°C, and c = 10.654°C). 119Sn single-pulse MAS NMR results presented two resonance lines, at δ1 =-683.8 ppm and δ2 =-690.9 ppm, which were assigned to the tin octahedrally coordinated in the metallo-stannosilicate structure. Heterogenous catalytic studies in the transesterification of refined edible, non-edible, and waste oils have resulted in high yields of FAMEs and FAEEs (fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters), nevertheless the highest FAMES (98.2%) and FAEEs (96.6%) yields were obtained for non-edible microalgae oil extracted from the genetically modified heterotrophic algal strain Prototheca moriformis. Catalytic studies also using non-edible macaw palm oil (Acrocomia aculeata) with a high content of free fatty acids (FFAs) demonstrated that the catalyst could simultaneously perform esterification and transesterification reactions. These findings indicate the potential application of this novel metallo-stannosilicate in the production of renewable and environmentally clean biofuels, like biodiesel, using different sources of lipids feedstocks, notably those that do not compete with food production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Novel aqueous-phase processing (APP) techniques can thermochemically convert cellulosic biomass into chemicals and liquid fuels. Here, we evaluate these technologies through process design and simulation, and from a techno-economic and environmental point of view. This is the first peer-reviewed study that conducts such an assessment taking into account different biomass pretreatment methods, process yields, product slates, and hydrogen sources, as well as the historical price variation of a number of core commodities involved in the production. This paper undertakes detailed process simulations for seven biorefinery models designed to convert red maple wood using a set of APP technologies into chemicals (e.g. furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural and gamma-valerolactone) and liquid fuels (e.g. naphtha, jet fuel and diesel). The simulation results are used to conduct a well-to-wake (WTW) lifecycle analysis for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and minimum selling price (MSP) calculations based on historical commodity price data from January 2010 to December 2015. An emphasis has been given towards aviation fuels throughout this work, and the results have been reported and discussed extensively for these fuels. It is found that the WTW GHG emissions and the MSP of jet fuel vary across the different refinery configurations from 31.6-104.5 gCO2e per MJ (64% lower and 19% higher, respectively, than a reported petroleum-derived fuel baseline) and $1.00-6.31 per gallon ($0.26-1.67 per liter, which is 61% lower and 146% higher, respectively, than the average conventional jet fuel price of the above time frame). It has been shown that the variation in the estimated emissions and fuel selling prices is primarily driven by the choice of hydrogen source and the relative production volumes of chemicals to fuels, respectively. The latter is a consequence of the fact that the APP chemicals considered here have a higher economic value than the liquid transportation fuels, and that their production is less carbon intensive compared to these fuels. However, the chemical market may get saturated if they are produced in large quantities, and increasing biofuel production over that of chemicals can help the biorefinery benefit under renewable fuel programs. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to study the co-cultivation of Chlorella sp. and wastewater wild algae under different cultivation conditions (i.e. CO2, light intensity, cultivation time, and inoculation ratio) for enhanced algal biomass and lipid productivity in wastewater medium using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The results show that mixed cultures of Chlorella sp. and wastewater wild algae increase biomass and lipid yield. Additionally, findings indicate that CO2, light intensity and cultivation time significantly affect algal productivity. Furthermore, CO2 concentration and light intensity, and CO2 concentration and algal composition, have an interactive effect on biomass productivity. Under different cultivation conditions, the response of algal biomass, cell count, and lipid productivity ranges from 2.5 to 10.2 mg/mL, 1.1 × 106 to 8.2 × 108 cells/mL, and 1.1 × 1012 to 6.8 × 1012 total fluorescent units/mL, respectively. The optimum conditions for simultaneous biomass and lipid accumulation are 3.6% of CO2 (v/v), 160 µmol/m2/s of light intensity, 1.6/2.4 of inoculation ratio (wastewater-algae/Chlorella), and 8.3 days of cultivation time. The optimal productivity is 9.8 (g/L) for dry biomass, 8.6 E + 08 (cells/mL) for cell count, and 6.8 E + 12 (Total FL units per mL) for lipid yield, achieving up to four times, eight times, and seven times higher productivity compared to nonoptimized conditions. Provided is a supportive methodology to improve mixed algal culture for bioenergy feedstock generation and to optimize cultivation conditions in complex wastewater environments. This work is an important step forward in the development of sustainable large-scale algae cultivation for cost-efficient generation of biofuel.

AB  - The adsorptive membrane had been prepared successfully by embedding purolite particles on polymer chitosan employing phase inversion method. The obtained membranes were characterized and used to purify crude biodiesel from acid, soap-level content and total glycerol. The result has shown that the adsorptive membranes have an open porous structure and the purolite particle surface is available for adsorption of contaminants in which the optimum compositions of the adsorptive membranes were 3% (g/v) of chitosan, 15% (v/v) of DMF and 60% of purolite particles. The porosity and the swelling degree of the membrane were 42.83% and 51.95% respectively. The membrane of clean water flux was 254.4 Lm-2h-1 at the transmembrane pressure of 1 bar. The obtained membrane has shown a good performance on capturing some contaminants in crude biodiesel. The highest adsorption capacity of the membrane could be obtained at 60 minutes of its contact time and the acid value in biodiesel was reduced from 1.07 to below 0.19 mg/g, agreeing with a standard value. The highest soap adsorption value was up to 78.57%, which was obtained by using the adsorptive membrane. The total glycerol can be reduced to be above 63.93% after biodiesel sample treatment with the prepared membrane. Finally, it could be noticed that the membranes can be reused for multiple adsorptions with a high adsorption capacity. © 2018 World Research Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Waste utilization is essential and challenging. Utilization of wastes gives environmental, economic, and social benefits. In this study, inexpensive, sulfonated solid acid catalysts were successfully prepared from palm empty fruit bunch (PEFB), coconut meal residue (CMR), and coconut coir husk (CH) waste by a simple protocol. It was found that prepared PEFB–BCS–SO3H, CMR–BCS–SO3H, and CH–BCS–SO3H catalysts have 4.79, 3.75, and 2.80 mmol g-1 acid density and 739.0, 89.77, and 61.49 m2 g-1 surface areas, respectively. Further, the presence of active functional groups on the surface of the catalysts was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Thermal stability of the catalysts was found below 150°C. Results show that biodiesel yield increases with increasing reaction time and methanol loading, when using microwave heating for biodiesel production from waste palm oil (WPO) and prepared catalysts. A maximum biodiesel yield of 95.5% was obtained by PEFB–BCS–SO3H in 60 minutes using 20:1 methanol:oil (molar ratio) at 70°C. CMR–BCS–SO3H and CH–BCS–SO3H obtained 88.7 and 88.5% biodiesel yields in 60 minutes, using 20:1 and 16:1 methanol:oil (molar ratio), at 70 and 110°C, respectively. Even though, the activity of the catalysts decreased during reuse, these are still of interest as the waste biomass of PEFB, CMR, and CH can be used for catalyst preparation and microwave-assisted biodiesel production from WPO. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Thermochemical conversion of lignocellulosic biomass and downstream processing represents an attractive alternative in biomass-to-liquid fuels (BtL) production. There are several thermochemical conversion routes that not only can produce fossil-like fuels but also can simultaneously produce a wider range of fuels in terms of gasoline and diesel profiles. In this work, synthesis, evaluation, and integration of conversion of softwood biomass to liquid transportation fuels are investigated within a systematic framework. Five BtL conversion processes were presented by combining promising thermochemical conversion, upgrading, and separation technologies. Process flowsheet setups and simulations are performed with Aspen Plus version 8.8. The total production processes are evaluated with both products profiles and costs indicators for capital, energy, and total annual costs. Finally, opportunities for process integration to improve the process performance are explored for four integration scenarios. The base case processes with and without integrations were compared to quantify the effect of the integrations on the total annual cost (TAC) and emissions. It was obtained that energy and mass integration could reduce the TAC of the gasification-LTFT-fractional upgrading-fractionation process by 25% and liquid and gas emissions by 97% (wt) and 43% (wt), respectively. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The Brazilian sugar-energy sector (SES) is facing an increasing challenge due to the worldwide expansion of biofuel consumption as a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, making yield improvement and land and water availability key factors in addressing this situation. Consequently, our main aim here is to identify SES vulnerability under climate change conditions, based on the methodology used by the Agricultural Zoning of Climatic Risks (ZARC) program. We assessed changes of the sugarcane ZARC in light of the current and near-future climatic conditions given by eight general circulation models (GCM) of the 5th IPCC report and under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5. We identified a conversion of the current climatic risk levels in the Brazilian central-southern macro-region for sugarcane in future climate change scenarios, but the spatial distribution of these changes is heterogeneous. The current expansion areas located mainly in southern Goiás and northwest of São Paulo are marked by an increase in areas of low water availability in the future, while the traditional production areas, east of São Paulo, do not present this same vulnerability. Sugarcane cultivation in the south of Goiás is already occurring based on a complementary irrigation (of about 50 mm per month from April to September) to reach a yield similar to traditional areas located in São Paulo state. The development of drought-resistant cultivars based on genetic engineering and the efficiency of the irrigation systems used on a large spatial scale and also in the long term are two key points of concern in the Brazilian context of greenhouse gas emission mitigation. The challenges for the traditional production regions are related to the production system’s ability to regulate the capacity and idleness of sugarcane mills aiming to avoid current and future competition by same raw material. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The European Commission has developed a series of regulatory measures to introduce alternative energy technologies, including a binding target for a specified share of biofuel in petrol and diesel, in European Union (EU) member states. The instruments to achieve this goal include taxation, subsidies and legal restraints. Biofuel suffers from the problem of being uncompetitive, and the intervention addresses the price gap between conventional fuel and biofuel. The enthusiasm for biofuel is particularly high in peripheral regions such as the northern provinces of Sweden and Finland. Expectations include renewed economic growth and employment opportunities. However, when studying the economic impact of the biofuel regulatory framework with the help of the concept of property economics, it becomes clear that the framework generates investment in biofuel production due to distorted price signals and expected profits. From the perspective of property economics, the biofuel framework challenges property rights as it requires people’s appropriated means to be put into the effort of biofuel production. The artificial change of investment conditions may lead to the formation of an investment bubble. This distorts the interweaving structure of capital goods, which contributes to the manufacturing of biofuel, including machinery and wood products. As bubbles are bound to burst, people in the affected territories may be left with a lower living standard and greater exposure to the consequences. Therefore, the biofuel regulatory framework leads to unsustainable conditions. © 2018 National Council of Applied Economic Research.

AB  - New technologies such as microwaves have gained a large deal of attention from scientists and industries who sought increased rate of production processes. In this study, microwave irradiation was utilized to produce a novel KOH/Ca12Al14O33 nanocatalyst used for biodiesel production. As support, calcium aluminate was prepared by microwave combustion method using different fuels including urea, glycine, sorbitol, and citric acid. The samples were then impregnated by KOH to improve their catalytic activities for microwave-enhanced transesterification of canola oil for biodiesel production. Results of XRD, BET, FTIR, TG, EDX, and FE-SEM analyses showed differences in physicochemical properties of the samples when using different fuels with different flame characteristics and combustion temperatures. Only the urea-fueled sample showed the crystalline structure of monocalcium aluminate (CaAl2O4), with the other samples exhibiting amorphous structure of CaO–Al2O3. However, all samples, except for that prepared by citric acid, transformed to crystalline structure of Ca12Al14O33 by calcination during KOH impregnation. Among the samples, the KOH/Ca12Al14O33 nanocatalyst prepared by sorbitol showed the highest activity in microwave-enhanced biodiesel production because of its large surface area, pore size, and basicity, converting 93.4% of canola oil to biodiesel at a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 18, catalyst concentration of 4 wt%, and microwave output power of 450 W in 60 min of reaction time. Moreover, the sample showed well-distributed particle sizes without any agglomeration, so that it could easily maintain its level of activity for several rounds of use. © 2017, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Biodiesel is the main substitute for petrodiesel being constituted by several alkyl esters including unsaturated compounds. It can undergo partial oxidation when stored for long periods and transported over long distances. The aims of this study were to analyze the impact of the oxidation process on the physicochemical properties of biodiesel and its remediation through distillation and esterification. Due to its high susceptibility to oxidation, sunflower biodiesel was used as a model. Specific mass, cloud point, cold filter plugging point, oxidation stability and iodine value were the properties analyzed. The results revealed that the treatments affected each sample differently, and in some cases the product after remediation had properties close to or even better than the initial biodiesel. The results reported here indicate that although biodiesel undergoes degradation during storage and transport, this does not mean the affected fuel cannot be marketed. Some important properties can be recovered with simple treatment. © 2017, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Fatty acid esters (methyl and ethyl) prepared from babassu nut oil were blended with the respective esters from soybean oil. These binary blends (babassu:soybean) were made in proportions of 10:90, 20:80, 30:70, 40:60, and 50:50 (vol%). The ester content of all the blends was higher than 96.5%, which is the minimum value required by the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis, ANP). The thermal properties of the babassu, soybean and binary mixtures of esters were investigated by thermogravimetry-differential thermogravimetry (TG/DTG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The thermal stability of the blended biodiesels decreased as the total contents of the babassu esters increased. From the experiments it was found that babassu methanol biodiesel is stable up to 49.6 °C and the ethanol biodiesel is stable up to 53.7 °C in air. The methyl esters blends were thermally stable up to 83.2 and 56.8 °C, for 90:10 and 50:50 blends (soybean:babassu), respectively. The ethyl ester blends presented values of temperature ranges somewhat higher than the methyl esters, such as 85.2 and 64.5 °C for 90:10 and 50:50 blends, respectively. The esters from babassu oil have satisfactory performance at low temperatures with respect to the point of crystallization, which were below-9.8 °C for ethylic esters and-8.5 °C for methylic esters. A good correlation between the crystallization onset temperature and the increase in the concentration of the babassu oil esters was obtained in the mixtures analyses. In the 50:50 combination (babassu:soybean), the crystallization onset temperature were-6.73 and-9.12 °C for methyl and ethyl esters, respectively.

AB  - The article quantifies, in a set of 23 countries, the amounts consumed of vegetable oils, the amounts of used oils produced after cooking, the amounts available for valorisation, and finally the quantities being valorised. The management practices adopted are also reviewed. Based on data collected, a production factor, relating vegetable oil consumption with used cooking oil production, of 0.32 is proposed. The valorisation factor, which quantifies the fraction of UCO being valorised, is higher in better performing countries (0.749) and worst in the remaining (0.232). Three consumption-valorisation factors, relating consumption with valorisation, were obtained: for high performing countries (0.274); intermediate performing (0.105); and under-performing (0.078). The management systems adopted by the different countries are based on either second-generation economic instruments (USA and Brazil), or on third-generation economic instruments (EU, Argentina, Japan). The former has allowed countries to attain better valorisation rates. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The microwave-metal interaction pyrolysis technique has great potential of producing highly upgraded bio-oils from the biomass. In this study, the heat of the sparking metals in a microwave oven was utilized to pyrolyze the biomass into bio-oil, biogas and char. Using this technique, highly upgraded preliminary bio-oil was produced from the water hyacinth biomass. The effect of the metal type and gauge size on the product quality and composition was investigated by using different heat generating antennas. The bio-oil, obtained with each metal coil, was analyzed with Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) technique. The gaseous products were characterized using spot test and combustibility analysis. Significant difference in the chemical composition of the bio-oils, produced with different metal coils, was noticed in these investigations. For all the tested metals, the oxygen and hydrocarbon content in the oil product was found significantly lower than those obtained through conventional pyrolysis. Also, unlike the thermal or thermo-catalytic pyrolysis, the bio-oil product of the microwave-metal interaction pyrolysis did not contain any water content. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Studies on the natural human exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and their elements composition are practically non-existent in South America. In order to understand the natural exposure of the typical Brazilian population to PM2.5 and their trace element composition, we measured PM2.5 concentrations and collected mass on filters for nine continuous hours during a typical workday of volunteers. In addition, bus routes were performed at peak and non-peak periods, mimicking the routine activity of the population. Mean concentrations of PM2.5 in the bus and car groups were similar while the fraction of BCe was higher for the bus group. For all routes, mean PM2.5 concentrations were higher during peak than non-peak hours, with an average of 43.5 ± 33.1 μg m−3 and 14.3 ± 10.2 μg m−3, respectively. The trace elements S, K and Na originated mainly from vehicle emissions; Na was associated with the presence of biofuel in diesel. Toxic elements (Pb, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, Mn) were found at low levels as evident by the total hazard index that ranged from 2.15 × 10−03 to 1.38 for volunteers. For all routes, the hazard index ranged from 2.25 × 10−03 to 5.03. Average PM2.5 respiratory deposition dose was estimated to be 0.60 μg/kg-hour for peak hours. Potential health damages to people during their movements and at workplaces close to the traffic were identified. Improvements in the design of the building to reduce the entrance of air pollutants as well as the use of filters in the buses could help to limit population exposure. © 2018

AB  - Ethanol is a renewable fuel and it is considered an alternative to gasoline in Otto-cycle engines. The present study evaluated the behavior of exhaustion gas carbon monoxide (CO) and total hydrocarbons (THC) according to the levels of anhydrous ethyl alcohol (AEA) added to gasoline in different proportions (E0, E10, E20, E27, that is, pure gasoline and its blends with AEA at 10, 20, and 27% v/v) in the use of non-road single cylinder engines of different powers (13 and 6.5 hp), to the loads applied to engine-generators and the air-fuel ratio (A/F) admitted to the engine cylinders. Also, the performance of engine-generators was verified in terms of mass, specific and energetic consumption and efficiency of the evaluated systems for the same blends and loads. The results showed that an increase in the AEA content in the blend resulted in significant drops in CO and THC concentrations for both engine-generators, while fuel consumption showed a slight upward trend; the increases in applied loads resulted in an increase in CO and THC concentrations and fuel consumption. In general, a higher AEA content (oxygenated) in the blends had a greater effect on gaseous emissions compared to the effect on consumption and system efficiency. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This work examines the effects of diesel fuel oxygenation on the combustion and emissions in a direct injection (DI) diesel engine. This is a predominately computational study, where the influence of the fuel oxygen content at various injection timings and loads is addressed by using an in-house, comprehensive, two-zone model of DI diesel engine combustion, which divides the cylinder contents into a nonburning zone of air and another zone in which fuel is continuously supplied from the injector and burned with entrained air from the air zone. The validity of the model results is assessed favorably against pertinent experimental data, such as cylinder pressure and heat release rate (HRR) diagrams and nitric oxide (NO) and soot emissions generated in this laboratory by conducting tests on an experimental, single-cylinder, DI Hydra (Ricardo/Cussons, Manchester, United Kingdom) diesel engine operated at two different loads and injection timings. Various degrees of oxygenation of conventional diesel fuel and various injection timings were undertaken in the theoretical study at each load. The numerical simulation results provide insight into the local combustion and emissions formation conditions. Numerical modeling determined that cylinder pressures, temperatures, and NO emissions increase, whereas soot emissions decrease with the degree of fuel oxygenation at any load, and also that cylinder pressures, temperatures, and NO emissions decrease, whereas soot emissions increase by retarding the injection timing at any load. These results are used for discussing the implications they have on the behavior of biofuels or diesel fuel blends, where the fuel-bound oxygen and ignition delay (embodied here in the injection timing variable) are the main parameters dictating their behavior. At least for the case of some common biofuels in blends with diesel fuel, it is shown that lower injection timings and higher degrees of biofuel blend oxygenation (inside limiting values) can alleviate the notorious NO-smoke trade-off with respect to a point of lower oxygenation degree lying on a higher injection timing NO-smoke curve (at any constant load). © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - In the present study, the combined effect of alumina nanoparticles into the Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel blend and exhaust gas recirculation on the combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of a diesel engine was investigated. The alumina (Al2O3) nanoparticles with the mass fraction of 40 ppm were dispersed into the C. inophyllum biodiesel blend (20% of C. inophyllum biodiesel + 80% of diesel (CIB20)) by the ultrasonication process. Further, the exhaust gas recirculation was adopted to control the oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions of a diesel engine. The experiments were conducted on a single cylinder diesel engine with the diesel, CIB20, 20% of C. inophyllum biodiesel + 80% of diesel + 40 ppm Al2O3 nanoparticles (CIB20ANP40), CIB20 + 20% exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), and CIB20ANP40 + 20% EGR fuel samples at different load conditions. The results reveal that brake thermal efficiency of CIB20ANP40 fuel increased by 5.04 and 7.71% compared to the CIB20 and CIB20ANP40 + 20% EGR fuels, respectively. The addition of alumina nanoparticles to the CIB20 fuel, CO, and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions were was reduced compared to the CIB20 fuel. The smoke opacity was decreased with the addition of alumina nanoparticles to the CIB20 fuel by 7.3% compared to the CIB20 fuel. The NOx emissions for the CIB20ANP40 + 20% EGR fuel was decreased by 36.84, 31.53, and 17.67% compared to the CIB20, CIB20ANP40, and CIB20 + 20% EGR fuel samples at full load condition. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The use of Fast Pyrolysis Bio-Oil (FPBO) as fuel was studied in a small scale non-regenerated micro gas turbine, set up in a dedicated test rig. The system includes a dedicated injection line and a modified combustor to burn efficiently high volume fractions of FPBO-in-ethanol solution. The effect of the larger combustor volume improved the quality of the combustion of the reference diesel oil and pure ethanol as regards exhaust emissions, while maintaining unchanged fuel consumptions of the original configuration. Tests with 20/80 and 50/50% (volume fractions) of FPBO/ethanol blends showed successfully and stable engine operation. By increasing the FPBO volume fraction in the fuel blend, an increase in CO emissions was observed - probably due to the larger droplets derived from the more viscous fuel - as well as in NOX emissions - probably due to fuel-bound nitrogen. Considering the proposed modifications and FPBO/ethanol blend as fuel, the engine reached an overall electrical efficiency higher than that measured with benchmark diesel fuel. A final run with 100% FPBO feeding showed unstable combustion with the presence of carbon deposits in the hot parts of the system, showing that the present configuration requires further modifications to achieve this goal. Guidelines were provided for the implementation of further upgraded solutions for MGTs towards viscous, acidic and aqueous fuels feeding. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A systematic study of the effect of nitrogen levels in the cultivation medium of Chlorella vulgaris microalgae grown in photobioreactor (PBR) on biomass productivity, biochemical and elemental composition, fatty acid profile, heating value (HHV), and composition of the algae-derived fast pyrolysis (bio-oil) is presented in this work. A relatively high biomass productivity and cell concentration (1.5 g of dry biomass per liter of cultivation medium and 120 × 106 cells/ml, respectively) were achieved after 30 h of cultivation under N-rich medium. On the other hand, the highest lipid content (ca. 36 wt.% on dry biomass) was obtained under N-depletion cultivation conditions. The medium and low N levels favored also the increased concentration of the saturated and mono-unsaturated C16:0 and C18:1(n-9) fatty acids (FA) in the lipid/oil fraction, thus providing a raw lipid feedstock that can be more efficiently converted to high-quality biodiesel or green diesel (via hydrotreatment). In terms of overall lipid productivity, taking in consideration both the biomass concentration in the medium and the content of lipids on dry biomass, the most effective system was the N-rich one. The thermal (non-catalytic) pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris microalgae produced a highly complex bio-oil composition, including fatty acids, phenolics, ethers, ketones, etc., as well as aromatics, alkanes, and nitrogen compounds (pyrroles and amides), originating from the lipid, protein, and carbohydrate fractions of the microalgae. However, the catalytic fast pyrolysis using a highly acidic ZSM-5 zeolite, afforded a bio-oil enriched in mono-aromatics (BTX), reducing at the same time significantly oxygenated compounds such as phenolics, acids, ethers, and ketones. These effects were even more pronounced in the catalytic fast pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris residual biomass (after extraction of lipids), thus showing for the first time the potential of transforming this low value by-product towards high added value platform chemicals. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Real geometric structures of randomly packed beds are modeled using the discrete element software LIGGGHTS. The wall-adapting local eddy-viscosity (WALE) model and the EBU-Arrhenius combustion model are used to simulate the propane-air premixed combustion process in the randomly packed beds, and the calculated results are compared with experimental data. The results reveal that the turbulence model and combustion model used in this paper are reasonable. Next, propagation velocity, area, mean vorticity and fractal dimension of a flame surface are calculated at various time points with different inlet velocities to investigate the changes in flame characteristics during the combustion process and the effect of increasing the inlet velocity. According to our results, the flame propagation velocity changes do not exhibit a clear trend over time. However, the variation trends of the two curves under the different inlet velocities are similar. In addition, the fractal dimension exhibits no obvious rule of increasing or decreasing during the combustion process. The area and mean vorticity of the flame surface increase with time. However, the rules of increase are not exactly the same. In addition, the flame regimes at various time points are identified. The results reveal that the turbulent premixed flames in a packed bed under two inlet velocities are concentrated in the thin reaction zone. © 2018

AB  - The energy situation and the concerns about global warming nowadays have ignited research interest in non-conventional and alternative fuel resources to decrease the emission and the continuous dependency on fossil fuels, particularly for various sectors like power generation, transportation, and agriculture. In the present work, the research is focused on evaluating the performance, emission characteristics, and combustion of biodiesel such as palm kernel methyl ester with the addition of diesel additive “triacetin” in it. A timed manifold injection (TMI) system was taken up to examine the influence of durations of several blends induced on the emission and performance characteristics as compared to normal diesel operation. This experimental study shows better performance and releases less emission as compared with mineral diesel and in turn, indicates that high performance and low emission is promising in PKME-triacetin fuel operation. This analysis also attempts to describe the application of the fuzzy logic-based Taguchi analysis to optimize the emission and performance parameters. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The use of human and animal wastes for fertilization of aquaculture ponds has been practiced for thousands of years. In the present work, we have used the excreta (human urine, poultry waste, cow dung, and urine) as a nutrient source for the cultivation of Chlorella singularis, Micractinium pusillum, and Chlorella sorokiniana strains of microalgae. Different solid wastes were treated with 60 mM H2SO4 for the extraction of nutrients. After treatment, the supernatant of different solid wastes and liquid waste were diluted 5, 10, 15, and 20% to be used as a media for the cultivation of microalgae. Chlorella sorokiniana was able to grow in all concentration of excreta media. The maximum growth rate 140 ± 3.1 mg/L/day and lipid production (45.5 ± 2.3 mg/L/day) was obtained in 20% poultry. Among the different excreta media used for cultivation of microalgae, poultry media displayed the best results and thus, should be used for large scale cultivation of microalgae. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The United States (US) military plans to acquire drop-in biofuels (renewable diesel and biojet fuel) to reduce carbon emissions and diversify military energy portfolio. To expedite this endeavor, the military provided direct financial incentives to offset investment costs of selected drop-in biofuel demonstration facilities. It is not known if investment incentives alone will stimulate the creation of a full-scale advanced biofuel supply chain capable of meeting US military demands, given limited availability of low-cost sustainable biomass feedstocks in some areas and considering the uncertainty in global oil prices. The objective of this work is to determine 1) whether a state in the US can meet its share of military biofuel targets from local biomass resources, and 2) if direct financial incentives can expedite the development of the military biofuel supply chain, under two different oil price scenarios. The Biofuel supply chain GeoSpatial and Temporal Optimizer (BioGeSTO), was developed for that purpose and applied to the state of California, USA from 2020 to 2040. The BioGeSTO model determined that biomass resources in California can meet 12-19% of its annual military targets between 2020 and 2040 of renewable diesel and biojet fuel using the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) and Hydro-Treatment of Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) conversion technologies. However, under the reference oil price scenario, only HEFA conversion facilities introduced at 2027 in Kings County were found feasible. Under the high oil price scenario, both the HEFA and FT technologies were financially feasible and the supply chain production approaches the theoretical production limit by 2032. In both scenarios, providing investment incentives has a modest impact on expediting the supply chain, as facilities are introduced only 1-3 years earlier when receiving direct investment incentives. Sensitivity analysis shows that biomass availability has the greatest impact on the supply chain performance such that a 50% increase in the baseline amount of biomass feedstock results in a 150% surge in the total cumulative production. In conclusion, the reference oil price scenario drastically limits the ability of California to meet its military drop-in biofuel targets. Assuming a high oil price scenario, the state may be able to meet military biofuel targets by subsidizing local biomass production and importing the rest of the biomass required for this purpose from the northwestern states of Washington and Oregon. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the context of home healthcare services, patients may need to be visited multiple times by different healthcare specialists who may use a fleet of heterogeneous vehicles. In addition, some of these visits may need to be synchronized with each other for performing a treatment at the same time. We call this problem the Heterogeneous Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem with Synchronized visits (HF-VRPS). It consists of planning a set of routes for a set of light duty vehicles running on alternative fuels. We propose three population-based hybrid Artificial Bee Colony metaheuristic algorithms for the HF-VRPS. These algorithms are tested on newly generated instances and on a set of homogeneous VRPS instances from the literature. Besides producing quality solutions, our experimental results illustrate the trade-offs between important factors, such as CO2 emissions and driver wage. The computational results also demonstrate the advantages of adopting a heterogeneous fleet rather than a homogeneous one for the use in home healthcare services. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, homogeneous catalyst “Sulfosuccinic acid” was added into the polymer matrix, and the functional catalytic membrane was prepared. Chitosan was chosen as a polymeric material. Sulfosuccinic acid (SSA) loaded functional chitosan membranes have been used to synthesize fuel bioadditive ethyl levulinate in a pervaporation catalytic membrane reactor. The functional membrane was characterized by the TGA and SEM. The performance of SSA loaded functional chitosan membranes was investigated with binary mixtures of ethanol/water under varying operating conditions (feed concentration, temperature, SSA amount) to study the influence on separation performance. Pervaporation catalytic membrane reactor experiments were carried out to optimize operating conditions such as reaction time, reaction temperature, catalyst amount, and molar feed ratio. The kinetic model in PVCMR with the functional membrane was applied to the experimental data. The theoretical conversion data were fitted well with the experimental data. The proposed model is found as suitable for the study being conducted. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel, typically produced from non-food crops with heterogeneous catalysts, deems to be a promising and sustainable alternative biofuel to petroleum-derived fuels. In this study, to improve biodiesel production process efficiency by acids, biodiesel production were successfully developed using a series of magnetically acidic poly(ionic liquid) catalysts with varying hydrophobicity and controllable acidity. The detailed characterization results demonstrated that the FnmS-PIL (1a, C8) core-shell structure catalyst had large Bruner Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area (128.1 m2/g), uniform mesoporous structure (4.2 nm), strong magnetism (12.4 emu/g), a high number of acid sites (2.14 mmol/g), strong acid strength (strong electron-withdrawing anion CF3SO3 − effect, −8.2 &lt; H0 &lt; −5.6) and strong hydrophobicity (water contact angle, 115.4°). For the biodiesel production, high biodiesel yields could be achieved by the esterification of oleic acid (by response surface methodology, RSM) and (trans)esterification of crude Euphorbia lathyris L. oils with an acid value of 24.59 mg KOH/g (by single factor optimization). Furthermore, a relative kinetic study was conducted wherein the activation energy was calculated as 39.2 kJ/mol and a pseudo-first-order model was determined for esterification. More importantly, the FnmS-PIL (1a, C8) catalyst was separated simply using a magnet and exhibited constant activity with biodiesel yield of 87.5% after five cycles in (trans)esterification. In addition, the biodiesel yield was maintained above 90% even with a water content of 6 wt% with respect to crude Euphorbia lathyris L. oils, and the fuel properties of Euphorbia lathyris L. biodiesel were found to satisfy the EN 14212 and ASTM D6751 standards, highlighting its potential in industrial biodiesel production as derived from crude non-food oil resources. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Beech wood has been converted into a mixture of oxygen-free naphtha and diesel boiling point range hydrocarbons by using catalytic hydropyrolysis in a fluid bed reactor with a CoMoS/MgAl2O4 catalyst, followed by deep hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) in a fixed bed reactor loaded with a NiMoS/Al2O3 catalyst. The effect of varying the temperature (365-511 °C) and hydrogen pressure (1.6-3.6 MPa) on the product yield and organic composition was studied. The mass balance closed by a mass fraction between 90 and 101% dry ash free basis (daf). The yield of the combined condensed organics and C4+ varied between a mass fraction of 17 and 22% daf, corresponding to an energy recovery of between 40 and 53% in the organic product. The yield of the non-condensable gases varied between a mass fraction of 24 and 32% daf and the char yield varied between 9.6 and 18% daf. The condensed organics contained a mass fraction of 42-75% aromatics, based on GC × GC-FID chromatographic peak area, and the remainder was primarily naphthenes with minor amounts of paraffins. The condensed organics were essentially oxygen free (mass fraction below 0.001%) when both reactors were used. Bypassing the HDO reactor increased the oxygen concentration in the condensed liquid to a mass fraction of 1.8%. The results show that catalytic hydropyrolysis may be a viable way to process solid biomass into liquid and gaseous fuels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effect of coupling leaching with torrefaction pretreatment process on bio-oil production from catalytic fast pyrolysis using ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst was evaluated by Py-GC/MS. During coupling leaching with torrefaction pretreatment, the fuel characteristics and structural characteristics of rice husk samples were changed, which were evaluated using proximate, ultimate, and calorific analyses, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD) techniques. The experimental results of catalytic fast pyrolysis indicated that coupling leaching with torrefaction pretreatment further improved the relative contents of BTX (benzene, toluene and xylene) compounds in bio-oil compared to that of raw rice husk sample. It was mainly ascribed to the effective removal of metallic species during leaching process. In addition, the selective removal of hemicellulose fraction and the increasing lignin fraction and changes in the structure of lignin (cleavage of ether linkages and demethoxylation) during torrefaction process also plays positive roles. Severe torrefaction process resulted in the cross-linking and charring of sample, thus reducing the formation of BTX compounds. Thus, coupling leaching with middle torrefaction pretreatment process was the optimum pretreatment conditions for catalytic fast pyrolysis of rice husk samples. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - While biodiesel production is on the rise, so too is the production of the low-value product, glycerol. Interesterification is an alternative reaction that produces fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and avoids the production of glycerol. In this work, ferric sulfate is used as a potential heterogeneous catalyst for interesterification of model triglyceride, triolein, using methyl acetate. Reaction conditions were optimized by varying reaction temperature, methyl acetate to oil mole ratio (MAOMR), catalyst loading, as well as FAME as co-solvents. Additionally, this work also evaluated the effect of typical triglyceride feedstock contaminants, water and free fatty acids (FFA). The optimal reaction conditions were found to be 120 °C, 20:1 MAOMR and a mass loading of 7.5% ferric sulfate with yields up to 83%. The addition of FAME and water in the system is shown to have potential benefits on reaction rate and yield while FFA addition had mildly negative impacts on initial reaction rate. The results in this work show relatively high yields at mild temperatures and reagents loadings and could be a promising means of alternative FAME production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Widely blended in the transportation fuels, biofuels have been generally regarded as indispensable components in the U.S. national energy portfolio. Although the current production of cellulosic biofuels has been staggering at pilot scales, it is expected that large-scale cultivation of cellulosic biofuel crops may occur when techniques for cost-effective bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol are available. However, it is still unclear if enough land is in existence to accommodate potential large-scale lignocellulosic crops development without negative effects on the environment and food market. The appropriate land use for the next-generation biofuel crops should be planned and allocated in a manner that the competitive use of land dedicated to food and energy production and other side effects could be minimized. This research proposes an approach of identifying the potential available land for planting switchgrass in the U.S. Midwest using a GIS-based multi-criteria analysis that combines soil and water constraint factors. The results showed that land areas of approximately 13.6 million ha are unsuitable for profitable food crops but available for switchgrass cultivation in 7 U.S. Great Plains states. The findings can assist decision-makers in formulating land use policies and related environmental management strategies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effect of different mixed solvents (methanol–water (MeOH–H2O), n-hexane–water (HEX–H2O)) on liquefaction of municipal wet sewage sludge (WSS) was investigated in this study. The highest bio-oil yield of 46.5 wt% was achieved in MeOH–H2O, of which ester content was 38.1% and methyl ester comprised 37.4%. The lowest solid residue yield of 10.3 wt% was achieved in HEX–H2O. The highest fatty acid compounds content was 54.9% of bio-oil obtained in HEX–H2O, of which were in saturated state. The highest calorific value and the lowest oxygen content of bio-oil were achieved in HEX–H2O: 36.45 ± 0.38 MJ/kg and 7.65 ± 0.26 wt%, respectively. The thermal stability of solid residue was enhanced in HEX–H2O. The formation of esters was promoted in MeOH–H2O, whereas aliphatic compounds could be efficiently extracted in HEX–H2O. © 2018

AB  - In this study, bio-oil was produced through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of C. vulgaris biomass cultivated in wastewater and was enriched into transportation fuels. Bio-oil yield was 29.37% wt at 300 °C, 60 min, at 15 g/200 mL biomass loading rate with 3% wt nano ZnO catalyst loading. Applying catalyst reduced oxygen and nitrogen content in bio-oil and increased its calorific value (19.6 ± 0.8 MJ/Kg). Bio-oil was enriched through liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and higher yield was obtained at 30 °C for dichloromethane solvent (18.2% wt). Compounds of enriched oil were within the petro-diesel range (C8–C21). Bio-char after HTL process was activated and used as adsorbent in wastewater treatment process to remove organic pollutants (COD, NO3, NH3 and PO4). Treated wastewater can be supplied as growth medium for microalgae cultivation in further experiments. Nearly 3–4 times the nanocatalyst can be reused in the HTL process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The efficiency of spark-ignition engines is limited by the phenomenon of knock, which is caused by auto-ignition of the fuel-air mixture ahead of the spark-initiated flame front. The resistance of a fuel to knock is quantified by its octane index; therefore, increasing the octane index of a spark-ignition engine fuel increases the efficiency of the respective engine. However, raising the octane index of gasoline increases the refining costs, as well as the energy consumption during production. The use of alternative fuels with synergistic blending effects presents an attractive option for improving octane index. In this work, the octane enhancing potential of 2-methylfuran (2-MF), a next-generation biofuel, has been examined and compared to other high-octane components (i.e., ethanol and toluene). A primary reference fuel with an octane index of 60 (PRF60) was chosen as the base fuel since it closely represents refinery naphtha streams, which are used as gasoline blend stocks. Initial screening of the fuels was done in an ignition quality tester (IQT). The PRF60/2-MF (80/20 v/v%) blend exhibited longer ignition delay times compared to PRF60/ethanol (80/20 v/v%) blend and PRF60/toluene (80/20 v/v%) blend, even though pure 2-MF is more reactive than both ethanol and toluene. The mixtures were also tested in a cooperative fuels research (CFR) engine under research octane number and motor octane number like conditions. The PRF60/2-MF blend again possesses a higher octane index than other blending components. A detailed chemical kinetic analysis was performed to understand the synergetic blending effect of 2-MF, using a well-validated PRF/2-MF kinetic model. Kinetic analysis revealed superior suppression of low-temperature chemistry with the addition of 2-MF. The results from simulations were further confirmed by homogeneous charge compression ignition engine experiments, which established its superior low-temperature heat release (LTHR) suppression compared to ethanol, resulting in better blending octane numbers. This work explores and provides a chemically sound explanation for the potential of 2-MF as an octane enhancer. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. has been proposed to be a potential tropical plant for augmenting renewable energy sources. Due to its several merits, J. curcas deserves to be considered as candidate for biofuel production instead of for food seed sources. Its seeds contain 27–40% oil that can be processed to produce a high quality biodiesel fuel that is usable in a standard diesel engine. While J. curcas grows well under low-rainfall conditions, the salt tolerance capacity of this species has received meager attention. Furthermore, another major problem faced by this species is the lack of a safe system capable of guaranteeing seed germination when stored for medium or long periods of time. Thus, J. curcas seeds show two important problems: (i) rapid loss of viability, resulting from the high respiratory rate of the seeds during storage, and (ii) seed sensitivity when germinated under salt conditions. Therefore, the main objectives were (i) to verify if storage in very low humidity boxes can improve germination without affecting the oil content of the seeds and (ii) to compare different genotypes to prove their salt tolerance capacities. The results indicate that from the use of desiccants, all the germination parameters were kept reasonably constant, and germination was essentially unchanged during the entire storage period. Biochemical activity, supported by the drastic reduction in respiratory activity of the seeds, was also decreased during the storage in order to keep the seed reserves intact; therefore, J. curcas seeds may be resistant to storage when stored in a controlled process. On the other hand, it was shown that J. curcas presents a moderate tolerance to salinity. This species is able to germinate in the presence of up to 150 mM of Sodium chloride (NaCl), although a drastic reduction in the biomass accumulation was observed with the increase in salt concentration in the irrigation water. It was shown that the germination was reduced to values close to 4% at 150 mM NaCl; whereas biometric and biomass characteristics were strongly affected by the increase in salt content. However, it was shown that genotypes 114, 171 and 183 were shown to be potentially tolerant, whereas genotypes 218 and 133 were sensitive. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present work, catalytic cracking of waste cooking oil (WCO) for the production of liquid fuels has been studied in a semi batch reactor under N2 atmosphere. Catalytic cracking was performed at a temperature range of 400–500 °C using zirconium oxide (ZrO2) as a catalyst. The influence of temperature, heating rate, residence time and catalyst loading on the product yield has been studied. The physicochemical properties such as calorific value, density, flash point and kinematic viscosity of organic liquid product (OLP) was analysed for its suitability for fuel application. The chemical compositions and functional groups present in OLP were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). From the overall study, the optimal ZrO2 load, reaction temperature, residence time and heating rate were found to be 4 wt%, 475 °C, 120 min and 10 °C/min, respectively at which 83 wt% of OLP was obtained. From the results of catalyst characterization, it was confirmed that the catalyst can be regenerated after use. © 2018

AB  - Lately, renewable biofuels could be considered leading candidates for softening society's liability to fossil derivate fuels and pollutants emission issues. In this paper, taking advantage of compression ignition engine's better performance, biodiesel and ethanol dawn as renewable commercial fuels in substitution to diesel fuel without the need of geometrical engine modifications. Experimental tests were run in an Euro III multi-cylinder compression ignition engine (MWM 4.10 TCA), fueled with diesel, biodiesel (7 or 15 vol% in diesel fuel) and anhydrous ethanol (up to 20 vol%, by 5 vol% steps) blends. Each diesel-biodiesel-ethanol (DBE) blend, always containing a 1 vol% of original additive in order to ensure blend's stability, is evaluated for three engine speeds (1500, 1800 and 2100 rpm), so as for two torque conditions (25% and 50%, considering 100% baseline torque conditions established by commercial B7E0 diesel fuel for each engine speed). An investigation is carried for engine's performance parameters and combustion characteristics, regarding different injection timings for the fuel. The specific fuel consumption could be reduced 4%, while ethanol specific energetic conversion was up to 30% improved at optimized injection timings. On the other hand, the maximum pressure was increased up to 9% and the ignition delay varied 5° just by shifting the start of injection. The fuel injection timing optimization study has also shown a trend of 1° CA injection timing anticipation for each additional 5%vol of ethanol, when the engine was fueled with B15E5, B15E10 and B15E15. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable energy resource consisting of the alkyl monoesters of fatty acids obtained from vegetable oils, waste cooking oils, or animal fats. Biodiesel has been noticed recently as an alternative to fossil fuels. Previous studies have shown that biodiesel produces less pollutants compared to diesel fuel. Biodiesel fuel increases the emission of NOx exceptionally. Recently, it has been found that antioxidant addition to biodiesel is a solution to solve the problem. The purpose of this research is to study the effect of antioxidants addition on the emissions of CO, HC, and NOx from biodiesel fuel. Exhaust emissions of an agriculture diesel engine were studied using biodiesel blend with a 500 ppm propyl gallate (PrG) (propyl-3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate) and butylated hydroxy anisole (BhA) (2-tert-butyl-4-methoxyphenol) as two major antioxidants. Biodiesel used in this research was prepared through NaOH catalyzed transesterification of a waste cooking oil that originally was taken from sunflower oil, with the assistance of ultrasonic homogenizer. After biodiesel production, five blends including neat diesel, B10, B20, B20 + 500 ppm PrG, and B20+ 500 ppm BhA were used as fuel and the emitted gases were analyzed. The results of this work demonstrated that the addition of antioxidants has no significant effect on lowering CO emission, as well as lowering HC; but the addition of antioxidants results in more efficient reduction of NOx emission from diesel exhaust. In general, BhA showed better results compared to PrG. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - In view of the importance of atomization, droplet breakup induced by high Weber number and vapor bubble during droplet impacting onto a solid and heated surface has been studied extensively, but the understand on jet break-up phenomenon in the film boiling regime is still lacking. Thus, the work is trying to study the dynamic of jet break-up of n-butanol, a potential alternative biofuel for internal combustion engine, under the influence of Weber number. During experiment, a high-speed camera, set at 512 × 512 pixels, 10,000 fps, and 20 μs exposure time was used to visualize the droplet impacting behavior. The droplet falling height was set from 1 cm to 9 cm with interval of 0.5 cm, with corresponded Weber number around from 6.94 to 102.12. The heated surface temperature was set at 250 °C, to ensure the impact locates at the film-boiling regime. The results show that the jet break-up is dominated by Rayleigh-Plateau instability, the secondary droplet is formed through contraction of symmetric unstable surface waves since the waves are clearly observed on the jet column. Under tested wall conditions, the jet break-up only takes place when the Weber number of butanol droplet is around from 14.34 to 89.13. Within the jet break-up regime, the number of separated droplets first increases then decreases with Weber number increasing, and reaches the maximum at We = 65. The length of jet break-up first increases slowly then decreases rapidly and then increases with Weber number. While, the time of jet break-up first decrease then increase with Weber number and also reaches the minimum at We = 65.20. In addition, the timing of jet break-up is fitting well with the theory of Rayleigh instability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, various carbon materials such as activated carbons and mesoporous carbon material CMK-3 modified with nickel and copper, are investigated in the production of a potential biofuel 2-methylfuran with furfural hydrotreatment. Deep characterization of the prepared catalysts revealed differences in pore size, surface area, and metal particle size. Furthermore, the acidity of the catalysts varied significantly affecting the product distribution. Very high activity and selectivity towards 2-methylfuran was achieved with two steam activated carbons (Norit RB4C and Darco) and ordered mesoporous carbon material CMK-3 modified with copper and nickel. 2-Methylfuran yield as high as 60.2% was achieved with 5/5 wt% CuNi/RB4C in 2 h at 230 °C. The operation in slurry phase was observed to promote the reaction towards 2-methylfuran. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biofuels were produced with waste cooking oil by Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC). The catalytic reactions involved two catalysts of Endurance and CGP-1HN, which were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), N2 Adsorption-Desorption, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Pyridine Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (Py-FTIR). The results indicated that the structure and properties of Endurance and CGP-1HN were similar, and the most obvious difference between them was a different content of acid sites. The Lewis and Brönsted acid contents of Endurance were 189.39 and 341.69 μmol/g, respectively, and the Lewis and Brönsted acid contents of CGP-1HN were 21.53 and 258.23 μmol/g, respectively. The different acid sites resulted in different distributions of products under the same reaction conditions. A higher diesel yield (32.04 wt%) was achieved using Endurance, and a higher Liquefied Petroleum Gas(LPG) yield (42.71 wt%) was produced using CGP-1HN. The result shows that different type acid and acid contents effect on the product distribution. The Lewis acid sites decreases the catalytic cracking depth of waste cooking oil. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The waste tyre and waste cooking oils have a great potential to be used as alternative fuels for diesel engines. The aim of this study was to convert light fractions of pyrolysis oil derived from Pakistani waste vehicle tyres and waste soybean oil methyl esters into valuable fuel and to reduce waste disposal-associated environmental problems. In this study, the waste tyre pyrolysis liquid (light fraction) was collected from commercial tyre pyrolysis plant and biodiesel was prepared from waste soybean oil. The fuel blends (FMWO10, FMWO20, FMWO30, FMWO40 and FMWO50) were prepared from a 30:70 mixture of waste tyre pyrolysis liquid and waste soybean oil methyl esters with different proportions of mineral diesel. The mixture was named as the fuel mixture of waste oils (FMWO). FT-IR analysis of the fuel mixture was carried out using ALPHA FT-IR spectrometer. Experimental investigations on a diesel engine were carried out with various FMWO blends. It was observed that the engine fuel consumption was marginally increased and brake thermal efficiency was marginally decreased with FMWO fuel blends. FMWO10 has shown lowest NOx emissions among all the fuel blends tested. In addition, HC, CO and smoke emissions were noticeably decreased by 3.1–15.6%, 16.5–33.2%, and 1.8–4.5%, respectively, in comparison to diesel fuel, thereby qualifying the blends to be used as alternative fuel for diesel engines. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - In the present study, the effect of different degumming processes on the phosphorus content of Crambe abyssinica oil and resultant biodiesel was evaluated. The non-edible oil was submitted to water degumming and chemical degumming with different concentrations of phosphoric acid and varying the acid to oil volume percentages. Phosphorus content of the products was measured by UV spectroscopy after sample calcination, according to NP 1994:2000. Biodiesel was produced by transesterification using a 6:1 methanol to oil molar ratio and 1 wt% sodium hydroxide as catalyst at 65 °C, during 1 h. The biodiesel produced directly from the crude oil presented high phosphorus concentration (>20 ppm); consequently, a degumming process was required to fulfil the quality standard (<4 ppm according to EN 14214). Water degumming was not effective, leading to biodiesel with a phosphorus concentration of 12.2 ppm. Among the acid degumming processes evaluated and taking into account technical and operational variables, the best established conditions, which allowed the fulfilment of the quality standard regarding phosphorus concentration, was considered to be 25 wt% acid concentration and 0.80 vol% of acid to oil. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays, the importance of recycle and energy savings is increasing due to the current economic and environmental situation. Many different technologies were developed to exploit biowaste to produce biofuels but they are not always easily available and economically advantageous, especially at small scale. A possible solution could be to couple them in a closed loop process. In this paper, we discuss the technological feasibility of a pilot plant producing biofuels from waste frying oil, solid organic wastes and algal biomass. The crucial point of this work is to the find the best layout and operative conditions in order to use organic wastes and by-products in a closed loop process. The study is carried out through a complete experimental campaign at both lab and pilot scale on the integrated process, consisting of three parts: I) biodiesel and glycerol production by transesterification of waste frying oil added with oil extracted from algal biomass; II) syngas production by gasification of biowaste, added with glycerol to increase the total LCV; III) algal biomass production in airlift photo-bioreactors, fed by the recycled process wastewater rich in glycerol, and capable of capturing carbon dioxide from flue gases and of producing valuable biomass to be reintroduced in the process cycle. Waste oil and organic waste were provided by the University Campus canteen and wood pellets were collected in the Campus park. Quality levels of biodiesel cetane number ranged from 47.7 to 58.4 and LHVs ranged from about 36080 kJ/kg to 36992 kJ/kg. A better syngas quality was found by adding glycerol, and flue gas composition was suitable to partially feed the airlift reactors. On the basis of this first step of experimentation, the technological feasibility of the proposed closed loop integrated process was verified. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The enzymatic esterification of an acid waste oil was investigated using a commercial lipase (Thermomyces lanuginosus) in batch reactors, under the following reaction conditions: temperature of 35 °C, molar ratio of acid:alcohol of 1:1.5, vigorous magnetic stirring and enzyme concentration from 2 to 5 wt.%. The reaction progressed during 24 h. The acid oil obtained from soapstock of vegetable oil refining had an acidity of 65.5 wt.% and a very high sulphur content of 10 400 mg/kg. Thus, a pretreatment to reduce the mineral acidity before enzymatic esterification was necessary. The selected pretreatment consisted of one wash with 1:1 V/V oil:NaOH solution followed by two washings with 1:1 V/V oil:distilled water. The results from the esterification of the pretreated oil showed a clear influence of enzyme concentration in the reduction of the acidity, most of which was achieved in the first 7 h. The amount and type of alcohol had minor influence in the reaction conversion and the fractionated addition of methanol had only expressive effect for lower catalyst concentrations, with final conversions being still unsatisfactory. The best conditions found were 4 wt.% of enzyme, 35 °C, 24 h, and 1:1.5 molar ratio of acid:alcohol, which afforded an 80% reduction of acidity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to improve the quality of bio-oil and reduce the coking and deactivation of HZSM-5 molecular sieve catalyst in the catalytic cracking of bio-oil upgrading process, Non-Thermal Plasma (NTP) assisted HZSM-5 technical scheme was proposed, online upgrading of rape straw vacuum pyrolytic vapors were conducted in a fixed bed reactor to verify the effectiveness of the technology. In the research, the influence of catalyzing temperature, catalyst bed height, discharge power on the physicochemical properties of refined bio-oil were studied, and the yield of refined bio-oil was regarded as evaluation index, response surface methodology was adopted to optimize upgrading processing parameters. Chemical composition of the refined bio-oil which was obtained under optimized parameters was analyzed by GC–MS, and using thermogravimetric analysis, the impact of NTP on catalyst anti-coking property was evaluated. Research results indicates that catalyzing temperature, catalyst bed height and discharge power have significance effect on yield and physicochemical properties of refined bio-oil. With the optimized processing parameters of 392 °C catalyzing temperature, 34 mm catalyst bed height and 23.7 W discharge power, the oxygen content, high heating value and pH of refined bio-oil were respectively 19.79%, 33.14 MJ/kg and 4.98. Compared with original HZSM-5 catalytic upgrading method, the quality of refined bio-oil was improved obviously, and the amount of catalyst coke deposit reduced from 5.88% to 2.14%, the feasibility of NTP assisted HZSM-5 online upgrading bio-oil was confirmed. © 2017 Energy Institute

AB  - Two new types of biodiesel were assessed, produced by transesterification of the oil from Annona muricata L. seeds, using basic catalysis with methanol or ethanol, obtaining yields of 91 and 83%, respectively. The values of esters showed that the conversion of the oil into biodiesel was quite high 95.5 and 95.2% for methyl and ethyl biodiesel, respectively, this shows that the transesterification reaction was efficient producing a quality biodiesel. Both types were analyzed according to the parameters set by Brazil’s National Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels Agency (ANP), responsible for overseeing the quality and sale of fuels in the country. These analyses demonstrated that both new products can be used as fuels. No significant quality differences were observed between them. The new biofuels were also assessed when blended with petroleum diesel at different concentrations (up to 30%), presenting excellent results with respect to the parameters set by the ANP. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - In the coming years, the application of paraffinic biofuels, such as Hydrotreated Vegetable Oils (HVO), in the transportation sector is expected to increase. However, as the composition of HVO is different compared to conventional diesel, the engine optimized for conventional fuel cannot take full advantage of the HVO beneficial properties. Suitable adjustment of a number of engine parameters, if not complete engine re-calibration, will enable the full exploitation of such fuels' potential for lower exhaust emissions and reduced fuel consumption. In the present work, the emission characteristics of HVO fuel in a light-duty Euro 5 diesel engine have been studied, under steady-state operation, as well as during the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The study was expanded to the investigation of exhaust emissions under modified Main Injection Timing (MIT) and EGR rate. The NEXBTL fuel, produced by Neste, was considered in the study and was compared with conventional market diesel. Emissions of nitric oxides (NOx), soot, carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and hydrocarbons (HC) were studied. At default MIT and EGR settings the use of HVO resulted in a significant reduction of all regulated emissions. In addition, it was observed that the adjustment of MIT and EGR can enhance the exploitation of HVO potential for emissions reduction, highlighting the differences with the conventional diesel fuel. © Copyright © 2018 Dimitriadis, Natsios, Dimaratos, Katsaounis, Samaras, Bezergianni and Lehto.

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation process is a potential route for upgrading biofuel intermediates, like vanillin, which is obtained in huge quantities through the chemical treatment of the abundant lignocellulosic biomass resources of nature, and this is attracting increasing attentions over the years. Herein, we report the grafting of palladium nanoparticles at the surface of porous organic polymer Pd-PDVTTT-1 synthesized through the co-condensation of 1,3,5-triallyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-(1H,3H,5H)-trione and divinylbenzene in the presence of radical initiator under solvothermal reaction conditions. The Pd-PDVTTT-1 material has been characterized thoroughly by powder X-ray diffraction, nitrogen sorption, ultra-high-resolution transmission electron Microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, 13C MAS NMR, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. High surface area together with good thermal stability of the Pd-PDVTTT-1 material has motivated us to explore its potential as heterogeneous catalyst in the hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin for the production of upgraded biofuel 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol in almost quantitative yield and high selectivity (94%). © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Microalgae are promising feedstock to produce biodiesel and other value added products. However, the water footprint for producing microalgal biodiesel is enormous and would put a strain on the water resources of water stressed countries like South Africa if freshwater is used without recycling. This study evaluates the utilization of pre-chlorinated wastewater as a cheap growth media for microalgal biomass propagation with the aim of producing biodiesel whilst simultaneously remediating the wastewater. Wastewater was collected from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Durban, inoculated with Neochloris aquatica and Asterarcys quadricellulare and the growth kinetics monitored for a period of 8 days. The physicochemical parameters; including chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) were determined before microalgal cultivation and after harvesting. Total lipids were quantified gravimetrically after extraction by hexane/isopropanol (3:2 v/v). Biodiesel was produced by transesterification and characterised by gas chromatography. The total carbohydrate was extracted by acid hydrolysis and quantified by spectrophotometric method based on aldehyde functional group derivatization. Asterarcys quadricellulare utilized the wastewater for growth and reduced the COD of the wastewater effluent from the Umbilo WWTP by 12.4%. Total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) were reduced by 48% and 50% respectively by Asterarcys quadricellulare cultivated in sterile wastewater while, Neochloris reduced the TP by 37% and TN by 29%. Although the highest biomass yield (460 mg dry weight) was obtained for Asterarcys, the highest amount of lipid (14.85 ± 1.63 mg L-1) and carbohydrate (14.84 ± 0.1 mg L-1) content were recorded in Neochloris aquatica. The dominant fatty acids in the microalgae were palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0) and oleic acid (C18:1). The biodiesel produced was determined to be of good quality with high oxidation stability and low viscosity, and conformed to the American society for testing and materials (ASTM) guidelines. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Current petroleum-derived fuels such as gasoline (C5-C12) and diesel (C15-C22) are complex mixtures of hydrocarbons with different chain lengths and chemical structures. Isoprenoids are hydrocarbon-based compounds with different carbon chain lengths and diverse chemical structures, similar to petroleum. Thus, isoprenoid alcohols such as isopentenol (C5), geraniol (C10), and farnesol (C15) have been considered to be ideal biofuel candidates. NudB, a native phosphatase of Escherichia coli, is reported to dephosphorylate isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) into isopentenol. However, no attention has been paid to its promiscuous activity toward longer chain length (C10-C15) prenyl diphosphates. Results: In this study, the promiscuous activity of NudB toward geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) was applied for the production of isoprenoid alcohol mixtures, including isopentenol, geraniol, and farnesol, and their derivatives. E. coli was engineered to produce a mixture of C5 and C15 alcohols by overexpressing NudB (dihydroneopterin triphosphate diphosphohydrolase) and IspA (FPP synthase) along with a heterologous MVA pathway, which resulted in a total of up to 1652 mg/L mixture of C5 and C15 alcohols and their derivatives. The production was further increased to 2027 mg/L by overexpression of another endogenous phosphatase, AphA, in addition to NudB. Production of DMAPP- and FPP-derived alcohols and their derivatives was significantly increased with an increase in the gene dosage of idi, encoding IPP isomerase (IDI), indicating a potential modulation of the composition of the alcohols mixture according to the expression level of IDI. When IspA was replaced with its mutant IspA∗, generating GPP in the production strain, a total of 1418 mg/L of the isoprenoid mixture was obtained containing C10 alcohols as a main component. Conclusions: The promiscuous activity of NudB was newly identified and successfully used for production of isoprenoid-based alcohol mixtures, which are suitable as next-generation biofuels or commodity chemicals. This is the first successful report on high-titer production of an isoprenoid alcohol-based mixture. The engineering approaches can provide a valuable platform for production of other isoprenoid mixtures via a proportional modulation of IPP, DMAPP, GPP, and FPP syntheses. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Small-scale biomethane production is a promising option to meet a domestic energy supply in Thailand. As part of domestic energy policies in Thailand (new Alternative Energy Development Plan), a biogas plant with 400 kg-wet/d capacity manufactured by Japanese companies was installed at a university in Thailand in 2013. For sustainable operation of the plant, the primary energy demand (PED) and life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission associated with well-to-tank, WTT (the food waste transport, conversion to biomethane and biomethane storage) are assessed. GHGs emission associated with well-to-wheel, WTW (the food waste transport, conversion to biomethane, biomethane storage and driving fuelled by the biomethane) are revealed. Economic analysis is also implemented based on the actual operating data including digestate price derived from N-P-K nutrient management (0.2689 THB/kg), and payback time sensitivity analysis. Primary energy demand associated with WTT processes was 0.68 MJ/MJ-CH4. GHG emission from WTW processes is 132.0 kg-CO2eq/km, which is less than one third that of the other biofuels (biohydrogen, biomethanol, bio-dimethylether and Fischer-Tropsch diesel). The economic analysis showed that food waste disposal income and electricity sales are hot spot in the revenue and interest payment and maintenance cost has high impact in expenditure. The most sensitive parameter is biomethane yield, which should be kept higher for profitable operation of the biogas plant in Thailand. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Because of the growing world energy demand, biofuels obtained from the hydrotreatment of vegetable oils represent a renewable alternative to replace fossil fuels. The development of mathematical models is an accurate tool to design and simulate the performance of the reactor to predict product yields during the hydrotreatment of these oils. Better understanding of the different phenomena occurring during the hydrotreatment of vegetable oils and parameters influencing on this process by means of kinetic and reactor modeling is required. This was the motivation to develop an exhaustive review on different aspects of reaction kinetics, catalytic deactivation, and reactor modeling. Kinetics of model compounds and real feedstocks (oils) used to produce biofuels are analyzed and different assumptions for developing of reaction rate equations are discussed. It has been recognized that catalyst deactivation and reactor modeling must be deeply studied and supported with experimental data. There are few reported models that consider the mass transfer and temperature inside the catalytic particle. However, there are no models that consider the phase distribution and dispersion in the transient state, nor correlations to calculate the solubility of hydrogen in this type of system. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In view of escalating concerns about energy (fuel) supply and environmental degradation, biodiesel is viewed as a potential replacement for petro-diesel, thereby reducing the dependences of many nations on importing crude petroleum. Cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) is a biofuel that is renewable and biodegradable and has similar properties of petro-diesel fuel. In the present paper, the status of CNSL is reviewed in order to provide an updated source of information on CNSL and its use for researchers, engineers, and policy makers. The paper summarizes information on cashew crop cultivation, oil extraction methods, and fuel modification techniques. Furthermore, the combustion behavior and emission characteristics of CNSL in a compression ignition engine are discussed. It is concluded that CNSL has the potential to be used as an alternative to diesel fuel in compression ignition engines, and thereby mitigate challenges associated with high dependences on imported petroleum and environmental impact that is due to the emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The potential effect of changing to a nonfossil fuel vehicle fleet was investigated by measuring primary emissions (by extractive sampling of bus plumes) and secondary mass formation, using a Gothenburg Potential Aerosol Mass (Go:PAM) reactor, from 29 in-use transit buses. Regarding fresh emissions, diesel (DSL) buses without a diesel particulate filter (DPF) emitted the highest median mass of particles, whereas compressed natural gas (CNG) buses emitted the lowest (MdEFPM 514 and 11 mg kgfuel -1, respectively). Rapeseed methyl ester (RME) buses showed smaller MdEFPM and particle sizes than DSL buses. DSL (no DPF) and hybrid-electric RME (RMEHEV) buses exhibited the highest particle numbers (MdEFPN 12 × 1014 # kgfuel -1). RMEHEV buses displayed a significant nucleation mode (Dp&lt; 20 nm). EFPN of CNG buses spanned the highest to lowest values measured. Low MdEFPN and MdEFPM were observed for a DPF-equipped DSL bus. Secondary particle formation resulting from exhaust aging was generally important for all the buses (79% showed an average EFPM:AGED/EFPM:FRESH ratio &gt;10) and fuel types tested, suggesting an important nonfuel dependent source. The results suggest that the potential for forming secondary mass should be considered in future fuel shifts, since the environmental impact is different when only considering the primary emissions. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The present study aims to address the following question: compared with first and second-generation biofuels, can microalgae biodiesel contribute to addressing the sustainability objectives in the transport sector in France? To this end, we deployed the range based Multi-Actor Multi-Criteria Analysis (range-based MAMCA) methodology that explicitly considers the different and occasionally conflicting values of the stakeholders (feedstock producers, biofuel producers, refining industry, fuel distributors, end-users, car manufacturers, government, and NGOs). By means of a Monte Carlo simulation, the method also provides an exploratory scenario approach that enables considering uncertainty concerning the context evolution and the biofuel impacts by 2030. In our case study, we aimed at fostering co-construction with stakeholders into the decision-making process by involving them starting from the very beginning of the procedure. Assuming a “weak sustainability” (i.e. the substitutability between human and environmental capital) our results suggest that microalgae biodiesel can contribute to the achievement of the sustainability objectives in the transport sector. Preliminary policy measures are finally suggested to speeding up the deployment of microalgae biodiesel in France. At the overall level, our study provides new insights about the capacity of first, second and third generation biofuels in fulfilling the sustainability criteria of the different stakeholders. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study is aimed to investigate and compare effects of biodiesel-ethanol (BE) and biodiesel-n-butanol (BBu) blends on combustion, performance and emissions of a direct-injection diesel engine. Experiments were conducted on BE5 (5% ethanol and 95% biodiesel, v/v), BE10, BE15, BBu5, BBu10 and BBu15, at five engine loads and at 1800 rpm. In regard to combustion characteristics, effects on maximum heat release rate, maximum in-cylinder pressure, start of combustion, combustion duration and coefficients of variations (COVs) of IMEP and maximum increase rate of in-cylinder pressure were investigated. In regard to engine performance, effects on BSFC and BTE were investigated. The blended fuels have adverse effects on engine performance especially at low load, with the BE blends having more adverse effects than the BBu blends. Moreover, on average of the five engine loads, the BBu and BE blends increase CO emission by 13.7% and 22.8% and HC emission by 5.6% and 29.2%, respectively; but reduce NOx emission by 6.5% and 28.0%, particle mass concentration by 20.7% and 20.6% and particle number concentration by 22% and 21%, respectively. Overall, the BE blends are more effective in reducing particulate and NOx emissions but the BBu blends would lead to less increase in CO and HC emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Particulate emissions from an urban bus fueled with B20 (20% biodiesel from waste cooking oil and 80% diesel by volume) were investigated using portable emissions measurement system (PEMS), then the effect of a catalyzed continuously regeneration trap (CCRT) on the particulate emissions of the B20-fueled bus were ascertained. Results show that compared with a D100 (pure diesel), B20 reduced particulate number (PN) and particulate mass (PM) emission rates of the bus by 13.9% and 24.3% under cruise control. Under transient condition, B20 reduced the PN and PM emission rates by 18.4% and 16.3%. B20 decreased the total PN concentration by 6.6% whereas increased the proportion of nucleation particles from 89.0% to 92.0%. Correspondingly causing a decrease in the GMD (geometric mean diameter) from 43.02 nm to 41.25 nm under cruise condition, and from 41.26 nm to 39.57 nm under transient condition. Using a CCRT exhibited an excellent filtration effect on both PN and PM from the B20-fueled bus. Both under cruise and transient conditions, CCRT could reduce more than 93% of the PN and PM. In addition, CCRT had a better filtration effect on accumulation particles. The use of CCRT also changed the particle size bimodal distribution of the B20 by removing the accumulation mode peak. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Herein, we report on a combined process that incorporates hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and supercritical water gasification (SCWG) to improve energy recovered from algal biomass. Eight algal biomasses, including four microalgae and four macroalgae with a large difference in biochemical compositions, were screened for this dual process. The algal biomass feedstocks significantly affected the carbon and energy distribution in the product fractions (crude bio-oil, solid, gas, and water-soluble products). 62.50–71.34% energy of microalgae and 6.03–41.06% energy of macroalgae could be recovered as crude bio-oil. 11.86–21.55% carbon of the microalgae and 8.01–15.82% carbon of the macroalgae was distributed in the HTL process water in form of water soluble products after the HTL process. 14.3–33.7% energy of microalgae and 30.18–36.34% energy of macroalgae was retained in the HTL process water. SCWG could convert the organics in the HTL process water into fuel gases consisting mainly of H2 and CH4. 54–91% carbon of the HTL process water was transformed into the fuel gases, which correspond 5.53–18.30% energy of the algal biomass. Thus, this work shows that the integration of HTL and SCWG could improve energy recovery from algal biomass relative to the HTL process alone. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is a mixture of esters of fatty acids (most often palmitic, stearic and oleic) and lower alcohols (in our work butanol) produced by transesterification. It is a renewable source of energy, prepared from triacylglycerides, which are contained in vegetable oils and animal fats. This work focuses on alkaline catalyzed transesterification of rapeseed oil with butanol and comparison of two catalysts (potassium hydroxide and potassium tert-butoxide). In industry is usually transesterification of rapeseed oil carried out like reaction catalyzed by potassium hydroxide. Potassium hydroxide have high content of K2CO3, KHCO3 and water. Moreover water is formed by neutralization of potassium hydroxide with free fatty acids contained in oil. In cause of tert-butoxide catalyzed reaction, it is not possible because tert-butoxide have not a OH− aniont, which is needed for water forming. The influence of various conditions (addition of water, temperature of separation, intensity of stirring and type of catalyst) on butanolysis process was studied for both catalysts. For both catalysts dependence of conversions on time were plotted. When tert-butoxide was used, satisfactory phase separation was not achieved. The only way was separation of hot crude reaction mixture without adding water. Ester formed by this method had high content of free glycerol and soaps, but reached higher conversion. The best results were obtained with KOH and subsequent separation of cold crude reaction mixture with the addition of water and slow stirring. The difference between reactions catalyzed by potassium hydroxide and potassium tert-butoxide was described. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In-situ hydrodeoxygenation of a mixture of oxygenated compounds from bio-oil with hydrogen donor over supported multi-metal catalysts was investigated. As most previous in-situ hydrodeoxygenation reports focused on phenols, guaiacol, furfural, and acetic acid, this paper extends the scope to a mixture of oxygenated compounds of not only phenols, guaiacol, furfural and acetic acid, but also of lesser reported hydroxyl -propanone, cyclopentanone aiming at obtaining more liquid fuels. The method of incipient wetness impregnation was used to load the three metals (Zr, Ni, Ir) and Pd on the support of ZSM-5 and C, respectively. The conversion of acetic acid, hydroxyl -propanone, cyclopentanone, guaiacol, furfural, and phenol reached 99.7%, 99.3%, 100%, 100%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, including the total deoxygenation ratio of 99.6%, the liquid yield (96.5%), and the hydrocarbon yield (86.7%), under the suitable conditions. The sulfur content, the octane number, and the H/C ratio of bio-oil through in-situ hydrodeoxygenation have been improved, and reached 0, 89 and 1.9, respectively. We also speculated reaction pathways of different oxides according to the product distribution over ZrNi/Ir-ZSM-5 and Pd/C. © 2018

AB  - 2-Methylfuran (MF) and 2,5-dimethylfuran's (DMF) combustion characteristics have confirmed their validity as appropriate gasoline replacement and enhancement fuels. However, the performance of fuel injection equipment is dependant on the tribological performance of these fuels lubricity testing of MF, DMF and their blends with gasoline was undertaken using the high frequency reciprocating rig method, based on ASTM D6079. Results showed that both MF and DMF possessed greater lubricity and wear resistance characteristics than those of gasoline when tested as pure substances. Their blends with gasoline at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20 and 50 percent volume (%vol) showed improved tribological performance also. DMF was found to possess greater lubricating properties than that of MF. As little as 2%vol reduced the wear scar diameter by 46% and 47% for MF and DMF respectively showing even a small addition of these biofuels could greatly improve the tribological performance of the fuel within the engine. This was mainly due to the polar functional groups of MF and DMF bonding to the bearing surfaces during testing, creating a tribo-film that protected the surface, reducing both wear and friction. These effects were greatest for the DMF blends, with two methyl groups leading to stronger polarity and a resulting higher bonding strength to the metal surfaces. The reduction in friction coefficients with the addition of the biofuels showed that utilisation of these blends would reduce frictional losses along the fuel line, improving the overall engine efficiency. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Microalgae is identified as a promising feedstock for producing renewable liquid transportation fuels; however, lipids extraction from microalgae for downstream processing to biofuels is one of the important challenges for algal based biorefineries. This work aims at evaluating the potential of applying flash hydrolysis (FH) as a chemical-free technique to increase the lipids extractability of algal biomass as well as its integration with the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae to enhance the biocrude yields and characteristics for fuel production. To this aim, the FH process was performed on three different algal species (Scenedesmus sp., Nannochloropsis sp., and Chlorella vulgaris) at 280 °C and 10 s of residence time. Following FH, in addition to the nutrients rich hydrolysate, approximately, 40 wt% of solids containing almost all (>90 wt%) the lipids termed as biofuels intermediates (BI), were recovered. Kinetics study on lipids extractability from the BI and their lipid profile analyses were conducted for each algal species. The results showed that the FH process had significantly enhanced the lipids extractability. For all three algae species, lipid yields from BI were higher than that of the raw algae. Lipid yields of Chlorella vulgaris in the first 15 min were more than five times higher (52.3 ± 0.8 vs. 10.7 ± 0.9 wt%) than that of raw algae during n-hexane based solvent extraction. The kinetics of lipids extractability followed a zero-order reaction rate for all wet raw microalgae and the BI of Scenedesmus sp., while the BI recovered from the other two algal species were determined as a second-order reaction. Comparison of fatty acids profiles indicated the contribution of the FH process in saturating fatty acids. Subsequent to lipids extraction, a conventional hydrothermal liquefaction was performed at 350 °C and 1 h to compare the biocrude yields from raw versus BI of Chlorella vulgaris microalgae. The results showed that the biocrude yields from the BI and its quality was significantly enhanced post FH than that of raw algae. The FH process was proven to be a viable option for lipid extraction by increasing the extent of recovery and decreasing the extraction time. Its integration with HTL notably impact the biocrude yields and characteristics for fuel production. © 2018

AB  - Under section 211 of the Clean Air Act, the EPA is required to set renewable fuel percentage standards every year. This action proposes the annual percentage standards for cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel that apply to gasoline and diesel transportation fuel produced or imported in the year 2019. Relying on statutory waiver authority that is available when the projected cellulosic biofuel production volume is less than the applicable volume specified in the statute, EPA is proposing volume requirements for cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel that are below the statutory volume targets. Also, the applicable volume of biomass-based diesel for 2020 is being proposed. Comments must be received on or before 8/17/2018.

AB  - There is continuously growing interest in renewable biofuels for combustion engines to help reduce transportation energy consumption. In the present work, ethanol and a Primary Reference Fuel (PRF) were studied in an advanced LTC concept using CFD. A split injection strategy was used where the majority of the fuel was injected early during the intake stroke to create a well-mixed charge, while a portion of the charge was direct injected closer to ignition to induce forced thermal and equivalence ratio stratification in a strategy similar to partial fuel stratification (PFS). This way, the combustion process in LTC can be better controlled by staggering the autoignition process through mixture stratification. The unique characteristics of ethanol, such as its high latent heat of vaporization and reduced ϕ-sensitivity, result in unique features for a PFS-style advanced LTC mode, explored in this paper. A 3D CFD model with detailed chemistry was implemented in CONVERGE. The results showed that for both ethanol and PRF fuels, a split direct injection strategy lowers the peak heat release rate and elongates the combustion process compared to a single early direct injection due to the increased stratification. However, this effect was more pronounced for ethanol compared to PRF90 due to its higher latent heat of vaporization and reduced ϕ-sensitivity. For a 60–40% split injection, the burn duration increased by 118% for ethanol and 91.6% for PRF90. The temperature, equivalence ratio, and OH mass fraction distributions illustrated that ethanol is primarily temperature-sensitive, while PRF90 shows a degree of ϕ-sensitivity in conjunction with temperature-sensitivity. The split direct injection of fuel creates an equivalence ratio and temperature distribution that are coupled due to the latent heat of vaporization of the fuel. For the PRF, these two effects are competing; whereas for the ethanol, the autoignition event is dictated by the thermal gradients since the fuel has a higher latent heat of vaporization and is not as ϕ-sensitive. Therefore, a PFS-style injection strategy is able to elongate the heat release rates more significantly with ethanol compared to a PRF. © Copyright © 2018 Rahimi Boldaji, Sofianopoulos, Mamalis and Lawler.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to experimentally investigate the use of grapeseed oil as a fuel substitute obtained from biomass waste from winery industry and the synergic effect of hydrogen addition for compression ignition engine application. The experiments were carried out in a single cylinder, four stroke diesel engine for various loads and energy share of hydrogen. Combustion, performance and emission characteristics of grapeseed biodiesel, neat grapeseed oil and diesel have been analysed and compared with the results obtained with hydrogen induction in the intake manifold in dual fuel mode. At full load, maximum brake thermal efficiency of the engine with diesel, grapeseed biodiesel and neat grapeseed oil has increased from 32.34%, 30.28% and 25.94% to 36.04%, 33.97% and 30.95% for a maximum hydrogen energy share of 14.46%, 14.1% and 12.8% respectively. Although there is an increasing trend in Nitric Oxide emission with hydrogen induction, smoke, brake specific hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide emissions respectively, reduces. Nitric oxide emission of Grapeseed biodiesel with maximum hydrogen share at full load is higher by 43.61% and smoke emission lower by 19.73% compared to biodiesel operation without hydrogen induction. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Fulfilling emission restrictions is the most challenging task considering future engine development. Stratified lean burn combustion mode associated with the use of biofuels has been widely studied to overcome current and future environmental regulation and global weather concerns. Power modulation by means of a throttle valve increases the pumping mean effective pressure with a corresponding penalty in engine fuel consumption at part load. De-throttling by means of direct injection (DI) is an attractive way of improving fuel economy and exhaust emissions at low and part load operation in spark-ignition (SI) engines. In this research, a study has been made of the investigations concerning stratified lean burn combustion in a wall-air guided type SI single cylinder optical research engine (SCORE) using Brazilian hydrous ethanol (E100) as fuel. Experiments were conducted at a constant load of 3 bar of net indicated mean effective pressure (NIMEP), for a wide range of injection, ignition and mixture formation parameters. Engine fuel conversion efficiency, combustion characteristics and emissions were evaluated for each excess air ratio (λ). Optical visualization illustrated the spray behavior and flame propagation. Specific fuel consumption and engine fuel conversion efficiency achieved an improvement of 8.1% and 2.6%, respectively, for λ = 1.4. Engine-out specific emissions were reduced by 66% for nitrogen oxides (NOx) and by 20% for total hydrocarbon (THC) and carbon dioxide (CO). A detailed combustion analysis based on in-cylinder pressure measurement was carried out and provided useful data for ethanol direct injection engine development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Diesel is the main source of world transportation due to higher combustion efficiency, compliance, consistency and cost-economy. It is also a major contributor to the world prosperity since it is used extensively. Diesel engine’s emissions are the serious hazard to the world environment and it is measured to be the major causes of air pollution. The demand in biofuels for years created a scope for aloe vera into biodiesels. Aloe vera, having higher calorific value vnthan other plant sources used as biodiesels, enhanced us in making another alternative biodiesel, which has lesser emissions and better performance. In this research work, four biodiesel blends from aloe vera oil with cerium oxide additive are explored for their performance and emission characteristics. The results proved B30 (30% biodiesel, 68% diesel and 1% cerium oxide) gives good performance when compared to other blends. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Soybean, rapeseed, and palm oil are the main raw materials for biodiesel production worldwide. However, there are other potential feedstocks for biodiesel production. Speculations swirl around the agreements signed at the 21st Conference of the Parties to reduce carbon emissions from the transportation sector and stimulate the biofuel blending. As an increase in the biodiesel demand is expected, Brazil can be an important player in the international market because of the availability of land and the diversity of raw materials. This paper discusses current global oil and biodiesel scenarios and reviews several potential feedstocks focusing on the prospects, limitations, food–fuel nexus, and opportunities to develop added-value products. Despite the variety of potential feedstocks, the biodiesel sector is likely to pursue its development based on large-scale economically competitive alternatives. Animal fat and waste frying oil are options for a short-term scenario. Palm oil is a promising choice for medium term, while algae and second generation routes may contribute to the biodiesel supply in the long term. Development of competitive chains, investment in technologies, processes and logistics, and domestication of species are essential to guarantee the inclusion of such feedstocks in the world biofuel mix. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The 9-Octadecenoic acid (oleic fatty acid) content of vegetable oil seeds can be altered by mutagenesis, thereby increasing its content in the oil, for the purpose of increasing shelf life. In this work, the effect of varying the oleic acid content in ester on the performance and emission of a CI engine was examined. For this purpose, the situation was simulated by adding commercially available 9-Octadecenoic acid to pongamia ester; in terms of different percentages, the experiments were conducted with 10% and 20% extra oleic acid, at 16, 17, 17.5 and 18 compression ratio (CR). The results indicate that the smoke emission and BSEC increase with increase in oleic acid content, whereas the BTE and NOx decrease with increased proportions of oleic acid for all CRs. Pongamia methyl ester with 10% extra oleic acid at 17 CR results in lower NOx when compared to neat pongamia methyl ester at a normal CR of 17.5. Smoke emission increases with extra oleic acid content for all CRs; however, it is minimum at 17 CR for 10% extra oleic acid. From the research it is concluded that pongamia methyl ester with 10% extra oleic acid at 17 CR results in better performance and emission. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article discusses the experimental investigation of a new biofuel (lemongrass oil) feedstock as an alternative fuel. The subject has not drawn much attention among the fraternity of researchers. So far, an exploration for a new biofuel feedstock has resulted in demonstrating lemongrass oil (LGO) as an alternative energy source. Nickel-chromium-zirconium coating on piston, inlet, and exhaust valves is achieved using a plasma spray method. The coated engine has been tested with a constant level of neat diesel and varying proportions of 5, 10, and 15 percent of LGO–water emulsion; its properties have been analyzed per the ASTM standards. The considered test fuel was experimentally investigated in a single cylinder diesel engine at 1,500 rpm for its performance, combustion, and emission characteristics. Among the different mixtures, a fuel mixture of LGWM1 (LGO of 94 %, water of 5 %, span 80 of 0.5 %, and tween 80 of 0.5 %) profile had similar properties to diesel fuel, resulting in a higher thermal efficiency and a lower hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide emission. However, oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide emission were comparatively higher for the test fuel considered. The cylinder pressure and heat release rate curves show a slight increase at the full load condition as compared with diesel fuel. Against the background of continuous fossil fuel depletion, the fuel blend of LGWM1 (LGO of 94 %, water of 5 %, span 80 of 0.5 % and tween 80 of 0.5 %) acts as a promising alternative fuel for further research work.

AB  - While the impact of emissions from combustion of fossil fuel on human health has been extensively studied, current knowledge of exhaust exposure from combustion of biofuels provides limited and inconsistent information about its neurotoxicity. The objective of the present work was to compare the gene expression patterns in rat frontal cortex and hippocampus after exposure to diesel exhaust emissions (DEE) from combustion of two 1st generation fuels, 7% fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) (B7) and 20% FAME (B20), and a 2nd generation 20% FAME/hydrotreated vegetable oil (SHB20: synthetic hydrocarbon biofuel), with and without diesel particulate filter (DPF). The Fisher 344 rats (n = 7/treatment) were exposed to DEE for 7 days (6h/day), and for 28 days (6h/day, 5 days/week) in whole body exposure chambers. The controls were breathing room air. Brain histological examinations did not reveal any adverse exposure-related effects of DEE in frontal cortex or in hippocampus. Gene expression analysis showed that several genes associated with antioxidant defenses and inflammation were statistically differently expressed in DEE exposed animals versus control. In addition, the gene expression changes between the exposure groups were compared, where the observed rank order in frontal cortex was B7 > B20 > SHB20 after 7 days of exposure, and SHB20 > B7 = B20 after 28 days of exposure. In the hippocampus, the rank order was B7 > SHB20 > B20. Effect of DPF treatment was observed for Tnf only. Overall, moderate increases in bio-components in diesel blends do not appear to result in dramatic alterations in gene expression or adverse histopathological effects. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Introduction: Waste frying oils transesterification was studied for the purpose of achieving the best conditions for biodiesel production. Biodiesel is proved to be the best replacement for diesel because of its unique properties such as significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, non-sulfur emissions, non-particulate matter pollutants, low toxicity, and biodegradability. Waste edible oil is an feedstock in the biodiesel production. The discussion will cover various aspects from oil composition, oil yielding, economics, cultivation materials, land availability, and also the resources availability. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire has been conducted among 100 students from Saveetha Dental College on awareness on the production of biodiesel from household waste. Results: Most of the waste accumulated in India is found to be form household wastes. 80% of the participants do not know about the zero waste system. There are 45% of the participants who are aware of glass Büchner system. In the present generation, more than 95% of the world biodiesel is produced from the edible oil which is easily available in many large-scale industries from the agriculture land. Conclusion: Production of biodiesel from waste cooking oils for diesel substitute is particularly important because of the decreasing trend of economical oil reserves, environmental problems caused due to fossil fuel use, and the high price of petroleum products in the international market. An awareness on the production of biodiesel from household waste was created. © JPR Solutions. All rights reserved.

AB  - With the ever-increasing energy demand, triggered by the continued population growth and accelerated industrial revolution, renewable energy has emerged as the world's fastest-growing energy source. Renewable energy's popularity has grown because it is environmentally friendly and abundant in natural environments. Despite its enormous potential as a viable alternative to traditional (fossil fuel-based) energy sources, renewable energy has rarely been commercialized and utilized. Its lack of commercialization has something to do with a lack of evidence proving its eco- and cost-efficiency. With this in mind, this paper aims to assess the eco- and cost-efficiency of renewable energy such as algae-based biofuels using data visualization. It also intends to help increase public awareness and facilitate the commercialization of renewable energy such as biofuels. Through experiments, this paper found that the success of biofuel commercialization hinged on temperature, light intensity, and algae strain. Another important finding is that the low carbon footprint resulting from biofuel consumption may not directly contribute to the immediate revenue growth of a biofuel producing company, but it can foster a long-term positive image that will help attract more customers in the future with increased brand recognition. Furthermore, this paper evaluates the effectiveness, the level of user involvement, and the usability of two data visualization tools built upon the dashboard and the balanced scorecard. Based on the case study, this paper demonstrates how effective and useful the tools are in communicating the firm's strategic goals toward sustainability and thus provides easier practical guidelines for renewable energy development decisions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study aimed to quantify the financial value of the carbon credits generated by the substitution of diesel fuel for biofuels in the agricultural activity, analyzing the energy matrix and the energy sources used in agriculture. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration generate credits that can be traded through financial returns. In view of this, the following problem arose: Can carbon credits stimulate change in the agricultural production model so that there is a reduction in emissions and an increase in carbon sequestration in rural areas? In addition to the financial return for the commercialization of credits, low-carbon agriculture can make use of indirect benefits such as subsidized interest financing lines and access to more demanding markets. The methodology used was the exploratory and bibliographical research by obtaining data on carbon credits and gas emissions. From this, an analysis was developed applying the qualitative and quantitative approach, measuring the financial value of the carbon credits generated in agriculture. Through these analyzes, it was possible to conclude that the socio-environmental actions resulting from the agricultural activity produce carbon credits that can be commercialized by the farmer. © 2018, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco.

AB  - In order to reduce the harmful effect on the environment, using the oxygenated fuels such as biofuel blends as fuel has been on the spotlights for the internal combustion engines. For this rationale; the diesel engine operated with blends of sunflower biodiesel and diesel fuel (blending of 0%, 10%, 20%, and 100% biodiesel fuel with conventional diesel fuel). In this study, an experimental and numerical model for Heat release rate (HRR) and the characteristic performance of diesel engine such as cylinder pressure and emission characteristics (NOx, CO, and HC) in internal combustion engines is presented. To ensure the integrity of modeling, the results were compared with the experimental results. This comparison indicated a good agreement between the two. A Gaussian and Fourier series of second order was used to define a function relating the pressure and emission characteristics. Presented numerical model, implemented in proprietary software AVL FIRE, is able to capture chemical phenomena and to predict pollutant emission concentration trends. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 37: 1540–1550, 2018. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog

AB  - The 1.4541 and the 1.4571 stainless steels and a carbon steel were subjected to immersion corrosion tests in stagnant and stirred biomass fuel sources such as rapeseed oil, waste cooking oil and animal waste lard as well as their emulsions with 5 and 50 wt.% aqueous citric acid solutions at a temperature of 80°C so as to model storage, handling and purification conditions. Passivation of carbon steel was facilitated by flow of the less acidic rapeseed and waste cooking oils and increased flux of oxygen. Carbon steel was sensitive for the higher concentration of proton donor species, acidity of the waste lard. Higher mass loss rates correlated with increased corrosion currents measured in citric acid solution by electrochemical methods. Flow of the biomasses and increased acid concentration of the emulsions were beneficial for the passivation of stainless steels. Although corrosion related mass loss, dissolution rate of the passive layers increased by flow and high acidity of the fluids, both the formation and compactness of passive layers are facilitated by the biomasses with higher concentration of oxygen donating species like water, alcohol and acids. Surface transformation of the passivating steels was reflected by decreasing electrochemical pseudo-capacity of the interfaces and increasing resistance of the passive layers derived from the results of Tafel and Stern methods as well as impedance results. Anti-correlation between mass loss results obtained by immersion in the biomasses and electrochemical data measured in dilute aqueous citric acid solution is explained by the varied compactness, resistance of the passive layers and exchange currents of the steel electrodes due to the orders of magnitude different activities of the hydrogen ion in the biomass mixtures and citric acid solution. © 2018, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Furfural (FF) is obtained from lignocellulosic biomass and is a promising platform chemical that can produce valuable chemicals including furfuryl alcohol (FA) and 2-methylfuran (MF). We synthesized both FA and MF using electrochemical hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis (ECH) of FF in acidic electrolyte using a Cu electrode. We investigated the role of concurrent side reactions including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and polymerization of furanic compounds during ECH, as well as the potential dependence of the reaction pathway for ECH of FF. As the magnitude of applied potential increased, both ECH and HER were promoted. Polymerization of furanic compounds was diminished by lowering the initial concentration of FF, but at a cost of increased the HER activity. In contrast, higher concentrations of FF suppressed the HER, though excessive initial concentrations of FF resulted in lowering the activity of both ECH and the HER due to a polymeric film being formed on the electrode. The highest mole balances and faradaic efficiencies towards ECH were achieved at −0.5 V, though at the expense of lower conversions of FF than those obtained at greater overpotentials. We also found that the ECH of FF followed two parallel reactions to independently produce FA and MF on Cu in 0.5 m H2SO4 regardless of the applied potential. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Catalytic hydrothermal conversion of non-edible corn distillers oil (CDO), a low-value by-product of the ethanol industries, into high value fuel-grade hydrocarbons was investigated in near-supercritical water. The decarboxylation experiments were conducted using activated carbon in a 300 mL batch stirred tank reactor at reaction temperatures of 300–400 °C with pressure ranges from 2200–2500 psi (≈15–17 MPa), water/CDO (v/v) ratios of 2:1 to 5:1, and reaction times of 0.5 to 4 h at constant stirring speed (800 rpm). For the first time, complete removal of the −COO− group from CDO was achieved at 400 °C with 4 h of reaction time and a water/CDO (v/v) ratio of 4:1. The liquid products obtained were a mixture of saturated hydrocarbons, mainly C8–C16 (selectivity 49.7 %) and heptadecane (48.9 %) which have similar specific gravity, higher heating value (HHV), cloud points, and pour points to those of commercial fuels. 65 % liquid yield was obtained under optimal reaction conditions. The reaction mechanism was found to follow pseudo-first-order kinetics with an activation energy 66.1±3 kJ mol−1, which is much lower than similar reported literature values for the decarboxylation process. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The concept of community ecology has become a central issue for sustainable biofuel production. However the development of appropriate multi-algae cultures for the industry remains challenging. Natural marine algae blooms collected from coastal areas of Cyprus were induced to form multi-algae cultures, and five (5) of those were developed and tested. Algae growth characteristics, biomass, and lipid productivity were assessed, and the dominant microalga was isolated in all cultures. Growth characteristics, lipid productivity, and FAME composition varied considerably among the different multi-algae cultures as well as their corresponding dominant species. Our results suggest that competitiveness and species complementarity could be crucial factors for biomass and lipid productivity. In material collected from the marina in Larnaca of Cyprus, the induced BL1_LCA bloom was the most promising culture, dominated by Nannochloropsis sp. and accompanied by cyanobacteria assemblages, exhibiting the highest biomass and lipid productivity compared to the other developed blooms. Biomass and lipid productivity of an axenic monoculture of Nannochloropsis sp. were 2.1 and 2.2 times lower compared to those measured in BL1_LCA. The growth parameters of BL1_LCA and its corresponding dominant species were further tested under culture media of different seawater and wastewater ratios. An increase of wastewater ratio in the culture media resulted in a significant reduction of lipid, FAME concentration as well as biomass productivity both in BL1_LCA and its dominant isolate. Overall, our findings suggest that the complex interactions within microalgae community might be crucial for biodiesel production; moreover, the general assumption that wastewater can be applied as an alternative nutrient source should be used cautiously since species-specific responses seem to take place. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The demand for higher fuel energy and lesser exhaust emissions of diesel engines can be achieved by fuel being used and engine operating parameters. In the present work, effects of engine speed (RPM), injection timing (IT), injection pressure (IP), and compression ratio (CR) on performance and emission characteristics of a compression ignition (CI) engine were investigated. The ternary test fuel of 65% diesel + 25% bael oil + 10% diethyl ether (DEE) was used in this work and test was conducted at different charge inlet temperature (CIT) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). All the experiments are conducted at the tradeoff engine load that is 75% engine load. When operating the diesel engine with 320 K CIT, brake thermal efficiency (BTE) is improved to 28.6%, and carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions have been reduced to 0.025% and 12.5 ppm at 18 CR. The oxide of nitrogen (NOx) has been reduced to 240 ppm at 1500 rpm for 30% EGR mode. Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method is frequently used in multi-factor selection and gray correlation analysis method is used to study uncertain of the systems. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Treated silica xerogel with protic ionic liquid (PIL) and bifunctional agents (glutaraldehyde and epichlorohydrin) is a novel support strategy used in the effective immobilization of lipase from Burkholderia cepacia (LBC) by covalent binding. As biocatalysts with the highest activity recovery yields, LBC immobilized by covalent binding with epichlorohydrin without (203%) and with PIL (250%), was assessed by the following the hydrolysis reaction of olive oil and characterized biochemically (Michaelis–Menten constant, optimum pH and temperature, and operational stability). Further, the potential transesterification activity for three substrates: sunflower, soybean, and colza oils, was also determined, achieving a conversion of ethyl esters between 70 and 98%. The supports and the immobilized lipase systems were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Medium- and long-chain methyl ketones are fatty acid-derived compounds that can be used as biofuel blending agents, flavors and fragrances. However, their large-scale production from sustainable feedstocks is currently limited due to the lack of robust microbial biocatalysts. The oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is a promising biorefinery platform strain for the production of methyl ketones from renewable lignocellulosic biomass due to its natively high flux towards fatty acid biosynthesis. In this study, we report the metabolic engineering of Y. lipolytica to produce long- and very long-chain methyl ketones. Truncation of peroxisomal β-oxidation by chromosomal deletion of pot1 resulted in the biosynthesis of saturated, mono-, and diunsaturated methyl ketones in the C13-C23 range. Additional overexpression and peroxisomal targeting of a heterologous bacterial methyl ketone biosynthesis pathway yielded an initial titer of 151.5 mg/L of saturated methyl ketones. Dissolved oxygen concentrations in the cultures were found to substantially impact cell morphology and methyl ketone biosynthesis. Bioreactor cultivation under optimized conditions resulted in a titer of 314.8 mg/L of total methyl ketones, representing more than a 6000-fold increase over the parental strain. This work highlights the potential of Y. lipolytica to serve as chassis organism for the biosynthesis of acyl-thioester derived long- and very long-chain methyl ketones. © 2018 International Metabolic Engineering Society

AB  - It is forecast that in the future, alternative fuels derived from non-petroleum sources will become the basic propellant for turbine aircraft engines. Currently, five types of aviation turbine fuel containing synthesized hydrocarbons are certified and accepted, and allow adding a maximum of 50% of synthetic component to conventional fuel. The experimental performance and the emission characteristics of a turbojet engine were investigated in this paper. The studies were conducted with the use of a miniature turbojet engine, which is the main component of a laboratory test rig. The test rig is an interesting solution for engine research, due to the fact that studies concerning full-scale aircraft engines are very complex and expensive. The literature of the subject contains many papers using small-scale turbojet engines for testing alternative fuels. However, most of them concern components of fuels, e.g. biodiesel, butanol, which do not have direct application in aviation. Two different fuel samples, a conventional Jet A-1 fuel and a blend of 48% synthesized paraffinic kerosene from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids process with Jet A-1 were tested. This process is one of the routes of producing alternative fuel for aviation, approved by ASTM standard. The test rig studies were performed according to a specific profile of engine test, which models different modes of a turbojet engine’s operation. The obtained results are compared in relation to the results for neat Jet A-1 fuel and then discussed. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Currently, there is a trend of moving away from the use of fossil fuels to the use of biofuels. This modification changes the molecular structure of gasoline and diesel constituents, which should impact pollutant emissions and engine efficiency. An important property of automotive fuels is the resistance to autoignition. The goal of the present work is to evaluate thermochemical and kinetic parameters that govern the carbon-carbon bond dissociation and relate these parameters, in conjunction with molecular properties, to autoignition resistance. Three model reactions were investigated in the present work: dissociation of ethane, ethanol, and ethanal. All studies were conducted at the multiconfigurational level of theory, and the rate coefficients were evaluated from 300 to 2000 K. The comparison of dissociation energies and Arrhenius expressions indicates that autoignition resistance is related to the kinetic control of dissociation reactions and it is possible to relate the higher octane number of ethanol based fuels to the kinetics parameters of carbon-carbon bond fission.

AB  - Brazil is one of the world's largest rice producers with more than 50 industries in this field. During the processing of the grain, high amounts of husk are generated, with a capacity to produce synthesis gas with high hydrogen content. On the other hand, in the process of parboiling, the final result is considerable volumes of effluent rich in organic matter, generating high amounts of methane. Therefore, spark ignition engine (SI) can operate with biogas, syngas or biogas-syngas mixtures, taking advantage of the bioenergy potential of the rice industries in Brazil. Accordingly, in this work, it was used the spark-ignition engine test operating with typical biogas and syngas compositions generated in the rice industries, named Bio70, syngas1 and syngas2, respectively. An important result could be observed. For both methane and biogas fuel the increase in excess ratio (λ) value from 1 to 1.25 lead to lower CO and NOx emissions as well as an increase in indicated efficiency. Using fuel mix, even at low concentration, such as 10% by vol., Bio70 provided increases in the calorific value of air-fuel mixture (edv) equal to 5.4 and 13.2% for syngas 1 and 2, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Vegetable oils, biodiesels, bio-alcohols and bio-gas are some of the popular biofuels evaluated for their suitability in compression-ignition (CI) engines. Among these, bio-alcohols can be produced from any kinds of biomass through fermentation and biosynthesis and they do not require extra land for cultivation. Therefore, bio-alcohols can be considered as the next generation alternative fuels for automobiles. Investigations have been already initiated to determine the effects of bioalcohols, such as methanol and ethanol, in automobiles as fuel. However, they pose some problems like miscibility, phase separation, low cetane number and low calorific value. On the other side, the effects of higher alcohols, such as butanol, pentanol, octanol, are investigated very rarely. In this work, the effects of higher alcohol addition on the engine performance and emissions characteristics are investigated on a single cylinder diesel engine. Conventional diesel and biodiesel are taken as the reference fuels. 1-Butanol of blends (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%) was mixed with the remaining biodiesel as the testing fuel blends. Experiments were conducted on a single cylinder compression ignition diesel engine for four load conditions (5 kg, 10 kg, 15 kg and 20 kg) at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. Brake thermal efficiency and emissions of CO, NOx and HC were recorded and discussed. From the experimental results, it is evident that the addition of butanol with biodiesel seems to an alternative fuel that can replace conventional diesel fuel in terms of both engine emissions and performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Furfural is a key biomass-derived chemical to produce important biofuels, such as 2-methylfuran. The furfural conversion over Cu(1 1 1)/ZnO catalyst has been investigated by the catalytic evaluation experiments. In order to elucidate the reaction temperature-oriented selectivity, density functional theory calculations were used to study the furfural conversion over Cu(1 1 1) surface. Furfural alcohol forms via F-CHO + 2H → F-CH2O + H → F-CH2OH, and 2-methylfuran forms via dehydration of furfuryl alcohol (F-CH2OH + 2H → F-CH2 + OH + 2H → F-CH3 + OH + H → F-CH3 + H2O). Furthermore, the reaction rates at different temperature (403, 453 and 503 K) have been calculated. As a result, high temperature plays a significant role in enhancing the reaction rate and prompting the reaction selectivity towards 2-methylfuran. © 2018

AB  - Biomass-derived bio-oil cannot be applied directly in diesel engines due to several poor fuel properties such high viscosity and instability. Emulsification could overcome the disadvantages of bio-oil. In this study, bio-oil emulsified with diesel was combusted in a DI diesel engine, and the effects of bio-oil compositions on the engine performance and emissions were investigated. Crude bio-oil has aging and instability problems, which could cause inconsistencies in the results. Synthetic bio-oil was used to avoid the limitations posed by crude bio-oil. Synthetic bio-oil was fractioned into three categories (hydroxyl compounds, aldehydes and sugars), and the corresponding emulsions were prepared. Compared with diesel, the brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and brake-specific energy consumption (BSEC) were increased, and the brake power remained almost unchanged for the emulsions. For the exhaust emissions, CO and smoke emissions were decreased, while CO2 emissions were increased. The emulsions derived from the aldehydes and hydroxyl compounds reduced NOx emissions, whereas emulsions derived from sugars and the whole bio-oil increased NOx emissions. The results indicated that the aldehydes and hydroxyl compounds in bio-oil were more desirable for clean combustion than sugars. The hydroxyl compounds could result in the largest emissions reductions due to the presence of OH radicals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increased urbanization and increase in population has led to an increased demand for fuels. The result is the prices of fuels are reaching new heights every day. Using low-cost feedstocks such as rendered animal fats in biodiesel production will reduce biodiesel expenditures. One of the low-cost feedstocks for biodiesel production from poultry feathers. This paper describes a new and environmentally friendly process for developing biodiesel production technology from feather waste produced in poultry industry. Transesterification is one of the well-known processes by which fats and oils are converted into biodiesel. The reaction often makes use of acid/base catalyst. If the material possesses high free fatty acid then acid catalyst gives better results. The data resulted from gas chromatography (GC) revealed these percentages for fatty acid compositions: myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and arachidonic acid. The biodiesel function group was analyzed by using FTIR. This study concluded that the rooster feathers have superior potential to process them into biodiesel than broiler chicken feathers fat because of fatty acid composition values and it has important properties of biodiesel. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - The current work focuses on the experimental investigation to analyze the combustion and emission characteristics of a direct injection diesel engine fueled with neat biodiesel (BD100) and different proportions of cyclohexanol blends as a fuel additive in various volume fractions. Cyclohexanol is dispersed into a neat biodiesel in a volume fraction of 10, 20, and 30 vol%. The biodiesel is produced from neem oil by the conventional transesterification process. The experimental results revealed that with the increased cyclohexanol fraction, the combustion was found smooth. The addition of cyclohexanol has a positive influence on various physical and chemical properties of neat biodiesel. The in-cylinder pressure is comparatively low for diesel followed by cyclohexanol and biodiesel blends when compared with neat biodiesel. This is due to shorter ignition delay period. The heat-release rate of neat biodiesel is the highest among all fuels. The overall HC emission of BD70COH30 is 12.19% lower than BD100 and 16.34% lower than diesel. The overall CO2 emission of BD70COH30 is 13.91% higher than BD100 and 19.5% higher than diesel. The overall NOx emission of BD70COH30 is 5.31% lower than BD100 at all load engine operations. The presence of 10, 20, and 30% of cyclohexanol in biodiesel decreased smoke emissions as compared with neat biodiesel and diesel. The overall smoke emission of BD70COH30 is 19.23% lower than BD100 and 25.51% lower than diesel. The overall CO emission of cyclohexanol blended with biodiesel by 30 vol% (BD70COH30) is 17% lower than neat biodiesel and 21.8% lower than diesel. Based on the outcome of this study, neem oil biodiesel and cyclohexanol blends can be employed as a potential alternative fuel for existing unmodified diesel engines owing to its lesser emission characteristics. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Several studies that have assessed the role of bioenergy in the energy system have primarily focused on electricity, heat, and road transport. However, sectors that have few alternatives to biomass, namely aviation and the chemical industry, are expected to become increasingly important. We have extended a bottom-up energy systems model with fossil-based and bio-based chemicals and with renewable jet fuels to assess the deployment of biomass conversion technologies in the Netherlands until 2030. The model comprises detailed cost-structures and mid-term developments for the energy system with detailed cost-supply curves for biomass, renewable energy technologies, and carbon capture and storage. The framework incorporates multi-output processes, such as biorefineries, to address cross-sectoral synergies. To capture the uncertainty in technical progress, technology development scenarios are used to assess cost-optimal biomass utilization pathways over time. Slow technical progress (LowTech) leads to biomass applications for heating, first-generation biofuels from hydrotreated oils, and bio-based chemicals based on first-generation fermentation systems. Enhanced technology development (HighTech) allows the production of second-generation biofuels, large volumes of diverse bio-based chemicals and renewable jet fuels. The required biomass may range from 230 PJ (LowTech) to 300 PJ (HighTech) in 2030, supplied primarily from imported resources. Both scenarios show that, under existing policies, CO2 emissions will only gradually be reduced to reach 1990 levels (140–145 Mt CO2). Further scenario analysis is recommended to assess model sensitivity and the necessary preconditions for future biomass conversion pathways and robust directions towards the required greenhouse-gas mitigation pathways. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Perennial bioenergy crops are considered an important feedstock for a growing bioeconomy. However, in the USA, production of biofuel from these dedicated, nonfood crops is lagging behind federal mandates and markets have yet to develop. Most studies on the economic potential of perennial biofuel crops have concluded that even high-yielding bioenergy grasses are unprofitable compared to corn/soybeans, the prevailing crops in the United States Corn Belt. However, they did not account for opportunities precision agriculture presents to integrate perennials into agronomically and economically underperforming parts of corn/soybean fields. Using publicly available subfield data and market projections, we identified an upper bound to the areas in Iowa, United States, where the conversion from corn/soybean cropland to an herbaceous bioenergy crop, switchgrass, could be economically viable under different price, land tenancy, and yield scenarios. Assuming owned land, medium crop prices, and a biomass price of US$ 55 Mg−1, we showed that 4.3% of corn/soybean cropland could break even when converted to switchgrass yielding up to 10.08 Mg ha−1. The annualized change in net present value on each converted subfield patch ranged from just above US$ 0 ha−1 to 692 ha−1. In the three counties of highest economic opportunity, total annualized producer benefits from converting corn/soybean to switchgrass summed to US$ 2.6 million, 3.4 million, and 7.6 million, respectively. This is the first study to quantify an upper bound to the potential private economic benefits from targeted conversion of unfavorable corn/soybean cropland to switchgrass, leaving arable land already under perennial cover unchanged. Broadly, we conclude that areas with high within-field yield variation provide highest economic opportunities for switchgrass conversion. Our results are relevant for policy design intended to improve the sustainability of agricultural production. While focused on Iowa, this approach is applicable to other intensively farmed regions globally with similar data availability. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Ethanol has become a promising biofuel, widely used as a renewable fuel and gasoline additive. Describing the oxidation kinetics of ethanol with high accuracy is required for the development of future efficient combustion devices with lower pollutant emissions. The oxidation process of ethanol, from reducing to oxidizing conditions, and its pressure dependence (20, 40 and 60 bar) has been analyzed in the 500–1100 K temperature range, in a tubular flow reactor under well controlled conditions. The effect of the presence of NO has been also investigated. The experimental results have been interpreted in terms of a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism with the GADM mechanism (Glarborg P, Alzueta MU, Dam-Johansen K and Miller JA, 1998) as a base mechanism but updated, validated, extended by our research group with reactions added from the ethanol oxidation mechanism of Alzueta and Hernández (Alzueta MU and Hernández JM, 2002), and revised according to the present high-pressure conditions and the presence of NO. The final mechanism is able to reproduce the experimental trends observed on the reactants consumption and main products formation during the ethanol oxidation under the conditions studied in this work. The results show that the oxygen availability in the reactant mixture has an almost imperceptible effect on the temperature for the onset of ethanol consumption at a constant pressure, but this consumption is faster for the highest value of air excess ratio (λ) analyzed. Moreover, as the pressure becomes higher, the oxidation of ethanol starts at lower temperatures. The presence of NO promotes ethanol oxidation, due to the increased relevance of the interactions of CH3 radicals and NO2 (from the conversion of NO to NO2 at high pressures and in presence of O2) and the increased concentration of OH radicals from the interaction of NO2 and water. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The high consumption of gasoline in the Brazilian highway sector (around 32.1%) makes the fuel adulteration a target, especially due to the content of anhydrous ethanol. The excess of ethanol in gasoline beyond the 27% limit (v/v) that is the maximum content allowed by the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Gas and Biofuels (ANP) can cause premature corrosion in the fuel tank, and problems with ignition and engine performance problems. This work proposes the application of a new methodology, time domain nuclear magnetic resonance (TD-NMR) to detect the adulteration of gasoline with ethanol. The results showed that the commercial gasoline has transverse relaxation time (T2) changing between 2.02 and 2.05 s, while the ethanol has T2 equal to 1.6 s. Samples adulterated with percentage of ethanol between 5% and 50% (v/v) showed T2 ranges between 1.70 s and 2.05 s. The methodology proposed here showed excellent agreement with infrared in the middle region (MIR) and can used to diverse commercial gasoline. Besides, TD-NMR is simple, the measure are rapid, non-destructiveness and data are easy to be interpreted. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A single-step method for transesterifying and recovering lipids in concentrated slurries (ca 20% w/w solids) of ruptured microalgae is presented. A soluble Rhizomucor miehei lipase (RML) was used to directly transesterify the lipids in the marine microalgae Nannochloropsis salina. This allowed both triglycerides (TAG) and polar saponifiable lipids to be recovered as fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) using a nonpolar solvent (hexane). Up to 90 wt% of the total saponifiable lipids (SL) were converted to FAME within 24 h, approximately 75% of which was recovered in the hexane by centrifugation. Two pathways for the conversion and recovery of polar lipids were identified. The water in the slurry buffered against potential lipase inhibition by methanol, but necessitated a high methanol dose for maximal FAME conversion. Nonetheless the method enables the recovery of polar lipids as FAME while avoiding the need for both drying of the biomass and a downstream transesterification step. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Particle size distributions (PSDs) are measured at the exhaust of a diesel engine burning a sulphur-free diesel fuel and a blend of the fuel with a rapeseed methyl-ester. Different operating conditions of load and engine speed are analyzed. Particles with sizes ranging from few nanometers up 1 micron are generated during combustion in the engine. Operating conditions and fuel characteristics strongly affect the PSDs confirming that particles are generated from fuel oxidation and pyrolysis rather than from the oxidation of lube oil or from other sources in the engine. The higher is the engine load, the higher the emission of mass concentration of particulate matter but the lower their number concentration. At fixed engine loads, the increase of the engine speed produces more particles and with larger mean sizes. The use of the biofuel blended with a commercial fuel reduces the total mass concentration of particulate matter but strongly increases the number concentration of sub-10 nm particles. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This research develops an optimization model to describe the tradeoff among blend components in the least-cost biomass blend, based on resource availability, quality requirements, and logistics cost for a biochemical conversion. A mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to determine the least-cost blend from a set of candidate feedstocks. A case study – based on a biorefinery located in western Kansas that uses three-pass corn stover, two-pass corn stover, switchgrass, miscanthus, and municipal solid waste fractions to meet biochemical conversion specifications and feedstock demand – shows that the delivered cost of an optimal blend that meets carbohydrate and ash specifications is 12.12% higher than the delivered cost of optimal blend that meets a carbohydrate specification only. The results indicate that a least-cost blend that meets both carbohydrate and ash specifications consists of miscanthus (48.2%) and switchgrass (29.4%) whereas the least-cost blend meeting carbohydrate specification only comprises three-pass corn stover (55.4%) and two-pass corn stover (20.4%). An optimal blend uses a low-cost municipal solid waste fraction in all cases, implying that blending could be a potential strategy to reduce delivered feedstock cost. Published 2018.

AB  - Ethyl levulinate (Ethyl 4-oxopentanoate) is a liquid molecule at ambient temperature, comprising of ketone and ethyl ester functionalities and is one of the prominent liquid fuel candidates that may be easily obtained from lignocellulosic biomass. The combustion kinetics of ethyl levulinate have been investigated. Shock tube and rapid compression machine apparatuses are utilised to acquire gas phase ignition delay measurements of 0.5% ethyl levulinate/O2 mixtures at ϕ = 1.0 and ϕ = 0.5 at ∼ 10 atm over the temperature range 1000–1400 K. Ethyl levulinate is observed not to ignite at temperatures lower than ∼1040 K in the rapid compression machine. The shock tube and rapid compression machine data are closely consistent and show ethyl levulinate ignition delay to exhibit an Arrhenius dependence to temperature. These measurements are explained by the construction and analysis of a detailed chemical kinetic model. The kinetic model is completed by establishing thermochemical-kinetic analogies to 2-butanone, for the ethyl levulinate ketone functionality, and to ethyl propanoate for the ethyl ester functionality. The so constructed model is observed to describe the shock tube data very accurately, but computes the rapid compression machine data set to a lesser but still applicable fidelity. Analysis of the model suggests the autooxidation mechanism of ethyl levulinate to be entirely dominated by the propensity for the ethyl ester functionality to unimolecularly decompose to form levulinic acid and ethylene. The subsequent reaction kinetics of these species is shown to dictate the overall rate of the global combustion reaction. This model is then use to estimate the Research and Motored Octane Numbers of ethyl levulinate to be ≥97.7 and ≥ 93, respectively. With this analysis ethyl levulinate would be best suited as a gasoline fuel component, rather than as a diesel fuel as suggested in the literature. Indeed it may be considered to be useful as an octane booster. The ethyl levulinate kinetic model is constructed within a state-of-the-art gasoline surrogate combustion kinetic model and is thus available as a tool with which to investigate the use of ethyl levulinate as a gasoline additive. © 2018 The Combustion Institute

AB  - The valorization of the spent coffee grounds (SCGs) has attracted a lot of attention recently from both the academia and industry. The development of an economically attractive and environmentally sustainable process based on available experimental data on the SCGs valorization has not been investigated in the open literature. This is clearly a very important issue and is the subject of the present work. Evidence is presented to support the conclusion that the economic performance of the process can be acceptable only at large production capacities realized at centralized facilities. In addition, it is shown, using a “gate-to-gate” Life Cycle Assessment (LCI), that the environmental performance of the process is acceptable and the process can be considered sustainable. Further research is necessary in the area of efficient recovery of the bioactive compounds available in SCGs. These compounds have a significant added value that can render the process economically attractive at capacities that are low enough to be practically realizable. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Co-liquefaction of municipal sewage sludge (MSS) and heavy metal (HM) contaminated lignocellulosic biomass (rice straw or wood sawdust) was conducted at 300 °C with ethanol as the solvent to study the transformation behavior of HMs (e.g., Cu, Cd, Pb, Cr, Zn, and Ni). The results indicate that HMs in rice straw or wood sawdust transferred heavily to bio-oils (up to 10–25% of the total Cu, Cd, and Zn) when they were liquefied individually, compared with MSS with only ∼5% distributed to bio-oil. The bio-available fraction of HMs in bio-chars and bio-oils produced from liquefaction of individual biomass were assessed to show medium to high risk to the environment. Co-liquefaction promoted the distribution of HMs to solid bio-char. Moreover, co-liquefaction benefited the immobilization of HMs in bio-chars and bio-oils. Synergistic effects were found for HMs immobilization during co-liquefaction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Drop-in fuels have aroused great interest for automotive and aeronautical use, constituting the newest area of biofuel research. These fuels do not contain oxygen, like fossil fuels, and require no modifications to engines and distribution infrastructure. In this work, biohydrocarbons were obtained in the distillation ranges of gasoline, diesel and aviation kerosene from palm kernel oil and palm olein in the form of triglycerides or their hydrolysates. A 15% ratio of the thermally activated HBeta zeolite catalyst to the mass of the fatty material was used. Deoxygenation reactions (5 h, 800 rpm, batch reactor) occurred at 350 °C under 10 bar H2 atmosphere to furnish as much as 96% conversion to liquid hydrocarbons. The products were analyzed by FTIR for a rapid quantification of the deoxygenation efficiency using a method developed for this purpose. These products were also characterized by thermal analysis and GC–MS. The freezing temperatures of the biohydrocarbons and their mixtures with fossil aviation kerosene were determined by DSC. The results obtained were very promising, especially considering the relatively mild process conditions as low H2 pressure and catalyst without noble metal and with high reusability. © 2018

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable energy source that reduces particle emission, but few studies have assessed its effects. To assess the effects of acute inhalation of two doses (600 and 1200 μg/m3) of diesel (DE) and biodiesel (BD) fuels on the inflammatory pulmonary and systemic profile of mice. Animals were exposed for 2 h in an inhalation chamber inside the Container Laboratory for Fuels. Heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure were determined 30 min after exposure. After 24 h, we analyzed the lung inflammation using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF); neutrophil and macrophage quantification in the lung parenchyma was performed, and blood and bone marrow biomarkers as well as receptor of endothelin-A (ET-Ar), receptor of endothelin-B (ET-Br), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOs) and isoprostane (ISO) levels in the pulmonary vessels and bronchial epithelium were evaluated. HRV increased for BD600, D600 and D1200 compared to filtered air (FA). Both fuels (DE and BD) produced alterations in red blood cells independent of the dose. BALF from the BD600 and BD1200 groups showed an increase in neutrophils compared to those of the FA group. Numeric density of the polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells was elevated with BD600 compared to FA. In the peribronchiolar vessels, there was an increase in ET-Ar and ET-Br expression following BD600 compared to FA; and there was a reduction in the iNOs expression for BD1200 and the VCAM-1 for D1200 compared to FA. In the bronchial epithelium, there was an increase in ETAr at BD600, ET-Br at two doses (600 and 1200 μg/m3) of DE and BD, iNOs at D600 and VCAM-1 at BD1200 and D600; all groups were compared to the FA group. Acute exposure to DE and BD derived from sewage methyl esters triggered pulmonary and cardiovascular inflammatory alterations in mice. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Two locally isolated oleaginous microalgae from Songkhla Lake in Thailand were identified as Micractinium reisseri SIT04 and Scenedesmus obliquus SIT06. The effects of nutrient starvations on the responses of these two strains were intensively investigated in order to increase their lipid contents and manipulate their fatty acid compositions for suitable use as biodiesel feedstocks. Starvation of either phosphorus or ferrous less affected cell growth but did stimulate lipid accumulation of both strains by 1.2 folds. While nitrogen starvation severely limited cell growth but most effectively increased lipid content of both strains by 1.54 folds for M. reisseri SIT04 (up to 36.6%) and by 1.6 folds for S. obliquus SIT06 (up to 56.8%). The lipid accumulated during nitrogen starvation contained higher saturated fatty acids which could make biodiesel with better fuel properties and higher oxidative stability. The harvesting process through bioflocculation was optimized by Response Surface Methodology. The maximum flocculation efficiency greater than 99.5% was achieved using minimum dosage of chitosan as bioflocculant. This study has revealed the strategies to increase the potential use of oleaginous microalgae as biodiesel feedstocks and the cost-effective process for the harvesting of microalgal biomass. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design (CCD) was used to optimize various process variables such as methanol to oil molar ratio, reaction time, catalyst concentration (sodium phosphate) and temperature for biodiesel production. The optimum conditions obtained were as follows: 11:1 M ratio of methanol to oil, 45 min reaction time, 2.96 wt% catalyst concentration and 74 °C temperature. At these conditions, the obtained bauhinia variegata methyl ester (BVME/biodiesel) yield was 95.1%. Fatty acid composition of oil was categorized by using gas chromatography (GC) analysis. The biodiesel product was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR and 13C NMR). The fuel properties of the biodiesel were determined as per ASTM test method. The performance, combustion and emission characteristics of test samples (diesel, biodiesel test blends such as B10, B20, B30, B40 and B100) on a single cylinder diesel engine were studied. The test data were generated by varying the load (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%). Variations in the engine emissions were recorded using AVL DIGAS 444 analyser. The engine performance was slightly reduced and combustion characteristics had slightly changed when engine was fueled with biodiesel test blends. The CO and HC emissions were less for biodiesel test blends (except B100) but NOx emissions increased with closer engine performance when compared with diesel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The main contribution of this research is formulating the size optimization of grid-independent hybrid wind/photovoltaic/biodiesel/battery systems and proposing a hybrid algorithm on this optimization problem. There are many investigations based on hybrid wind and PV power systems but the investigation on the hybrid wind/photovoltaic/biodiesel/battery system is rarely found. Here, the optimal design of a biodiesel/wind/photovoltaic/battery energy system for a stand-alone application in Iran is studied. The objective of the optimum design problem is to minimize the life cycle cost of the wind/photovoltaic/biodiesel/battery system subject to some constraints by adjusting four decision variables, namely, number of batteries, photovoltaic area, the swept area of wind turbines, and fuel consumption of the biodiesel generator. To solve the optimization problem, initially, we investigate the performance of two popular metaheuristic algorithms, namely, harmony search and simulated annealing. Moreover, this article proposes a hybrid harmony search-simulated annealing method that combines the advantages of each one of the above-mentioned metaheuristic algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed hybrid harmony search-simulated annealing improves the obtained solutions, in terms of quality, compared to the solutions provided by individual harmony search or individual simulated annealing algorithms. Moreover, the hybrid photovoltaic/biodiesel/battery system is the best choice to supply the electrical load. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rape is a non-grain feedstock with several characteristics that make it suitable for biofuel production, such as high oil yields and low environmental impact. Planting rape on winter fallow fields could allow for seasonal rotation between the bioenergy production and agricultural production. In the present study, the Global Agro-Ecological Zones model was used to estimate the production potential of rapeseed on winter fallow fields in the Yangtze River region from 2010 to 2015. Life cycle assessment was then conducted to calculate energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions from the entire energy-producing process and to estimate the number of bioenergy enterprises and their spatial distribution. The results indicated that the total area available of winter fallow fields in the Yangtze River region was 24.93 million ha, accounting for 34.2% of the total cultivated land area. The total yield of winter rapeseed was up to 46.41 million tons (an average yield of 1.86 tons/ha). Thus, the study area could potentially produce net energy of up to 3564 million MJ with energy return on energy investment (EROEI) as high as 1.52–1.84. The total reduction of greenhouse gas emissions may be up to 23.28 million tons, and the total number of bioenergy enterprises could be 589, from which the total biodiesel output could be 167.5 million tons. Hubei, Henan, Anhui and Jiangxi should be prioritized for generating biofuels from rapeseed planted on winter fallow fields. © 2018

AB  - A numerical study is performed by KIVA-CHEMKIN code to compare the combustion, performance and emission characteristics of neat biodiesel (B100) and biodiesel blend including a mixture of 20% biodiesel and 80% diesel (B20) resulting from the PCCI combustion mode in a light-duty diesel engine. For the biodiesel reaction mechanism, multi-chemistry surrogate mechanism using methyl decanoate (MD) and methyl-9-decenoate (MD9D) is used in this study. The results show that PCCI combustion like high temperature conventional combustion cannot cover the lower ISFC of the biodiesel blend fuel compared to the diesel fuel. A detailed analysis of combustion and emissions, involving the role of formaldehyde (CH2O) and hydroxyl (OH) radicals as well as O and H radicals, was performed in the PCCI combustion stages and emissions formation for the B100 and B20 fuels. The results indicate that higher concentration of formaldehyde as well as lower concentration of hydroxyl radicals for the B20 case advances low temperature heat release (LTHR) and retards high temperature heat release (HTHR) respectively compared to the B100 case. In addition, O and OH radicals as well as cylinder temperature are effective parameters regarding higher NO and CO concentrations for the B20 case compared to the B100 case. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Jatropha curcas shell was slow pyrolyzed in pilot-scale fixed bed reactor at 500 °C. Fuel properties of moisture free bio-oil (MFBO) and diesel were compared, which advocated MFBO's applicability in CI engines. Negligible corrosion effect of MFBO was experienced for SS-316 and anodized Al, whereas significant corrosiveness was observed towards Cu. For all three metals, diesel was found to be less corrosive. MFBO was mixed with diesel in proportions of 4%, 8%, 12% and 16% (% v/v) and operating variables of single cylinder VCR engine were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM) with the blends. A central composite design (CCD) was employed to examine the effects of three independent variables - CR, load and blend %, whereas the investigated response variables were brake thermal efficiency (ηBth), brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc), unburnt hydrocarbon (UHC), CO, and CO2. The obtained data were analyzed with the help of Design Expert software. Response prediction was accomplished by following a second-degree polynomial model. The optimum conditions were CR 18.00, load 6.665 kg, and blend 12.22%. Under optimum conditions, the experimental values of response variables were fairly comparable with the model predicted values. The designed model achieved overall desirability of 0.786. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Some properties of castor oil such as extremely high viscosity and high water content complicate the use of neat castor oil (NCO) as a fuel for compression ignition engines. The brake thermal efficiency, emission and combustion characteristics of a diesel engine operation compared with neat castor oil is far inferior. However, neat castor oil has an affinity for alcohol because of high Ricinoleic Acid about 89.5% and hence mixes in any proportion without any phase separation and also diesel easily blends with neat castor oil. The blending of bio-ethanol and diesel enhances the combustion of NCO. The present study aims to obtain an optimum ternary fuel blend with neat castor oil-diesel- bio-ethanol, which can be used in small diesel engines. Experimental investigation reveals that the ternary blend of neat castor oil-diesel-bio-ethanol fuel with the volume ratio of NCO40 + D30 + E30 is optimum. At full load, the thermal efficiency of the engine operating with NCO40 + D30 + E30 is 31.25%, which is closer to diesel operation of 32.94% and specific NO emission for NCO40 + D30 + E30 is 6.11 g/kWh, whereas it is 8.17 g/kWh for diesel. NCO40 + D30 + E30 has a smoke emission of 68% opacity, but the smoke level of the base diesel engine is 57% opacity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The coconut kernel-associated fungus, Lasiodiplodia theobromae VBE1, was grown on coconut cake with added coconut oil as lipase inducer under solid-state fermentation conditions. The extracellular-produced lipases were purified and resulted in two enzymes: lipase A (68,000 Da)—purified 25.41-fold, recovery of 47.1%—and lipase B (32,000 Da)—purified 18.47-fold, recovery of 8.2%. Both lipases showed optimal activity at pH 8.0 and 35 °C, were activated by Ca2+, exhibited highest specificity towards coconut oil and p-nitrophenyl palmitate, and were stable in iso-octane and hexane. Ethanol supported higher lipase activity than methanol, and n-butanol inactivated both lipases. Crude lipase immobilized by entrapment within 4% (w/v) calcium alginate beads was more stable than the crude-free lipase preparation within the range pH 2.5–10.0 and 20–80 °C. The immobilized lipase preparation was used to catalyze the transesterification/methanolysis of coconut oil to biodiesel (fatty acyl methyl esters (FAMEs)) and was quantified by gas chromatography. The principal FAMEs were laurate (46.1%), myristate (22.3%), palmitate (9.9%), and oleate (7.2%), with minor amounts of caprylate, caprate, and stearate also present. The FAME profile was comparatively similar to NaOH-mediated transesterified biodiesel from coconut oil, but distinctly different to petroleum-derived diesel. This study concluded that Lasiodiplodia theobromae VBE1 lipases have potential for biodiesel production from coconut oil. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biocrude pyrolysis oil is obtained by a process called fast-pyrolysis, in which almost any organic-based feedstock is thermally processed at moderate temperatures, in the range of 400–600 °C, in the absence of oxygen at short residence times. After condensing the vapors in a cooling tray, a dark-brown bioliquid is obtained. The quality of the thus obtained fast pyrolysis oil has some barriers for its direct use as transportation fuel. Low caloric value, high viscosity, and corrosion are the major challenges for its implementation in conventional engines. There have been sustained efforts to improve the quality of the oil. In this Communication we are reporting a concept on improving the acidic properties by means of a combined catalysis and adsorption approach. We found that fast pyrolysis oil can be upgraded through alcoholysis using n-butanol and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, which are biomass-derived bulk chemicals. The reaction is acid catalyzed whereas water is continuously separated from the condensate mixture through molecular sieve adsorption. Under optimal conditions, the ultimate acidity and water content of the upgraded product are negligible. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Advanced biomass feedstocks tend to provide more non-fuel ecosystem goods and services (ES) than 1st-generation alternatives. We explore the idea that payment for non-fuel ES could facilitate market penetration of advanced biofuels by closing the profitability gap. As a specific example, we discuss the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin (MARB), where 1st-generation bioenergy feedstocks (e.g., corn-grain) have been integrated into the agricultural landscape. Downstream, the MARB drains to the Gulf of Mexico, where the most-valuable fishery in the US is impacted by annual formation of a large hypoxic “Dead zone.” We suggest that advanced biomass production systems in the MARB can increase and stabilize the provision of ES derived from the coastal and marine ecosystems of the Gulf-of-Mexico. Upstream, we suggest that choosing feedstocks based on their resistance or resilience to disturbance (e.g., perennials, diverse feedstocks) can increase reliability in ES provision over time. Direct feedbacks to incentivize producers of advanced feedstocks are currently lacking. Perhaps a shift from first-generation biofuels to perennial-based fuels and other advanced bioenergy systems (e.g., algal diesel, biogas from animal wastes) can be encouraged by bringing downstream environmental externalities into the market for upstream producers. In future, we can create such feedbacks through payments for ES, but significant research is needed to pave the way. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Energy-efficient and scalable harvesting and lipid extraction processes must be developed in order for the algal biofuels and bioproducts industry to thrive. The major challenge for harvesting is the handling of large volumes of cultivation water to concentrate low amounts of biomass. For lipid extraction, the major energy and cost drivers are associated with disrupting the algae cell wall and drying the biomass before solvent extraction of the lipids. Here we review the research and development conducted by the Harvesting and Extraction Team during the 3-year National Alliance for Advanced Biofuels and Bioproducts (NAABB) algal consortium project. The harvesting and extraction team investigated five harvesting and three wet extraction technologies at lab bench scale for effectiveness, and conducted a techoeconomic study to evaluate their costs and energy efficiency compared to available baseline technologies. Based on this study, three harvesting technologies were selected for further study at larger scale. The selected harvesting technologies: electrocoagulation, membrane filtration, and ultrasonic harvesting, were evaluated in a field study at minimum scale of 100 L/h. None of the extraction technologies were determined to be ready for scale-up; therefore, an emerging extraction technology (wet solvent extraction) was selected from industry to provide scale-up data and capabilities to produce lipid and lipid-extracted materials for the NAABB program. One specialized extraction/adsorption technology was developed that showed promise for recovering high value co-products from lipid extracts. Overall, the NAABB Harvesting and Extraction Team improved the readiness level of several innovative, energy efficient technologies to integrate with algae production processes and captured valuable lessons learned about scale-up challenges. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Small-scale biodiesel production with a high level of community involvement has been associated with a number of benefits. These include relatively low environmental impacts, lack of competition with food production, strong poverty alleviation effects and enhanced access to energy. This Short Communication provides a qualitative analysis of the effects of the cultivation of biodiesel oilseed tree crops (mostly Millettia pinnata, along with Simarouba glauca, Azadirachta indica, Madhuca lungifolia and Jatropha curcas) in such a small-scale project, the Hassan Bio-Fuel Park in Karnataka, India. This extensive ethnographic research and using the ecosystem services approach to synthesize the findings suggests that the changes in both the flows of ecosystem services and different constituents of human wellbeing are marginal. While the ecosystem services approach can be useful to synthesize various forms of knowledge on biofuels to inform policy, this particular case study highlights the importance of being open about the different, often implicit, priorities and values of research projects and the various kinds of actors involved in biofuel production. Finally, it is crucial to understand not just which impacts are generated but especially how those impacts are generated. © 2017 The Author

AB  - Tungsten oxide promoted platinum catalysts (Pt-WOx/Al2O3) of varying composition were prepared by wet impregnation method and reduced in hydrogen atmosphere. X-ray powder diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that Pt is completely reduced to metallic state while tungsten is in +6 and +5 oxidation states. Pt crystallite and particle sizes increased (from 1.2 to 1.4 nm and 2.5 to 3 nm, respectively) in presence of WOx (CO-chemisorption and transmission electron microscopy). Tungsten addition augmented strong acid sites. It enhanced significantly the catalytic activity of Pt/Al2O3 in deoxygenation of fatty acids and their methyl esters. Tungsten altered the reaction pathway from decarbonylation/decarboxylation to hydrodeoxygenation. A catalyst with 4 wt% Pt and 8 wt% W exhibited high catalytic performance. Complete conversion of oleic acid and octadecane product selectivity in the range 67.1–80.8% was obtained. Pt-WOx/Al2O3 is a stable and reusable fatty acid deoxygenation catalyst. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding changes in carbon sequestration due to land conversion is key for elucidating the true potential of biofuel landscapes to provide climate regulation ecosystem services. In this study, we focus on the two most promoted biofuel crops in southern Africa, Jatropha and sugarcane, to analyse the land use change effects and associated carbon impacts of growing biofuel crops in five study sites in Mozambique, Malawi and Swaziland. We found that, considering a 20-year cycle, carbon stocks in aboveground biomass are higher for sugarcane than for Jatropha. However, as soil organic carbon (SOC) is generally the main carbon pool, total carbon stocks (considering biomass and soil) will highly depend on SOC. Our results show that, in our study sites, sugarcane replaced land uses with low carbon stocks (low-density forest and agriculture), and as a result carbon gains occurred due to land use change. In the Jatropha projects, carbon gains are observed in the smallholder scheme as agricultural land was converted to Jatropha, but carbon debts occurred in the Jatropha plantation as high-density forest was cleared to grow this feedstock. Finally we show that, if a plantation of sugarcane or Jatropha is envisioned to be located in the studied regions, more forested land could potentially be converted into sugarcane (30–44% of forest) than into Jatropha (24–32%), without creating carbon debts due to land conversion. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of the carbon impacts of land use change of the main biofuel crops in southern Africa. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ni/AC (nickel on active carbon) catalysts with different Ni loadings were synthesized and studied for the decarboxylation and aromatization of oleic acid in the absence of H2 or hydrogen donors. Without the use of hydrogen source, the whole deoxygenation process became more economical. Moreover, oleic acid can be saturated using the H2 derived from the production of aromatics, which were also considered as the critical component in aviation biofuels. The structure and properties of the catalysts were investigated using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and temperature-programmed desorption of CH3COOH and CO. The experimental and characterization results revealed that 30% Ni/AC had a higher adsorption capacity of CH3COOH among the other Ni/AC catalysts and highly dispersed and small Ni particles, providing a heptadecane yield of 40.7%. It also contained 13.8% aromatics, which fulfills the requirement of aviation fuels. This Ni/AC catalyst showed good stability even after being reused thrice. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Of all the biofuels available in the market, ethanol seems to be the most promising one for spark-ignited engines. However, its lower calorific value makes operation more expensive due to increased volumetric fuel consumption, when compared to gasoline. Measures that further increase efficiency and that reduce fuel costs are necessary for a more widespread use. Hence, the use of ethanol with increased hydration may be the answer for reducing fuel costs while contributing for increased efficiency should the properties of this blend are properly addressed. Previous studies reported an important increase in knock resistance for ethanol–water fuel blends with high water content, the so-called “wet ethanol”. This work explored this phenomenon by increasing the compression ratio of the engine. It was investigated the limiting conditions with respect to spark advance and compression ratio through ignition timing sweep. The direct impact on combustion and emissions parameters of using wet ethanol with higher compression ratios was also evaluated. Ethanol-water fuel blends containing 4%, 10%, 20% and 30% v/v of water in ethanol were tested and compared in engine tests. For each of the fuel blends it was assessed three different compression ratios (12.5, 13.5 and 14.5:1). The results showed that ethanol–water fuel blends with high water content allow working with optimum combustion phasing even for compression ratios of 14.5:1. It leads to an increase of 7% in the indicated efficiency values for E80W20 when compared to commercial ethanol with 4% hydration. Emissions results were similar to those of commercial ethanol. Thus, this work shows that E80W20 is an optimum blend for increased engine efficiency and similar emissions of those of E4W96 while reducing fuel production costs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Caesalpinea eriostachys seed oil, as a source of triglycerides with potential application for biodiesel production in Mexico is introduced. Its lipid profile obtained by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed saturated and unsaturated glycerol esters as the constituents. Therefore, heterogeneous and homogeneous catalyzed transesterification reactions were assayed employing ZnAl hydrotalcites and KOH, as the catalysts, respectively. The transesterification reactions yielded 59% for Zn/Al(2), 79% for Zn/Al(4), and 90% for KOH, depicting typical behavior, as in biodiesel production data from literature, where Zn-Al hydrotalcites or KOH were assayed. The caloric, density, viscosity values, and fatty acid methyl esters profile from reaction products were concordant to EN 14214, suggesting C. eriostachys as a promising feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A novel and efficient method for the use of non-edible cassava to synthesize biofuel precursors with long carbon chains in two steps was proposed. The finally produced precursors were based on the decomposition of cassava and condensation between furans and levulinates. The reaction parameters for levulinate production from cassava were optimized, and the results showed that the highest carbon mole yield of levulinates was up to 51.3% at 473 K, 4.0 MPa N2, and 6.0 h. After that, precursors with yields of 88.0 and 90.5% could be obtained when the mole ratios between furans and levulinates were 1:1 and 2:1, respectively. Characterization of precursors using elemental analysis, 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, gel permeation chromatography, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrated that different and intersecting routes of condensation resulted in the complex components of precursors. Moreover, the mechanism of condensation was proven to excessively depend upon the mole ratio between furans and levulinates in this investigation. This technical route indicates a simple and feasible method to produce renewable biofuel with long carbon chains from cassava directly. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: The aim of this work was to establish a process for the heterotrophic growth of green microalgae using forest biomass hydrolysates. To provide a carbon source for the growth of the green microalgae, two forest biomasses (Norway spruce and silver birch) were pretreated with a hybrid organosolv-steam explosion method, resulting in inhibitor-free pretreated solids with a high cellulose content of 77.9% w/w (birch) and 72% w/w (spruce). Pretreated solids were hydrolyzed using commercial cellulolytic enzymes to produce hydrolysate for the culture of algae. Results: The heterotrophic growth of A. protothecoides was assessed using synthetic medium with glucose as carbon source, where the effect of sugar concentration and the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio were optimized, resulting in accumulation of lipids at 5.42 ± 0.32 g/L (64.52 ± 0.53% lipid content) after 5 days of culture on glucose at 20 g/L. The use of birch and spruce hydrolysates was favorable for the growth and lipid accumulation of the algae, resulting in lipid production of 5.65 ± 0.21 g/L (66 ± 0.33% lipid content) and 5.28 ± 0.17 g/L (63.08 ± 0.71% lipid content) when grown on birch and spruce, respectively, after only 120 h of cultivation. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of using organosolv pretreated wood biomass hydrolysates for the growth and lipid production of microalgae in the literature. The pretreatment process used in this study provided high saccharification of biomass without the presence of inhibitors. Moreover, the lipid profile of this microalga showed similar contents to vegetable oils which improve the biodiesel properties. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Different research works demonstrate that the pervaporation can replace the distillation or deliver better solutions. It should be, however, accepted with criticism. In our case study, isobutanol-water separation is studied since it is increasingly important in the field of biofuels and process wastewater treatment. There are many options for the separation and they differ in their efficiency, economic features, robustness, development level and environmental impact. Five separation structures are investigated using distillation, both organophilic and hydrophilic pervaporations and hybrid separation units consisting of distillation and pervaporation including heat integrated solutions. The different alternatives are modelled in professional flowsheeting environment. Life cycle assessment, energy evaluation and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) based on PEST (Political, Economic, Social, and Technological) analysis are completed to evaluate and compare the five alternatives. The feed stream to be separated has the composition of 7 wt% isobutanol 93 wt% water that corresponds to the mixture of the phase split due to the limited solubility. Two product purities are considered, 98.8 and 99.9 wt%. In case of distillation processes, heat integration is also considered, that is, the feed is preheated with its bottom flow. Heat integration significantly improves the efficiency of the distillation and makes it for practically a competitive alternative. The best efficiency can be obtained with heat integrated hybrid separation, that is, the combination of distillation and pervaporation. The pure pervaporation that is the combination of organophilic and hydrophilic pervaporation can be efficient only at sloppy product purities because of the modest separation factor of the organophilic pervaporation membranes. In case of sharp separations, the organophilic pervaporation can be an equally applicable solution as the azeotropic distillation for isobutanol-water separation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-oil is a sustainable and environment-friendly material. The application of bio-oil in paving material, especially into asphalt binder territory, has attracted great attentions. This study focuses on the effect of bio-oil on mechanical and rheological characteristics of asphalt mastic. Bio-oil acting as a modifier was incorporated into asphalt binder by a weight percentage of 15%. Eight types of asphalt mastics were fabricated by means of mixing binder with various amounts of mineral powder filler. The effect of bio-oil on the shear property, high-temperature rheological performance and low-temperature flexibility of asphalt mastics was investigated by the cone penetration test, multiple stress creep recovery test and bending beam test, respectively. The result showed that the critical thermostability temperature of petroleum-based asphalt binder was 1.5 times higher than that of bio-modified asphalt binder. The shear strength of asphalt mastic with and without bio-oil increased with an increase in filler-to-binder ratio. The incorporation of bio-oil enhanced the high temperature stability of asphalt mastic. Asphalt mastic with and without bio-oil exhibited a great anti-deformation potential at high temperature of 64 °C when the filler-to-binder ratio reaches to 1.2. Filler-to-binder ratio had little influence on the corresponding deflection of bio-modified asphalt mastic at −10 °C. © 2018

AB  - Herein, a lignin-centered convergent approach to produce either aliphatic or aromatic bio-hydrocarbons is introduced. First, poplar or spruce wood was deconstructed by a lignin-first biorefining process, a technique based on the early-stage catalytic conversion of lignin, yielding lignin oils along with cellulosic pulps. Next, the lignin oils were catalytically upgraded in the presence of a phosphidated Ni/SiO2 catalyst under H2 pressure. Notably, selectivity toward aliphatics or aromatics can simply be adjusted by changes in H2 pressure and temperature. The process renders two distinct main cuts of branched hydrocarbons (gasoline: C6-C10, and kerosene/diesel: C14-C20). As the approach is H2-intensive, we examined the utilization of pulp as an H2 source via gasification. For several biomass sources, the H2 obtainable by gasification stoichiometrically meets the H2 demand of the deep converting lignin-first biorefinery, making this concept plausible for the production of high-energy-density drop-in biofuels. Heterogeneous catalysis is no longer limited to the conversion of lignin wastes from cellulosic-centric industries, but has expanded to offer innovative solutions for the deconstruction of lignocellulose by reductive processes. Such solutions are referred to as lignin-first biorefining. They are highly efficient at preventing the generation of recalcitrance in the lignin streams while yielding delignified pulps. Herein, a lignin-centered convergent approach rendering two main cuts of branched hydrocarbons (gasoline: C6-C10, and kerosene/diesel: C14-C20) is introduced. As the hydrodeoxygenation of lignin streams is H2-intensive, the utilization of pulp as an H2 source via gasification is proposed. The cellulosic H2 shows potential for covering the H2 demand for the production of drop-in lignin fuels. Importantly, the energy content of the lignin fuels relative to the energy content of the lignocellulose is approximately 2- to 2.5-times higher than that of cellulosic ethanol. Therefore, it is now timely to question whether cellulosic bioethanol is the most sensible target fuel from lignocellulose. Heterogeneous catalysis is no longer limited to the conversion of lignin wastes from cellulosic-centric industries, but has expanded to offer innovative solutions for the deconstruction of lignocellulose by reductive processes. This enables the creation of a deep converting lignin-first biorefinery, shifting paradigms. Lignin-biorefinery produces gasoline and kerosene/diesel drop-in fuels. The self-sufficiency in H2 is achieved through the gasification of the delignified holocelluloses. Notably, H2 surplus releases holocellulose for the production of platform chemicals, further monetizing the lignin-first process chains. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - This study examines that a non-edible dairy waste scum and Hydnocarpus Wightiana oil is claimed to be a highly potential feed stock for biodiesel production. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) in aggregation with Central Composite Design (CCD) is employed to evaluate the best potential combination of catalyst concentration, methanol to oil molar ratio, reaction time and temperature for higher yield of biodiesel content. A statistical model predicted that the highest conversion yield of scum oil methyl ester (SOME) and Hydnocarpus Wightiana oil methyl ester (HWOME) would be 91.636% and 94.091% at the following optimized reaction conditions: Methanol to oil molar ratio of 7.5:1 and 6.526:1, Catalyst Concentration of 0.961 wt% and 0.934 wt%, Reaction Time 49.529 min and 45 min and temperature 63.46 °C and 64.386 °C respectively. Experiments were conducted for SOME and HWOME at the predicted optimum conditions in three independent replicates, an average biodiesel yield of 90.89 ± 5% and 93.68 ± 4% was achieved which was in reasonable agreement with the predicted value. This study shows that the quality of biodiesel production from SOME and HWOME at optimum process conditions satisfies the ASTM D-6751 and EN14214 Standards. The physio-chemical properties of SOME and HWOME were determined and compared with that of diesel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase (ADO) is an essential enzyme for production of long-chain alkanes as drop-in biofuels, which are compatible with existing fuel systems. The most active ADOs are present in mesophilic cyanobacteria, especially Nostoc punctiforme. Given the potential applications of thermostable enzymes in biorefineries, here we generated a thermostable (Cts)-ADO based on a consensus of ADO sequences from several thermophilic cyanobacterial strains. Using an in silico design pipeline and a metagenome library containing 41 hotspring microbial communities, we created Cts-ADO. Cts-ADO displayed a 3.8-fold increase in pentadecane production on raising the temperature from 30 to 42 ?C, whereas ADO from N. punctiforme (Np-ADO) exhibited a 1.7-fold decline. 3D structure modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of Ctsand Np-ADO at different temperatures revealed differences between the two enzymes in residues clustered on exposed loops of these variants, which affected the conformation of helices involved in forming the ADO catalytic core. In Cts-ADO, this conformational change promoted ligand binding to its preferred iron, Fe2, in the di-iron cluster at higher temperature, but the reverse was observed in Np-ADO. Detailed mapping of residues conferring Cts-ADO thermostability identified four amino acids, which we substituted individually and together in Np-ADO. Among these substitution variants, A161E was remarkably similar to Cts-ADO in terms of activity optima, kinetic parameters, and structure at higher temperature. A161E was located in loop L6, which connects helices H5 and H6, and supported ligand binding to Fe2 at higher temperatures, thereby promoting optimal activity at these temperatures and explaining the increased thermostability of Cts-ADO. © 2018 Michalski and Williams Published under exclusive license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - Biodiesel has the potential to replace the conventional diesel fuel, thus the increasing interest and research in the use of biodiesel fuels for transport applications to improve the emisions. In this work, the spray characteristics of diesel with hydrogenated catalytic biodiesel (HCB) fuel blends were investigated in a constant volume combustion chamber to provide an accessible tool to predict spray behavior based on cheap and off-engine condition measurements for applying HCB in diesel engines. As two important indexes of spray characteristics, the liquid penetration and vapor penetration were researched using Mie-scattering and Schlieren methods under non-reacting conditions to avoid the influence of combustion on the mixing and vaporization processes. Besides, the liquid length of blended fuel under reacting conditions is measured by a laser system to figure out the effect of combustion on atomization process. The results show that the liquid length decreases with increasing HCB ratio in the blends and the fuel density has greater influence on the liquid length than the fuel viscosity. By comparing the liquid length result, a slight difference between the different blends on vapor penetration was observed under the same boundary condition. The spray characteristics of blends indicate that HCB is a good blending component for blended fuel which can be applied in diesel engine directly in large-scale. Moreover, the liquid length of laser Mie-scattering method is higher than that of LED Mie-scattering and the liquid length under reacting conditions is shorter than that of inert conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Different sludges such as municipal sewage sludge, paper/pulp mill sludge, and slaughterhouse sludge were collected and characterized for energy production. Bio-oils were produced from these sludges by supercritical liquefaction at 300 °C with methanol as the solvent. Carbon-rich and viscous bio-oils with yields about 20–30% were obtained. With methyl esters as the dominant component, these bio-oils were upgraded by blending or microemulsifying with biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters). The optimum microemulsions were formed at biodiesel/bio-oil ratio of 10, with bio-oil content of more than 8% (which doubled that obtained by blending) and surfactant effectiveness of 0.5–0.6 g rhamnolipid/g bio-oil being obtained. The thermogravimetric studies show that the blending and microemulsifying processes led to the shift of decomposition range and rate to higher levels and the reduction of activation energy of the hybrid fuel systems. There may be synergies of enhancing the combustion or ignition of microemulsions when biodiesel and bio-oil were used in combination in diesel engines, overcoming the disadvantages of using either biodiesel (e.g., long ignition delay, etc.) or bio-oil (e.g., long ignition delay and viscosity, etc.) individually. Microemulsification may be a promising bio-oil upgrading technology. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the presented paper, a combined experimental and numerical study was carried out in order to study the influence of in-nozzle flow, cavitation and tested fuel properties on the spray development and primary break up process. The internal flow of neat diesel and neat rapeseed oil biodiesel fuel in single-hole diesel injectors was studied numerically using the AVL FIRE computational program. The spray development and break-up were monitored in a pressure chamber at high pressure using a high-speed camera. An innovative method for obtaining spray length and cone angle was developed using LabVIEW software. The developed method allows us to study the influence of in-nozzle cavitation inception on the symmetry of injected fuel spray. The obtained numerical results show that the geometry of the test injector influences internal fuel flow and cavitation inception highly. Experimental results indicate that tested fuel properties‘ influence spray length and cone angle at high atmospheric pressure is rather small. The cavitation inside the injector nozzle influences the primary spray break-up process further and causes part of the spray, where more cavitation is present in the nozzle hole and its exit, to disintegrate. This confirms that cavitation inside the fuel injector can have a positive effect on the spray break-up and spray disintegration process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As our world demands more and more energy and fossil fuel resources are running out, searches on finding alternative fuels in internal combustion engines are increasing. Alcohols and biofuels obtained from oils can be used as alternative diesel fuels. The present work investigated the effects of n-butanol addition to safflower biodiesel usage in a diesel engine used for driving an electrical power generator. Safflower biodiesel was obtained by using transesterification method. Binary blends of butanol-biodiesel and ternary blends of ultra-low sulfur diesel-biodiesel–butanol were contained 5%, 10%, and 20% butanol in volume basis. The tests were carried out on a four-cylinder, four-strokes, and direct-injection diesel engine at half load operation with stable engine speed of 1500 rpm. Experimental test results on combustion characteristics, emission and performance of the fuels were investigated. According to test results, formation of heat release rates and in-cylinder pressure curves were considerably similar and total heat transfer, average gas temperature and mass fraction burned were slightly changed. The ternary blends showed lower emission and increased brake thermal efficiency up to 1.5%. Besides, average mass fuel consumption was increased up to 5% and brake specific fuel consumption up to 6%. For the other fuels, emission and brake thermal efficiency were deteriorated. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Butanol is frequently discussed as a potential biofuel as it can be produced via acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation. Like ethanol, it can be added to conventional petrochemical fuels in order to reduce the use of fossil fuels. However, such blending of butanol is only possible if the effects upon mixing are understood. This study makes an important step towards developing detailed knowledge of the influences butanol may exert on a hydrocarbon based fuel. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is employed to analyze the molecular interactions in the fuel blends. In a first step, binary mixtures of butanol and n-decane, which is utilized as a single-component fuel surrogate, are studied. In the second step, blends of butanol with commercial B5 diesel fuel are analyzed. The presence of n-decane weakens the hydrogen bonding interactions between the butanol molecules. When butanol is added to diesel, strong interactions with the biodiesel components containing ester groups are found. Moreover, the potential of using IR spectroscopy for the quantitative analysis of the blends is evaluated. It is shown that the spectra allow a very accurate measurement of the butanol content. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study have been considered the effects of the three type of biodiesel (brassica, cardoon and coffee) on the performance, tailpipe emissions and combustion characteristics of a single cylinder direct injection compression ignition engine operated in four different speeds (1200, 1700, 2200, 2700 rpm) and three different engine loads (15, 30 and 45%). The differences in combustion and performance parameters and exhaust emissions of engine fueled by these fuels have been compared. The free fatty acid profile of the biodiesels has been considered. The properties of the biodiesels according to the ASTM D6751 have been analyzed. Highest degree of unsaturation is achieved for biodiesel produced from brassica (94.64%) compared to biofuels derived from cardoon and coffee, 79.81% and 57.65%, respectively. The high value of the erucic acid (C22:1) in the brassica biodiesel (48.7 wt%) is the reason of higher unsaturation degree than the other biodiesels. The components of the free fatty acid profile of the considered biodiesels mostly include long chain free fatty acids (C18 and higher). The physical properties of the biodiesel fuel is influenced by the fatty acid profile. The CN of the brassica, cardoon and coffee is 56.44, 56.11 and 57.44, respectively. The surface tension of the brassica, cardoon and coffee biodiesel fuel is 42.05, 40.99 and 37.62 mN/m. The oxygen content of the brassica, cardoon and coffee is 13.44, 10.91 and 7.77%, accordingly. Dynamic viscosity of the brassica, cardoon and coffee was 6, 5.7 and 9.5 cSt, respectively. The ignition delay of the brassica, cardoon and coffee biodiesel diesel fuel blends at 15% engine load is 9.52, 11.05, 5.07% and at 30% engine load is 12.88, 13.85, 15.78% lower than diesel fuel on average, respectively. The additional oxygen have decreased the CO and THC emissions. The highest reduction of the THC emission than standard diesel fuel was 41.19%. The maximum BTE (brake thermal efficiency) obtained for different biodiesel diesel blends fuels was lower than that of standard diesel fuel. The CA50 of the biodiesel diesel fuels was lower than diesel fuel due to their lower ignition delay. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Achieving high biomass and lipid yields simultaneously during the cultivation process is essential and currently represents one of the biggest challenges in the production of microalgal biofuel. Using waste streams for microalgal growth is essential to improving the economic viability of microalgal biofuel systems, and provides an avenue for wastewater treatment. In this study, the growth of and nutrient removals by Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris) under autotrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic conditions were optimized for centrate wastewater, generated from anaerobic digestion at wastewater treatment plants, as well as on glycerol, a byproduct from the downstream microalgal lipid transesterification process. Compared to autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions, mixotrophic conditions promoted more biomass growth (0.72 ± 0.01 g/L) and yielded higher total chlorophyll (14.2 ± 0.1 µg/ml) and carotenoid (12.9 ± 0.4 µg/ml) concentrations. Subsequently, three glycerol feeding strategies (single-dose initial feeding, multiple-dose step feeding, single-dose exponential feeding) were studied under mixotrophic conditions. Feeding glycerol at the late exponential growth stage generated the highest biomass (0.070 ± 0.001 g/L/d) and lipid (20.4 ± 3.4 mg/L/d) productivities as it engaged both autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolisms, which enhanced biomass yields. The composition of the extracted lipids varied slightly with cultivation conditions, although C16, C18 and C24 accounted for 55–82% of the total fatty acids. Moreover, under conditions exhibiting high biomass production, almost complete nitrogen and phosphorus removals (&gt;99% for both total nitrogen and PO43−-P) were achieved, primarily through biomass assimilation. Finally, an integrated two-phase autotrophic-mixotrophic cultivation process for C. vulgaris, with glycerol fed at the exponential growth stage, was demonstrated, giving an effective wastewater treatment alternative while simultaneously obtaining high lipid productivities for biofuel production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With strict environmental legislations and to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, biofuels and their blends with hydrocarbon fuels are being seen as cleaner alternatives to meet the world's energy demand. This paper explores the effect of adding ethanol and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) to gasoline on its sooting tendency as well as on the characteristics and oxidative reactivity of soot. The fuel sooting tendency is determined through its smoke point using a diffusion flame setup. Several characterization techniques such as thermogravimetric analysis, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, and Raman spectroscopy are employed to reveal the changes in the physicochemical properties of soot collected at a flame height of 25 mm. With 20% ethanol or DMF addition to gasoline, the rate of soot production, the sizes of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and primary particles in soot, and its aromatic character decreased, while its amorphous character and the concentrations of oxygenated and aliphatic functional groups on it increased. These led to the increased oxidative reactivity of soot from the blended fuels. The differences in the characteristics of soot from ethanol/gasoline and DMF/gasoline blends are reported. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A composted material derived from biogas production residues, spent mushroom substrate (SMS) and pig manure was evaluated as a partial or total replacement for peat in growth medium for tomato and pepper seedlings. Five different substrates were tested: T1, compost + perlite (5:1, v:v); T2, compost + peat + perlite (4:1:1, v:v:v); T3, compost + peat + perlite (2.5:2.5:1, v:v:v); T4, compost + peat + perlite (1:4:1, v:v:v); and CK, a commercial peat + perlite (5:1, v:v). The physical-chemical characteristics of the various media were analyzed, and the germination rate and morphological growth were also measured. Real-time Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to quantify Fusarium concentrations. The addition of compost to peat-based growth medium increased the pH, electrical conductivity, air porosity, bulk density, and nutrition (NPK), and decreased the water holding capacity and total porosity. The use of compost did not affect the percent germination at day 15 of the tomato and pepper seedlings. The addition of compost resulted in better or comparable seedling quality compared with CK and fertilized CK. The best growth parameters were seen in tomato and pepper seedlings grown in T1 and T2, with higher morphological growth in comparison with CK and fertilized CK. However, T2 showed the highest Fusarium concentration compared to compost and all growth media. Fusarium concentrations in T1, T3, and T4 did not differ significantly from those in CK for tomato seedlings, and those in T1 and T4 were also similar to those in CK for pepper seedlings. The results suggest that biogas residues and SMS compost is a good alternative to peat, allowing 100% replacement, and that 20–50% replacement produces tomato and pepper seedlings with higher morphological growth and lower Fusarium concentrations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The separate collection of Used Cooking Oil (UCO) is gaining popularity through several countries in Europe. An appropriate management of UCO waste stream leads to substantial benefits. In this study, we analyse two different possibilities of UCO energy reuse: the direct feed to a reciprocating internal combustion engine (ICE) for cogeneration purpose, and the processing to generate biodiesel. Concerning biodiesel production, we analyse four among conventional and innovative technologies, characterised by different type and amount of used chemicals, heat and electricity consumptions and yields. We perform a systematic evaluation of environmental benefits and drawbacks by applying life cycle assessment (LCA) analysis to compare the alternatives. For the impact assessment, two methods are selected: the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Cumulative Exergy Consumption (CExC). Results related only to the processing phases (i.e. not including yet the avoided effects) show that the recovery of UCO in cogeneration plant has in general lower values in terms of environmental impacts than its employment in biodiesel production. When products and co-products substitution are included, the savings obtained by the substitution of conventional diesel production, in the biodiesel cases, are significantly higher than the avoided effects for electricity and heat in the cogeneration case. In particular, by using the UCO in the biodiesel production processes, the savings vary from 41.6 to 54.6 GJex per tUCO, and from 2270 to 2860 kg CO2eq per tUCO for CExC and GWP, respectively. A particular focus is put on sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Overall, high uncertainty of final results for process impacts is observed, especially for the supercritical methanol process. Low uncertainty values are evaluated for the avoided effects. Including the uncertain character of the impacts, cogeneration scenario and NaOH catalysed process of biodiesel production result to be the most suitable solutions from the process impacts and avoided effects perspective. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Disposal of sewage sludge is one of the most important issues in wastewater treatment throughout Europe, as EU sludge production, estimated at 9.5 million tons dry weight in 2005, is expected to approach 13 million tons in 2020. While sludge disposal costs may constitute 30–50% of the total operation costs of wastewater treatment processes, waste sewage sludge still contains resources that may be put to use, like nutrients and energy, that can be recovered through a variety of approaches. Research has shown that waste sewage sludge can be a valuable and very productive feedstock for biodiesel generation, containing lipids (the fats from which biofuels are extracted) in amounts that would require large areas cultivated with typical biodiesel feedstock, to produce, and at a much lower final cost. Several methods have been tested for the production of biodiesel from sewage sludge. To date, among the most efficient such process is pyrolysis, and in particular Microwave-Assisted Pyrolysis (MAP), under which process conditions are more favorable in energetic and economic terms. Sludge characteristics are very variable, depending on the characteristics of the wastewater-generating service area and on the wastewater treatment process itself. Each sludge can be considered a unique case, and as such experimental determination of the optimal biodiesel yields must be conducted on a case-by-case basis. In addition to biodiesel, other pyrolysis products can add to the energetic yield of the process (and not only). This paper discusses how feedstock properties and process characteristics may influence biodiesel (and other products) yield from pyrolytic (and in particular, MAP) processes, and discusses future possible technological developments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Cottonseed is one of the most important raw materials for plant protein, oil and alternative biofuel for diesel engines. Understanding the complex genetic basis of cottonseed traits is requisite for achieving efficient genetic improvement of the traits. However, it is not yet clear about their genetic architecture in genomic level. GWAS has been an effective way to explore genetic basis of quantitative traits in human and many crops. This study aims to dissect genetic mechanism seven cottonseed traits by a GWAS for genetic improvement. Results: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) based on a full gene model with gene effects as fixed and gene-environment interaction as random, was conducted for protein, oil and 5 fatty acids using 316 accessions and ~390K SNPs. Totally, 124 significant quantitative trait SNPs (QTSs), consisting of 16, 21, 87 for protein, oil and fatty acids (palmitic, linoleic, oleic, myristic, stearic), respectively, were identified and the broad-sense heritability was estimated from 71.62 to 93.43%; no QTS-environment interaction was detected for the protein, the palmitic and the oleic contents; the protein content was predominantly controlled by epistatic effects accounting for 65.18% of the total variation, but the oil content and the fatty acids except the palmitic were mainly determined by gene main effects and no epistasis was detected for the myristic and the stearic. Prediction of superior pure line and hybrid revealed the potential of the QTSs in the improvement of cottonseed traits, and the hybrid could achieve higher or lower genetic values compared with pure lines. Conclusions: This study revealed complex genetic architecture of seven cottonseed traits at whole genome-wide by mixed linear model approach; the identified genetic variants and estimated genetic component effects of gene, gene-gene and gene-environment interaction provide cotton geneticist or breeders new knowledge on the genetic mechanism of the traits and the potential molecular breeding design strategy. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Transport is one of the sectors of the energy consumption where the presence of renewable energies is lower and its increase is hard to achieve especially in countries that import all the fuels that they consume. This paper addresses the progress that Portugal is making toward a more sustainable transport sector. A near- and medium- term scenario analysis is performed, based on the energy consumption in the past and on a detailed evaluation of the trends for renewable energy in the transport sector. The near-term scenarios aim at portraying the conditions that allow the country to fulfill the target of 10% renewable share in transportation established by the European Union. The medium-term scenarios highlight the implications, in terms of emission reduction and of energy independence, deriving from the use of electric vehicles and natural gas, synthetic and fossil, as alternatives to liquid fuels. The results show that electric vehicles would substantially reduce the total energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions, while the promotion of routes for synthetic natural gas would contribute to taking advantage of local resources. The paper also provides some insights about the design of future policies to build a more sustainable transport sector. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: The economic viability of hydrodeoxygenation process using Camelina, Carinata and Jatropha feedstocks for aviation biofuel production was evaluated for two product profiles: (i) maximum diesel production and (ii) maximum jet fuel production (HRJ). Results: Deterministic analysis of Camelina and Carinata diesel facilities returned positive NPVs and IRRs of 25 and 18%, respectively. Stochastic analysis suggested that the probabilities of positive NPVs were 75, 59 and 15%, respectively, for Camelina, Carinata and Jatropha diesel plants. Jet fuel facilities presented probabilities of loss of 98, 99 and 100% for Camelina, Carinata and Jatropha scenarios, respectively. Sensitivity analysis determined that financial performance was majorly influenced by feedstock and fuel prices. Categories of subsidies to enhance the attractiveness of the projects were studied. Conclusions: Camelina, Carinata and Jatropha plants targeting HRJ required incentives of 0.31, 0.39 and 0.61 US/L of biofuel produced, respectively, to reduce the probabilities of loss to approximately 30%. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper introduces a method to analyse and explore consistency within policy mixes in order to support the policymaking cycle and applies it to energy and climate change policies in the United Kingdom (UK) biofuels policy context. The first part of the paper introduces a multi-level method to evaluate consistency within policy mixes implemented over a period of time. The first level explores consistency across policy design features in policy mixes. The second level evaluates how stakeholders, and their interactions with policy instruments and each other, can impact consistency within a given context. These interactions influence the implementation of policies and can lead to unintended outcomes that fail to meet the overarching goals. In the second part of the paper, we apply our method to the UK biofuels policy mix, to explore a sector that cuts across the policy areas of transportation, energy, land-use, air, and climate change. Our analysis demonstrates how, by overlooking complex interactions in the design and implementation of policies in the biofuels sector, policy mixes have conflicted with the development of a potential low-carbon technology. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The spectral composition of light can affect the growth and biochemical composition of photosynthetic microalgae. This study examined the use of light filtering through a solution of soluble colored additives, a cost-effective method to alter the light spectrum, on the growth and lipid production of an oleaginous microalga, Nannochloropsis gaditana (N. gaditana). Cells were photoautotrophically cultivated under a white light emitting diode (LED) alone (control) or under a white LED that passed through a solution of red and yellow color additive (4:1 ratio) that blocked light below 600 nm. The specific growth rate was significantly greater under filtered light than white light (0.2672 d-1 vs. 0.1930 d-1). Growth under filtered light also increased the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield by 22.4% and FAME productivity by 80.0%, relative to the white light control. In addition, the content of saturated fatty acids was greater under filtered light, so the biodiesel products had better stability. These results show that passing white light through an inexpensive color filter can simultaneously enhance cellular growth and lipid productivity of N. gaditana. This approach of optimizing the light spectrum may be applicable to other species of microalgae. © 2018 Korean Society of Environmental Engineers.

AB  - The present research work deals with the bio-waste valorisation approach for the catalyst development and then its use in the low cost biodiesel production. The sulfonated carbon catalyst, a solid acid is prepared from waste orange peels (WOP) through carbonization followed by sulfonation treatment. WOP is one of the bio-wastes of food industries. The developed catalyst was characterized using elemental, spectral and thermal analysis. Surface area and pore volume is measured using Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area analysis. The synthesized catalyst exhibits 44 m2/g surface area and 1.57 mmol/g acid density. To demonstrate the catalytic performance, the sulfonated carbon catalyst was used to esterify corn acid oil (CAO), a low cost feed stock containing 127.21 mg KOH/g acid value, to generate cost effective biodiesel. 91.68% biodiesel conversion is obtained under optimized conditions using Box-Behnken Design (BBD). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable fuel consisting of alkyl esters, which show a higher corrosive behavior when compared with a diesel fuel. The corrosive processes by biodiesel affects the processing infrastructure of this biofuel and mechanical parts of automotives. Valves, engine blocks, and cylinder liners are gray cast iron components affected by biodiesel corrosion. The corrosion resistance of niobium carbide (NbC) coatings deposited using thermoreactive diffusion (TRD) on gray cast iron in continuous contact with diesel fuel and palm biodiesel was studied. Both coated and uncoated samples were subjected to immersion tests, cyclic oxidation at 473 K, and an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test. The coatings were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Both the rate of corrosion by immersion and the resistance to polarization via EIS showed the favorable behavior of niobium carbide coatings against the corrosion of palm biodiesel. The corrosion rate on samples coated with niobium carbide was three times lower than that of the gray casting samples. These results allow the conclusion that niobium carbide coatings could be a viable alternative to lessening the corrosive effects of palm biodiesel in the applications where gray cast iron is used in continuous contact with biofuel. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative fuel obtained from different biomass sources and processes. Nowadays, this biofuel has gained importance due to environmental concerns and rising energy demand. In the biodiesel production chain, stability is a critical issue, as it is linked to the maintenance of its original properties. This work performed a study evaluating the influence of storage conditions on the quality aspects of biodiesel. Thus, different samples of biodiesel obtained from soybean and frying oils were produced and placed in containers made by plastic, glass and tin, and stored in presence or absence of an oxidative atmosphere, moisture and light. These samples were analyzed to evaluate the ester content, acidity, iodine value, kinematic viscosity and oxidative stability. The characterization with GC-MS and GC/FID were done aiming to determine the chemical composition. Blends with frying biodiesel into soybean biodiesel have also been produced in concentrations ranging from 1%, 5% and 10% (m/m) in order to evaluate the mixing effect. In the initial storage time, all tested parameters were in accordance to the legislation. Distinct behaviors were identified for each sample according to the container type, being the glass the most effective of them in maintenance of biodiesel characteristics. © 2018 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

AB  - Particulate Matter (PM) emissions from gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines, particularly Particle Number (PN) emissions, have been studied intensively in both academia and industry because of the adverse effects of ultrafine PM emissions on human health and other environmental concerns. GDI engines are known to emit a higher number of PN emissions (on an engine-out basis) than Port Fuel Injection (PFI) engines, due to the reduced mixture homogeneity in GDI engines. Euro 6 emission standards have been introduced in Europe (and similarly in China) to limit PN emissions from GDI engines. This article summarises the current state of research in GDI PN emissions (engine-out) including a discussion of PN formation, and the characteristics of PN emissions from GDI engines. The effect of key GDI engine operating parameters is analysed, including air-fuel ratio, ignition and injection timing, injection pressure, and EGR; in addition the effect of fuel composition on particulate emissions is explored, including the effect of oxygenate components such as ethanol. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The usage of biodiesel, a renewable and biodegradable fuel, is becoming increasingly popular. The objective of the study was to evaluate the operational performance-tractor forward speed, drawbar power, and fuel consumption-and smoke density of an agricultural tractor using biodiesel, diesel, and biodiesel/diesel mixtures as fuel in a tilled field. Soybean biodiesel, murumuru biodiesel, and three combinations of soybean biodiesel and murumuru were used: 90S10M (90% soybean and 10% murumuru), 80S20M (80% soybean and 20% murumuru), and 70S30M (70% soybean and 30% murumuru). The biodiesel/diesel ratios were: B0, B5, B15, B25, B50, and B100; the letter B indicates the presence of biodiesel and the number is the percentage of biodiesel in the diesel. The results showed an increase in specific fuel consumption (SFC) of 10.13%, 16.66%, 12.69%, 14.59%, and 17.42% for murumuru, soybean, 90S10M, 80S20M, and 70S30M, respectively, when comparing B100 to B0. SFC was influenced by the type of biodiesel, B100 of soybean, 90S10M, 80S20M, and 70S30M consumptions were, respectively, 7.8%, 2.9%, 5.2%, and 8.8% higher than those of murumuru. The hourly volumetric consumption (HVC) of 90S10M was 4.8% higher than soybean and murumuru. The tractor's forward speed and drawbar power did not have any significant difference. Smoke density was reduced by 51.6%, 23.04%, 30.41%, 37.8%, and 36.9% for Murumuru, Soybean, 90S10M, 80S20M, and 70S30M, respectively, when comparing B100 to B0. For Murumuru, the smoke density was 59.0%, 43.8%, 28.6%, and 30.5% lower for this variety of biodiesel when compared to soybean at 90S10M, 80S20M and 70S30M, respectively. The results demonstrate the potential usage of biodiesel as a substitution for diesel. © 2018, Southern Cross Publishing.

AB  - Microalgae biodiesel production depends on several factors to minimize the costs of the production process from both biomass and biodiesel. In some outdoor systems, the temperature can be higher than 35 °C, which is lethal for several algae. Prospecting microalga from thermal environments seems to be a good option. Therefore, the objective of this work was to isolate a microalga (Acutodesmus obliquus (Turpin) Hegewald and Hanagata) from thermal water and evaluate its cultivation productivity in Bold Basal Medium (BBM) and in lower cost alternative media. One alternative medium contained only the main growth ingredients (DAF), the other included these same ingredients with the addition of wastewater from the purification of grease-based raw materials (DAF + OGR). Microalga biodiesel productivity was also compared with the biodiesel yield of soybean, which is one of the main raw materials currently used for biodiesel production. The microalga was shown to provide biomass with similar productivity using the three different culture media in log phase. The microalga exhibited biodiesel productivity from 46 to 61 times higher than soybean; using 5.5–7.2% of the water and 1.6–2.2% of the land required for soybean cultivation to produce the same amount of biodiesel. The DAF + OGR medium, which costs 29% of the cost of the BBM medium, proved to be an efficient alternative medium compared to other in biomass productivity. Levels of tri-unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids from A. obliquus microalga were slightly higher than those standardized by EN14214, requiring that the biodiesel be mixed with antioxidants. © 2018, Botanical Society of Sao Paulo.

AB  - Currently one of the energetic challenges is to look for environmentally friendly alternatives that would fulfill in advance the future shortage of oil in the world. Especially, biofuels have turned into one of the most favorable proposals to overcome current demands of the oil. Biofuels are produced from living organisms or from metabolic by-products (organic or food waste products). In this paper a particular application of nanophotonics in the frame of the interaction between light and matter through Surface-Enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is addressed. As a test prove a Biodiésel sample is considered, the reason relies on the necessity to establish analysis procedures either to be performed during the production or as a quantifying tool to probe integrity during the blending process with diesel. © 2018, Universidad de Tarapaca.

AB  - Background: The ideal biofuel should not only be a regenerative fuel from renewable feedstocks, but should also be compatible with the existing fuel distribution infrastructure and with normal car engines. As the so-called drop-in biofuel, the fatty alcohol 1-octanol has been described as a valuable substitute for diesel and jet fuels and has already been produced fermentatively from sugars in small amounts with engineered bacteria via reduction of thioesterase-mediated premature release of octanoic acid from fatty acid synthase or via a reversal of the β-oxidation pathway. Results: The previously engineered short-chain acyl-CoA producing yeast Fas1R1834K/Fas2 fatty acid synthase variant was expressed together with carboxylic acid reductase from Mycobacterium marinum and phosphopantetheinyl transferase Sfp from Bacillus subtilis in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae Δfas1 Δfas2 Δfaa2 mutant strain. With the involvement of endogenous thioesterases, alcohol dehydrogenases, and aldehyde reductases, the synthesized octanoyl-CoA was converted to 1-octanol up to a titer of 26.0 mg L-1 in a 72-h fermentation. The additional accumulation of 90 mg L-1 octanoic acid in the medium indicated a bottleneck in 1-octanol production. When octanoic acid was supplied externally to the yeast cells, it could be efficiently converted to 1-octanol indicating that re-uptake of octanoic acid across the plasma membrane is not limiting. Additional overexpression of aldehyde reductase Ahr from Escherichia coli nearly completely prevented accumulation of octanoic acid and increased 1-octanol titers up to 49.5 mg L-1. However, in growth tests concentrations even lower than 50.0 mg L-1 turned out to be inhibitory to yeast growth. In situ extraction in a two-phase fermentation with dodecane as second phase did not improve growth, indicating that 1-octanol acts inhibitive before secretion. Furthermore, 1-octanol production was even reduced, which results from extraction of the intermediate octanoic acid to the organic phase, preventing its re-uptake. Conclusions: By providing chain length control via an engineered octanoyl-CoA producing fatty acid synthase, we were able to specifically produce 1-octanol with S. cerevisiae. Before metabolic engineering can be used to further increase product titers and yields, strategies must be developed that cope with the toxic effects of 1-octanol on the yeast cells. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Petroleum-based fuels are continuously depleting and will vanish in the coming years. Among the biomass sources, vegetable oils and animal fats have attracted much attention as a potential renewable resource for production of an alternative for petroleum-based diesel fuel. In the present work, preheated thumba oil is used to prepare three different concentration blends with diesel, B20, B40, and B60 to run a single cylinder CI engine. The results of the engine parameters when blends are used as a fuel are compared to the results with pure diesel. The brake thermal efficiency of B20 blend was found to be higher than diesel and other blends. Brake-specific fuel consumption and brake-specific energy consumption of B20 were less than other blends but slightly more than diesel. By combining the effect of all the parameters, B20 blend was found to be a suitable alternative for diesel fuel. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.) is a species of flowering plant with great potential for biofuel production and as an emerging model organism for functional genomic analysis, particularly in the Euphorbiaceae family. DNA binding with one finger (Dof) transcription factors play critical roles in numerous biological processes in plants. Nevertheless, the knowledge about members, and the evolutionary and functional characteristics of the Dof gene family in physic nut is insufficient. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide screening and characterization of the Dof gene family within the physic nut draft genome. In total, 24 JcDof genes (encoding 33 JcDof proteins) were identified. All the JcDof genes were divided into three major groups based on phylogenetic inference, which was further validated by the subsequent gene structure and motif analysis. Genome comparison revealed that segmental duplication may have played crucial roles in the expansion of the JcDof gene family, and gene expansion was mainly subjected to positive selection. The expression profile demonstrated the broad involvement of JcDof genes in response to various abiotic stresses, hormonal treatments and functional divergence. This study provides valuable information for better understanding the evolution of JcDof genes, and lays a foundation for future functional exploration of JcDof genes. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to study biodiesel production from waste cooking oil using a transesterification method. Optimization was achieved by changing process variables, including the oil:alcohol molar ratio and reaction temperature, to maximize biodiesel yield. Optimum variables were identified using Central Composite Face-Centered Design (CCFD) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Furthermore, the synergistic and antagonistic effects among process parameters were analyzed. The optimum temperature for the production of biodiesel was identified at 62.8 °C, and the optimum oil:alcohol ratio was 4.3; the combination of these parameters resulted in the highest theoretical efficiency of 96.08% and desirability of 0.608. After evaluating the experimentally produced biodiesel, the study revealed that waste cooking oil can be used as a potential raw material for the production of biofuel. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Increasing energy demand, limited fossil fuel resources and climate change have prompted development of alternative sustainable and economical fuel resources such as crop-based bio-ethanol and biodiesel. However, there is concern over use of arable land that is used for food agriculture for creation of biofuel. Thus, there is a renewed interest in the use of microbes particularly microalgae for bio-fuel production. Microbes such as micro-algae and cyanobacteria that are used for biofuel production also produce other bioactive compounds under stressed conditions. Microbial agents used for biofuel production also produce bioactive compounds with antimicrobial, antiviral, anticoagulant, antioxidant, antifungal, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activity. Because of importance of such high-value compounds in aquaculture and bioremediation, and the potential to reduce carbon emissions and energy security, the biofuels produced by microbial biotechnology might substitute the crop-based bioethanol and bio-diesel production. © 2018 Frontiers in Bioscience.

AB  - Jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) is an oil yielding desert shrub popularly known as desert gold. Jojoba based industries, mainly works in two sectors: lubricant and cosmetics. The high cost of jojoba products could be lowered down by selecting the best raw material. So, we made our hypothesis to select the best raw material separately for cosmetics and lubricant industries. The purpose of the study was the comprehensive comparative phytochemical characterization of fifteen different accessions of jojoba oil using Spectrophotometer, Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) and Gas Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS). GC and MS identified 10 fatty acids (myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, oleic, linoleic, arachidic, 11-eicosenoic, heneicosanoic, tricosanoic and nervonic acids). Differences were found in most of the parameters and correlation analysis was done to compare all biochemical traits with respect to oil yield. Accessions Q-104 was found to be the best for cosmetics, as it shows a high concentration of fatty acids (linoleic, oleic, arachidic, 11-eicosenoic and palmitic acids) together with good oil yield. Accessions Clone-64 was found to be the best for the lubricant purpose as it showed the good oil yield, lower elements, and phosphorus content. We concluded that accession Q-104 and Clone-64 could be used commercially for cosmetic and lubricant industry, respectively. Further, these accessions could be used for the genetic breeding program. © 2018

AB  - Dwindling fossil fuel resources and deteriorating ambient air quality has mandate the search for suitable alternative fuels for diesel engine. Dual fuel engines show remarkable engine performance characteristics at higher engine loads but suffer from high NOx-smoke opacity emissions trade-off. In the present study, an attempt has been made to introduce exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) under compressed natural gas (CNG) fuelled diesel engine using Jatropha biodiesel (B20) blend as pilot fuel. Experimental investigations were carried out in a single cylinder direct injection compression ignition engine, which was suitably modified to operate under dual fuel mode along with EGR. Comparative analysis was made on the basis of combustion, performance and emissions characteristics at different engine operating loads for fossil diesel, CNG and biodiesel blend (B20) with and without EGR. It was evident from the experimental investigations that dual fuel mode with EGR improved the NOx-smoke emission trade-off at higher engine loads without deteriorating engine combustion and performance characteristics. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 1-Butanol is a well-known biofuel for blending with both gasoline and diesel. It is also reported to act as fuel additive and convert straight vegetable oil (SVO) into a diesel blend. The direct use of SVO and 1-butanol in diesel blends has important implications for the elimination of transesterification of triglycerides. The mechanism of SVO stabilization in diesel in the presence of 1-butanol remains unknown. The present work describes the physicochemical properties and mechanism of stability of biofuel blends with 1-butanol as a fuel additive. The presence of 1-butanol as an additive results in a clear homogeneous fuel composition. The mechanisms of triglyceride stability in fuel blends with 1-butanol were studied with fluorescence techniques using the charge transfer probes Nile Red and PRODAN. We found that the micro-environment of biodiesel blends with 1-butanol results in the stabilization of triglycerides by formation of reverse micelles. The charge transfer probes displayed fluorescence emission peaks representative of the region in which they are present. We observed that the four regions present in AOT reverse micelles are also present in this 1-butanol/SVO/diesel ternary mixture. The physicochemical analysis including friccohesity has suggested that the formed reverse micelle is stable. This study is the first attempt to understand the mechanism behind stabilization of SVO as diesel blend in presence of 1-butanol. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuels are an alternative to fossil fuels and can be made from many different raw materials. The use of distinct catalyst and production processes, feedstocks, and types of alcohol results in biofuels with different physical and chemical properties. Even though these diverse options for biodiesel production are considered advantageous, they may pose a setback when quality specifications are considered, since different properties are subject to different reactions during usage, storage and handling. In this work, we present a systematic characterization of biodiesels to investigate how accelerated thermal degradation affects fuel properties. Two different types of biodiesel, commercially obtained from distinct feedstocks, were tested. The thermal degradation process was performed by maintaining the temperature of the sample at 140∘C under constant air flux for different times: 0 h, 3 h, 6 h, 9 h, 12 h, 24 h and 36 h. Properties such as density, viscosity, activation energy, volumetric thermal expansion coefficient, gross caloric value, acid value, infrared absorption, and temperature coefficient of the refractive index were used to study the thermal degradation of the biodiesel samples. The results show a significant difference in fuel properties before and after the thermal degradation process suggesting the formation of undesirable compounds. All the properties mentioned above were found to be useful to determine whether a biodiesel sample underwent thermal degradation. Moreover, viscosity and acid value were found to be the most sensitive characteristics to detect the thermal degradation process. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study was based on the determination of metals in particulate matter emitted by a typical diesel engine used by busses and trucks in Brazil. Emissions were sampled using a cascade impactor, and the engine was operated using diesel with 5% (B5), 10% (B10), 15% (B15), and 20% (B20) of biodiesel. The particulate matter was stratified in different sizes, i.e., 18, 5.6, 3.2, 1.8, 1.0, 0.560, 0.320, 0.180, 0.100, and 0.056 μm. Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn with concentrations within 10 to 1000 ng m−3 were determined. The results indicate a trend in the prevalence of lead, nickel, and chromium in coarse particles and nanoparticles in all blends of fuels. By comparing the results of B5, B10, B15, and B20 fuels, we can confirm that the addition of biodiesel to diesel promotes a reduction of emissions, and by comparing the behavior of the concentration of all elements analyzed, emissions by B10 and B15 fuels are similar, while B5 and B20 suffer significant changes during the process of combustion. Multivariate statistical analysis was used, and it indicates possible sources in three clusters, one for Ni, other for Cr-Mn, and the last one for other metals. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A mixed cyanobacterial-mixotrophic algal population, dominated by the filamentous cyanobacterium Leptolyngbya sp. and the microalga Ochromonas (which contributed to the total photosynthetic population with rates of less than 5%), was studied under non-aseptic conditions for its efficiency to remove organic and inorganic compounds from different types of wastes/wastewaters while simultaneously producing lipids. Second cheese whey, poplar sawdust, and grass hydrolysates were used in lab-scale experiments, in photobioreactors that operated under aerobic conditions with different initial nutrient (C, N and P) concentrations. Nutrient removal rates, biomass productivity, and the maximum oil production rates were determined. The highest lipid production was achieved using the biologically treated dairy effluent (up to 14.8% oil in dry biomass corresponding to 124 mg L−1) which also led to high nutrient removal rates (up to 94%). Lipids synthesized by the microbial consortium contained high percentages of saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids (up to 75% in total lipids) for all the substrates tested, which implies that the produced biomass may be harnessed as a source of biodiesel. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Two-stroke petrol engines find wide applications in the areas like chain saws, weed cutters, and power sprayers because of their compactness and higher power to weight ratio. In the present study, the feasibility of using vegetable-based lubricant instead of ordinary mineral 2 T oil is investigated. M15 (85% petrol + 15% methanol) and E15 (85% petrol + 15% ethanol) blend with gasoline are used as the fuel. Experiments were carried out in a two-stroke air-cooled engine equipped with a rope brake dynamometer. It is observed that the vegetable-based lubricant (sunflower oil) is miscible with the tested fuels. The frictional power for the vegetable-based lubricant was found to be less than that of mineral 2 T oil. The brake thermal efficiency improved and the brake-specific fuel consumption decreased for the sunflower oil-based lubricant. The combination of E15 + sunflower oil lubricant exhibited the greatest benefits, raising the brake thermal efficiency by 3.4% and reducing the brake-specific fuel consumption by 1.4%. Hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions were lower for the vegetable-based lubricant than the 2 T mineral oil. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Nowadays, a major preoccupation is the production and usage of fuels obtained from renewable and eco-friendly sources. Camelina sativa is well-suited to be a sustainable bio-fuel crop, as its seeds naturally have high oil content. However, the process of obtaining bio-kerosene from camelina oil by hydrotreatment is time consuming and expensive at this moment. Thus, the possibility of using straight camelina oil as fuel in terrestrial applications has been taken into consideration. For this purpose, combustion tests have been conducted on a burner. Tests at different burner functioning regimes have been carried out by varying both the pressure of the air used for fuel atomization, and the air flow delivered by the burner's fan. The influence of the variation of the fuel preheating temperature is also studied and presented. During the tests, the composition of the exhaust gas and temperature have been monitored and registered using two gas analysers. The results have been compared with those obtained when the burner was fuelled with pure kerosene. © 2017 International Energy Initiative

AB  - The highly unbalanced nature of bio-oil composition poses a serious threat in terms of storage and utilization of bio-oil as a viable fuel in engines. So it becomes inevitable to study the variations in physicochemical properties of the bio-oil during storage to value its chemical instability, for designing stabilization methodologies. The present study aims to investigate the effects of storage stability of bio-oil extracted from pyrolyzing Calophyllum inophyllum (CI) deoiled seed cake on the engine operating characteristics. The bio-oil is produced in a fixed bed reactor at 500 °C under the constant heating rate of 30 °C/min. All the stability analysis methods involve an accelerated aging procedure based on standards established by ASTM (D5304 and E2009) and European standard (EN 14112). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was employed to analytically characterize the unaged and aged bio-oil samples. The results clearly depict that stabilizing Calophyllum inophyllum bio-oil with 10% (w/w) methanol improved its stability than that of the unstabilized sample thereby reducing the aging rate of bio-oil to 0.04 and 0.13 cst/h for thermal and oxidative aging respectively. Engine testing of the bio-oil sample revealed that aged bio-oil samples deteriorated engine performance and increased emission levels at the exhaust. The oxidatively aged sample showed the lowest BTE (24.41%), the highest BSEC (20.14 MJ/kWh), CO (1.51%), HC (132 ppm), NOx (1098 ppm) and smoke opacity (34.8%). © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This manuscript presents the impact of addition of antioxidant additives to rice bran biodiesel blend on the performance and emission characteristics of compression ignition (C.I) engine. Rice bran methyl ester (RBME) was produced from rice bran oil by transesterification using sodium hydroxide as catalyst. An experimental investigation was conducted on a single-cylinder four-stroke C.I engine to analyze the performance and emission characteristics of rice bran methyl ester (RBME) blended with diesel at 20% by volume (B20) with and without addition of 1000 ppm of two monophenolic antioxidant additives, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). The results showed that the BHA- and BHT-treated B20 blend decreased the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) by 2.1 and 1.2% and increased the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) by 1.04 and 0.5% compared to B20. The BHA- and BHT-treated B20 blend produced mean reductions in NOx emission of 12.2 and 9.6%, respectively, compared to B20. The carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions of BHA- and BHT-treated B20 were increased by 14.8–16.6% and 10.6–11.2%, respectively, compared to B20. However the emission levels were lower than those of diesel. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Replacing fossil fuels with renewable fuels derived from lignocellulosic biomass can contribute to the mitigation of global warming and the economic development of rural communities. This will require lignocellulosic biofuels to become price competitive with fossil fuels. Techno-economic analyses can provide insights into which parts of the biofuel production process need to be optimized to reduce cost or energy use. We used data obtained from a pilot biorefinery to model a commercial-scale biorefinery that processes lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol, with a focus on the minimum ethanol selling price (MESP). The process utilizes a phosphoric acid-catalyzed pre-treatment of sweet sorghum bagasse followed by liquefaction and simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (L+SScF) of hexose and pentose sugars by an engineered Escherichia coli strain. After validating a techno-economic model developed with the SuperPro Designer software for the conversion of sugarcane bagasse to ethanol by comparing it to a published Aspen Plus model, six different scenarios were modeled for sweet sorghum bagasse Under the most optimistic scenario, the ethanol can be produced at a cost close to the energy-equivalent price of gasoline. Aside from an increase in the price of gasoline, the gap between ethanol and gasoline prices could also be bridged by either a decrease in the cost of cellulolytic enzymes or development of value-added products from lignin. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Large-scale copper (Cu) mining activities in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula produced millions of metric tons of mining wastes also known as stamp sands. The stamp sands containing high concentrations of Cu were disposed of into several lakes connected to the Lake Superior. Eventually, as aquatic organisms in these lakes started to exhibit toxicity symptoms, the stamp sands were dredged and discarded on the lake shores. Consequently, these areas turned into degraded, marginal lands and were collectively classified as a Torch Lake Superfund site by the US EPA. Due to the lack of vegetative cover, the Cu-rich stamp sands eroded into the lakes, affecting the aquatic life. To alleviate this issue, a sustainable restoration plan (SRP) was developed and tested in a greenhouse environment prior to field implementation. Cold-tolerant oilseed crops, camelina (Camelina sativa) and field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense), were grown on compost-fertilized stamp sands, which reduced soil erosion by acting as a vegetative cap. Oilseed plants produced normal yield, demonstrating their potential utilization as biofuel feedstock. Prior to implementing the SRP in field-scale in the Torch Lake Superfund site, a public opinion survey of the local community was conducted to understand the views of residents. Door-to-door survey was performed in July–August 2015, which yielded a response rate of 68.1%. Results showed that residents were generally concerned with stamp sand erosion into the Torch Lake and were overwhelmingly supportive of the SRP, which would not only provide environmental benefits but could boost the local economy via biofuel production. To gauge the general environmental awareness of the respondents, the survey included questions on climate change. Most of the respondents acknowledged that climate change is real and anthropogenically mediated. Having college education and a relatively high annual household income showed a positive and significant correlation with climate change awareness. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Jet and diesel fuels are typically composed of C9-C14 and C12-C20 hydrocarbons, respectively, but the carbon-chain length of sugar-derived aldehydes and furanic compounds is no longer than C6. Here, a cascade catalytic process involving alkylation and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of 2-methylfuran (2-MF) with different aldehydes is conducted to directly produce long-chain alkanes with exclusive carbon number of C11-C17 in overall yields of 50–84 %. Preliminary investigations on the alkylation of 2-MF and formalin show that the relative density of Lewis and Brønsted acidic sites of zeolitic materials remarkably affect their catalytic activity and selectivity. Sn-beta(12.5) with pronounced Lewis acidity (including the acid density and strength) exhibits higher catalytic performance in the alkylation than other zeolites, producing long-chain oxygenates in 58–92 % yields. Even in aqueous solution, the Sn-beta(12.5) catalyst can be reused for at least six reaction cycles with almost constant reactivity. More importantly, the co-addition of Hf(OTf)4 with Pd/C greatly promotes C−O bond cleavage of the furan-ring during the HDO process under mild reaction conditions, producing long-chain alkanes in high yields of 84–94 %. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The techno-economic analysis of biodiesel production with supercritical methanol (SCM) at a low methanol: oil molar ratio (L-SCM) of 12:1, as well as with a homogeneous alkali-catalyzed process (Alkali-cat) and conventional SCM (C-SCM) with a methanol: oil molar ratio of 42:1 was investigated. The process simulation was performed using the Aspen plus® software based on the plant biodiesel production capacity of 40,000 tonnes/y. Even though the L-SCM had a higher total capital investment than the Alkali-cat process ($7.19 million versus $4.91 million), it was economically viable. The L-SCM process provided a lower manufacturing cost of $37.28 million and the highest net present value (NPV) of $45.48 million. However, the C-SCM process was not financially profitable because of the large amount of methanol employed in the recycling loop. Sensitivity analysis of all the processes was investigated based on variations in the feedstock and products selling price and revealed that the biodiesel selling price and palm oil price were the major effects on the sensitivity of the NPV. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, researchers around the world have focused on biofuels such as 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) and n-pentanol because of their potential for reducing harmful emissions. Studies show that oxygenated biofuels can decrease soot emissions from the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) engine. This study compared the combustion and emission characteristics of diesel, D20, and P20 fuels on HD diesel engines without EGR. Results show that D20 and P20 fuels show no obvious advantage in emissions compared with diesel fuel. For some load conditions, D20 and P20 have relatively better fuel economy, but overall fuel economy has little difference for the three fuels. Although D20 and P20 can be used without any engine modifications, the performance and emission characteristics of P20 fuel are closer to those of diesel fuel than to D20 fuel. These results can be used in the development of alternative bio-fuels for use in the auto industry. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Microalgae cultivation using wastewater is an approach for simultaneous wastewater treatment and biofuels/chemicals productions. In this study, three microalgae species Chorella vulgaris ESP-31, Chorella sorokiniana CY-1 and Scenedesmus sp. were cultivated using coke-making wastewater generated from a steel-making company. Of these, C. vulgaris ESP-31 had the best tolerance towards wastewater, with maximal biomass concentration of 2.82 g/l and lipid productivity of 32.3 mg/l/d. The highest biomass concentration 3.98 g/l and lipid productivity of 47.1 mg/l/d was obtained in 20% wastewater. Immobilization approach was applied to boost biomass growth and lipid production. Both maximal biomass growth (5.17 g/l) and lipid productivity (68.4 mg/l/d) was significantly enhanced with activated charcoal addition. Semi-batch cultivation resulted in stable biomass production and lipid productivity of 5.18 g/l and 77.3 mg/l/d, respectively. This study has revealed that C. vulgaris ESP-31 is a potential candidate for growth in coke making wastewater and biofuel production. © 2018 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan

AB  - A series of modified hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) supported by various Ni loading (5 wt% Ni, 10 wt% Ni, 40 wt% Ni and 100 wt% Ni) have been synthesized and systematically characterized. The resultant Ni catalysts improved the performance of the deoxygenation (DO) of triolein at a reaction temperature of 380 °C in a simple glass batch reactor under a solvent-free condition and are hydrogen-free. The incorporation of Ni loading into the HMS framework casued the catalytic activity to increase when compared to that of HMS. Surprisingly, 10 wt% Ni/HMS catalyst exhibited the highest conversion. It was observed that 10 wt% Ni loading was highly dispersed on the HMS which is capable of achieving 92.5% and 95.2% of conversion and selectivity, respectively. This is due to the synergistic effect of Si-O-Ni bonding and high dispersion of NiO on HMS. In this respect, the nature of catalyst support such as pore size and the high surface areas of HMS play an important role in enhancing the catalytic performance of DO reaction. This study has revealed that Ni/HMS catalyst is a promising catalyst that can be applied to the development of sustainable biofuel from non-edible oil. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The behaviors of a biofuel and a fossil fuel were evaluated by different techniques, namely thermal analysis (Thermogravimetry-TG and Differential Thermal Analysis-DTA) and engine performance tests. From TG and DTA curves, two decomposition phases were identified for diesel fuel with ignition temperature (IT) at 250 °C and three phases for biodiesel fuel with IT at 300 °C. Combining conversion (α) versus temperature and a model-free kinetics method, the range of activation energies (Ea) values were determined for both diesel (from 48.5 kJ mol−1 up to 61.0 kJ mol−1) and biodiesel (from 58.6 kJ mol−1 up to 55.0 kJ mol−1) fuels. At the initial phase of combustion, diesel fuel presents lower Ea and IT than biodiesel fuel. At the final phase of combustion, an opposite behavior is observed. These results provide subsides to predict that the behavior of diesel-biodiesel blends is the best option due to the lowering of Ea along the entire combustion process. As regards the engine tests, the B20 blend showed improvements compared with diesel fuel. In average, B20 presented increases of 1.2% in power, 1.0% in torque and 1.2% in thermal efficiency. In terms of soot, B20 presented 8.9% lower emissions than diesel fuel. Although thermal analysis and engine performance tests are executed under very different conditions, the results from both techniques showed the same trend, i.e., the best option for the combustion performance is a diesel-biodiesel blend. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Co-form® products are typically used for personal hygiene care (cleansing wipes), household cleaning (pads and mops) and absorbent applications. Co-form® is a thermo-bonded multilayer nonwoven composite and Kimberly-Clark patented its process in 2008. Co-form® rejects are composed of 30% plastic polypropylene and 70% wood pulp fibre. It is difficult to recycle and to-date no research articles explore pyrolytic valorisation for its energy recovery. This paper investigated pyrolytic valorisation of co-form® rejects into energy vectors. Pelletised co-form® rejects obtained from a secondary fibre paper mill were processed using a laboratory scale 2 kg/h Thermo-Catalytic Reforming (TCR®) reactor. The TCR® process combines intermediate pyrolysis, using an auger reactor to heat the material under moderate temperatures (350–450 °C) and moderate solid residence times (minutes) in the complete absence of Oxygen, with post catalytic reforming in a fixed bed reactor at 700 °C. Pelletised co-form® rejects were successfully converted into 12 wt% bio-oil, 9 wt% aqueous phase liquid, 8 wt% char and 71 wt% syngas products. The bio-oil higher heating value was found to be 39.36 MJ/kg, comparable to biodiesel. Naphthalene was found to be the most abundant aromatic compound within the oil, with a relative abundance of 15.22% measured by GC–MS. Oleic acid methyl ester (15.86%) was the most abundant long chain hydrocarbon detected. The higher heating value of produced gas was 11.02 MJ Nm3 and char 30.79 MJ/kg. TCR® conversion of co-form® rejects proved to be a feasible route for the valorisation of this waste stream into sustainable energy vectors. In previous works, gasification processes could not successfully convert organic waste streams with a high plastic content, without implications attributed to agglomeration and melting of plastics. The TCR® process overcome these issues with no evidence of agglomeration or melting of plastics present within the reactor. The success was believed to be through applying moderate heating rates (°C/min) and temperatures (max 700 °C), as well as the mechanical effect of continuous mixing of material within the reactor via the internal auger screw. Overall, TCR® is a promising future route for the valorisation of co-form® rejects to produce energy vectors. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study intends to explore the effect of the addition of fuel additives with camphor oil (CMO) on the characteristics of a twin-cylinder compression ignition (CI) engine. The lower viscosity and boiling point of CMO when compared to diesel could improve the fuel atomization, evaporation, and air/fuel mixing process. However, the lower cetane index of CMO limits its use as a drop in fuel for diesel in CI engine. In general, NOX emission increases for less viscous and low cetane (LVLC) fuels due to pronounced premixed combustion phase. To improve the ignition characteristics and decrease NOX emissions, fuel additives such as diglyme (DGE)—a cetane enhancer, cumene (CU)—an antioxidant, and eugenol (EU) and acetone (A)—bio-additives, are added 10% by volume with CMO. The engine used for the experimentation is a twin-cylinder tractor engine that runs at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. The engine was operated with diesel initially to attain warm-up condition, which facilitates the operation of neat CMO. At full load condition, brake thermal efficiency (BTE) for CMO is higher (29.6%) than that of diesel (28.1%), while NOX emission is increased by 9.4%. With DGE10 (10% DGE + 90% CMO), the ignition characteristics of CMO are improved and BTE is increased to 31.7% at full load condition. With EU10 (10% EU + 90% CMO) and A10 (10% A + 90% CMO), NOX emission is decreased by 24.6 and 17.8% when compared to diesel, while BTE is comparable to diesel. While HC and CO emission decreased for DGE10 and CU10, they increased for EU10 and A10 when compared to baseline diesel and CMO. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The elemental composition, heating value and water content, are important properties to be characterized for pyrolysis bio-oils, providing information on their quality. These properties are mainly determined according to ASTM standards by using three different analytical techniques requiring time and cost. This research was focused on a simple method to determine the weight content of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and water as well as the heating value, by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) using models based on partial least squares regressions (PLS). Samples were classified into two sets according to Kennard-Stone algorithm. The first set of samples was used to develop the calibration models for each physical parameter, where the number of latent variables was determined by full cross validation procedure. The second set of samples was employed as an external prediction set, assessing the quality of the models. External predictions confirmed that robust models were developed since elemental analysis, heating value and water content of the upgraded biofuels obtained by the catalytic cracking of pyrolysis bio-oil vapors could be determined with good predictive ability with a root mean square error of prediction of carbon content = 0.963 wt.% (R2 = 0.836, range = 70.9–78.8 wt.%), hydrogen content = 0.101 wt.% (R2 = 0.815, range = 8.01-8.75 wt.%), oxygen content = 0.910 wt.% (R2 = 0.873, range = 12.3–20.9 wt.%), water content = 0.416 wt.% (R2 = 0.829, range = 2.79–7.24 wt.%) and heating value = 0.539 MJ kg−1(R2 = 0.874, range = 31.9–36.9 MJ kg−1) by chemometric tools joined to medium infrared spectrum. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), the monomeric constituent of chitin, is rarely studied for lipid production by oleaginous species. This study demonstrated that Cryptococcus curvatus had a great capacity to convert GlcNAc into lipid with high yield using a two-stage production process. Optimal inoculum age and inoculation size strongly improved the two-stage lipid production efficiency. More interestingly, this process rendered superior lipid production under non-sterile condition. The acetate liberated from GlcNAc was consumed timely, while the NH4+ released was rarely assimilated. Lipid titre, lipid content and lipid yield reached 9.9 g/L, 56.9% and 0.23 g/g, respectively, which were significantly higher than those from the conventional process where cell growth and lipid accumulation were coupled. The resulting lipid samples had similar fatty acid compositional profiles to those of vegetable oil, suggesting their potential for biodiesel production. These findings strongly supported the two-stage process as an attractive strategy for better techno-economics of the chitin-to-biodiesel routes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - India is developing at a faster rate in the current era. It needs usage of large amount fuel and electricity, which leads to increase the import of crude oil and huge greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Hence, air pollution in the metro cities is increased. To reduce these emissions, alternative fuel is to be used which emits less GHG emissions in the atmosphere. This review highlights the potential materials such as sweet Sorghum, Neem seed, Mahua seed, Sugarcane molasses, Jatropha etc. for producing biofuels. This article also discusses the promising blends and their effects on GHG emissions. This will helps India to sustainably develop its economy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cyclohexanone was identified as an attractive second-generation biofuel that can be used as an alternative fuel or blending component, thereby reducing greenhouse gas and particulate emissions from internal combustion engines. This paper investigates auto-ignition characteristics of cyclohexanone/O2/Ar mixtures behind reflected shock waves. Ignition delay time measurements cover the temperature range of 1255−1646 K, with pressures near 2.5, 5, and 10 atm, argon/oxygen dilution ratios of 23.9, 48.9 and 98.9, and equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. Five kinds of mixtures were prepared to determine the effects of pressure, equivalence ratio and dilution ratio on the reactivity over the entire temperature range. An ignition delay correlation, τ=6.87×10−6P−0.52Φ0.70D0.66exp(45.59/RT)(μs), has been developed for cyclohexanone, including dependencies on pressure, equivalence ratio and dilution ratio. Experimental data have been compared to the kinetic modeling predictions of Serinyel et al. [Proc. Combust. Inst. 35 (2015) 507−514]. In general, the predictions overestimate the experimental data by 30–50%. With several reaction rate constants of selected small radical reactions updated, the predictions by modified mechanism present satisfactory agreement with the measured ignition delay data. Also, simulations based on the original model and modified model were compared to species concentrations measured in a jet-stirred reactor at 10 atm from the literature. Reaction pathway and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the fuel consumption paths and key reactions during the ignition process of cyclohexanone. To our knowledge, the auto-ignition measurement of gas-phase cyclohexanone presented here are the first measurement for this compound. © 2018 The Combustion Institute

AB  - Annual average PM2.5 concentration in south Beijing was 30% and 40% higher than the whole Beijing city in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Few studies have been conducted to investigate what leads to the characteristics and sources of heavy pollution in the south rural area of Beijing. This study conducted an observation with Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) at a southwest rural site (Liulihe) in Beijing during 2014–2016, to investigate the seasonal aerosol characteristics and their sources. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) algorithm was used to distinguish different components of organic aerosol measured by ACSM. Biomass burning is an important pollution source, mainly due to the open burning after harvest season in autumn, regional transport in spring, and local residential biofuel use in winter. Coal consumption is the largest primary organic aerosol source in winter. Heavy duty diesel trucks contributed significantly to organic aerosol at night-time in the rural area. Results of this study show residential solid fuel burning is the most important source of aerosol pollution in the rural area of Beijing and the results focusing on urban Beijing might have underestimate the contribution from residential emissions in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The economic and environmental performance of microalgal processes has been widely analyzed in recent years. However, few studies propose an integrated process-based approach to evaluate economic and environmental indicators simultaneously. Biodiesel is usually the single product and the effect of environmental benefits of co-products obtained in the process is rarely discussed. In addition, there is wide variation of the results due to inherent variability of some parameters as well as different assumptions in the models and limited knowledge about the processes. In this study, two standardized models were combined to provide an integrated simulation tool allowing the simultaneous estimation of economic and environmental indicators from a unique set of input parameters. First, a harmonized scenario was assessed to validate the joint environmental and techno-economic model. The findings were consistent with previous assessments. In a second stage, a Monte Carlo simulation was applied to evaluate the influence of variable and uncertain parameters in the model output, as well as the correlations between the different outputs. The simulation showed a high probability of achieving favorable environmental performance for the evaluated categories and a minimum selling price ranging from $11 gal− 1 to $106 gal− 1. Greenhouse gas emissions and minimum selling price were found to have the strongest positive linear relationship, whereas eutrophication showed weak correlations with the other indicators (namely greenhouse gas emissions, cumulative energy demand and minimum selling price). Process parameters (especially biomass productivity and lipid content) were the main source of variation, whereas uncertainties linked to the characterization methods and economic parameters had limited effect on the results. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The co-pyrolysis of pretreated lignin and soapstock was carried out to upgrade vapors under microwave irradiation. Results showed that the yield of 29.92–42.21 wt% of upgraded liquid oil was achieved under varied pretreatment conditions. Char yield decreased from 32.44 wt% for untreated control to 24.35 wt% for the 150 °C pretreated samples. The increased temperature, irradiation time and acid concentration were conducive to decrease the relative contents of phenols and oxygenates in liquid oils. The main components of the liquid oil were gasoline fraction (mono-aromatics and C5–C12 aliphatics), which ranged from 57.38 to 71.98% under various pretreatment conditions. Meanwhile, the diesel fraction (C12+ aliphatics) ranged from 13.16 to 22.62% from co-pyrolysis of pretreated lignin and soapstock, comparing with 10.18% of C12+ aliphatics from co-pyrolysis of non-pretreated lignin and soapstock. A possible mechanism was proposed for co-pyrolysis of pretreated lignin and soapstock for upgraded liquid oils. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is widely accepted as substitute fuel for diesel engine by scientist, engineers and researchers for its superior fuel quality compared to diesel in terms of emission. The environmental and social benefits got from biodiesel attract almost all section of people. The use of biodiesel in diesel engine reduces the green house gases like CO, HC and PM emission considerably, but the smoke and NOx emissions are high compare to diesel. In order to reduce the smoke and NOx emissions caused by biodiesel in diesel engine, an experimental study was conducted by using water emulsified pongamia biodiesel in a four stroke direct injection diesel engine. The result revealed 9% increase in BSFC and 5% decrease in BTE with a reduction of around 32% in NOx emission. The smoke has been reduced to 7.4%, the emission of CO and HC has been reduced to a marginal value of 2.3% and 1% respectively compared with that of B20 blend. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays, there is a lot of research done with renewable diesel fuels. The number of parent materials (especially sludge oil, used oil, edible and non-edible oils), production technologies, and additives of biodiesel is increasing. In our work a comprehensive comparison test series of three fuels (fossil diesel, conventional biodiesel (rapeseed oil methyl ester), and a new type of biodiesel (which is called Triglycerides of Modified Structure)) have been performed. Comparison tests have been conducted with respect to their physicochemical properties and their effect on the combustion and emission of a bus engine. Referring to the physicochemical properties, the tested biodiesel fulfil all the requirements of the EN (European Norm) 14214 standard, but the tested TBK (Thész-Boros-Király) doesn't fit some of the requirements of the EN standard. Based on the indicator and heat release results it can be established, that there is no significant, but a moderate improvement of the combustion process with bio fuels. As for the emission it can be stated, that bio fuels are advantageous as well, but the results are near to measurement accuracy, except smoke and opacity, which decreased in a high degree in case of the two tested bio fuel compared to the fossil one. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Latin American and Caribbean's (LAC) external dependency on fossil fuels and the pursuit for renewable energy leads to the need for a strategy to afford a cleaner and reliable domestic energy supply. Sugarcane presents high photosynthetic efficiency and it is a well-spread crop in LAC. Our study aims to explore the potential of different approaches of modern energy production from sugarcane, at a national level, and its implication to the environmental aspects. We found that Guatemala, Nicaragua and Cuba would be able to replace 10% of the gasoline and about 2–3% of the diesel consumption by only using the current molasses. With a slight expansion on sugarcane production, Bolivia can replace 20% of the gasoline and diesel, besides providing surplus ethanol for exportation or other purposes. With a minor investment, bagasse may enlarge the electricity access in many countries whereas in other may represent an alternative to replace fossil fuel sources. We also found relevant potential on reducing the GHG emissions specially in Bolivia, Paraguay and Nicaragua. However, the implementation of such strategies must be supported by appropriate policies to ensure competitive prices, overcome opportunity costs, and stimulate investments. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study investigates the feasibility of synthesis of environmentally benign heterogeneous carbonaceous catalyst and biodiesel production from a single source i.e. Mesua ferrea Linn (MFL) seeds. The study primarily focuses on the optimisation of biodiesel synthesis process considering four parameters viz. reaction time, temperature, catalyst loading and methanol to oil ratio (M/O). The parametric influence on the free fatty acid (FFA) conversion has been studied to evaluate the most significant parameters. The contribution factor and analysis of variance results reveal that temperature is the most significant parameter influencing the FFA conversion followed by reaction time and catalyst content. The optimum conditions observed for maximum FFA conversion of 95.57% were: temperature 55 °C, time 2 h, catalyst content 10 wt% and M/O 6:1. The physico-chemical properties of the produced Mesua ferrea oil methyl ester (MFOME) were analysed following ASTM standard methods and found to be within limit; and compatible with the conventional diesel. Thus, the study suggests that the MFL seeds could be a promising source for the synthesis of an effective heterogeneous catalyst; and eco-friendly energy efficient sustainable fuel through the concept of green chemistry by converting waste into valuable commodity towards mitigation of increased energy demand. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present paper reports the microwave assisted intensification of biodiesel production from waste cooking oil using heterogeneous base catalyst - calcium diglyceroxide. Initially, experiments were carried out by varying various parameters such as reaction temperature, catalyst loading, and methanol to waste cooking oil (WCO) molar ratio using one factor at a time (OFAT) approach, to estimate the best condition. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the process variables, using the Box-Behnken model with three level and three factor. Under the optimized reaction conditions of methanol (MeOH) to WCO molar ratio of 7.46:1, catalyst loading of 1.03% (w/w of WCO) and temperature of 62 °C in the presence of microwave, a maximum biodiesel yield of 94.86% was obtained, whereas in the conventional heating method showed 42.59% yield for the similar reaction time of 15 min. Reusability of the catalyst was also tested, after the first run catalytic activity of calcium diglyceroxide was decreased for consecutive cycles. The transesterification of WCO followed pseudo first-order kinetics model. The activation energy and per-exponential factor were found to be 26.56 kJ mol−1 and 1.65 × 103 min−1, respectively. The fuel properties of biodiesel matched with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM-D6751) standards. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hybrid process that integrated fermentation, pervaporation and esterification was established aiming to improve the economic feasibility of the conventional acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation process. Candida sp 99–125 cells were used as full-cell catalyst. The feasibility of batch and fed-batch esterification using the ABE permeate of pervaporation (ranging from 286.9 g/L to 402.9 g/L) as substrate were compared. Valuable butyl oleate was produced along with ethyl oleate. For the batch esterification, due to severe inhibition of substrate to lipase, the yield of butyl oleate and ethyl oleate were only 24.9% and 3.3%, respectively. In contrast, 75% and 11.8% of butyl oleate and ethyl oleate were obtained, respectively, at the end of the fed-batch esterification. The novel integration process provides a promising strategy for in situ upgrading ABE products. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Alcohol fuels offer opportunities to reduce the use of fossil fuels in CI engines and to increase percentage of biofuels in the transport and energy sectors, where combustion engines are often used. This study presents experimental examinations of a stationary single-cylinder compression ignition dual-fuel engine based on co-combustion of diesel fuel with alcohols. The study evaluated the effect of addition of methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and 1-butanol to diesel fuel on the combustion process, performance and emissions from a research engine. Percentage of the energy supplied in the alcohol fuel was 15, 30, 45, 55 and 70% of total energy supplied with fuel to the engine. The results of the examinations were compared to the examinations for the engine fuelled with pure diesel fuel as a reference. Addition of alcohol to diesel fuel had a positive effect on the level of mean indicated pressure, thermal efficiency and stability of the research engine. The increase in energy percentage of each alcohol to 55% during co-combustion with diesel fuel led to the mean increase in indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) by 22%, mean increase of indicated thermal efficiency (ITE) by almost 13% and reduction in coefficient of variation COVIMEP by 52%. Of the alcohols analysed in the study, methanol was the most beneficial in terms of high indicated pressure and high efficiency, with maximal values of IMEP = 0.86 MPa and ITE = 35.3% at DM55. Addition and increase in percentage of each alcohol to 55% led to the increase in emissions of nitrogen oxides (by 139% on average), decline of carbon oxide emissions (by 45% on average) and increase in carbon dioxide emissions (by 17% on average). However, it did not lead to significant changes in emissions of hydrocarbons. The highest content of NOx, CO and CO2 in engine exhaust were found for co-combustion of diesel fuel with addition of methanol. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The article draws on the multi-level perspective (MLP) and global value chain (GVC) frameworks to analyse the drivers and trajectories of foreign private investment in biofuel production in Ghana. It is based on a narrative of the evolution of a niche for jatropha production in Ghana in the period 1995–2016 including company case studies. The factors analysed relating to MLP are alignment of expectations, network formation, and learning and knowledge sharing, and those relating to GVC are chain structure, governance, ownership, and access to land and capital. High entry barriers for creating a new agriculture-based value chain for global biofuel markets, i.e. high volume requirements, high capital needs, and market risks contributed to the collapse of the jatropha sector in Ghana. A low level of learning and knowledge sharing between jatropha actors in Ghana, alongside weak public R&D support, reduced access to technical and managerial information. Confirming previous GVC research on biofuels, policy and NGOs had a stronger influence on the jatropha value chain than in typical agricultural chains. Moreover, global drivers and the strategies and capabilities of foreign investors can strongly influence the development of a new biofuel value chain in a developing country. The latter points complement previous research on jatropha, which highlights politico- economic factors such as land tenure, regional and local power relations, and the interests of donors and NGOs. The study exemplifies a non- evolutionary niche development that goes beyond the European experiences of industrial niche development on which the MLP framework was first established. The importance of investors and policy at different levels of the value chain illustrate the synergies in combining the MLP and GVC frameworks in research on energy transitions in developing countries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present experimental work investigates the use of ethyne gas in biodiesel-fueled diesel engine at different flow rate of 1, 2, and 3 L/min and is compared with diesel operation. This work is aimed to examine the outcome of ethyne gas by dual-fuel operation on emission characteristics of neat biodiesel-fueled stationary diesel engine. The oil derived from mustard seeds are employed as a source for biodiesel. The work was carried out at 2100 rpm (speed) and at an optimal compression ratio of 17. Based on the outcome of this investigation, the maximum reduction in hydrocarbon (25.1%), carbon monoxide (17.24%), and smoke emission (24.8%) was observed for biodiesel–ethyne at 3 L/min than the neat biodiesel. However, NOx emissions were found to be 15.8% higher for ethyne–biodiesel fueling at 3 L/min owing to increase in combustion gas temperature than neat biodiesel. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this research study, biodiesel has been successfully produced from vegetable seed oil of an indigenous plant Salvadora persica L. that meets the international biodiesel standard (ASTM D6751). The biodiesel yield was 1.57 g/5 g (31.4% by weight) and the in-situ transesterification ester content conversion was 97.7%. The produced biodiesel density was 0.894 g/mL, its kinematic viscosity 5.51 mm2/s, HHV 35.26 MJ/kg, flash point 210°C, cetane no. 61, and sulfur content 0.0844%. Thermal analysis of the biodiesel showed that 97% weight loss was achieved at 595°C with total oxidation of the biodiesel. The production energy efficiency was 0.46% with a lab scale setup, assuming the volume fraction ratio (volume of the sample/total volume of the equipment used). The results revealed that single-step in-situ transesterification method is suitable for the production of biodiesel from S. persica seed oil. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The development of renewable liquid biofuel is a crucial route to increase the energy supply and reduce the pollutant emission.The catalysts were tested in the hydrocracking of bio-alkanes,produced from biodiesel hydrodeoxygenation for producing the bio-jet fuel.The ratio of metal sites to acid sites(C Pt /C A )on Pt/Al-MCM-41 bifunctional catalyst was important to both the catalyst activity and product selectivity.Catalysts with different metal/acid ratios were prepared on Al-MCM-41 support with Si/Al ratio of 10 using various platinum loadings.Both the hydrocracking activity and selectivity to kerosene increased with the increasing in C Pt /C A ratio in the range of 0.182~0.338.However,too high metal/acid ratio could cause the agglomeration of platinum particles,resulting in the waste of catalyst and reduction of catalyst activity and selectivity to kerosene.The optimal C Pt /C A ratio was 0.203,under which the bio-alkanes conversion,kerosene yield and kerosene/gasoline ratio could reach 98.7%,47.0% and 1.12,respectively. © 2018, Dept. of JCCOA.

AB  - In order to produce jet biofuel from lipids derived from microalgal biomass, lower-viscosity and smaller-molecular microalgal biodiesel was converted into jet range hydrocarbons over four mesoporous zeolite-based catalysts decorated with nickel. Ni/Meso-Y catalyst exhibited a high selectivity (44.5%) of jet range alkane (C8-C16) from light microalgal biodiesel. The conversion pathway of light microalgal biodiesel to jet range hydrocarbons was proposed that majority of fatty acids first deoxygenated to C15-C16 through decarbonylation and then long chain alkane cracked into short chain alkane. The other fatty acids first cracked into short chain acids and then further deoxygenated through decarbonylation to jet range alkane, in which a part of alkane converted to aromatic hydrocarbons through aromatization. Meso-Y catalyst was suitable for conversion of heavy microalgal biodiesel to jet range hydrocarbons with low selectivity (4.47%) of aromatic hydrocarbons, but the other three catalysts (Meso-HZSM-5, Meso-Hbeta and SAPO-34) gave high aromatic hydrocarbons selectivity. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Even though a shift from conventional to renewable resources is often envisaged, lignocellulosic biorefinery concepts struggle with economic viability and sustainability. In order to overcome these barriers, a full analysis from biomass supply chain, process performance optimization, and product-portfolio selection is targeted. Addressing the economic viability and sustainability already at an early process development stage when only limited knowledge is available, Process Network Flux Analysis (PNFA) [Ulonska et al., AIChE J. 2017, 62, 3096-3108] is capable of systematically identifying the most valuable processing pathways. This enables a first performance ranking based on the profit or global warming potential of pathways, thereby accelerating process development. While so far only processing networks have been considered, the methodology is herein extended to consider biomass supply chain optimization and market-dependent price developments such that all main influencing factors are considered simultaneously. The extended methodology is validated identifying reasonable plant locations in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Enhancing economic viability of the best performing biofuel ethanol, a multiproduct biorefinery is targeted coproducing value-added chemicals. Herein, a coproduction of iso-butanol raises the profit significantly: a mass ratio of at most 1.9 (ethanol:iso-butanol) is required to break even. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This article optimizes the design and configuration of algal biofuel supply chain networks (SCN) under economic and environmental objectives. Minimization of the total supply chain cost and the total life cycle greenhouse gas emission are the economic and environmental objectives, respectively. The SCN has been modeled by a multiobjective mixed integer linear programming approach which incorporates multiple production pathways and time periods, seasonality factors, water evaporation, recycling opportunities, and other major traits of the algal biofuel SCN. The model determines the optimal strategic and tactical level decisions of all SCN echelons. A fuzzy solution-based ε-constraint method has been utilized to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions that illustrate the trade-off between economic and environmental objectives. The performance of the model has been assessed in a case study carried out in seven states of the U.S which intends to develop the algal biofuel SCN from the year 2018 to the year 2024. Essential information with regard to the future of different technological pathways, relative importance of various supply chain factors, and sensitivity analysis has been discussed with respect to the case study results. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - n-Octanol (C8H17OH) is an advanced biofuel derived from ligno-cellulosic biomass that is suitable for compression ignition technology with several properties closer to fossil diesel. This study analyses the performance and emissions of a direct-injection (DI) diesel engine fueled with n-octanol/diesel blends containing 10% (OCT10), 20% (OCT20) and 30%(OCT30) by volume of n-octanol using a 3 × 3 full-factorial experimental design matrix that considers blend composition of n-octanol in diesel, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rates of 10%, 15% and 20% and injection timings of 19° 21° and 23° crank angle (CA) before top dead centre (bTDC) as factors. Models for oxides of nitrogen (NOx), smoke, brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) were developed using response surface methodology (RSM) and were found to be significant statistically. The variation of EGR had a considerable effect on both BTE and BSFC of the engine followed by blend composition and injection timing. Best performance (BTE = 37.06%, BSFC = 0.23kg/kWh) was delivered by OCT10 at 10% EGR and 23°CA while the lowest performance (BTE = 30.95%, BSFC = 0.28kg/kWh) was by OCT30 at 20% EGR and 19°CA. Injection timing was found to have the highest effect on NOx emissions while EGR affected smoke opacity to the maximum. NOx was found to decrease from 1790 ppm (for OCT10 at 10% EGR and 23°CA) to as low as 410 ppm (for OCT30 at 20% EGR and 19°CA). Smoke opacity was found to decrease from 94.2% (for OCT10 at 20% EGR and 19°CA) to as low as 43% (for OCT30 at 10% EGR and 23°CA). Desirability approach was used to determine the best combination of blend composition of n-octanol, EGR and injection timing for minimising smoke, NOx and BSFC simultaneously. 17% by volume of n-octanol/diesel blend injected at 20° CA bTDC and 10% EGR was predicted to be optimum which delivered a simultaneous reduction of NOx (−47.4%), smoke (−21.08%) and BSFC (−8%) during confirmatory tests with a reasonable accuracy of within 4%. This method is robust and could be employed to other small engines for developing models that can predict engine characteristics with reasonable accuracy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Gaseous fuels can be used in diesel engines to improve combustion and obtain more favorable emission. Vibration and noise formation in diesel engines is a rather complex phenomenon which is created during combustion of fuels and leads to a reduction in vehicle comfort. Although there are studies in the literature that examine the noise and vibration of the diesel engine using different biofuels, there is no study that thoroughly examines the effect of combined utilization of Foeniculum vulgare oil biodiesel (FVB) and hydroxy gas (HHO) on vibration, noise and combustion characteristics. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effects of FVB, a promising biodiesel feedstock, and HHO dual fuel operation on vibration, noise and exhaust emissions of a diesel engine. The vibration, noise and emission data obtained by the use of diesel fuel were taken as a reference and the effects of FVB and HHO mixture utilization on vibration, noise and emission formation were examined. The results show that the total vibration and noise generated by the engine was decreased by the use of FVB. In addition, the utilization of HHO together with biodiesel further reduced the engine vibration and noise according to experimental data. According to exhaust emission formation measurements, the minimum carbon monoxide values were obtained when the engine was fueled with HHO and FVB mixtures. However, CO2 and NOX emissions increased with the combination of HHO and FVB usage. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The excessive blooming of green filamentous macroalgae is a global problem due to their unwanted presence in freshwater, lakes, nursery garden and stagnant waters. An attractive solution is to use macroalgae as a biofuel feedstock. In this work, the macroalgae studied was the Chaetomorpha cf. gracilis. The macroalgae oil extraction was accomplished using Soxhlet method obtaining a yield of 1.85%. The gas chromatography analysis showed higher unsaturated fatty acids (56.14%) compared to saturated fatty acids (35.18%), highlighting the content of oleic acid, 27.89%. The kinematic viscosity and density were 0.826 mm2/s and 699.6 kg/m3, respectively. The heating value, crystallization temperature and elemental composition showed higher values than other algae oils. Nevertheless, the nitrogen content was similar to L.digitata macroalgae. The analysis conducted on the net energy ratio for the oil extraction process showed that the Chaetomorpha macroalgae oil might represent an attractive alternative for liquid biofuel production. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In recent years, in order to increase the quality of life of people, energy usage has become very important. Researchers are constantly searching for new sources of energy due to increased energy demand. Engine tests are being conducted to investigate the feasibility of the new sources of energy such as alternative fuels. In the engine tests, engine performance, combustion characteristics and exhaust emissions are evaluated by obtaining the results. The effect of newly developed fuels on engine lifetime, safe transport and storage are also examined for fuel availability. In addition, the potential and the price of fuels are important in terms of sustainability. In these studies, laboratory environments are needed for experimental setups. It is difficult to determine the availability of the most suitable alternative fuel since numerous results are obtained in the engine tests and studies. This integrated model provides a great advantage in terms of time and cost. The physical and chemical properties of the fuel affect experimental results such as engine performance, combustion, and exhaust emission. The suggested model can be making the most efficient and eco-friendly fuel choice without the need for experimental studies by using physical and chemical properties of the fuel. It also can offer the best fuel for cost, safety and maintenance processes. In this study, animal fat biodiesel derived from waste animal fats and vegetable oil biodiesel produced from aspir-canola oils were investigated. Biodiesel fuels are mixed with diesel at 5%, 20%, and 50%, and nine different fuels prepared with three pure fuels, and six different fuel blends are compared. Before using these fuels in an experimental study, estimates are made about which fuels may be more advantageous in terms of many criteria. In the process, nine varied fuel specifications are taken as references such as calorific value, cetane number, oxygen content rate, fuel price, flash point, viscosity, lubricity, iodine number and water content. The criteria weights are determined with SWARA (Step-Wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis) from multi-criteria decision-making models, and MULTIMOORA (Multi-Objective Optimization on the basis of Ratio Analysis) is ranked according to fuels' characteristics from the best to the worst. While theoretically, the best fuel is ultimately VOB20, VOB50 and AFB20 were selected as the second fuel and the third fuel. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This research combines Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model to determine feedstock supply, preprocessing facility, and biorefinery locations at a highly resolved spatial scale with the objective of meeting a large-scale annual biofuel production and demand goal for Tennessee, USA. Simultaneous determination of this supply chain network using MIP is computationally expensive. Memory limitation of typical personal computers constrain the network problem. High Performance Computing environments may require days to solve, and without any assurance of a feasible solution. This paper proposes a two-stage optimization procedure to overcome these computational challenges while maintaining theoretical consistency with conventional firm location theory paradigms. The two-stage procedure assumes that firms first identify biorefinery locations with comparative advantage in terms of supplying biomass. Step two entails determining if costs can be lowered with the addition of preprocessing facilities, and their optimal location relative to the biorefinery sites. In contrast, a single step optimization procedure siting multiple biorefineries and concomitantly preprocessing units and biomass supply areas assumes a different strategy for a single firm. Results suggest that the two-stage optimization approach is able to identify a feasible solution of multiple feedstock areas, feedstock preprocessing and fuel production locations using high-resolution spatial layers over a relatively large geographic region in a fraction of the computer resources required to solve a single, simultaneous location problem. The optimal supply chain network solutions generated from the two-stage and single simultaneous approaches are different. The absolute difference in the smaller scaled models’ objective values is less than 1%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae are a promising feedstock for biofuel generation. Economical and effective mass cultivation is essential for greater feasibility in microalgal-based biofuel full applications. The present study reported on cultivation of Chlorella sorokiniana CY-1 in palm oil mill effluent (POME) under photoautotrophic and mixotrophic cultivation. Enhancement of biomass and lipid productions were carried out by using glucose, urea and glycerol supplementations. Mixotrophic cultivation was more effective than photoautotrophic condition. Glycerol addition exhibited greater microalgae growth performance compared to supplementing glucose or urea. Biomass (1.68 g L−1) and lipid (15.07%) production were highest in POME medium with combinations of 200 mg L−1 urea, glucose and glycerol supplementation. Chlorella sorokiniana CY-1 grown in POME with glucose and glycerol supplementation gave considerably comparable yields as in all supplements-added POME medium. Ideal fatty acids compositions shown in urea and glycerol supplemented-POME medium though lower biomass production obtained. The pollutant remediation efficiencies attained were 63.85% COD, 91.54% TN and 83.25% TP in all supplements-added medium. The estimated net energy ratio was 0.55 and nutrient cost could be reduced up to 76%. Cheap and effective carbon and nutrients supplementation is essential to minimize the economic impact and maximize yields in commercial scale microalgae cultivation for biofuel production and environmental sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Analysis of thermal properties of the new types of biofuels is very important, providing basis to estimate the limit values of the combustion process and the specific behavior of the fuel itself. This is especially important when new and often expensive types of fuel undergo the initial evaluation. In this paper, thermal and physical properties of P. moriformis oil and biodiesel, diesel fuel and their 30/70 and 70/30 blends have been analyzed by using thermogravimetric analysis methods – Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetry (TGA/DTG). According to obtained thermograms, it is observed that boiling point temperatures and ignition temperatures of the samples taking place in following order: diesel < algal oil < algal biodiesel and diesel < algal biodiesel < algal oil, respectively. By using three different methods derived in literature, Calculated Cetane Index (CCI) was calculated for the tested fuels and the obtained values compared with the reference values. An outcome of an experiment based on a scientific method in which Cetane number is assigned as a function of density and thermogravimetric analysis index have shown a very strong correlation between CCI obtained for P. moriformis biodiesel and reference value for the same fuel found in scholarly publication. Finally, we concluded that there are wide possibilities to utilise P. moriformis biodiesel blended in various proportions with fossil fuel without significant modifications of diesel engines. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Bio-jet fuels are emerging as a valuable alternative to petroleum-based fuels for their potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel dependence. In this study, residual woody biomass from slash piles in the U.S. Pacific Northwest is used as a feedstock to produce iso-paraffinic kerosene, through the production of sugar and subsequent patented proprietary fermentation and upgrading. To enhance the economic viability and reduce the environmental impacts of iso-paraffinic kerosene, two co-products, activated carbon and lignosulfonate, are simultaneously produced within the same bio-refinery. A cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed for the residual woody biomass-based bio-jet fuel and compared against the cradle-to-grave LCA of petroleum-based jet fuel. This paper also discusses the differences in the environmental impacts of the residual biomass-based bio-jet fuel using two different approaches, mass allocation and system expansion, to partition the impacts between the bio-fuel and the co-products, which are produced in the bio-refinery. Results: The environmental assessment of biomass-based bio-jet fuel reveals an improvement along most critical environmental criteria, as compared to its petroleum-based counterpart. However, the results present significant differences in the environmental impact of biomass-based bio-jet fuel, based on the partitioning method adopted. The mass allocation approach shows a greater improvement along most of the environmental criteria, as compared to the system expansion approach. However, independent of the partitioning approach, the results of this study reveal that more than the EISA mandated 60% reduction in the global warming potential could be achieved by substituting petroleum-based jet fuel with residual woody biomass-based jet fuel. Converting residual woody biomass from slash piles into bio-jet fuel presents the additional benefit of avoiding the impacts of slash pile burning in the forest, which results in a net negative impact on 'Carcinogenics' and 'Respiratory effects', and substantial reduction in the 'Smog' and 'Ecotoxicity' impacts. The production of woody biomass-based bio-jet fuel, however, did not show any significant improvement in the 'Acidification' and 'Eutrophication' impact categories. Conclusions: The study reveals that residual woody biomass recovered from slash piles represents a more sustainable alternative to petroleum for the production of jet fuel with a lower impact on global warming and local pollution. Future research should focus on the optimization of chemical processes of the bio-refinery to reduce the impacts on the 'Acidification' and 'Eutrophication' impact categories. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - An inexpensive carbocatalyst containing Brønsted acidic sulfonic acid group and Lewis acidic Ti4+ is found to be effective for cascade conversion of C6 sugar to 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) via sequential dehydration, and etherification reactions. HMF and fructose conversions at mild conditions achieved 91% and 64% EMF yields, respectively. The results indicate that the two acid sites interplay synergistically for high EMF yield and minimal ring-opened product ethyl levulinate (EL), another promising biofuel additive. Etherification of 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) with alcohols of varying carbon lengths formed alkoxymethylfurans (AMF) with high yields. The catalyst retained good activity upon recycling. The nature and strength of the acid sites are elucidated. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A reductive fractionation process for the valorization of Quercus suber bark toward hydrocarbons in gasoline and diesel ranges and optionally 4-ethylguaiacol has been developed. The procedure involves three steps: (1) tandem hydrogen-free Pd/C-catalyzed transfer hydrogenolysis of lignin where the carbohydrates serve as an inherent hydrogen donor under slightly alkaline conditions to also facilitate the depolymerization of suberin, (2) optional distillation, to isolate the 4-ethylguaiacol, (3) hydrodeoxygenation of the mixture from the first step by a Pt-MoO3/TiO2 catalyst generated hydrocarbons in gasoline and diesel ranges. The yield of 4-ethylguaiacol (90% purity) is 2.6% of dry bark weight (12% of acid insoluble lignin), and yield of hydrocarbon bio-oil is 42% of dry bark weight. This corresponds to a theoretical maximum yield of 77% for lignin and suberin. The carbon yield of the obtained bio-oil is thereby 64% from the total initial bark. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In light of advances in the simultaneous production of biobased fuels and chemicals, a prospective well-to-wheel lifecycle assessment (LCA) model of a two-step multistage torrefaction biorefinery is constructed to quantify both lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy return on primary fossil energy investment (EROIfossil) for a transportation-range biofuel product. Coproducts - including cyclopentanone (CPO), biochar, and a potential net electricity export - are handled via six coproduct scenarios, evaluated across both market-based allocation and displacement methods. Process-scale performance metrics and product distributions are compared across cases to evaluate trade-offs between process and environmental performance; carbon flows are visualized to better explain patterns of carbon yield and waste. LCA results include median GHG values spanning from -30.8 to +36.1 g CO2e/MJ-fuel and median EROIfossil values ranging from 1.6 to 12.8 MJ-fuel/MJ-PEfossil. Sensitivity results for the Market CPO case under market-based allocation display a large dependence on CPO yield, hydrogen consumption and fuel and CPO prices, while exhibiting minimal dependence on liquid fuel yield. Unrealistically low lifecycle GHG and high EROIfossil values are obtained under displacement for the maximum level of CPO production, prompting a discussion of methodological limitations, especially as they relate to the assignment of system expansion coproduct credit within existing EROI formulations. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The energy market is diversifying, allowing for the development of biofuels that seek to reduce environmental impact and be energetically competitive with conventional fuels. One of the aforementioned biofuels is the biodiesel that is produced from the oil extracted from the seeds of Jatropha curcas L. This research uses life cycle analysis (LCA) tool to analyze the following environmental impacts associated with its production: energy, water footprint, carbon footprint, mineral resource depletion, fossil resource depletion, terrestrial ecotoxicity, and human toxicity. The following stages were evaluated: (i) cultivation, (ii) the extraction of oil, and (iii) the biodiesel manufacturing process. The results showed that the overall process has an accumulated energy demand of 37.9 MJ/kg biodiesel, and generates 2.16 kg CO2 eq. of greenhouse gases (GHG) per kg of biofuel. The cultivation stage had the greatest contribution towards its energy and carbon footprints, taking up 45% and 60%, respectively. However, considering the energy valorization of the coproducts that are generated in the agricultural and extraction stages for self-consumption into the product system, both categories of impact mentioned above were reduced by 35% and 41%, respectively. © 2018 by the author.

AB  - Conversion of vegetable-derived triglycerides to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) is a popular approach to the generation of biodiesel fuels and the basis of a growing industry. Drawbacks of the strategy are that (a) the glycerol backbone of the triglyceride is discarded as waste, and (2) most available natural triglycerides in the U.S. are multiunsaturated or fully saturated, giving inferior fuel performance and causing engine problems. Here we show that catalysis by iridium complex 1 can address both of these problems through selective reduction of triglycerides high in polyunsaturation. This is realized using hydrogen from methanol or those imbedded in the triglyceride backbone, concurrently generating lactate as a value-added C3 product. Additional methanol or glycerol as a hydrogen source enables reduction of corn and soybean oils to >80% oleate. The cost of the iridium catalyst is mitigated by its recovery through aqueous extraction. The process can be further driven with a supporting iron-based catalyst for the complete saturation of all olefins. Preparative procedures are established for synthesis and separation of methyl esters of the hydrogenated fatty acids, enabling instant access to upgraded biofuels. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Due to the success of shale gas development in the US, the production cost of natural gas has been reduced significantly, which in turn has made methane (CH4), the major component of natural gas, a potential alternative substrate for bioconversion processes compared with other high-price raw material sources or edible feedstocks. Therefore, exploring effective ways to use CH4 for the production of biofuels is attractive. Biological fixation of CH4 by methanotrophic bacteria capable of using CH4 as their sole carbon and energy source has obtained great attention for biofuel production from this resource. Results: In this study, a fast-growing and lipid-rich methanotroph, Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1 and its glycogen-knock-out mutant (AP18) were investigated for the production of lipids derived from intracellular membranes, which are key precursors for the production of green diesel. The effects of culture conditions on cell growth and lipid production were investigated in high cell density cultivation with continuous feeding of CH4 and O2. The highest dry cell weight observed was 21.4 g/L and the maximum lipid productivity observed was 45.4 mg/L/h obtained in batch cultures, which corresponds to a 2-fold enhancement in cell density and 3-fold improvement in lipid production, compared with previous reported data from cultures of 5GB1. A 90% enhancement of lipid content was achieved by limiting the biosynthesis of glycogen in strain AP18. Increased CH4/O2 uptake and CO2 evaluation rates were observed in AP18 cultures suggesting that more carbon substrate and energy are needed for AP18 growth while producing lipids. The lipid produced by M. buryatense was estimated to have a cetane number of 75, which is 50% higher than biofuel standards requested by US and EU. Conclusions: Cell growth and lipid production were significantly influenced by culture conditions for both 5GB1 and AP18. Enhanced lipid production in terms of titer, productivity, and content was achieved under high cell density culture conditions by blocking glycogen accumulation as a carbon sink in the strain AP18. Differences observed in CH4/O2 gas uptake and CO2 evolution rates as well as cell growth and glycogen accumulation between 5GB1 and AP18 suggest changes in the metabolic network between these strains. This bioconversion process provides a promising opportunity to transform CH4 into biofuel molecules and encourages further investigation to elucidate the remarkable CH4 biofixation mechanism used by these bacteria. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Biodiesel is a promising fuel for compression ignition engines instead of diesel fuel. Due to the depletion of diesel fuel, an alternative fuel can be used in an engine. The experiments were conducted on a four-stroke, single cylinder CI engine. In this present investigation, an attempt has been made to study the influence of injection pressure (IP) and injection timing (IT) on the performance and emission characteristics of diesel engines by using mixed biodiesel (Thevetia peruviana, Jatropha, Pongamia, and Azadirachta indica). The injection pressure is varied from 200 to 230 bar and the injection timing is varied from 23 to 29° bTDC at an increment of 10 bar and 2° bTDC, respectively, and the results were compared with diesel. From this study, the results showed that the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) was increased by 2.4% with an increase in injection pressure and 1.5% with an increase in the injection timing for the maximum load, but lesser than diesel. Furthermore, a reduction of 5.08% of brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) has been noticed for the rise in IP and IT with loads but higher than diesel. The reduction was 34.17%, 53.85%, and 29.7% and 29.17%, 53.85%, and 21.95% of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and smoke emissions, respectively, at 230 bar injection pressure and at 27° bTDC injection timing. Also, a significant increase in nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions at the maximum load was observed by increasing the injection pressure and injection timing. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Aim: Biodiesel is an attractive fuel option for diesel engines in view of issues related to fossil fuel crisis and environmental degradation. The present study aimed to prepare biodiesel from non-edible grade castor Ricinus communis oil and to evaluate the emission characteristics of castor biodiesel fuelled diesel engine at different engine operating loads. Methodology: The biodiesel was prepared from non-edible grade castor oil by single step alkaline transesterification process at room temperature.The fuel properties like kinematic viscosity, density, calorific value, flash point, pour point, and cloud point were measured as per ASTM D-6751 specifications.The engine used for experimental work is a single cylinder, four stroke, constant speed, direct injection diesel engine. The engine testing was performed at different engine loads (0.9, 1.8 and 2.7 bmep) and at constant speed of 1500 rpm with different tested fuel blends i.e. B0, B20, B40 and B60. The emission parameters like nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide were evaluated using flue gas analyzer. Results: Production yield of 96.5% was obtained using biodiesel synthesis and castor oil based biodiesel was found to possess similar fuel properties when compared to fossil petro-diesel. At full engine load condition of 2.7 bmep, the hydrocarbon emission was lowered by 24.6, 39.6 and 42.1% for B20, B40 and B60 fuels, respectively, and the carbon monoxide emission was reduced by 12.9, 17.1 and 26.2% for tested fuel blends B20, B40 and B60, respectively, when compared to petro-diesel. At 2.7 bmep load condition, the NOx emissions was higher by 28.2% for B60 fuel when compared to petro-diesel, while, at 0.9 bmep load condition, NOx emissions increased by 11.8 and 15.1% for B20 and B40 blends, respectively, when compared with petro-diesel. Interpretation: The non-edible grade of castor oil can be used as a raw material for biodiesel production and its blend with diesel is a suitable fuel candidate for use in diesel engine without modifications, which results in overall low emissions. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).

AB  - Soybean is an important oil and protein source for human and animal food, as well as being used in the production of biofuel. Brazilian soybean is known for its quality, especially with regard to its high protein content. This work aimed to present a screening of Brazilian soybean cropped at different locations, to assess the composition of seed with regard to the protein, oil and fatty acid contents. We screened 46 cultivars, which represent more than 50% of the soybean cultivars produced in the South-Center region of Brazil in recent years, analyzed under six environments. In order to conduct the analysis, a grain sample was used to determine seed protein, oil and fatty acid contents, which was accomplished using near infrared spectroscopy (NIR). All the characters presented a genotype x environment interaction (GEI) (p < 0.01). A mean oil content of 20.35% was identified for all the evaluated cultivars. This was superior to that obtained in other countries. The mean protein content was 40.20%, which was expected for the Brazilian soybean. This higher oil content is doubly favorable in Brazilian soybean: firstly, for its use as cooking oil and biofuel; secondly, for the production of high protein soybean meal, once all the oil is removed. The cultivars which presented the highest oil contents were also stable across the evaluated environments. On the other hand, the genotypes with the highest protein content presented low stability across the environments. Regarding the fatty acid composition, Brazilian soybean stands out for its low linoleic acid content, which gives a high oxidative stability to the resulting oil and biofuel. Character associations were dependent on the location, thus breeders can select plants for specific traits at different locations. Brazilian cultivars present interesting characteristics for use in human and animal food products, and for biofuel production. © 2007-2018 Southern Cross Publishing-Australia.

AB  - This study examines the emission properties of particulate matter and particle-bound metals from a diesel engine generator fueled by traditional fossil diesel (D100) with the addition of n-butanol (B), hydrous n-butanol (B′), acetone (A), hydrous acetone (A′), isopropyl alcohol (I) or waste cooking oil-based biodiesel (W). The fuel blends were B30W20D50 (abbr. B30), B′30W20D50 (abbr. B′30), A3I1W20D76 (abbr. A3), A′3I1W20D76 (abbr.A′3), B30A3I1W20D46 (abbr. B30A3) and B′30A′3I1W20D46 (abbr. B′30A′3) tested at loads of 1.5 kW and 3.0 kW for the diesel engine generator. Experimental results indicate that adding B30, A3 or B30A3 reduces the PM mass concentration in the exhaust at both engine loads compared to using only W20. Additionally, the PM emission concentrations are lower when using B′30, A′3 and B′30A′3 than when using B30, A3 and B30A3, respectively; in other words, replacing pure n-butanol/acetone with hydrated n-butanol/acetone in the blends further reduces the PM emission concentrations. However, B30 or B30A3 is more effective than A3 in reducing the PM emissions, irrespective of the water content in the fuel blends. Conversely, using B30, B′30, A3, A′3, B30A3 or B′30A′3 instead of W20 reduces the metal content in the PM emissions at both engine loads. The major metal components in PM are Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, Fe and Zn, accounting for about 97 wt.% of 21 overall metals. The remaining analyzed metals were dominated by Mn, Ni, Cu, Mo and Ba. Accordingly, adding biodiesel from waste cooking oil and hydrous acetone/n-butanol to diesel fuel for diesel engine generators reduces the levels of PM and particle-bound metals. The waste hydrous acetone/n-butanol can be used for recycling purposes during this process. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.

AB  - Environmental damage concerns combined with low levels of domestic gasoline production and high import amounts makes it imperative for Mexico to seek renewable biofuel sources. This paper focuses on bioethanol research at public and private research centers, the regulatory framework and potential of second-generation bioethanol production, current and failed bioethanol introduction attempts, and a recent plan for a pilot introduction in three states in Mexico. Second-generation bioethanol based on agroindustry byproducts is a promising alternative. For example, 218 000 m3 of bioethanol could be produced annually from agave bagasse solids exceeding the estimated 123 000 m3 needed for the pilot program. However, knowledge gaps, an inadequate regulatory status, an unsuitable indifference price, and lack of government support to establish in Mexico a bioethanol industry have delayed its introduction. Finding solutions to factors preventing the introduction of 6% bioethanol to replace gasoline additives would benefit the environment and initiate Mexico's path to lower its dependence on nonrenewable fuels and gasoline imports. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - High production cost and lack of process-suitable characteristics in available microbial xylanases limit their vast industrial application potential. A new strain of Aspergillus terreus S9 isolated from mushroom compost (Directorate of Mushroom Research, Solan, India), utilized agro-industrial wastes as substrates for growth, and produced a process-apt xylanase. The study is the first ever report of a thermostable (60–90°C) and broad range pH stable (6.0–10.0) xylanase from a strain of Aspergillus terreus. Of a total of ten process variables examined based on Plackett-Burman design, four variables, i.e., wheat bran, incubation time, pH, and CaCl2 were earmarked to have substantial influence on xylanase production. These selected four variables were further optimized using Design of Experiments (DoE) approach (response surface methodology), and xylanase yield was enhanced (1.92-fold). Saccharification potential of xylanase was assessed using rice straw as substrate, under several sets of combinatorial regimes. Results showed that alkali pretreatment (0.2M KOH) followed by acid pretreatment (1% sulphuric acid) and enzymatic hydrolysis with cellulase and xylanase yielded maximum sugars. Desired industrial traits of A. terreus S9 xylanase reflect its application prospective for valorization of lignocellulosic biomass for production of biofuel-ethanol/other industrial products. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 37: 1210–1219, 2018. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog

AB  - Algae have an ample potential to produce biodiesel from spent wash of food industry. In addition, it is cheaper and presents an environment friendly way to handle food industry wastewater. This study was conducted to optimize the growth of microalgal strains and to assess biodiesel production potential of algae using untreated food industry wastewater as a source of nutrients. The food industry wastewater was collected and analyzed for its physicochemical characteristics. Different dilutions (10, 20, 40, 80, and 100%) of this wastewater were made with distilled water, and growth of two microalgal strains (Cladophora sp. and Spyrogyra sp.) was recorded. Each type of wastewater was inoculated with microalgae, and biomass was harvested after 7 days. The growth of both strains was also evaluated at varying temperatures, pH and light periods to optimize the algal growth for enhanced biodiesel production. After optimization, biodiesel production by Spyrogyra sp. was recorded in real food industry wastewater. The algal biomass increased with increasing level of food industry wastewater and was at maximum with 100% wastewater. Moreover, statistically similar results were found with algal growth on 100% wastewater and also on Bristol’s media. The Cladophora sp. produced higher biomass than Spyrogyra sp. while growing on food industry wastewater. The optimal growth of both microalgal strains was observed at temperature 30 °C, pH: 8, light 24 h. Cladophora sp. was further evaluated for biodiesel production while growing on 100% wastewater and found that this strain produced high level of oil and biodiesel. Algae have an ample potential to produce biodiesel from spent wash of food industry. In addition, it is cheaper and presents an environment friendly way to handle food industry wastewater. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Alcohol is used as an additive for a long time with the petroleum-based fuels. In this study, the higher alcohol, n-pentanol, was used as an additive to Calophyllum inophyllum (CI) biodiesel/diesel blends at 10, 15, and 20% by volume. In all blends, the ratio of CI was maintained at 20% by volume. The engine characteristics of the pentanol fuel blends were compared with the diesel and CI20 (Calophyllum inophyllum 20% and diesel 80%) biodiesel blend. The nitrogen oxide (NO) emission of the pentanol fuel blends showed an increased value than CI20 and neat diesel fuel. The carbon dioxide (CO2) also increased with increase in pentanol addition with the fuel blends than CI20 fuel blend and diesel. The carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions were decreased with increase in pentanol proportion in the blend than the CI20 fuel and diesel. The smoke emission was reduced and the combustion characteristics of the engine were also improved by using pentanol blended fuels. From this investigation, it is suggested that 20% pentanol addition with the biodiesel/diesel fuel is suitable for improved performance and combustion characteristics of a diesel engine without any engine modifications, whereas CO2 and NO emissions increased with addition of pentanol due to effective combustion. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - While the viscosity is an important factor influencing the atomization and combustion behavior of biodiesels, the viscosity prediction of biodiesels, blend of biodiesels, and blends of biodiesel-diesel fuels can be utilized for the replacement of conventional diesel fuels by the biodiesels from environmental pollution and renewability stand points. Therefore, a Support Vector Machine (SVM), an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and feedforward neural network model trained by Genetic Algorithm (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) are proposed for accurate prediction of the viscosity of various biodiesels based on a high number of experimental viscosity data. The performances of the developed models are compared to choose the one with the highest accuracy, which in turn led to pick up ANFIS model. Also, the neural network model trained by the stochastic optimization algorithms is provided better performance compared to other soft computing models while took into account new data. Also, the comparisons between the proposed model and the most well-known biodiesel viscosity models proofing the superiority of the developed model for predicting the viscosity of eighteen types of biodiesels with the correlation of determination of 0.9964 and ARD of 2.51%. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Platinum and WOx-promoted platinum supported on SiO2-Al2O3, Al2O3, AlPO4-5 and ZrO2 catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation method and investigated for deoxygenation of oleic acid (OA, a representative fatty acid) producing diesel-range hydrocarbons. Support and WOx influenced the textural, electronic and catalytic properties of Pt. WOx promoted the deoxygenation activity through hydrodeoxygenation pathway. Structure-activity correlations revealed that metallicity of Pt and acidity of the catalyst are crucial in determining the catalytic performance and product selectivity. Among the catalysts tested, 4Pt-8WOx/ZrO2, having adequate metal dispersion and electron rich Pt (desired for hydrogen splitting), reduced WOx species (W5+; -desired for OA activation) and less amount of strong acid sites (desired to avoid hydrocracking) showed highest catalytic deoxygenation performance (OA conversion = 100 mol% and C18 hydrocarbon selectivity = 89.4% at 260 °C and 20 bar H2 pressure). The study reveals that support plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic performance of platinum. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present study, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of wet Scenedesmus obliquus biomass into bio-crude was carried out. Initially, the biochemical composition of S. obliquus biomass was examined, and it indicated high protein (56.1%) followed by carbohydrate (22.3%) and lipid (11.5%) contents. The ultimate analysis unveiled the presence of high carbon (48.1%) and oxygen (36.1%) in the biomass. This study had shed light on the selection of ideal reaction conditions such as temperature (200, 250, 300 °C), pressure (100, 200, 300 bar), and residence time (30, 60 min) for producing maximum bio-crude with/without catalyst aid. In the absence of the catalyst, a bio-crude yield of 35.7% was obtained at 300 °C temperature, 200 bar pressure, and 60 min residence time. On an interesting note, bio-crude yield was increased from 35.7 to 45.1% by adding homogeneous acid catalyst CH3COOH at 300 °C reaction temperature, which was higher than the other acid catalysts HCOOH (40%), H2SO4 (38%), HCl (39%), H3BO3 (37%), and the base catalysts NaOH (38%), KOH (37%), Na2CO3 (40%), K2CO3 (36%), Ca(OH)2 (37%). Elemental analyses of bio-crudes indicated a higher heating value of 35–40 MJ/kg, carbon-74%, nitrogen-5.86%, hydrogen-10.9%, sulfur &lt;0.5 and oxygen content of 8.85%, which is comparable with petro-crude. Using CH3COOH as a catalyst in HTL led to reducing the oxygen content and simultaneously increased the higher heating value of bio-crude. In addition, GC-MS characterization of bio-crude indicated the presence of mono-aromatics, nitrogen heterocycles, phenols, indole and fatty acids. Thus, based on the yield and characteristics, the bio-crude produced from S. obliquus biomass could be used in petroleum refinery for fuel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is one of the most popular prospective alternative fuels and can be obtained from a variety of sources. Waste frying oil is one such source along with the various raw vegetable oils. However, some specific technical treatments are required to improve certain fuel properties such as viscosity and calorific value of the biodiesel being obtained from waste cooking oil methyl ester (WCOME). Various treatments are applied depending on the source and therefore the composition of the cooking oil. This research investigated the performance of WCOME as an alternative biofuel in a four-stroke direct injection diesel engine. An 8-mode test was undertaken with diesel fuel and five WCOME blends. The best compromise blend in terms of performance and emissions was identified. Results showed that energy utilization factors of the blends were similar within the range of the operational parameters (speed, load and WCOME content). Increasing biodiesel content produced slightly more smoke and NOx for a great majority of test points, while the CO and THC emissions were lower. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Global warming caused by greenhouse gas emission is a major threat in recent times. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a major source of greenhouse gas emission from CI engine. The present study aims to investigate the effect of pre-combustion, oxygenate and post-combustion system with biofuel blends in single cylinder CI engine on CO2 emission. All the experiments were conducted in a single cylinder CI engine with 5.2 kW rated power at 1500 rpm at 50% and 100% load. Diesel is replaced with Karanja oil methyl ester (KOME) and both are taken as baseline data. Low carbon biofuel namely orange oil (ORG) was blended on an equal volume basis with KOME and tested. Zeolite based post-combustion capture system (ZPCS) and fuel ionization filter (FIF) as pre-combustion capture system was tested along with 20% methanol (M) blend with KOME-ORG. FIF electrochemically ionizes the fuel molecules and aids in quick dispersion of the ions for improved combustion. Hydrocarbon based biofuels are converted to carbon, hydrogen and oxygen ions, where hydrogen takes part in combustion and oxygen enhances the combustion process. At 100% load, CO2 emission for KOME-ORG + M20 + FIF + ZPCS is 68% less compared to KOME. The combination also reduces NO and smoke by 48% and 51% compared to KOME at 100% load. The combined effect of FIF, ZPCS and methanol aided in the simultaneous reduction of NO, smoke and CO2 emission. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In order to reduce the blindness in developing a new skeletal mechanism, a chaos genetic algorithm (CGA) is proposed for optimizing the progress of reaction rates adjustment against traditional manual operator. By this way, an optimized mechanism has been generated from a skeletal mechanism including 112 species and 498 reactions, which was reduced from a detailed mechanism consisting of 3299 species and 10806 reactions. CGA is composed by important reactions determination, fitness function building, and chaos genetic compilation. To test the applicability of the optimized biodiesel skeletal mechanism, it has been validated by 0-D ignition delay prediction and 3-D engine simulation and experiment data. Results indicate that the ignition delay error of the optimized mechanism is smaller than the skeletal mechanism by comparing with the detailed mechanism. The optimized mechanism can simulate MD and MD9D ignition behavior over a wide range of common conditions. The 3-D engine prediction results also indicated that the optimized mechanism can better present the in-cylinder combustion characteristics. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sophorolipid biosurfactants have shown promise in remediation of oil-contaminated environments. This study investigated the potential application of sophorolipid biosurfactants for enhanced dispersion of weathered biodiesel, diesel, and light crude oil-contaminated water under salinities (0, 10, 20, and 30 ppt), temperatures (8, 22, and 35°C), and pH (6-8) using bench-scale experiments. Solutions of oil-artificial seawater-sophorolipid were prepared, shaken, solvent extracted, and analyzed. Sophorolipid biosurfactants reduced the surface tension of seawater (30 ppt) to 34 mN/m with a critical micelle concentration of 38 mg/L. Results of dispersion experiments showed that oil dispersion significantly increased as the sophorolipid concentrations increased so that the biodiesel, diesel, and light crude oil dispersion in seawater was enhanced 27, 16, and 12%, respectively, by 80 mg/L of sophorolipid. Salinity, mixing, and temperature influenced the oil dispersion, but pH had the least effect on the oil dispersion. Oil dispersion was because of the decreases in the surface and interfacial tensions and encapsulation of oil droplets in micelles. This study suggests that sophorolipid has the properties to enhance oil dispersion in seawater under the examined laboratory conditions. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Life cycle environmental impacts of a product or process may be global and/or spatially-explicit, such as land use change (LUC) and LUC greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Life cycle optimization (LCO) usually does not account for these impacts. However, for a product or process to be truly sustainable, they must be considered. We integrate computable general equilibrium (CGE)-based LUC modeling and LCO to create a novel multiobjective CGE-LUC-LCO framework to account for global environmental impacts and production costs. The framework is then applied to case studies on life cycle GHG emissions throughout the bioethanol life cycle, considering regional and global agricultural practices, land use, technological impacts, and global economic forces. The framework considers emissions from feedstock production, transportation, direct/indirect processing emissions, end use, and LUC. The model allows for selection of 16 bioethanol production pathways from 5 feedstocks, and 3 case studies with US and EU bioethanol demands are examined. The methodology identifies cleaner production strategies by considering global, spatially-explicit life cycle environmental impacts like LUC and LUC GHG emissions for the first time in LCO. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, we report for the first time the use of Li-LSX-zeolite as catalyst for the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass (Isochrysis sp. Microalgae). Li-LSX-zeolite showed a good catalytic performance, principally for bio-oil denitrogenation (mainly in form of NH3), and good activity for olefins and aromatics production. At 500 °C, 11.8% aromatics and 23.1% aliphatics were produced. The increase of temperature led to transfer of C to the gas phase, coke formation on the catalyst surface and decrease in N-compounds in the bio-oil. The increase of the catalyst to biomass ratio from 0 to 3:1 resulted in the aromatics being five-fold those non-catalytically obtained and in a higher cracking power that reduced the bio-oil to 23% at expenses of olefins rich gas. However, a linear correlation between coke formation and aromatic yield was observed as the catalyst to microalgae ratio was increased. Therefore, the experimental results indicate that Li-LSX-zeolite could be used as catalyst for in-situ denitrogenation of microalgae bio-oil and for enhancing aliphatics and aromatics formation to be blend in gasoline and diesel and olefins in gas phase. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A set of fixed-bed biomass pyrolysis reactor incorporated with three-stage condensation columns was constructed in this study, and the effects of pyrolysis temperature, carrier gas flow rate and condensation temperature on biomass pyrolysis products were discussed systematically. Results show that as the pyrolysis temperature increased, the yield of liquid products initially increased with a maximum yield at 550 °C and then decreased. When the temperatures of the three-stage condensers were 110 °C, 0 °C, and −196 °C, the highest yields of bio-oil in each condenser were accordingly obtained at 550 °C, 450 °C, and 500 °C, respectively. Carrier gas flow rate and fractional condensation temperature indicated minimal influence on the total yield of liquid products. However, fractional condensation temperature had an obvious effect on the yields of the fractions. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed that the first fraction contained abundant phenolic compounds, the second fraction contained medium-boiling compounds with relatively high concentrations of water, acids, and ketones and the last fraction contained a minimal amount of hydrocarbons and water. Furthermore, higher pyrolysis temperature resulted in a higher yield of phenol products, whereas higher condensation temperature led to a higher concentration of phenols and dehydrated carbohydrates. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An alternative to the sugar/starch-based crops bioethanol is lignocellulosic biomass, but its utilization to biofuels is still not economically viable. In this context, an increasing interest has arising on the search for specific energy crops that do not require arable lands and are not water intensive, such as Jerusalem artichoke (JA). So, this work consisted on the cultivation of JA on those agricultural conditions and its further evaluation as a sustainable feedstock towards bioethanol. Two strategies of producing bioethanol were evaluated pointing out for the consolidated bioprocessing with the Zygosaccharomyces bailii Talf1 yeast as the best approach for further scale-up, based on energy data analysis and ethanol productivity. Different industrial scenarios were outlined and compared for overall CO2eq emissions and energy consumption per liter of ethanol (LEtOH), using adequate criteria on a cradle-to-gate approach. With no land-use change, no biogenic and no co-products credits, the comparison of the overall energy consumption and CO2eq emissions (100% process) from JA ethanol (9 MJ/LEtOH; 679 g CO2/LEtOH) with sugarcane/sugar beet ethanol (42/29 MJ/LEtOH; 731/735 g CO2/LEtOH) and with gasoline refinery (15 MJ/LEtOH eq; 1154 g CO2/LEtOH eq), highlights the JA as an alternative feedstock to be a focus of ethanol research for gasoline blends. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, non-edible seed oil namely raw neem oil was converted into biodiesel using transesterification process. In the experimentation, two biodiesel blends were prepared namely B25 (25% neem oil methyl ester with 75% of diesel) and B50 (50% neem oil methyl ester with 50% diesel). Urea-based selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technique with catalytic converter (CC) was fixed in the exhaust tail pipe of the engine for the reduction of engine exhaust emissions. Initially, the engine was operated with diesel as a working fluid and followed by refilling of biodiesel blends B25 and B50 to obtain the baseline readings without SCR and CC. Then, the same procedure was repeated with SCR and CC technique for emission reduction measurement in diesel, B25 and B50 sample. The experimental results revealed that the B25 blend showed higher break thermal efficiency (BTE) and exhaust gas temperature (EGT) with lower break-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) than B50 blend at all loads. On comparing with biodiesel blends, diesel experiences increased BTE of 31.9% with reduced BSFC of 0.29 kg/kWh at full load. A notable emission reduction was noticed for all test fuels in SCR and CC setup. At full load, B25 showed lower carbon monoxide (CO) of 0.09% volume, hydrocarbon (HC) of 24 ppm, and smoke of 14 HSU and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) of 735 ppm than diesel and B50 in SCR and CC setup. On the whole, the engine with SCR and CC setup showed better performance and emission characteristics than standard engine operation. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - We previously engineered Escherichia coli to overproduce medium- to long-chain saturated and monounsaturated methyl ketones, which could potentially be applied as diesel fuel blending agents or in the flavor and fragrance industry. Recent efforts at strain optimization have focused on cofactor balance, as fatty acid-derived pathways face the systematic metabolic challenge of net NADPH consumption (in large part, resulting from the key fatty acid biosynthetic enzyme FabG [β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase]) and net NADH production. In this study, we attempted to mitigate cofactor imbalance by heterologously expressing NADH-dependent, rather than NADPH-dependent, versions of FabG identified in previous studies. Of the four NADH-dependent versions of FabG tested in our previously best-reported methyl ketone-producing strain (EGS1895), the version from Acholeplasma laidlawii (Al_FabG) showed the greatest increase in methyl ketone yield in shake flasks (35–75% higher than for an RFP negative-control strain, depending on sugar loading). An improved strain (EGS2920) attained methyl ketone titers during fed-batch fermentation of 5.4 ± 0.5 g/L, which were, on average, ca. 40% greater than those for the base strain (EGS1895) under fermentation conditions optimized in this study. Shotgun proteomic data for strains EGS2920 and EGS1895 during fed-batch fermentation were consistent with the goal of alleviating NADPH limitation through expression of Al_FabG. For example, relative to strain EGS1895, strain EGS2920 significantly upregulated glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (directing flux into glycolysis rather than the NADPH-producing pentose phosphate pathway) and downregulated MaeB (a NADP+-dependent malate dehydrogenase). Overall, the results suggest that heterologous expression of NADH-dependent FabG in E. coli may improve sustained production of fatty acid-derived renewable fuels and chemicals. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This paper quantifies the impacts of commodity price uncertainty and major renewable energy policies on the economic feasibility of cellulosic biorefineries. Four nth plant cellulosic biorefinery scenarios are developed via techno-economic analysis to calculate 20-year net present value (NPV) probability distributions and probabilities of default. While individual policy scenarios are unable to make the pathway scenarios economically feasible in the form of positive median 20-year NPVs and low probabilities of default, combinations of policy scenarios that reflect the existing operating environment are able to do so. This result is seemingly incongruous with the large cellulosic biofuel production shortfall that currently exists in the United States but a pioneer plant analysis finds that current policies are unable to make ‘first-of-their-kind’ cellulosic biorefineries economically feasible. The results of the pioneer plant analysis suggest that additional policy support is needed if cellulosic biorefineries are to overcome the pioneer plant hurdle. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - The present work explores the use of argemone mexicana (non-edible and adulterer to mustard oil) biodiesel in multicylinder compression ignition, indirect injection engine. Argemone Mexicana biodiesel was produced by transesterification process and the important physico-chemical properties of various blends were investigated. Blends of diesel/biodiesel (AB10, AB20, AB30 and AB40) were prepared and used for analysing the engine performance and emission characteristics at varying loads (0, 25, 50 and 75%) and speeds (2500–4000 r/min). The results show improvement in indicated thermal efficiency and indicated specific fuel consumption with increased proportion of biodiesel in diesel, when compared to conventional diesel. In addition, exhaust emissions such as carbon monoxide, unburnt hydrocarbon and smoke opacity were significantly reduced by AOME/diesel blends. The improvement in engine performance and exhaust emissions were observed up to 30% blending of AOME/diesel. Beyond that, higher blend (AB40) showed deterioration in performance characteristics in contrast to AB30 but still better as compared to conventional diesel. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Nanozeolites with different crystallographic structures (Nano/TS1, Nano/GIS, Nano/LTA, Nano/BEA, Nano/X, and Nano-X/Ni), functionalized with (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS) and crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (GA), were studied as solid supports for Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL) immobilization. Physicochemical characterizations of the surface-functionalized nanozeolites and nanozeolite-enzyme complexes were performed using XRD, SEM, AFM, ATR-FTIR, and zeta potential measurements. The experimental enzymatic activity results indicated that the nanozeolitic supports functionalized with APTMS and GA immobilized larger amounts of enzymes and provided higher enzymatic activities, compared to unfunctionalized supports. Correlations were observed among the nanozeolite surface charges, the enzyme immobilization efficiencies, and the biocatalyst activities. The catalytic performance and reusability of these enzyme-nanozeolite complexes were evaluated in the ethanolysis transesterification of microalgae oil to fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs). TLL immobilized on the nanozeolite supports functionalized with APTMS and GA provided the most efficient biocatalysis, with FAEEs yields above 93% and stability during five reaction cycles. Lower FAEEs yields and poorer catalytic stability were found for nanozeolite-enzyme complexes prepared only by physical adsorption. The findings indicated the viability of designing highly efficient biocatalysts for biofuel production by means of chemical modulation of nanozeolite surfaces. The high biocatalyst catalytic efficiency observed in ethanolysis reactions using a lipid feedstock that does not compete with food production is an advantage that should encourage the industrial application of these biocatalysts. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study analyzed the financial feasibility of catalytic hydrothermolysis (CH) aviation biofuel technology. Three feedstocks were assessed: brown grease (rendered from grease trap waste), yellow grease (rendered from used cooking oil), and carinata oil. Since the technology carries risk, a stochastic analysis was conducted, which resulted in a distribution of net present values (NPVs) and breakeven prices. The breakeven price was the price of jet fuel per gallon that made the NPV equal to zero. A scenario where fuel price grew over time and a scenario where fuel price did not grow were both analyzed. Four plant scenarios were analyzed: 1. pioneer brownfield, 2. Nth brownfield, 3. pioneer greenfield, 4. Nth greenfield. Brown grease was the most promising feedstock scenario, in terms of financial feasibility. Breakeven prices in each feedstock scenario were lowest in the brownfield nth plant scenario, and highest in the greenfield pioneer plant scenario. Across the four plant scenarios and two fuel price growth scenarios, mean breakeven prices ranged from $2.02 to $2.83/gal in the brown grease scenario, $2.82 to $3.81/gal in the yellow grease scenario, and $3.90 to $5.66/gal in the carinata oil scenario. With the addition of RINs and LCFS credits, the probability of loss was as low as 0.0%, 18.9%, and 74.6% in the brown grease, yellow grease, and carinata oil scenarios, respectively. However, without RIN or LCFS credits, the process was not found to be financially viable. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - In this study, the effect of blending pentanol to biodiesel derived from mahua oil on emissions and performance pattern of a diesel engine under exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) mode was examined and compared with diesel. The purpose of this study is to improve the feasibility of employing biofuels as a potential alternative in an unmodified diesel engine. Two pentanol-biodiesel blends denoted as MOBD90P10 and MOBD80P20 which matches to 10 and 20 vol% of pentanol in biodiesel, respectively, were used as fuel in research engine at 10 and 20% EGR rates. Pentanol is chosen as a higher alcohol owing to its improved in-built properties than the other first-generation alcohols such as ethanol or methanol. Experimental results show that the pentanol and biodiesel blends (MOBD90P10 and MOBD80P20) have slightly higher brake thermal efficiency (0.2–0.4%) and lower brake-specific fuel consumption (0.6 to 1.1%) than that of neat biodiesel (MOBD100) at all engine loads. Nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission and smoke emission are reduced by 3.3–3.9 and 5.1–6.4% for pentanol and biodiesel blends compared to neat biodiesel. Introduction of pentanol to biodiesel reduces the unburned hydrocarbon (2.1–3.6%) and carbon monoxide emissions (3.1–4.2%) considerably. In addition, at 20% EGR rate, smoke, NOX emissions, and BTE drop by 7.8, 5.1, and 4.4% respectively. However, CO, HC emissions, and BSFC increased by 2.1, 2.8, and 3.8%, respectively, when compared to 0% EGR rate. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biofuel supply chain design plays a critical role in facilitating the large-scale substitution of biofuel for traditional fossil fuels with a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner towards sustainability. This paper proposes a multiobjective optimization model for a 4-layer biofuel supply chain network using mixed integer nonlinear programming while considering the benefits from economic, environmental, and societal aspects. The model can be used either to optimize an existing biofuel supply chain network or to guide the construction of a new biofuel supply chain network. The profit, the greenhouse gas emissions in transportation, and the market share of biofuel were set as targets for optimization. The selection of the participators at each layer, and the amount of the material flow between each pair of selected supplier and customer located at two adjacent layers were modeled as decision variables. The conventional weighted aggregation method was used to unify 3 objectives after normalization. Particle swarm optimization was used to solve this high-dimension multiobjective problem to obtain a near optimal solution. A numerical case study based on the state of Missouri in the United States was implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results of the case study illustrate that the benefits in terms of transportation emission, profit, and market share can be achieved simultaneously. Using the equal weights configuration in conventional weighted aggregation as an example, a 21% reduction of the transportation emission, a 33% increase of the profit, and a 2% augmentation of the market share were achieved compared to the benchmark scenario.

AB  - 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) has been considered as a potential biofuel candidate for the renewable feedstock and attractive properties. In this study, the spherically propagating flames of the MTHF/isooctane-air mixtures in different blending ratios were investigated at elevated temperatures and pressures over equivalence ratios of 0.8–1.5 in a constant volume chamber using high-speed photography technique. Laminar burning velocities were calculated through nonlinear method and correlated by mixing rules as a function of initial temperature, pressure, equivalence ratio, and blending ratio. To investigate the influence of the potential interaction between MTHF and isooctane, a detailed model was established by merging the models of the two fuels and validated against laminar burning velocity, ignition delay times and flame structure. The laminar flame velocities of MTHF were observed to increase with initial temperature while the flame velocities decrease with increase in pressure. Kinetic analysis indicates that the major consumption pathways for MTHF are through H abstraction reactions at 2 and 5 sites. The H abstraction reactions at methyl group are less competitive. Unsaturated hydrocarbons and aldehydes are produced in high concentration and are the main stable intermediates of MTHF combustion. The laminar burning velocity is sensitive to the reactions of small radicals and some intermediates such as propylene and ethylene. The laminar burning velocities of MTHF/isooctane blends increase with MTHF blending ratio. The influence of blending ratio on laminar burning velocity should attribute to the chemical factors, rather than thermal or diffusion factors. MTHF oxidation generates less proportion of propylene and higher fractions of H, OH than isooctane, reflecting positive chemical effects on laminar burning velocity as MTHF blended. According to the instability analysis, the Markstein length and critical radius shows similar flame instability among different blending ratios. © 2017 The Combustion Institute

AB  - Decanoic acid is a valuable compound used as precursor for industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and biofuels. Despite efforts to produce it from renewables, only limited achievements have been reported. Here, we report an engineered cell factory able to produce decanoic acid as a major product from glycerol, and abundant and renewable feedstock. We exploit the overlapping chain-length specificity of β-oxidation reversal (r-BOX) and thioesterase enzymes to selectively generate decanoic acid. This was achieved by selecting r-BOX enzymes that support the synthesis of acyl-CoA of up to 10 carbons (thiolase BktB and enoyl-CoA reductase EgTER) and a thioesterase that exhibited high activity toward decanoyl-CoA and longer-chain acyl-CoAs (FadM). Combined chromosomal and episomal expression of r-BOX core enzymes such as enoyl-CoA reductase and thiolase (in the presence of E. coli thioesterase FadM) increased titer and yield of decanoic acid, respectively. The carbon flux toward decanoic acid was substantially increased by the use of an organic overlay, which decreased its intracellular accumulation and presumably increased its concentration gradient across cell membrane, suggesting that decanoic acid transport to the extracellular medium might be a major bottleneck. When cultivated in the presence of a n-dodecane overlay, the final engineered strain produced 2.1 g/L of decanoic acid with a yield of 0.1 g/g glycerol. Collectively, our data suggests that r-BOX can be used as a platform to selectively produce decanoic acid and its derivatives at high yield, titer and productivity. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - A series of carbonaceous solid acid catalysts were prepared by facile carbonization and sulfonation of biorenewable feedstocks (i.e., glucose, sucrose, starch and cellulose), and employed for directly converting carbohydrates in ethanol medium to synthesize 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF). The carbonization temperature of cellulose and starch (500 °C) was required to be higher than that of glucose and sucrose (400 °C) to realize high –SO3H density and EMF yield. Based on rich exploitability of cellulose and good activity of its derived carbonaceous catalyst, magnetic cellulose-derived carbonaceous solid acid (MCC-SO3H) was subsequently synthesized, which possessed a porous structure with BET surface area of 35.34 m2 g–1, high –SO3H density (1.28 mmol g–1) and sufficient magnetism for separation (1.99 emu g–1). By optimizing the process variables, a maximum EMF yield of 63.2% could be achieved from fructose at 120 °C, and ethyl levulinate formation was favored at elevated temperature. The MCC-SO3H catalyst could be readily separated from the reaction mixture by an external magnet with recovery rate of 92.6% after six successive runs, and reused repeatedly with little deactivation. Besides, this catalyst was efficient for the one-pot transformation of fructose-based polysaccharides into EMF, affording yields of 51.3% and 32.5% from inulin and sucrose, respectively. With glucose as the substrate, instead ethyl glucoside with a high yield of 86.5% was obtained. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

The partial molar excess Gibbs energies ΔG1E,∞, enthalpies ΔH1E,∞ and entropies ΔS1E,∞ at infinite dilution were calculated from the experimental γ13∞ values obtained over the temperature range. The selectivities and capacities at infinite dilution for water/butan-1-ol separation problem were calculated from the γ13∞ and compared to the literature values for other ionic liquids. High selectivity was obtained in comparison to other ionic liquids. Butanol is considered as possible biofuel. This alcohol is produced by fermentation and it must be separated from the aqueous fermentation broth. The values of KL were used to determine the linear free energy relationship (LFER) system constants as a function of temperature.

AB  - The waste resulted from fish processing industries are discarded into the environment around the world, causing environmental pollution. The main problem of fish oil extracted from waste is the high content in free fatty acids (FFA) which decrease the yield in fatty acids esters during transesterification reactions. Therefore, to correct the fish-oil properties, a new environmentally friendly heterogeneous superacid catalyst (SO4 2−/SnO2-ZrO2) was tested in the esterification reaction of FFA with ethanol. The catalyst was characterized by different techniques (XRD, FT-IR, FT-IR of adsorbed pyridine, BET, SEM-EDX, TGA and acidity measurements). The reaction was found to follow a Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L-H) dual-site mechanism with the novelty that both Brönsted and Lewis acid centers participate equally in the esterification reaction. The pre-treated oil was subjected to transesterification reaction with ethanol over a heterogeneous base catalyst and then, the saturated and unsaturated fractions of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) were separated using a vacuum rectification unit with falling film. The saturated content can be used as biofuel, while the unsaturated FAEE are further transesterified with glycerol in order to obtain oil with high content in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). A detailed study of the intrinsic kinetic process at the surface of the superacid catalyst and a thorough mathematical model of the fixed bed reactor were written and validated by an experimental program, designed according to the D-optimal methodology. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Plant seed oil-based liquid transportation fuels (i.e., biodiesel and green diesel) have tremendous potential as environmentally, economically and technologically feasible alternatives to petroleum-derived fuels. Due to their nutritional and industrial importance, one of the major objectives is to increase the seed yield and oil production of oilseed crops via biotechnological approaches. Camelina sativa, an emerging oilseed crop, has been proposed as an ideal crop for biodiesel and bioproduct applications. Further increase in seed oil yield by increasing the flux of carbon from increased photosynthesis into triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis will make this crop more profitable. To increase the oil yield, we engineered Camelina by co-expressing the Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. diacylglycerol acyltransferase1 (DGAT1) and a yeast cytosolic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD1) genes under the control of seed-specific promoters. Plants co-expressing DGAT1 and GPD1 exhibited up to 13% higher seed oil content and up to 52% increase in seed mass compared to wild-type plants. Further, DGAT1- and GDP1-co-expressing lines showed significantly higher seed and oil yields on a dry weight basis than the wild-type controls or plants expressing DGAT1 and GPD1 alone. The oil harvest index (g oil per g total dry matter) for DGTA1- and GPD1-co-expressing lines was almost twofold higher as compared to wild type and the lines expressing DGAT1 and GPD1 alone. Therefore, combining the overexpression of TAG biosynthetic genes, DGAT1 and GPD1, appears to be a positive strategy to achieve a synergistic effect on the flux through the TAG synthesis pathway, and thereby further increase the oil yield. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Aviation alternative fuel originated from sustainable raw materials should meet a set of safety requirements and must show the same physicochemical properties to mineral kerosene. The production of a short-chain esters enriched biofuel using molecular distillation of FAME obtained from babassu oil was assessed. Operational conditions were assessed to obtain high mass yields and high ester content in the carbon chain length range of kerosene. A fuel with properties close to those of aviation biofuels was obtained at 140°C. At this temperature, more than 80% of the esters in the product composition were within the desired range and there was a mass recovery higher than 88%. The short-chain esters enriched biofuel was blended with fossil kerosene at different concentrations. The effects of the gradual addition of this biofuel stream to commercial aviation kerosene were considered. A mixture up to 6% g/g accomplished the specification limits established by ASTM D1655.

AB  - Biodiesel industrial effluent rich in crude glycerol (CG) was processed to produce value-added product. Under continuous culture system, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain CD16 immobilized within its biofilm, produced 3.2 L H2/day/L feed, over a period of 60 days at a hydraulic retention time of 2 days. The effective H2 yield by B. amyloliquefaciens strain CD16 was 165 L/L CG. This H2 yield was 1.18-fold higher than that observed with non-biofilm forming Bacillus thuringiensis strain EGU45. Bioprocessing of the effluent released after this stage, by recycling it up to 25% did not have any adverse effect on H2 production by strain EGU45; however, a 25% reduction in yield was recorded with strain CD16. Biofilm forming H2 producers thus proved effective as self-immobilizing system leading to enhanced process efficiency. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the environmental impacts of omega-3 fatty acid (n-3), high protein feed and biofuel production from algae to the impacts of the production of those products from fish. Methods: The functional unit was the production of one metric ton of omega-3 fatty acids from algae (fish) and the accompanying co-products of biofuel and high protein feed. This was a cradle to gate LCA. Four scenarios were used in this model. The algae multiproduct model (MPM) scenario was the baseline using only unit operations currently in use at the reference facility (Cellana LLC). A low-energy centrifuge replaced the existing conventional centrifuge (MPM (LE)) to reduce energy consumption. The MPM was improved in a different manner, employing membrane filtration prior to centrifugation (MPM (MF)). These three scenarios were compared to the conventional production of the same products from fish (conventional product model: CPM). This life cycle assessment investigated the following impacts: ozone depletion potential, global warming potential, smog formation potential, acidification potential, and eutrophication potential. Results and discussion: The environmental impacts of producing omega-3 fatty acids from algae were higher than producing omega-3 fatty acids from fish if membrane filtration was not used. Membrane filtration reduced most of the environmental impacts of the algae system by more than 50%. Fuel consumption was the only factor that caused the fish systems to change by greater than 10% from the baseline. Productivity, membrane filtration electricity, and annual operating days could each affect the environmental impacts of the algae system by greater than 10% from the baseline. Improvements to the algae system depend on improvements to cultivation and harvesting, with the impacts from processing being very small. Conclusions: This study presented results comparing the environmental impacts from a multiproduct system from algae and from fish. The results of this study can serve as a benchmark for the environmental impacts of an algal multiproduct biorefinery compared to the conventional production of those same products from fish. Areas of improvement have been identified for the algae production system for dewatering and cultivation. The amount of n-3 had little impact on the n-3 market but had a significant effect on the existing algal n-3 market. The amount of fuel and feed produced had a negligible effect on both markets. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Experimental investigation was conducted on the influence of the presence of alkali compounds such as K and Na present in biofuels on catalytic behaviors of a commercial diesel oxidation catalyst (Pt/Pd/Al2O3) in the monolith form. Doping of different alkali metal components on carrots of monolith was performed. These carrots were physicochemically characterized, and the catalytic tests consisted of series of temperature-programmed surface reactions with representative exhaust gas mixtures from diesel combustion. The aim of the present study is to reveal the effect of the alkali metal on overall catalytic activity of diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) and more particularly to show their influence on the reactions involving CO, hydrocarbons, NO, and NO2. Potassium and sodium lead to different catalytic properties. A promotion effect was found in the presence of K, whereas an inhibiting effect was evidenced in the presence of Na or when both Na and K were doped onto the DOC. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - This paper presents the recent development of low temperature, fuel cells having high efficiency with better environmental performance leading towards an excellent potential as a future source of energy for all category vehicles. Electrolyte materials in the fuel cell functioning at low temperature (700°C) undergo interfacial reactions with adjoining cell components after continuous and extended operation. The Problem is that the present fuels are not renewable biofuels and their burning results a net increase of CO₂ accumulation in the atmosphere accompanied by toxic by-products. It’s aims at an experimental investigation of hydrogen blending by deployment of an Oxy-Hydrogen (HHO) booster in a two wheeler, which involves production of hydrogen from distilled water and blending it with air-fuel mixture through carburetor for improvements. Mileage test has been conducted at 1500 rpm and variations in performance like mechanical, volumetric, thermal efficiencies and emission characteristics due to deployment of HHO booster have been investigated. © TJPRC Pvt.

AB  - There is a major issue worldwide on the level of contamination caused by emissions of I. C. Engines that debilitate the issues concerning the high cost of raw petroleum. This has prompted an alternative for diesel engine. The pursuit has been centered on vegetable oil due to its sustainable source from agribusiness and the way that it is richly accessible and uniformly circulated everywhere throughout the world. One of such vegetable oil sources is "Fluted Pumpkin plant" ("Telfairia Occidentalis Hook F.") which is from the cucurbit case family and is described by its thick and enlarged fruit size. It is a creeper vegetative shrub that spreads low over the ground and has expansive lobed leaves and tendrils. Generally, the oil from pumpkin seeds can be extracted in a mechanical extractor utilizing "normal hexane" as solvent and transesterified to get bio fuel whose fuel properties can be assessed following the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) techniques for biodiesel. The biodiesel thus obtained can likewise be utilized in different blends with the petroleum diesel in Four stroke naturally aspirated Diesel Engines. Phytosterols present in the pumpkin seed oil are likewise being considered for their part in bringing down cholesterol levels. The pumpkin seeds (oil and cake) can be profitable as additives in a variety of applications, since they give a decent wellspring of protein, and are rich in antioxidants, which can help prevent cancer; they are high in "monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids". At the point when pumpkin seed oil is expelled from the seed, a by-product in the form of "pumpkin seed cake” is produced. Pumpkin seeds basically comprise of protein and fat giving a concentrated source of energy. The current work involves extraction of biofuel from pumpkin seeds and blending it with the diesel at different constituent percentage of 10, 20, 30 and 40, followed by evaluation of the characteristics. The results clearly infer that the blending of the bio diesel with the petroleum diesel will vary the properties such as Flash Point, Fire Point, Viscosity and Calorific Value which may have further effect on the performance characteristics of “Internal combustion engines”. © TJPRC Pvt.

AB  - Biodiesel is considered an important renewable energy source but still there is some controversy about its environmental toxicity, especially to aquatic life. In our study, the toxicity of water soluble fraction of biodiesel was evaluated in relatively low concentrations using a battery of bioassays: Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition, Sinapis alba root growth inhibition, Daphnia magna immobilization, boar semen live/dead ratio and DNA fragmentation and Unio pictorum micronucleus test. While the S. alba test indicated nutritive (stimulating) effect of the sample, the biodiesel exerted toxic effect in the aquatic tests. D. magna was the most sensitive with EC50 value of 0.0226%. For genotoxicity assessment, the mussel micronucleus test (MNT) was applied, detecting considerable genotoxic potential of the biodiesel sample: it elucidated micronuclei formation already at low concentration of 3.3%. Although this test has never been employed in biodiesel eco/genotoxicity assessments, it seems a promising tool, based on its appropriate sensitivity, and representativity. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper evaluates the financial outlays and environmental costs of using biofuel and traditional aviation fuel for selected flight routes. Cost-benefit analysis and the dose-response method were applied for evaluating the financial and environmental costs of both biofuels and traditional fuel. Selected flight routes originating from Taipei were used for empirical analysis, for the purpose of comparing the use of different fuels in monetary terms. The use of biofuel leads to a considerable increase in fuel purchase price; however, it results in fewer negative environmental impacts compared with the use of the traditional aviation fuel. The empirical results and sensitivity analysis show that the reduction in environmental costs will only outweigh the additional purchase cost of biofuel if the unit environmental social costs of pollutants are considered to be very high. The potential incentives for the use of biofuel in commercial flights could come from some form of government measures that internalize externalities, or from a reduction in biofuel price (e.g. through subsidy) or an increase in traditional fuel price (e.g. through tax). The environmental benefit of using biofuel in commercial flights, estimated in monetary terms and compared with its extra financial cost, provide good reference for policy makers when implementing policies and incentives for the development of biofuels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production and use of transportation fuels can lead to sustainability impacts. Assessing them simultaneously in a holistic way is a challenge. This paper examines methodology for assessing the sustainability performance of products in a more integrated way, including a broad range of social impacts. Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) methodology is applied for this assessment. LSCA often constitutes of the integration of results from social LCA (S-LCA), environmental life cycle assessment (E-LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC). In this study, an S-LCA from an earlier project is extended with a positive social aspect, as well as refined and detailed. E-LCA and LCC results are built from LCA database and literature. Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methodology is applied to integrate the results from the three different assessments into an LCSA. The weighting of key sustainability dimensions in the MCDA is performed in different ways, where the sustainability dimensions are prioritized differently priority based on the assumed values of different stakeholder profiles (Egalitarian, Hierarchist, and Individualist). The developed methodology is tested on selected biomass based and fossil transportation fuels - ethanol produced from Brazilian sugarcane and US corn/maize, and petrol produced from Russian and Nigerian crude oils, where it delineates differences in sustainability performance between products assessed. The outcome in terms of relative ranking of the transportation fuel chains based on sustainability performance differs when applying different decision-maker profiles. This result highlights and supports views that there is no one single answer regarding which of the alternatives that is most sustainable. Rather, it depends strongly upon the worldview and values held by the decision maker. A key conclusion is that sustainability assessments should pay more attention to potential differences in underlying values held by key stakeholders in relevant societal contexts. The LCSA methodology still faces challenges regarding results integration but MCDA in combination with stakeholder profiles appears to be a useful approach to build on further. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Climate changes induced by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (mainly carbon dioxide) is one of the major threats of the modern era. Primary causes are the high reliance on fossil fuels for power generation, transportation, manufacturing and the intensive land usage (deforestation). The current share of renewable biofuel production in the overall fuel demand has been found insufficient to replace fossil fuels. Microalgae can deliver a sustainable and complementary biofuel platform with some important advantages. This review aims to offer a state-of-the art review of algal biomass conversion methods into various biofuel products, including biodiesel, syngas, biogas, bioethanol. Emerging more sustainable biofuel/bioenergy production technologies are highlighted. Attention is also paid to sustainable cultivation methods, including wastewater treatment and bioremediation to capture CO2 and fix nitrogen and phosphorus, produced from industrial, agricultural and municipal sources. Finally, a light is shed on the important role of algae metabolic engineering. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effects of a paraffinic biofuel (farnesane) obtained from sugar cane, a gas to liquid (GTL) fuel, and a biodiesel fuel on performance and emissions of a light duty engine were evaluated. Similar engine performance is obtained with all fuels maintaining the default electronic control unit (ECU) configuration. Clear reductions in total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions were observed with all alternative fuels, and, comparing both paraffinic fuels, farnesane was more beneficial. Reductions were also obtained with these fuels in particle emissions, with the exception of the mode G, which is not an operating mode included in the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), where particle number concentration of paraffinic fuels was higher compared with diesel and biodiesel fuels. This behavior could be explained by the nonoptimization of ECU at this engine work condition. The benefits in terms of pollutant emission obtained with farnesane make it a potential biofuel for use in diesel engines. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Naphthalene as a fuel additive to ethanol was examined in a swirl combustor with the objective to obtain efficient burning and ultra-low emissions using different heating value fuels. Naphthalene is a polyaromatic compound often regarded as a waste fuel that results in high levels of pollutants emission. The effectiveness of naphthalene as a fuel additive to ethanol on NO and CO emissions and stability was determined. The naphthalene concentration was varied from 0 to 0.4 mol/L in ethanol, corresponding to a heating value increase of 8.8% on a volumetric basis (or 5.7% on mass basis). Emissions data were reported for Colorless Distributed Combustion (CDC) using N2/CO2 dilution, at equivalence ratios (Φ) of 0.9 and 0.7. The data under normal fuel–air combustion conditions also reported, clearly showing the benefits of CDC. NO and CO emission below 1 and 6 ppm, respectively, were achieved under CDC conditions for each of the naphthalene-ethanol fuels examined. The results at both the equivalence ratios showed lower NO emission with increase in naphthalene concentration, which provided higher heating value fuel mixture. The CO emission was also low and remained negligibly unchanged with change in naphthalene concentration and equivalence ratio. The results show the use of naphthalene addition to ethanol for increased heating value fuel with ultra-low emissions and higher stability under distributed combustion conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study was focused on detailed exergoeconomic analysis of a single cylinder DI diesel engine fueled with diesel/biodiesel blend (B5) emulsified with water at different concentrations, i.e., 3, 5, and 7 wt%. Aqueous cerium oxide nanoparticles were also used at two levels (0 and 90 ppm) as a combustion improver. The combustion experiments were conducted under four engine loads in the range of 25–100% of full load condition at a fixed engine speed of 1000 rpm. More specifically, this study was carried out to find the most thermodynamically and economically favorable fuel compositions and engine operating loads. Overall, engine load had a significant effect on the exergoeconomic variables, while fuel type only affected some exergoeconomic parameters. The cost per unit of exergy for the shaft work exergy was considerably decreased by elevating engine load for all the fuel blends investigated. The lowest cost per unit of exergy for the shaft work was determined at 48.81 USD/MJ for neat diesel at full load condition. Although B5W3m was found to be an exergetically and environmentally efficient fuel compared with the other blends, neat diesel was the most exergoeconomically attractive fuel as revealed throughout this study. This meant that one-dimensional criteria solely based on the conventional exergy analysis cannot be used as perfect decision-making paradigms on the efficiency and productivity of internal combustion engines. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To evaluate the performance and emissions of a test engine fueled by biodiesel blends produced from fish processing by-products, the experimental and simulation methods were used to investigate the effects of injection pressure and timing on engine operation and correlation of these effects with varying fish-oil concentrations in the biodiesel blends. Consequently, commercial diesel fuel blended with different concentrations of fish-oil biodiesel including B0, B10, B20, B30, B40 and B50 (corresponding to 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% of biodiesel in blend) were used for the test engine. Compared to B0, the average reduction in brake power of the biodiesel fuels was reduced proportionally with the biodiesel ratio in the fuel blends. The brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and NOx emissions increased together with a reduction in soot, HC and CO emissions as the percentage of biodiesel increases. Moreover, the engine characteristics depend on operating parameters such as injection timing and injection pressure as also mentioned in many previous studies. When increasing injection timing, the brake power initially increases until reaching a maximum value and then decreases slightly for all types of fuels tested. Meanwhile, the effect of injection pressure differs depending on the pressure range and biodiesel blends. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We present a framework that allows us to utilize high-resolution spatial data to design biomass-to-fuel supply chains. Specifically, we first present how to extract crop data from the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project packages, and then develop a method to combine these data with a historical cropland data layer, to generate spatial data with user-specified resolution. Next, we develop a general approach to determine the potential depot and biorefinery locations, and calculate the actual flow path distance between facilities using Geographic Information Systems methods. Since spatially explicit data lead to large-scale supply chain networks, we develop preprocessing algorithms that allow us to remove arcs that will never be used in an optimal solution, thereby reducing the size of the network under consideration. We then present a multi-period mixed-integer linear programming model that accounts for the selection of depot and biorefinery locations and their capacities, shipping and inventory planning, as well as the selection of pretreatment and conversion technologies, and transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate the application of our framework using a case study of corn stover-to-ethanol supply chain in Wisconsin. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - In this study, Jatropha oil was catalytically cracked using Co(NO3)2 and Mn(NO3)2 as heterogeneous catalysts at different ratios of 0.5%–3% to obtain different grades of biofuel. The physical and fuel properties of the obtained biofuels were characterized by measuring the following properties: density, viscosity, specific gravity, pour point, flash and fire points, cetane number, carbon and ash residues and sulfur content. The determined properties were located within the limits of the specific standards of ASTM specifications. The type of transition metal and the ratio of the used catalysts were greatly affect the physical and fuel properties of the obtained biofuels. Comparing the reactivity of (Co(NO3)2 and Mn(NO3)2) as catalytic cracking catalysts revealed that Co(NO3)2 is more reactive than Mn(NO3)2. Using of low catalysts ratio produced biofuel comparable to biodiesel according to ASTM specifications; while higher catalyst ratio produced biofuel comparable to bio-gasoline. Lighter fractions of the biofuel in the range of gasoline were produced at higher catalysts ratios and the optimum concentration was 3%. The reactivity of the two salts was discussed based on their electronic configurations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - PVT, saturated liquid density and two-phase (vapor-pressure) properties of one of the main component of the biofuel (methyl palmitate), produced from a soybean, have been measured. One-phase PVT measurements were made for ten liquid and four vapor isochores between (85.2 and 811.7) kg·m−3over the temperatures range from (300 to 443) K using a constant-volume piezometer technique. The vapor-pressures (PS,TS) of the methyl palmitate were measured in the temperature range from (300 to 501) K. The combined expanded uncertainty of the density, ρ pressure, P, and temperature, T, measurements at 95% confidence level with a coverage factor of k = 2 is estimated to be 0.1%, (0.15–0.5)% depending on temperature and pressure ranges, and 15 mK, respectively. We have critically assessed all of the reported density data at atmospheric pressure and at high-pressures and vapor-pressures together with the present results for their internal thermodynamic consistence to carefully select primary data to fit reference correlations for ρ0(T) and vapor-pressure PS(T). The measurements were concentrated in the two-phase region to accurately determine vapor-pressures and in the immediate vicinity of the phase-transition temperatures to precisely determine the phase boundary properties (PS,TS,ρS) on the liquid + gas equilibrium curve. The liquid-gas phase transition temperatures (TS) for seven liquid isochores of (711.9, 766.8, 774.5, 782.3, 795.00, 803.40, and 811.70) kg·m−3were accurately obtained using the isochoric (P-T) break point technique. The measured values of the vapor-pressures and saturated liquid densities were fitted to Wagner-type vapor-pressure equation and complete scaling model, respectively. The values of the critical parameters (PC,TC,ρC) were estimated using vapor-pressure and liquid-gas coexistence curve data. The correlation for the density at atmospheric pressure, ρ0(T), together with the present and reported high-pressure density measurements (ρ,P,T) were used to develop two-parametric (c and B) and theoretically based Tait-type equation of state. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic cracking of Swida wilsoniana oil over non-catalyst and various Cu-modified ZSM-5 catalysts doped with different concentration of Cu (0, 5, 10, 20 and 30 wt%) was studied. The physicochemical properties of the prepared catalysts were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) analysis. Results showed that the introduction of Cu did not change the crystalline structure of ZSM-5 and CuO might deposit on the surface or inside the pores. The numbers of ZSM-5 total acidic sites were increased after it was loaded with 5 wt% and 10 wt% concentration of Cu. The overall hydrocarbon biofuels yields obtained from Cu-modified ZSM-5 catalysts were improved relative to parent ZSM-5. Determination of composition of the hydrocarbon biofuels showed that the hydrocarbon fractions were the main components produced. The optimum Cu concentration used for ZSM-5 modification was 10 wt%, which obtained the highest hydrocarbon biofuels yield (68.20 wt%) and percentage of hydrocarbon fractions content (89.07 wt%). The reuse of Cu-modified ZSM-5 catalysts results showed acceptable levels of reusability after three times regeneration. In addition, the physical properties of the Cu-modified ZSM-5 catalysts produced hydrocarbon biofuels were improved compared to non-catalytic cracking of S. wilsoniana oil. This work showed that the newly developed 10 wt% concentration Cu-modified ZSM-5 was an efficient catalyst for cracking of S. wilsoniana oil for the production of hydrocarbon biofuels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The need for renewable and cleaner sources of energy has made biofuels an interesting alternative to fossil fuels, especially in the case of butanol isomers, with its favorable blend properties and low hygroscopicity. Although C4 alcohols are prospective fuels, some key reactions governing their pyrolysis and combustion have not been adequately studied, leading to incomplete kinetic models. Enols are important intermediates in the combustion of C4 alcohols, as well as in atmospheric processes. Butanol reactions kinetics is poorly understood. Specifically, the unimolecular tautomerism of propen-2-ol ↔ acetone, which is included in butanol combustion kinetic models, is assigned rate parameters based on the tautomerism vinyl alcohol ↔ acetaldehyde as an analogy. In an attempt to update current kinetic models for tert- and 2-butanol, a theoretical kinetic study of the titled reaction was carried out by means of CCSD(T,FULL)/aug-cc-pVTZ//CCSD(T)/6-31+G(d,p) ab initio calculations, with multistructural torsional anharmonicity and variational transition state theory considerations in a wide temperature and pressure range (200-3000 K; 0.1-108 kPa). Results differ from vinyl alcohol ↔ acetaldehyde analogue reaction, which shows lower rate constant values. It was observed that decreasing pressure leads to a decrease in rate constants, describing the expected falloff behavior. Tunneling turned out to be important, especially at low temperatures. Accordingly, pyrolysis simulations in a batch reactor for tert- and 2-butanol with computed rate constants showed important differences in comparison with previous results, such as larger acetone yield and quicker propen-2-ol consumption. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The n-butanol fuel, as a renewable and clean biofuel, could ease the energy crisis and decrease the harmful emissions. As another clean and renewable energy, hydrogen properly offset the high HC emissions and the insufficient of dynamic property of pure n-butanol fuel in SI engines, because of the high diffusion coefficient, high adiabatic flame velocity and low heat value. Hydrogen direct injection not only avoids backfire and lower intake efficiency but also promotes to form in-cylinder stratified mixture, which is helpful to enhance combustion and reduce emissions. This experimental study focused on the combustion and emissions characteristics of a hydrogen direct injection stratified n-butanol engine. Three different hydrogen addition fractions (0%, 2.5%, 5%) were used under five different spark timing (10°,15°,20°,25°,30° CA BTDC). Engine speed and excess air ratio stabled at 1500 rpm and 1.2 respectively. The direct injection timing of the hydrogen was optimized to form a beter stratified mixture. The obtained results demonstrated that brake power and brake thermal efficiency are increased by addition hydrogen directly injected. The BSFC is decreased with the addition of hydrogen. The peak cylinder pressure and the instantaneous heat release rate raises with the increase of the hydrogen addition fraction. In addition, the HC and CO emissions drop while the NOx emissions sharply rise with the addition of hydrogen. As a whole, with hydrogen direct injection, the power and fuel economy performance of n-butanol engine are markedly improved, harmful emissions are partly decreased. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The California Regional Multisector Air Quality Emissions (CA-REMARQUE) model is developed to predict changes to criteria pollutant emissions inventories in California in response to sophisticated emissions control programs implemented to achieve deep greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions. Two scenarios for the year 2050 act as the starting point for calculations: a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario and an 80 % GHG reduction (GHG-Step) scenario. Each of these scenarios was developed with an energy economic model to optimize costs across the entire California economy and so they include changes in activity, fuels, and technology across economic sectors. Separate algorithms are developed to estimate emissions of criteria pollutants (or their precursors) that are consistent with the future GHG scenarios for the following economic sectors: (i) on-road, (ii) rail and off-road, (iii) marine and aviation, (iv) residential and commercial, (v) electricity generation, and (vi) biorefineries. Properly accounting for new technologies involving electrification, biofuels, and hydrogen plays a central role in these calculations. Critically, criteria pollutant emissions do not decrease uniformly across all sectors of the economy. Emissions of certain criteria pollutants (or their precursors) increase in some sectors as part of the overall optimization within each of the scenarios. This produces nonuniform changes to criteria pollutant emissions in close proximity to heavily populated regions when viewed at 4 km spatial resolution with implications for exposure to air pollution for those populations. As a further complication, changing fuels and technology also modify the composition of reactive organic gas emissions and the size and composition of particulate matter emissions. This is most notably apparent through a comparison of emissions reductions for different size fractions of primary particulate matter. Primary PM2.5 emissions decrease by 4 % in the GHG-Step scenario vs. the BAU scenario while corresponding primary PM0.1 emissions decrease by 36 %. Ultrafine particles (PM0.1) are an emerging pollutant of concern expected to impact public health in future scenarios. The complexity of this situation illustrates the need for realistic treatment of criteria pollutant emissions inventories linked to GHG emissions policies designed for fully developed countries and states with strict existing environmental regulations. © Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Biomass has emerged as an abundant and relatively low cost carbon resource alternative to fossil fuel resources in the sustainable production of specialty chemicals and biofuel. Levulinic acid is an attractive platform chemical. Upgrading of levulinic acid produces levulinate esters, which serve as a transportation fuel and fuel additive. The present review focuses on the development of sustainable conversion of biomass into levulinic acid and levulinate esters via ionic liquids dual solvent-catalysts. The synthesis routes of levulinic acid and levulinate esters and the corresponding ionic liquids are introduced. The biomass pretreament, as well as the conversions of lignocellulosic biomass and their derivatives into levulinic acid and levulinate esters, are detailed in relation to the catalytic role, properties, and performance of acidic ionic liquids. Finally, the operating conditions affecting the ionic liquids catalytic conversions are discussed as part of a comprehensive review of this topic. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Sustainable future fuels are likely to be produced by a wide range of processes, and there exists the opportunity to engineer these fuels so that they burn more efficiently and produce fewer harmful emissions. Such potential is especially important within the context of reducing the emissions of both greenhouse gases (GHG) and toxic pollutants that adversely impact air quality and human health. To illustrate how fuel design on a molecular level may be exploited to reduce these emissions, the combustion and emission properties of three potential future fuels, geraniol, diethyl carbonate, and a biodiesel (soy methyl ester), were evaluated along with a fossil diesel. The fuels were assessed using "smoke point" tests and a Stirling engine. The purpose of the demonstration was to highlight to a general audience several burning characteristics of some possible future fuels, and thus the potential for the development of clean burning "designer" fuels. During the 15 min demonstration, significant differences in the combustion properties of the different fuels were shown. For example, the conventional fossil diesel fuel produced a significant amount of soot in flame tests, whereas diethyl carbonate, which is a potential second-generation biofuel, produced visibly lower amounts of soot. © 2017 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc..

AB  - Our planet has been experiencing abrupt climate changes in recent years. The major contributor to this phenomenon is, without doubt, emissions of gases derived from petroleum-based fuels, compared to their high consumption, especially diesel and gasoline. In Brazil, the sum of all motorized trips shows that more than half of them (60%) is based on public transport, with buses carrying 94% of all those who use this service. These vehicles, in their vast majority, use the technology of Compression Ignition (CI) engines. On the other hand, studies have shown that the country has a high biofuel production potential from various sources, such as landfills and hydroelectric plants, with an extensive production of biogas and hydrogen, that can be used, for example, in Spark Ignition (SI) engines. Nevertheless, SI engines have lower efficiency than CI engines. Part load operation of SI engines is conventionally achieved by the use of a throttle to control the airflow or air-fuel mixture into the engine. When operating at partial load the throttle causes exergy losses what affecting on decreasing engine efficiency. With the objective of analysing the emission of pollutants and the efficiency of conversion of fuel chemical energy, this work presents an analysis on the use of blends of hydrogen (H2), biogas (BIO60) and methane (BIO95) using an SI engine. The system was operated in partial load and the addition of H2 was an attempt to increase efficiency by reducing the pumping work through the throttle, once it was possible increasing the lambda value. The tests were performed at different ignition angles and air/fuel ratio. The value of ignition advance angle has been adjusted to obtain maximum Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE) of the engine. It was possible to recognize that the addition of H2 allowed the combustion limits to be extended. On the other hand, reduced values of CO and NOx emissions could be achieved. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - In this work, the biofuel target compound 2-ethyl-5,5-dimethylcyclopenta-1,3-diene (1) and its exo isomers (9a and 9b), were successfully synthesized via two different pathways from the common intermediate 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-2-ene-1-one (2). The first pathway produced the endocyclic product as a pure isomer via a triflate intermediate obtained from ketone 2 in 60% yield, followed by copper-catalyzed coupling with ethyl magnesium bromide in 63% yield. The second pathway employed a Grignard reaction with ketone 2, which generated an alcohol that was immediately subjected to mild acid-catalyzed elimination to yield primarily a mixture of exo isomers 9a and 9b in 46% yield. The preparation method developed by this work allowed for the production of a sufficient quantity of these targets to evaluate their fuel properties, which will be reported in a separate study. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study is concerned with comparing raw dairy wastewater (DWW) with blue-green medium (BG11 medium) for biofuel production. Three microalgae strains (Chlorella sp., Scenedesmus sp., and Chlorella zofingiensis) were cultured in tubular bubble column photobioreactors with two media separately. After 8 days of cultivation, DWW was demonstrated to be more suitable medium for microalgae biomass and lipid production than BG11 medium. The biomass and lipid produced within wastewater provided suitable feedstocks for anaerobic digestion and biodiesel conversion. Nutrients in wastewater were efficiently removed (>90% total nitrogen removal, approximately 100% ammonia removal, and >85% total phosphorus removal) during this process. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Bioethanol for use in vehicles is becoming a substantial part of global energy infrastructure because it is renewable and some emissions are reduced. CO emissions and total hydrocarbons (THC) are reduced, but there is still controversy regarding emissions of NOx, aldehydes, and ethanol. The amount of emissions depends on the ethanol content, but it also may depend on the engine quality and ethanol origin. Thus, a photochemical chamber was used to study secondary gas and aerosol formation from two flex-fueled vehicles using different ethanol blends in gasoline. One vehicle and the fuel used were made in the United States, and the others were made in Brazil. Primary emissions of THC, CO, CO2, and nonmethane hydrocarbons from both vehicles decreased as the amount of ethanol in gasoline increased. NOxemissions in the US and Brazilian cars decreased with ethanol content. However, emissions of THC, CO, and NOxfrom the Brazilian car were markedly higher than those from the US car, showing high variability between vehicle technologies. Results indicate that using higher ethanol blends may have a positive impact on air quality.

AB  - Background: In this study, a two-step processing method (hydrothermal liquefaction followed by catalytic upgrading) was used to produce upgraded bio-oil. A comprehensive screening analysis of algal species, including four microalgae and four macroalgae, was conducted to bridge the gap between previous accounts of microalgae and macroalgae hydrothermal liquefaction and the upgrading process of the resulting crude bio-oils. Results: Hydrothermal liquefaction using eight algal biomasses was performed at 350 °C for 1 h. The microalgae always produced a higher crude bio-oil yield than the macroalgae due to their high lipid content, among which Schizochytrium limacinum provided the maximum crude bio-oil yield of 54.42 wt%. For microalgae, higher amounts of N in the biomass resulted in higher amounts of N in the crude bio-oil; however, contrary results were observed for the macroalgae. The crude bio-oils generated from both the microalgae and macroalgae were characterized as having a high viscosity, total acid number, and heteroatom content, and they were influenced by the biochemical compositions of the feedstocks. Next, all eight-crude bio-oils were treated at 400 °C for 2 h with 10 wt% Ru/C using tetralin as the hydrogen donor. The hydrogen source was provided after tetralin was transformed to naphthalene. All the upgraded bio-oils had higher energy densities and significantly lower N, O, and S contents and viscosities than their corresponding crude bio-oils. However, the H/C molar ratio of the upgraded bio-oils decreased due to the absence of external hydrogen relative to the crude bio-oils. The S content of the upgraded bio-oil produced from upgrading the Schizochytrium limacinum crude bio-oil was even close to the 50 ppm requirement of China IV diesel. Conclusions: Microalgae are better feedstocks than macroalgae for liquid fuel production. Biochemical components have a significant impact on the yield and composition of crude bio-oil. Tetralin does not perform as well as external hydrogen for controlling coke formation. The S content of the upgraded bio-oil can be reduced to 76 ppm for the crude bio-oil produced from Schizochytrium limacinum. Upgraded bio-oils have similar properties to those of naphtha and jet fuel. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Fatty acid and its derivatives have recently received considerable interest as a possible precursor for producing renewable hydrocarbon. Compared to the traditional hydrotreating method that consumes a significant amount of H2, this study developed a hydrothermal catalytic deoxygenation approach that produced hydrocarbon from fatty acids and bio-oil with in situ self-sustaining H2. The presence of H2O played a critical role in the generation of in situ H2 via enhancing water-gas shift and reforming reactions, thus promoting fatty acid decarbonylation and increased paraffin yields. Both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (stearic acid (SA) and oleic acid (OA)) were employed as model compounds, where 100% conversion was achieved with 63.59% paraffin yield from SA and 47% n-paraffin yield from OA. By investigating the reaction pathway, fatty acid and glycerol reforming, and water-gas shift reactions, were determined to be the major reactions for the in situ H2 generation. Decarbonylation was found as the major route for fatty acid and bio-oil deoxygenation. Fatty acid reforming and hydrogenoloysis reactions were found as the major reactions for producing short-chain hydrocarbons (C8-C16). We previously developed a sequential hydrothermal liquefaction method to produce bio-oil from yeast biomass. In this study, the produced bio-oil was also tested, where 100 wt % bio-oil conversion and 55.17 wt % of liquid n-paraffin yield were achieved at 320 °C. This study demonstrates that this hydrothermal catalytic process is a promising approach for producing liquid paraffin (C8-C15) from fatty acid and bio-oil under the conditions of no H2 supply. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biobutanol is an attractive, economical, and sustainable alternative fuel to petroleum oil which are depleting in sources due to the diminishing oil reserves and creating an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Alternative routes to sustainable bacterial fermentation for the production of biobutanol are being sought and prepared for commercialization. The challenges for implementing an economically competitive fermentation process for biobutanol production include the availability of cheaper feedstock by improvement toward large-scaled production, improvement of fermentation efficiency, and better strategies for solvent recovery. The development of biobutanol production was analyzed and various methods to increase the fermentative butanol production were discussed in detail. It was found that the implementations of metabolic engineering of the Clostridia sp., advanced fermentation techniques, and utilization of renewed substrates are among the potential and economically viable technology in the production butanol production. Besides, this review outlines several challenges and potential future work for the advancement of fermentative butanol production. © 2018 by ASME.

AB  - The Renewable Fuel Standard mandates large increases in U.S. biofuel consumption and is implemented using tradable compliance credits known as RINs. In early 2013, RIN prices soared, causing the regulator to propose reducing future mandates. We estimate empirically the effect of three "policy shocks" that reduced the expected mandates in 2013. We find that the largest of these shocks decreased the value of the fuel industry's 2013 compliance obligation by $7 billion. We then study the effects of the shocks on commodity markets and the market value of publicly-traded biofuel firms. Results show that the burden of the mandate reductions fell primarily on advanced biofuel firms and commodity markets of the marginal compliance biofuel. We argue that the policy shocks reduced the incentive to invest in the technologies required to meet the future objectives of the RFS, and discuss alternative policy designs to address the problems that arose in 2013. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Among the fossil fuels, diesel has the major share in petroleum product consumption. Diesel demand in Iran has increasingly grown due to the low price of diesel, a high subsidy, and an unsuitable consumption pattern. During 2006-2007, this growth imposed 2.2 billion liters of imports, which were equivalent to 7.5% of diesel production in 2007 and cost about $1.2 billion. Therefore, the government implemented fuel rationing in 2007 and a targeted subsidy law in 2010. These projects have not gained effective control of consumption due to the wide gap between the international diesel price and the domestic price. Diesel import after the implementation of fuel rationing and the targeted subsidy law in 2011 imposed 3.6 billion liters of import and cost about $2.2 billion. Therefore, the government will need fundamental strategies and policies to face and control the negative impact on the economy and the environment. Third generation fuels, biofuels, as another supplementary approach seems to have the capability to reduce the petroleum requirement. This paper investigates the potential of biodiesel as diesel alternative fuel from oil seeds and microalgae in Iran along with evaluating the policy for reducing diesel consumption. Dunaliella salina as an indigenous green microalga isolated from the Maharlu Salt Lake was cultivated in an integration of an airlift system and a raceway pond (IARWP) to prove microalgal potentials in Iran. Additionally, the natural culture medium from the Maharlu Salt Lake was utilized for Dunaliella salina in order to commercialize and reduce cultivation cost. Compared to oilseeds, microalgae because of their high lipid content have much potential to solve a fuel consumption problem. This paper found that only 21 percent of cultivable land is needed to replace the diesel currently consumed in Iran with microalgal biodiesel. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Water, energy, and food are essential elements for human life, but face constant pressure resulting from economic development, climate change, and other global processes. Predictions of rapid economic growth, increasing population, and urbanization in the coming decades point to rapidly increasing demand for all three. In this context, improved management of the interactions among water, energy, and food requires an integrated “nexus” approach. This paper focuses on a specific nexus case: biogas generated from organic waste, a renewable source of energy created in livestock production, which can have water-quality impacts if waste enters water bodies. An innovative model is presented to make biogas and biomethane systems feasible, termed “biogas condominiums” (based on collective action given that small- and medium-scale farms on their own cannot afford the necessary investments). Based on the “farm to fuel” concept, animal waste and manure are converted into electrical and thermal energy, biofuel for transportation, and high-quality biofertilizer. This nexus approach provides multiple economic, environmental, and social benefits in both rural and urban areas, including reduction of ground and surface water pollution, decrease of fossil fuels dependence, and mitigation of greenhouse gases emissions, among others. The research finds that biogas condominiums create benefits for the whole biogas supply chain, which includes farmers, agroindustry, input providers, and local communities. The study estimated that biomethane potential in Brazil could substitute the country's entire diesel and gasoline imports as well as 44% of the total diesel demand. In the United States, biomethane potential can meet 16% of diesel demand and significantly diversify the energy matrix. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This work presents a study on the surface tension, density and wetting behaviour of distilled glycerol, technical grade glycerol and the matter organic non-glycerin fraction. The research was conducted to expand the knowledge about the physical properties of wastes from the rapeseed oil biofuel production. The results show that the densities of technical grade glycerol (1.300 g cm-3) and distilled glycerol (1.267 g cm-3) did not differ and were significantly lower than the density of the matter organic non-glycerin fraction (1.579 g cm-3). Furthermore, the surface tension of distilled glycerol (49.6 mN m-1) was significantly higher than the matter organic non-glycerin fraction (32.7 mN m-1) and technical grade glycerol (29.5 mN m-1). As a result, both technical grade glycerol and the matter organic non-glycerin fraction had lower contact angles than distilled glycerol. The examined physical properties of distilled glycerol were found to be very close to that of the commercially available pure glycerol. The results suggest that technical grade glycerol may have potential application in the production of glycerol/fuel blends or biosurfactants. The presented results indicate that surface tension measurements are more useful when examining the quality of biofuel wastes than is density determination, as they allow for a more accurate analysis of the effects of impurities on the physical properties of the biofuel by-products. © 2018 Siemowit Muszyński, published by Sciendo 2018.

AB  - Negative emission (NE) technologies are recognized to play an increasingly relevant role in strategies limiting mean global warming to 1.5 °C as specified in the Paris Agreement. The potentially significant contribution of pyrogenic carbon capture and storage (PyCCS) is, however, highly underrepresented in the discussion. In this study, we conduct the first quantitative assessment of the global potential of PyCCS as a NE technology based on biomass plantations. Using a process-based biosphere model, we calculate the land use change required to reach specific climate mitigation goals while observing biodiversity protection guardrails. We consider NE targets of 100-300 GtC following socioeconomic pathways consistent with a mean global warming of 1.5 °C as well as the option of additional carbon balancing required in case of failure or delay of decarbonization measures. The technological opportunities of PyCCS are represented by three tracks accounting for the sequestration of different pyrolysis products: Biochar (as soil amendment), bio-oil (pumped into geological storages) and permanent-pyrogas (capture and storage of CO2 from gas combustion). In addition, we analyse how the gain in land induced by biochar-mediated yield increases on tropical cropland may reduce the pressure on land. Our results show that meeting the 1.5 °C goal through mitigation strategies including large-scale NE with plantation-based PyCCS may require conversion of natural vegetation to biomass plantations in the order of 133-3280 Mha globally, depending on the applied technology and the NE demand. Advancing towards additional bio-oil sequestration reduces land demand considerably by potentially up to 60%, while the benefits from yield increases account for another 3%-38% reduction (equalling 82-362 Mha). However, when mitigation commitments are increased by high balancing claims, even the most advanced PyCCS technologies and biochar-mediated co-benefits cannot compensate for delayed action towards phasing-out fossil fuels. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Pollutant emission from motorcycles in Vietnam where is among the countries with the highest number of motorcycles is very serious problem. From the beginning of 2018, biogasoline E5 will be officially distributed nationwide, and in the next stage, biogasoline E10 will be used in 2019 to replace the as-used fossil gasoline. This work presents the results of empirical research about engine performance, and emission characteristics as using biogasoline E10 for the most popular motorcycle Honda Wave RX110 in Vietnam. As showed results, there are the increases in engine power, thermal efficiency, NOx and CO2 emissions, otherwise, the reduction of fuel consumption, CO emission, HC emission in comparison with E5 and fossil gasoline-RON95 are reported. This study result is the proof of confirmation about the benefits of in-using biogasoline, diversification of fuel sources and reduction of environmental pollution. © IJENS.

AB  - In our present investigation oil is extracted from the Cotton seeds with the help of Expeller machine. Obtained oil is transesterified with Methanol as reagent and Potassium Hydroxide as catalyst and biofuel solution has been formed. This biofuel is further treated to remove the glycerol content. This biofuel is blended with diesel in B5 B10 B20 B30 proportions and fuelled into single cylinder diesel engine and performance has been verified by taking D100(Diesel) as the base reference. We found B10 blend to the optimum and this blend is added with Dimethyl Carbonate and once again the performance has been verified. We identified a reasonable change in the parameters and the obtained results suggest that Cotton seed oil added with DMC can be used as an alternative fuel. © IAEME Publication

AB  - Identifying a suitable microalga, which has the attributes of optimal growth characteristics, preferable biofuel profile and high-value product accumulation capability, is necessary for a feasible microalgal cultivation process. In this regard, the objective of this present study comes under the topic called phyco-prospecting, which is identification of appropriate microalgae for a specified task. With this, the aim of the study is to molecularly identify an interest of organism to conduct outdoor cultivation, biomass production and biofuel evaluation. Concerning this, environmental samples were collected from a dry lake at summer time to isolate thermophilic microalgae using traditional isolation techniques. The isolated microalgae was identified as species of Coelastrella based on 18 s rRNA gene analysis, and tested specifically for its thermo-tolerant competency at an outdoor pilot scale cultivation facility. Based on the desirable growth performance of the species, it was further cultivated in series of bubble column reactors aerated at a higher rate of 4.4 vv−1 m−1 of 0.04%, 1.5% and 5% CO2 (vv−1) enriched air. Improved growth was observed in 1.5% CO2 aeration, whereas slightly inhibited growth was found biomass productivity, and produced 3.5 g L−1 of dry biomass from 0.05 g L−1 of initial concentration within 9 days of cultivation. The biomasses had ~18% (ww−1) of total lipids, and the fatty acid profile of lipids shows higher presence of C18:1, which is desirable for biodiesel conversion. The energy content biomass was about 21 MJ kg−1, and the reddish pigment accumulation characteristic of the species was considered as beneficial. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Contaminants are increasing in the aquatic ecosystem due to the development of industrial and agricultural activities. Contaminants include organic pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and endocrine-disrupting compounds, which accumulate in the ecosystem’s primary producers and propagate through the food chain. The total lipid contents and fatty acid profiles in the marine macroalgae Pterocladia capillacea, Ulva lactuca and Sargassum hornschuchii proved to be a good bioindicator to assess contamination levels. The lowest value of the total lipid content was 1.90% obtained in S. hornschuchii under the bisphenol treatment, while the highest value was 4.66% obtained in U. lactuca under exposed to clofibric acid. The fatty acid methyl ester profiles were analysed by using gas chromatography. The total fatty acids varied from 5.85% (U. lactuca after exposure to bisphenol) to 28.38% (P. capillacea treated with clofibric acid). The ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids was significantly higher in U. lactuca after exposure to acetyl salicylic acid than in the other macroalgae under different treatments. © 2017, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - To quantitatively convert biomass into value-added chemicals or biofuels is still a great challenge. Herein, we develop an efficient electrochemical method to convert the biomass-derived valeric acid into ethers (butyl methyl ether and butyraldehyde dimethyl acetal) or esters (methyl valerate) on boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode in methanol solution. The products distribution was well controlled by tuning the supporting electrolyte and the KOH amount. 98.7% selectivity and ca. 58% Faraday efficiency for ethers and 96% selectivity for esters were achieved by optimizing the supporting electrolytes, initial molar ratio of VA to KOH, VA feed concentration and anodic potential. Strong alkali as supporting electrolyte, high VA feed concentration and initial VA/KOH=1 (mol/mol) favoured the formation of ether products. Fatty acid methyl esters were high-selectively ( &gt; 96%) produced by using NaClO4 as the supporting electrolyte and/or adding excessive KOH (initial KOH/VA ratio beyond 2:1). Moreover, partially replacing methanol with ethanol, only one new diether (1,1-diethoxybutane) was formed. A rational mechanism of synthetic butyraldehyde dimethyl acetal via electrocatalytic decarboxylation, rearrangement of carbenium ion, Aldol reaction on BDD in alcohols solution was developed. This strategy may provide a new direction for renewable chemicals and fuels from biomass. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - The influence of microalgae speciation and biomass composition on the recovery of biogas and nutrients from the AD of lipid-extracted microalgae was studied. BatchADof lipid-extracted Chlorella vulgaris, a model freshwater microalgae, and lipid-extracted Cyclotella sp, a model marine diatomic microalgae with a high silica composition, resulted in similar 30-d biogas yields. However, biogas production rates varied significantly between species with lipid-extracted Cyclotella producing 79%-1% of its biogas within the first 5-d compared to 49%-1% for Cyclotella. In addition, microalgae speciation and composition significantly influenced nutrient recovery with an average N2 recovery of 46%-9% for lipid extracted Cyclotella, while a negligible N2 recovery was observed for lipid-extracted Chlorella. Interestingly, for phosphate, the opposite trend occurred with an average phosphorus recovery of 78%-14% for lipid-extracted Chlorella and a negative phosphorus recovery from lipid-extracted Cyclotella, possibly due to its high salt content, which can result in the precipitation of phosphorus-containing salts. Thus, unlike biogas yields, nutrient recovery appears to be highly sensitive to microalgae speciation and composition.

AB  - A new integrated process of biofuel production is introduced and analyzed. This process consists of lignocellulosic biomass fast pyrolysis, gasification, electrical power generation and latest bio-oil upgrading in biorefinery processes. Upgrading processes include hydrotreating, distillation, hydrocracking and steam reforming units. Biomass is converted to bio-oil, gas and bio-char through fast pyrolysis which is then used in biorefinery and gasification. Simulation results show that 1 kg/s hybrid poplar biomass generate about 0.68 kg/s bio-oil, 0.16 kg/s gas and 0.17 kg/s char. Also 5.62 MW electrical power can be gained from the steam cycle. The excess heat of gasification can be used as a part of the required heat source in the process. Moreover the produced syngas is used in the steam reforming unit to provide the required hydrogen in the refinery. In addition, by heat integration the consumption of hot and cold utilities decreased and consequently the process performance improved. The obtained results show that synthetic biofuel yield is about 0.49 wt% and 0.51 wt% gasoline/diesel blendstocks. Moreover economic analysis, sensitivity analysis was also done to study the effects of major operating parameters, i.e., steam reforming temperature, steam/carbon ratio of gasification and greenhouse gas emission, on the process performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative fuel that has been used for partial or total substitution of diesel to reduce its environmental impacts. In Brazil, the main industrial technique used to produce biodiesel is via transesterification of soybean oil with methanol under sodium methoxide as a homogenous catalyst. Some studies on this topic have focused on improving the cold properties of biodiesel for use in cold climate countries. This research focused on the comparison of the cold properties of the biofuel produced from the transesterification of soybean oil with different alcohols. The alcohols used vary according to the size of the carbon chain and its nature: methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, isoamyl and benzyl alcohol. The chemical composition of the esters formed were studied by means of 1H NMR, HPLC, FTIR, sodium and sulphur content. The 1H NMR spectra showed that only the methyl and ethyl esters reached the minimum value of ester content established for the international specifications for biodiesel. Despite the greater difficulty in removing the excess of the reactant alcohol at the end of the reaction and having an ester content above requirements, the esters obtained from the alcohol isopropyl and isoamyl presented the best results in terms of their cold properties. However, the presence of the benzyl in the structure of the ester did not show any change in its CFPP, compared to the respective methyl ester. In addition to the cold properties, studies of some other physicochemical properties have also been made to show the maintenance of international specifications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Currently, there are mainly two pathways of the biodiesel production from wastewater sludge including 1) directly extracting the lipid in sludge and then converting the lipid to biodiesel through trans-esterification, and 2) employing sludge as medium to cultivate oleaginous microorganism to accumulate lipid and then transferring the lipid to biodiesel. So far, the study was still in research stage and its cost feasibility was not yet investigated. In this study, biodiesel production from wastewater sludge was designed and the cost was estimated with SuperPro Designer. With consideration of converting the lipid in raw sludge to biodiesel, the unit production cost was 0.67 US $/kg biodiesel (0.59 US $/L biodiesel). When the sludge was used as medium to grow oleaginous microorganism to accumulate lipid for producing biodiesel, the unit production cost was 1.08 US $/kg biodiesel (0.94 US $/L biodiesel). The study showed that sludge has great potential in biodiesel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgal biofuel has the potential to address two major global issues; 1) fulfill the rising energy demand of the world and 2) mitigate the increasing global warming by CO2 sequestration. Botryococcus braunii is a unique alga producing high hydrocarbon contents which can be hydrocracked into high quality fuel. However, there is a lack of interest on the use of B. braunii for biofuel production due to its slow growth rate, an influencing parameter in determining the economics of conventional algal fuel production process. Non-destructive extraction (milking) of B. braunii hydrocarbons is a process which enables the alga to reproduce the hydrocarbons reducing the requirement of fast growth of this alga for biofuel production. This study targets to establish a techno-economics of B. braunii milking to analyze its potential for the renewable hydrocarbon production. The minimum sales price (MSP) to achieve a 10% rate of return was estimated to be US$3.20 L−1 of B. braunii hydrocarbons for the base case scenario. The extraction efficiency and the hydrocarbon contents were found to be the major economy drivers of the process as a result of the additional sensitivity analysis performed to identify the most economic influencing parameters. The MSP has the potential of significant reduction (down to US$1.45 L−1) if a B. braunii with higher hydrocarbon contents is identified as long as the selected strain is suitable for milking and the higher non-destructive extraction efficiency is achieved. A resource assessment comparison was also made to evaluate the significance of the repetitive extraction versus the single extraction. The milking has the clear advantage over the conventional single extraction regarding resource consumption and the cost of the process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - During downstream operations involved in the purification of hydrophobic biofuels produced by microorganisms, undesired stable emulsions may be formed. Understanding the mechanisms behind this stability is a pre-requisite for designing cost-effective strategies to break these emulsions. In this work, we aimed at increasing our knowledge on the mechanisms responsible for stabilizing yeast-containing oil-in-water emulsions. For this purpose, emulsions containing hexadecane and different yeast-based aqueous phases were prepared and analyzed for phase separation, surface charge density, particle size, and rheology. First, we observed that compounds present in fresh tablet baker’s yeast contribute to emulsion stability. In order to eliminate this effect, we generated stocks with this yeast in the laboratory, and compared its performance with an industrial fuel ethanol strain, namely Saccharomyces cerevisiae PE-2. We confirmed that the presence of yeast cells enhances emulsion stability. The cultivation medium (complex or defined) in which cells are grown, as well as the physiological state of the cells (pre- or post-diauxic), prior to emulsion preparation, influenced emulsion stability. The smaller cell size of tablet yeast probably also contributes to more stable emulsions, when compared to those prepared with yeast cells grown in the laboratory. Baker’s and fuel ethanol yeast cells in post-diauxic phase promote the formation of more stable emulsions than those with cells in the pre-diauxic physiological state. Finally, we propose a mechanism to explain the enhanced emulsion stability due to the presence of yeast cells, with electrostatic repulsion between emulsion droplets having the prevailing effect. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Continuous transesterification of linseed oil was examined in order to maximize the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) yield. The continuous process was conducted in a packed bed reactor using calcium oxide as a heterogeneous catalyst. In addition, the impact of three variables, namely the molar ratio of diethyl ether (DEE) to methanol, the molar ratio of methanol to oil and the flow rate (ml/min), on the FAMEs yield were studied. The effectiveness of DEE will reveal after comparing transesterification yield in the presence and absence of the co-solvent. The optimum conditions for in continuous method were reported as follows: a molar ratio of DEE to methanol of 1.19:1, a molar ratio of methanol to oil of 9.48:1, a flow rate of 1.37 ml/min, and temperature of 30 °C. Under the optimum conditions, a FAMEs yield of 98.08% was achieved. All the properties such as flash point, pour point, cloud point, and viscosity of the biodiesel from linseed oil were measured by the related specific standards. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To investigate the effect of biofuel properties on RCCI combustion and emissions, the experimental study was conducted on a single-cylinder diesel engine. Three low reactivity oxygenated biofuels, i.e. n-butanol, 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) and ethanol were injected in the intake port and biodiesel was directly injected into the cylinder to realize RCCI operation. Results show that the heat releases are changed from two-stage to single-peak with the increase of EGR rates. Biodiesel/ethanol presents 1 °CA longer ignition delay than the others, which indicates latent heat has significant effect on ignition delay. Under different injection timings, the trends of combustion and emissions are similar for three RCCI modes, meantime, biodiesel/ethanol shows greater potential on reducing NOx and soot emissions simultaneously (soot<0.3 FSN and NOx<1.5 g/kWh at SOI of −8 °CA ATDC) and biodiesel/n-butanol presents the highest ITE of 47.5%, and shows remarkable advantages on improving indicated thermal efficiency of RCCI combustion. Employing 80% fraction of biofuels by port injection results in lower soot emissions (below 0.3 FSN) and higher CO and HC emissions than neat biodiesel, but relatively high cetane number of n-butanol limits the maximum applying fraction. The increase of load highlights the differences on combustion and emissions among three RCCI modes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Modern vehicles equipped with Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engine have emerged as an important source of particulate emissions potentially harmful to human health. We collected and characterized gasoline exhaust particles (GEPs) produced by neat gasoline fuel (E0) and its blends with 15% ethanol (E15), 25% n-butanol (n-But25) and 25% isobutanol (i-But25). To study the toxic effects of organic compounds extracted from GEPs, we analyzed gene expression profiles in human lung BEAS-2B cells. Despite the lowest GEP mass, n-But25 extract contained the highest concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), while i-But25 extract the lowest. Gene expression analysis identified activation of the DNA damage response and other subsequent events (cell cycle arrest, modulation of extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis) following 4 h exposure to all GEP extracts. The i-But25 extract induced the most distinctive gene expression pattern particularly after 24 h exposure. Whereas E0, E15 and n-But25 extract treatments resulted in persistent stress signaling including DNA damage response, MAPK signaling, oxidative stress, metabolism of PAHs or pro-inflammatory response, i-But25 induced changes related to the metabolism of the cellular nutrients required for cell recovery. Our results indicate that i-But25 extract possessed the weakest genotoxic potency possibly due to the low PAH content. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - This study investigates and evaluates the storage stability of asphalt binder modified by bio-oil at high temperature. Five bioasphalts are prepared by adding 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30% bio-oil into 70# petroleum asphalt. The bioasphalts are statically stored for 48 h at four different temperatures: 120, 140, 160, and 180°C. The softening point test, rotational viscosity test, dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) test, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) test are applied. The top and bottom sections of samples after thermal storage are analyzed for thermal storage stability from three aspects: physical properties, rheological properties, and functional group composition. The results show that after thermal storage, the bioasphalts segregated and the softening point, viscosity, and antirutting factor of the bottom sections are larger than those of the top sections. The viscosities of the top and bottom sections of bioasphalt with 20% bio-oil are 0.507 and 0.643 Pa · s, respectively, under the storage temperature of 140°C. Moreover, the thermal storage stability of bioasphalts decreases with an increase in bio-oil content and storage temperature. Furthermore, based on rheological properties and functional group analysis, it is found that physical segregation and chemical reactions occurred, such as carbonation reactions, reactions between the oligomers, and volatilization of aromatic compounds. Overall, it is recommended that the storage temperature should be kept below 160°C and the bio-oil content should be less than 25%. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Escherichia coli has been the organism of choice for the production of different chemicals by engineering native and heterologous pathways. In the present study, we simultaneously address some of the main issues associated with E. coli as an industrial platform for isoprenoids, including an inability to grow on sucrose, a lack of endogenous control over toxic mevalonate (MVA) pathway intermediates, and the limited pathway engineering into the chromosome. As a proof of concept, we generated an E. coli DH1 strain able to produce the isoprenoid bisabolene from sucrose by integrating the cscAKB operon into the chromosome and by expressing a heterologous MVA pathway under stress-responsive control. Production levels dropped dramatically relative to plasmid-mediated expression when the entire pathway was integrated into the chromosome. In order to optimize the chromosomally integrated MVA pathway, we established a CRISPR-Cas9 system to rapidly and systematically replace promoter sequences. This strategy led to higher pathway expression and a fivefold improvement in bisabolene production. More interestingly, we analyzed proteomics data sets to understand and address some of the challenges associated with metabolic engineering of the chromosomally integrated pathway. This report shows that integrating plasmid-optimized operons into the genome and making them work optimally is not a straightforward task and any poor engineering choices on the chromosome may lead to cell death rather than just resulting in low titers. Based on these results, we also propose directions for chromosomal metabolic engineering. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Recently, biodiesel is receiving global attention as an alternative fuel for diesel engines because of its many advantages compared to petroleum-based diesel fuel. Despite many advantages, it has also some drawbacks such as: poor flow characteristics, lower energy content, higher price and viscosity. Higher viscosity leading poor atomization with larger droplet size results in bad mixing quality and incomplete combustion. Blending of biodiesel with diesel or alcohol is one of the most appropriate techniques to overcome high viscosity problem. Although viscosity data of biodiesel-diesel fuel binary blends at different temperatures are abundantly available in the literature, these of ethyl ester-diesel-alcohol ternary blends including especially higher alcohols are still insufficient. Therefore, in this study, waste cooking oil ethyl ester (biodiesel) was produced by means of transesterification, and it was blended with diesel fuel and different alcohols (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-butanol and n-pentanol). Viscosities of the prepared ternary blends were measured at different temperatures accordingly DIN 53015. Finally, a rational model depending on blend temperature or alcohol fraction was proposed for estimating viscosities of them, and it was tested with the well-known other models (Arrhenius, Kendall–Monroe, Andrade and Vogel) for its predictive ability. © 2018

AB  - Microalgae are a promising feedstock for biofuel production, but difficulties associated with harvesting suspended cultures contribute to the high costs of algal feedstock production. Ultrasonic harvesting has been identified as a potential low-cost technique, but limited data are available on the response of microalgae cells in the presence of an acoustic field. The acoustic radiation force acting on a cell depends upon cell size and the acoustic contrast factor (ACF) of the cell in the media. The ACF depends upon the density and compressibility of the cell and the media. Cell size and ACF were measured for Microchloropsis gaditana, Nannochloropsis oculata, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The average ACFs, which were determined by measuring the densities and sound velocities of suspensions containing varying concentrations of cells in growth media, were 0.04 (range = 0.03–0.05) for M. gaditana, 0.02 (range = 0.01–0.04) for N. oculata, 0.05 (range = 0.04–0.07) for P. tricornutum, and 0.05 (range = 0.049–0.053) for C. reinhardtii. The ratio of the acoustic radiation force to the drag force would be highest for C. reinhardtii cells due to their larger effective radius (5.6 μm compared to 1.9–2.7 μm for the other species). The effective ACF of C. reinhardtii was also evaluated by recording the motion of cells in the presence of an acoustic field, using particle tracking velocimetry, and then modeling the recorded motion using COMSOL Multiphysics software. The result (ACF = 0.04) demonstrated agreement with the density/sound velocity meter method. Experiments with starch null sta6 mutant C. reinhardtii cells demonstrated that the effective ACF can transition from positive to zero and eventually become negative as microalgae cells accumulate lipids. The dynamic nature of the ACF represents an opportunity and a challenge for acoustic harvesting of algal cells. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Liquefaction of sewage sludge (SS) is a promising technology for the preparation of bio-oil (target product) and biochar (by-product). The liquefaction of SS in ethanol-water cosolvent were preliminarily investigated in this study. There existed synergetic effects between ethanol and water on the liquefaction of SS. Higher bio-oil yield (33.5–36.1 wt%) were obtained in ethanol-water cosolvent, compared to those in pure water (32.2 wt%) and pure ethanol (26.8 wt%). Furthermore, the bio-oil obtained in ethanol-water cosolvent contained higher content of ester components, suggesting higher bio-oil quality. The addition of Na2CO3 further increased the yield of bio-oil (37.5 wt% versus 34.9 wt%), but lowered the quality of bio-oil. The main two types of coke oils in bio-oils were diesel oils and lubricating oils. Elemental, proximate and micromorphology analyses of biochars further indicated that ethanol-water cosolvent had better degradation/transformation effects on SS. The biochars obtained from the liquefaction of SS in ethanol-water cosolvent possessed similar specific surface area (23.0–26.0 m2/g) and pore volume (0.118–0.141 cm3/g) to SS pyrolysis biochar. In view of the yield and quality of liquefaction products, ethanol-water cosolvent may be more proper for the liquefaction of SS, compared to pure water/ethanol. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, a vertical-algal-biofilm-enhanced raceway pond (VAB-enhanced raceway pond) was designed and assessed for wastewater treatment and algal biomass production under different nutrient loading rates. Results indicated that the maximum removal capacity of the system was accordingly 7.52, 6.76 and 0.11 g·m−2·day−1 for COD, TN and TP, under which the wastewater effluent concentration could be respectively reduced from 106.00, 92.71 and 1.48 mg/L to 43.5, 11.03 and 0.46 mg/L in continuous mode. Meanwhile, about 7.47–10.10 t·ha−1·year−1 of lipid, 14.85–23.01 t·ha−1·year−1 of protein and 10.69–14.20 t·ha−1·year−1 of carbohydrate could be produced from the algae by the system in large scale. The corresponding estimated stoichiometric-methane-potential and biodiesel production of the harvested biomass was 21,471–29,136 m3·ha−1·year−1 and 0.57–1.15 t·ha−1·year−1, respectively. The findings of this study demonstrate the feasibility of using VAB-enhanced raceway pond for economically and cost-effectively recovery of nutrients from the wastewater via algal-based byproducts production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Experimental investigation has been carried out to utilize biogas as an alternative source of energy in compression ignition (CI) engine under dual fuel operational mode. Biogas was inducted into the inlet manifold at different flow rates along with fresh air through inlet manifold and diesel was injected as a pilot fuel to initiate combustion under dual fuel mode. The engine performance and emission characteristics of dual fuel operational mode were analyzed at different biogas flow rates and compared with baseline conventional diesel fuel. Based upon the improved performance and lower emission characteristics under the dual fuel operation, the optimum flow rate of biogas was observed to be 2.2 kg/h. The lower brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and higher brake-specific energy consumption (BSEC) were noticed with biogas-diesel fuel under dual fuel mode when compared with neat diesel operation. Test results showed reduced NOx emissions and smoke opacity level in the exhaust tailpipe emissions. However, higher hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions were noticed under dual fuel mode at entire engine loads when compared with baseline fossil petro-diesel. Hence, the use of low-cost gaseous fuel such as biogas would be an economically viable proposition to address the current and future problems of energy scarcity and associated environmental concerns. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper aims to analyse the characteristics and properties of the fractions obtained from slow pyrolysis of non-edible seed cake of Calophyllum inophyllum (CI). The gas, bio-oil and biochar obtained from the pyrolysis carried out at 500 °C in a fixed bed batch type reactor at a heating rate of 30 °C/min were characterized by various analytical techniques. Owing to the high volatile content of CI biomass (72.61%), it was selected as the raw material in this present investigation. GC-MS and FT-IR analysis of bio-oil showed the presence of higher amount of oxygenated compounds, phenol derivatives, esters, acid and furans. The physicochemical properties of the bio-oil were tested as per ASTM norms which imply that bio-oil is a highly viscous liquid with lower heating value as compared to that of diesel fuel. The chemical composition of evolved gas was analysed by using GC testing which revealed the presence of combustible components. The FT-IR characterization of biochar showed the presence of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons whereas the elevated amount of carbon in biochar indicates its potential to be used as solid fuel. The performance and emission characteristics of CI engine were assessed with different CI bio-oil blends and compared with baseline diesel fuel. The results showed that addition of bio-oil leads to decreased brake thermal efficiency and increased brake specific energy consumption. Meanwhile, increase in blend ratio reduces harmful pollutants such as oxides of nitrogen and smoke in the exhaust. From the engine testing, it is suggested to employ 20% of CI bio-oil blends in CI engine to obtain better operation. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The contribution of diesel exhaust to atmospheric pollution is a major concern for public health, especially in terms of occurrence of lung cancers. The present study aimed at addressing the toxic effects of a repeated exposure to these emissions in an animal study performed under strictly controlled conditions. Rats were repeatedly exposed to the exhaust of diesel engine. Parameters such as the presence of a particle filter or the use of gasoil containing rapeseed methyl ester were investigated. Various biological parameters were monitored in the lungs to assess the toxic and genotoxic effects of the exposure. First, a transcriptomic analysis showed that some pathways related to DNA repair and cell cycle were affected to a limited extent by diesel but even less by biodiesel. In agreement with occurrence of a limited genotoxic stress in the lungs of diesel-exposed animals, small induction of γ-H2AX and acrolein adducts was observed but not of bulky adducts and 8-oxodGuo. Unexpected results were obtained in the study of the effect of the particle filter. Indeed, exhausts collected downstream of the particle filter led to a slightly higher induction of a series of genes than those collected upstream. This result was in agreement with the formation of acrolein adducts and γH2AX. On the contrary, induction of oxidative stress remained very limited since only SOD was found to be induced and only when rats were exposed to biodiesel exhaust collected upstream of the particle filter. Parameters related to telomeres were identical in all groups. In summary, our results point to a limited accumulation of damage in lungs following repeated exposure to diesel exhausts when modern engines and relevant fuels are used. Yet, a few significant effects are still observed, mostly after the particle filter, suggesting a remaining toxicity associated with the gaseous or nano-particular phases. Only limited effects are observed on biological endpoints related to genotoxicity in the lung of rats repeatedly exposed to diesel exhaust, with a few exceptions suggesting a toxicity of the gaseous and nano-particular phase. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study aims to investigate the biofuel production ability and potential of heavy metal remediation of Chlorella sp. ISTLA1 isolated from a landfill site. The strain was cultured in Bold's Basal medium at different concentration of NaHCO3 and pH. Response surface methodology was employed for the optimization of nutrient sources for higher lipid production. Under the optimized conditions, the yield of lipid and biomass was 365.42 and 833.14 mg L−1 respectively. GC–MS analysis of lipid indicated the presence of C8 to C31 organic compounds consisting mainly of palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0) and oleic acid (C18:1). Additionally, remediation of heavy metals like Zn, Cu, Mn and Fe from waste water was observed by AAS and EDX. The removal efficiency was 82.6% for Zn, 56.5% for Cu, 79.8% for Mn and 40% for Fe. The study revealed simultaneous biodiesel production and waste water treatment by Chlorella sp. ISTLA1. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recent studies on laser induced thermal lens effect has made it possible to use this tool to investigate thermo-physical and chemical properties of biofuels. During laser illumination, a number of light induced effects may take place in the excited volume of the sample. However, the complexity of information included in the thermal lens transients could lead to misinterpretation of the results. This work examines the theoretical and experimental aspects that must be considered when performing biodiesel analysis using thermal lens spectrometry. The induction of photochemical reaction and thermal diffusion processes is carefully accounted for by describing the localized optical path change due to the concentration gradient created within the sample. We characterize mechanical, chemical and photochemical properties of thermal degraded biodiesels, enabling quantitative access of mass diffusion coefficient, photobleaching cross-section, and thermal yield. Dynamic viscosity analysis corroborates the results obtained by thermal lens, describing the method as very sensitive to thermal stability discrimination of biodiesel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Databases of sooting indices, based on measuring some aspect of sooting behavior in a standardized combustion environment, are useful in providing information on the comparative sooting tendencies of different fuels or pure compounds. However, newer biofuels have varied chemical structures including both aromatic and oxygenated functional groups, which expands the chemical space of relevant compounds. In this work, we propose a unified sooting tendency database for pure compounds, including both regular and oxygenated hydrocarbons, which is based on combining two disparate databases of yield-based sooting tendency measurements in the literature. Unification of the different databases was made possible by leveraging the greater dynamic range of the color ratio pyrometry soot diagnostic. This unified database contains a substantial number of pure compounds (≥ 400 total) from multiple categories of hydrocarbons important in modern fuels and establishes the sooting tendencies of aromatic and oxygenated hydrocarbons on the same numeric scale for the first time. Using this unified sooting tendency database, we have developed a predictive model for sooting behavior applicable to a broad range of hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons. The model decomposes each compound into single-carbon fragments and assigns a sooting tendency contribution to each fragment based on regression against the unified database. The model's predictive accuracy (as demonstrated by leave-one-out cross-validation) is comparable to a previously developed, more detailed predictive model. The fitted model provides insight into the effects of chemical structure on soot formation, and cases where its predictions fail reveal the presence of more complicated kinetic sooting mechanisms. This work will therefore enable the rational design of low-sooting fuel blends from a wide range of feedstocks and chemical functionalities. © 2017 The Combustion Institute

AB  - Oxygenated biofuels such as fatty acid methyl esters or ethanol are incorporated in larger and larger amounts into conventional hydrocarbon fuels for use in internal combustion and jet engines. The use of these alternative fuels, along with new engine technology, results in an increased production of toxic pollutants among which aldehydes are the most abundant. The present study focuses on the kinetic modeling of acetaldehyde pyrolysis and oxidation. Based on new ignition delay-time measurements obtained in shock tube and the data from the literature, a comprehensive validation database was assembled. Available kinetic parameters for the most important chemical reactions are reviewed and an updated reaction model is proposed. The new reaction model enables reproducing most of the trends observed experimentally and constitutes an overall improvement as compared to standard detailed chemical models including Aramco 2.0, CaltechMech, and JetSurf. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the influence of the degree of unsaturation of the triglyceride on the composition of the products of the thermal cracking process, in particular the formation of aromatic compounds, was investigated. Experiments were performed using triglyceride sources with different degrees of unsaturation, maintaining the same operational conditions. Analysis of the products revealed that a greater amount of aromatic compounds is formed during the thermal cracking of biomass with a higher degree of unsaturation. The aromatics content in the liquid product decreased by 14% in the cracking of biomass with the lowest unsaturated content. A correlation between the aromatics content and the iodine index of the sample was proposed, as a simple way to estimate the aromatics content in bio-oil. It was also observed that the reactions for carboxyl removal were favorable in the case of saturated compounds, the acidity index reducing from 210.9 to 139.0 gKOH/g in the biomass with the lowest unsaturated content. However, long-chain paraffinic compounds were present in the products, which suggests that a catalyst or more severe conditions might be necessary for the biomass cracking. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A process model of a 2000 metric ton per day eucalyptus Tail Gas Reactive Pyrolysis (TGRP) and electricity generation plant was developed and simulated in Pro/II software for the purpose of evaluating its techno-economic viability in Brazil. Two scenarios were compared based on operational conditions in the country: a single biomass to bio-oil TGRP production facility and a distributed/satellite processing that consists of several small TGRP production facilities with aggregate capacity similar to the single one, both feeding into one centralized electricity generation plant. The selling price at the breakeven point of the electricity generated via TGRP was estimated to be US$0.34 and US$0.62 per kWh for the single and the distributed scenarios respectively, considering a 10-year payback period. The single capacity pyrolysis and electricity generation facility is found to have better economic benefits over the distributed plants of small sizes under the current conditions in Brazil. The results therefore indicate that pyrolysis of eucalyptus wood for electricity in a single facility cannot be competitive with the current electricity cost in Brazil (US$0.08–0.13/kWh) at present time. Considering auxiliary benefits such as climate change and carbon credits, plus the continuous increasing in the electricity market price in Brazil, both scenarios could be competitive in the future. © 2017

AB  - In this paper, Mahua seed oil was transesterified with methanol using acid and alkaline catalyst process to obtain Mahua Methyl Ester. The chemical composition and physical properties of MME were tested. Experimental tests were investigated to study the performance, combustion and emission on computerized single cylinder CI diesel engine fueled with diesel and B20 (20% (vol.) of MME biodiesel + 80% (vol.) of diesel) along with each of the three nozzles has 3 injection holes, with the aperture of Ø = 0.20 mm (modified), Ø = 0.28 mm (base), and Ø = 0.31 mm (modified). The engine performance, combustion and emission is examined by measuring BSFC, BTE, In-cylinder pressure, MGT, HRR, CO, HC, NOx and smoke opacity. The authentic results were observed by using B20 and smaller orifice NHD. It is observed that smaller orifice NHD improves the air-fuel mixing, atomization, and vaporization which leads to shorter combustion duration. The B20 fuel showed better results such as performance at lower side of partial loads, combustion and emissions than the baseline diesel. The combination of B20 with smaller orifice NHD has shown appreciable results in performance, combustion and emissions. But, the only drawback was NOx is found to be increased. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The cost of biodiesel production as a renewable source is always an obstacle in industry. In order to overcome this problem, another renewable source, solar collector was used to investigate and optimize the transesterification reaction of rapeseed oil for methyl ester production. Three main factors, which include catalyst (NaOH) concentration, reaction temperature and time, were varied according to a central composite design. The yield of methyl ester as the first response was determined by using NMR method. The second response was the commercial cost of production. In order to reduce fossil energy consumption for electric power as a main part of cost, the solar collector was used to provide heat. The results based on response surface method showed that the best conditions for producing biodiesel in the constant molar ratio of 1:6 oil:methanol were the temperature of 60 °C, NaOH concentration of 0.3% wt/wt and reaction time of 60 min. In these optimum conditions, the yield of methyl ester and the cost of production for one-liter biodiesel were 78.6% and 0.706$, respectively. Also, some chemical and physical properties of biodiesel were compared with those of petro-diesel fuel and biodiesel production without solar collector has been done for achieving price differences. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Low-cost palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) feedstock to produce biodiesel is of interest. Single step esterification of PFAD is effective but requires large amounts of chemicals. Removal of water in a two-step process increases the effectiveness of FFA conversion with methanol, but ethanol has yet to be investigated and hence was proposed. Effects of parameters: ethanol to FFA molar ratio, temperature, time and catalyst amount, were investigated. In the first step, catalyst amount was kept constant; and for the second-step, the reaction temperature was fixed. RSM coupled with sensitivity analysis enabled parameters to be optimized. Optimal conditions for the first step were: 4:1 M ratio, 343 K and 15 min, resulting in 88% FFA conversion. In the second step, the conversion reached 86.8% under these conditions: 27:1 M ratio, 53 min and 35.3 wt% catalyst amount. Under these two sets of optimal conditions, the overall FFA conversion of 98.44% was comparable to other studies. The attempt on the use of ethanol to produce ethyl ester in a two-step process of PFAD is quite successful: ethanol, renewable and more environmental friendly, is a contending effective alternative. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An experimental work has been performed to compare the combustion, performance and emission characteristics of a compression ignition engine running with diesel and three different blends of diesel and biodiesel (castor oil methyl ester, COME). The biodiesel has been prepared by alkaline transesterification using NaOH as catalyst. The properties of the fuels, like viscosity, surface tension, heating value, flash point and elemental composition, have been measured following standard test procedures. The variation of viscosity and surface tension of the pure fuels and their blends with temperature are experimentally determined. Experiments have also been performed on a porous sphere to compare the mass burning rate and transition velocity from envelope to wake flame for the pure fuels and their blends. The porous sphere experiment results indicate that diesel has higher evaporation rate than COME while the chemical reactivity of the latter is more than the former. The originality of the work is in using the fundamental information from the porous sphere experiments to explain the combustion characteristics in the engine cylinder. Studies in the engine reveal that combustion starts earlier with the diesel-biodiesel blends and the rate of pressure rise during the rapid combustion phase is also faster with the blended fuels compared to that with diesel. However, not much difference has been noticed in the performance (brake thermal efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption and exhaust gas temperature) and emission (CO, HC and NO) characteristics of the engine using the diesel fuel and diesel-biodiesel fuel blends. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is a very popular renewable alternative fuel. Biodiesel utilization rate as an alternative fuel has been increasing in recent years due to availability, comparatively easier manufacturing process as well as superior fuel properties like non-sulphur content and storage safety. There are many articles related to properties of biodiesel and its effects on engine performance in the literature. However, the studies that compared various biodiesel samples in the same experimental system are scarce. Therefore, results obtained from different experimental systems cannot be definitely benchmarked to provide a comprehensive comparative analysis. In this study, engine performances of five different kinds of biodiesels produced from five different vegetable oils (corn, sunflower, soybean, canola and hazelnut) were compared with each other and with diesel fuel in the same experimental system. Therefore, biodiesel samples that include different ratios of (20%, 50%, and 100%) biodiesel in diesel fuel for each biodiesel sample was prepared after biodiesels were produced by transesterification method. Every sample was used as fuel in the diesel engine. Both effective characteristics and indicated characteristics were determined for each fuel during engine test. All values were compared each other graphically. Finally, it was found that the mixture consists of 20% hazelnut biodiesel has the best performance. © 2017

AB  - The pyrolysis characteristic of rice bran wax (RBW) and its bio-fuel oil were analyzed. TG, Py-GC-MS, TG-MS, FTIR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR were all carried out to analysis RBW pyrolysis characteristic and bio-fuel oil characteristic. TG results showed that RBW pyrolysis temperature was mainly in the temperature range of 350 °C–450 °C. The mean activation energy values calculated from KAS method and FWO method was 106.15 kJ/mol and 115.72 kJ/mol, respectively. The TG-MS results showed that main gas products were alkane and olefins. The Py-GC-MS also found the mainly components of pyrolysis products were alkane and alkene. The 1H NMR, 13C NMR and FTIR experiments were also carried out to confirm the component of bio-fuel oil. The results found that the main components of pyrolysis products were alkane and alkene. The bio-fuel oil properties were also analyzed. The acid value was very low. It was about 10 mg(KOH)/g. And the coke was found. The yield was about 8%. According to above results, it was confirmed that RBW maybe was a good bio-resource to obtain long carbon chain bio-fuel oil. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lithium doped ceria loaded SBA-15 has been synthesised under normal atmospheric condition (without using hydrothermal treatment) and following wet impregnation route. The catalyst has been characterised by using different techniques viz., BET method for surface area measurements, FE-SEM for surface morphology study, XPS for the determination of catalyst composition and element oxidation state. The catalyst was found to possess both acidic and basic sites and hence, successfully employed for the simultaneous esterification and transesterification of waste cottonseed oil. Under optimized reaction conditions of catalyst concentration 10 wt%, methanol to oil molar ratio of 40:1 at 65 °C, the catalyst was able to give &gt;98% fatty acid methyl ester yield within 4 h of reaction time. The catalyst was recovered and reused during 5 successive runs without any significant loss of activity. The activation energy (Ea) for the reaction was found to be 57.7 kJ mol−1, while ΔH‡, ΔG‡ and ΔS‡ were found to be 59.4 kJ mol−1, +95.9 kJ mol−1and - 0.108 kJ mol−1, respectively. On the basis of thermodynamic parameters, the reaction is expected to be endothermic, non spontaneous and following an associative pathway. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study sets out to determine the effects of water reduction on the properties characteristic of fusel oil-gasoline blends, also to study the effects of this reduction on the performance and emissions of an SI engine. The experiments were performed on a SI engine under 4500 rpm speed, different open throttle valve position (% of WOT) as engine loads. As a result of the reduced water contentfrom 13.5% to 6.5%, the heating value and carbon content improved by 13% and 7.9% respectively. While the oxygen content reduced by 14%. The brake power was slightly increased than that of gasoline for most fusel oil–gasoline blends. Furthermore, it was observed that the fusel oil after water extraction (FAWE10 and FAWE20), the fusel oil had slightly higher power compared to the fusel oil before water extraction (FBWE10 and FBWE20). Moreover, brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) improved by reducing the water content. The engine emissions were also slightly increased with the reduction of water content. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass-to-Liquid (BTL) and Coal-to-Liquid (CTL) Synfuels have been the two most significant alternatives for the transportation liquid fuels. But their performance in resource depletion, economic investment, and environmental impacts differs greatly from the conventional refinery. For comparing the strengths and the weakness of each alternative, a quantitative trade-off procedure is required. However, a few researches have discussed such trade-off procedures. In this paper, the life cycle inventories, production cost, and Ecological Cumulative Exergy Consumption (ECEC) of BTL and CTL in China are investigated to compare the pros and cons of each Synfuel. Herewith, the ECEC is taken as a metric for the ecological burden, providing a significant way to integrate the life cycle resource, economic, and environmental factors of Synfuels for the sustainability assessments. The results demonstrated that the shifting of petroleum to BTL reduced the CO2 emission by 98% but relatively increased the water consumption and wastewater. The production cost-breakeven crude oil price with BTL is about 98 $/bbl without considering the taxes, and it could be decreased to 50 $/bbl according to China's tax policy. More importantly, BTL could cut as high as 65% of the overall ecological burden so that would be much more beneficial to the sustainable development of the fuel industry. On the other hand, the economic effectiveness of CTL is relatively reliable, where its production cost-breakeven crude oil price is below 70 $/bbl. However, 10.7 t of CO2 are created for each tonne of CTL, which is 3.3 times to conventional petroleum, and three times of water is consumed in the whole. The ECEC analysis also indicates that the shifting of crude oil to coal for transportation fuels will almost double the overall ecological burden and pose threats to the safety and sustainability of the entire fuel industry at which the cautions should be paid. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Considering the urgent need to shift to low carbon energy carriers, waste wood resources could provide an alternative energy feedstock and at the same time reduce emissions from landfill. This research examines the climate change impacts and related emission uncertainties of waste wood based energy. For this, different grades of waste wood and energy application have been investigated using lifecycle assessment. Sensitivity analysis has then been applied for supply chain processes and feedstock properties for the main emission contributing categories: transport, processing, pelletizing, urea resin fraction and related N2O formation. The results show, depending on the waste wood grade, the conversion option, scale and the related reference case, that emission reductions of up to 91% are possible for non-treated wood waste. Compared to this, energy from treated wood waste with low contamination can achieve up to 83% emission savings, similar to untreated waste wood pellets, but in some cases emissions from waste wood based energy can exceed the ones of the fossil fuel reference - in the worst case by 126%. Emission reductions from highly contaminated feedstocks are largest when replacing electricity from large-scale coal and landfill. The highest emission uncertainties are related to the wood's resin fraction and N2O formation during combustion and, pelletizing. Comparing wood processing with diesel and electricity powered equipment also generated high variations in the results, while emission variations related to transport are relatively small. Using treated waste wood as a bioenergy feedstock can be a valid option to reduce emissions from energy production but this is only realisable if coal and landfill gas are replaced. To achieve meaningful emission reduction in line with national and international climate change targets, pre-treatment of waste wood would be required to reduce components that form N2O during the energy conversion. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The combustion chemistry of di-n‑butyl ether (DBE, C8H18O), conceivable as a potential biofuel candidate, was studied here for the first time under flame conditions with examining a detailed species dataset. Two flames, i.e., a fuel-rich (ϕ = 1.5) and a fuel-lean (ϕ = 0.8) one, were analyzed at the same pressure (4 kPa), argon dilution (50%), and cold-gas velocity (60 cm s−1) by molecular-beam mass spectrometry (MBMS) using electron ionization (EI). About 50 species including reactants, diluent, combustion-related intermediates, and products, were detected with a special interest in fuel-specific intermediates, harmful species as well as important soot precursors. n-Butanal was detected in high concentration and identified as an important fuel-specific intermediate in the DBE flames, while cyclic soot precursors (e.g., 1,3-cyclopentadiene, benzene, toluene) were detected with low mole fractions (∼10 ppm). The present experimental data were compared to simulations by the kinetic model of Cai et al. [Combust. Flame 161 (2014)] and the very recent model of Thion et al. [Combust. Flame 185 (2017)], with the dual purpose to support the data interpretation and to examine the performance of these models also in comparison to each other. Note that species in the range of C5 to C7 (known as important soot precursors) that are not yet addressed in either of the models have been well detected and are presented in the present work. For further insight into the combustion chemistry of DBE, its fuel-rich flame was also compared to those of successively smaller ethers, namely dimethyl ether (DME) and diethyl ether (DEE). This comparison showed a strong effect of the aliphatic side chains of ethers on the formation of intermediate species. Not unexpectedly, increasing the length of side chains enhances the formation tendency of larger unsaturated hydrocarbons. However, the contribution of highly toxic carbonyl compounds, namely formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, was found to be much lower upon the use of DBE as a fuel than for DME and DEE, respectively. Similarly, DBE was also compared to its half-structurally similar fuels, i.e., n-butane and n-butanol. This comparison generally indicates that the distribution of hydrocarbon species (except for C4H8) in DBE flames is quite similar to those in n-butane and n-butanol flames, whereas the formation of oxygenated species is very different for the three fuels. © 2017 The Combustion Institute

AB  - Production of biodiesel from waste animal fats has a great potential since this feedstock does not compete with the food industry and leads to the global reduction of wastes. The type of feedstock as well as the presence of impurities highly influences the quality of biodiesel. Too high concentrations of glycerol and glycerides in biodiesel negatively influence the fuel quality and can generally reduce the engine durability, so crude biodiesel needs to be purified. One alternative method of purifying biodiesel is extraction with deep eutectic solvents. Biodiesels were synthesised from five types of waste animal fats: veal and beef tallow, lard, chicken and goose fat, by means of chemical transesterification catalysed by alkali catalyst. Due to the fact that the presence of impurities negatively influences the quality of biodiesel, crude biodiesels were purified. Liquid-liquid extraction with previously prepared deep eutectic solvent choline-chloride/ethylene-glycol (molar ratio 1:2.5) was selected as the purification method. Experiments were performed at different mass ratio solvent/biodiesel in a laboratory scale batch extractor equipped with mechanical stirrer and optimal mass ratio was defined. Biodiesels were characterised and their properties were compared with the standard specification. Free glycerol from animal fats biodiesels was efficiently removed by the selected solvent. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In dealing with lignocellulosic and algal biomass, thermal acid hydrolysis is an economical and efficient method. In this process, 5-hydroxy-methylfurfural (5-HMF) is formed unavoidably, which inhibits downstream reducing sugar fermentation. Fortunately, 5-HMF can be biotransformed into 2,5-furan-dicarboxylic acid (FDCA), the top 14 biomass platform molecules. Base on the connection between 5-HMF removal and FDCA production, microbes capable of biotransforming 5-HMF into FDCA are beneficial to raise biofuel yield and potential molecule production. In this research, pure strain Methylobacterium radiotolerans G-2 capable of transforming 5-HMF into FDCA was enriched and isolated from local campus soil, and its abilities of 5-HMF biotransformation and FDCA production were characterized. Strain M. radiotolerans G-2 could completely transform 1000 mg/L 5-HMF into FDCA with maximum concentration of 513.9 mg/L at an initial pH of 7 at 26°C. Algal acid hydrolysate after two-fold dilution was suitable for strain M. radiotolerans G-2 to perform 5-HMF biotransformation, and 459.7 mg/L FDCA could be obtained. Interestingly, strain M. radiotolerans G-2 did not significantly consume reducing sugar and reducing sugar consuming efficiency was less than 16%. © 2017 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan

AB  - In this paper, the concept of value at risk (VAR) is introduced to study process economics related to biodiesel production and use. Although the VAR concept is actively used in financial engineering for stock investment and trading, it has never been used in process economics. A methodology to develop a VAR model for a biodiesel process facility has been proposed and analysed. The impact of different cost related risk factors is modelled using a stochastic process and interdependence in a Bayesian Network format. The analysis reveals that cost underestimation is the most significant risk factor in biodiesel economics. The VAR model is analysed for 1, 5, and 10 VAR for 5 years of plant operations. Analysing VAR at any point of time (i.e. year 2) shows that with a 1% chance, 5% chance and 10% chance, the maximum loss would be $6.26, $9.52 and $11.34 million respectively (up to year 2). When VAR is considered in the process economics the return period is significantly affected and is increased by 21 months. This study recommends that VAR should be considered as an integral part of process economics, especially for new product or process design. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A new nano-sized barium coordination polymer, {(bipyH)[Ba2(pydc)2(Hpydc)(H2O)2]}n·nH2O (1), (bipy = 4,4′-bipyridine and H2pydc = pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid), has been sonochemically synthesized and fully characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), FT-IR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and elemental analyses. Compound 1 was structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction and it was shown that this compound consists of 1D anionic coordination polymers and bipyH+ cationic species that construct a three-dimensional supramolecular architecture via non-covalent interactions i.e. ion-pairing and hydrogen bonding. The role of compound 1 as a heterogeneous catalyst in the production of biodiesel was also investigated. A full conversion of soybean oil to biodiesel was accomplished in an exceptionally short timeframe through an ultrasonic-assisted transesterification process in the presence of compound 1. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In Lithuania about 201 PJ of energy is consumed annually and heat energy amounts to two-thirds of the total energy used. Biofuel combustion plants built in the country in 2000–2015 produce more than 1500 MW of power. The increasing demand for raw material compels a search for alternative sources. The promising crops for enhancement of biomass resources are high-yielding perennial herbaceous energy plants. Yield and yield variations of A.dubia Wall. with and without the application of nitrogen fertilizer were determined. The highest biomass productivity of 26.99 ± 6.88 t ha−1 was achieved at the second growing year. The average moisture content was 59.2 ± 0.83% in A. dubia harvested in October, but only 10.98 ± 0.60% in A.dubia harvested in March. Also, the influence of ventilation intensity on the drying processes and on variation of physical and thermal properties of A. dubia was determined in this study. On the basis of the research carried out, by simulation of A. dubia growth and the biofuel production technologies, energy efficiency indices of thermal conversion were determined. For pellet production and thermal conversion of pellets, the energy efficiency index varied in the range of (7–10):1; for A.dubia biomass combustion, it varied in the range of (15–20):1. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study evaluates environmental impacts of an integrated mixed crop-livestock system with a green biorefinery (GBR). System integration included production of feed crops and green biomasses (Sys-I) to meet the demand of a livestock system (Sys-III) and to process green biomasses in a GBR system (Sys-II). Processing of grass-clover to produce feed protein was considered in Sys-II, particularly to substitute the imported soybean meal. Waste generated from the livestock and GBR systems were considered for the conversion to biomethane (Sys-IV). Digestate produced therefrom was assumed to be recirculated back to the farmers' field (Sys-I). A consequential approach of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method was used to evaluate the environmental impacts of a combined production of suckler cow calves (SCC) and Pigs, calculated in terms of their live weight (LW). The functional unit (FU) was a basket of two products “1 kgLW-SCC + 1 kgLW-Pigs”, produced at the farm gate. Results obtained per FU were: 19.6 kg CO2 eq for carbon footprint; 0.11 kg PO4 eq for eutrophication potential, − 129 MJ eq for non-renewable energy use and − 3.9 comparative toxicity units (CTUe) for potential freshwater ecotoxicity. Environmental impact, e.g. greenhouse gas (GHG) emission was primarily due to (i) N2O emission and diesel consumption within Sys-I, (ii) energy input to Sys-II, III and IV, and (iii) methane emission from Sys-III and Sys-IV. Specifically, integrating GBR with the mixed crop-livestock system contributed 4% of the GHG emissions, whilst its products credited 7% of the total impact. Synergies among the different sub-systems showed positive environmental gains for the selected main products. The main effects of the system integration were in the reductions of GHG emissions, fossil fuel consumption, eutrophication potential and freshwater ecotoxicity, compared to a conventional mixed crop-livestock system, without the biogas conversion facility and the GBR. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of oleaginous bacteria to produce lipid-based biofuels from organic waste is an emerging approach. The present study was designed to isolate oleaginous bacteria capable of growing on food-processing waste to produce bio-fuels on a sustainable basis. About 26 oleaginous bacteria were isolated from natural crude oils using Luria-Bertani (LB) medium under nitrogen-deficient conditions. The GC–MS analysis confirmed the ability of 10 isolates to produce free fatty acids, where oleic acid appeared to be the most recurring compound among the identified fatty acids. The results of aerobic wet digestion (batch mode) showed the potential of the strain KM15 for simultaneous lipid accumulation and waste treatment. Among different types of waste, removal of volatile solids (VS) up to 38.5% and oxidizable organic matter removal (COD-based) up to 48.9% was achieved by strain KM15, while simultaneously showing an accumulation of lipids up to 41.5% in 96 h. The degradation efficiency of organic matter was 30.9% and 31% for apple and orange waste after 96 h with a lipid accumulation of 21% and 25% respectively. Overall, Bacillus cerus strain KM15 was the most effective strain in the degradation of mango waste and, correspondingly, the production of biolipids from waste. This study illustrates the concept of biorefinery for sustainable waste management and simultaneous production of lipid-based biofuels. The use of waste as the sole source of nutrition could be a key factor in reducing the total production cost of lipid-based bacteriological biorefineries. © 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of bio-oil is considered among the most promising techniques for upgrading pyrolysis bio-oils to biofuels. However, its commercial application is challenging because of the complexity of the reaction. In particular, minimizing the hydrogen consumption in HDO is a main concern. In this study, ruthenium supported on mesoporous TiO2 (Ru/meso-TiO2) catalysts were prepared with various Fe loadings for this reaction, using anisole as a model substrate. Analytical techniques, such as transmission electron microscopy, CO chemisorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, revealed that the addition of Fe increased the number of oxygen vacancies, reaching a maximum when the Fe loading was 1 wt.%. H2 consumption can be reduced by performing HDO reaction at high temperatures. The Ru/meso-TiO2 without Fe converted anisole mainly to methoxycyclohexane, indicating that hydrogenation (HYD) is the dominant reaction pathway. The addition of Fe remarkably promotes the conversion and selectivity of the catalyst. The reaction path could be drastically changed from HYD to direct deoxygenation (DDO) by the addition of a proper amount of Fe. This change can be assigned to the synergism between Ru particles and Fe species on the surface of meso-TiO2 support. The catalyst with 1 wt.% Fe exhibited the highest conversion and benzene selectivity due to its largest number of oxygen vacancies, indicating that it utilized a minimum amount of H2. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To achieve the emission mitigation and decarbonization goals, future aviation requires alternative sustainable fuels. Synthetic paraffinic kerosene, generated by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, is certified as a drop-in jet fuel up to 50%. Potential fuel production routes are via conversion of biomass (Biomass-to-Liquid, BtL), the combination of renewable power and biomass (Power-and-Biomass-to-Liquid, PBtL) and the conversion of carbon dioxide with hydrogen from renewable power (Power-to-Liquid, PtL). In order to compare the three different production routes, an Aspen Plus® model is designed for each production path and techno-economically assessed for an assumed capacity of 11 Mg h−1 fuel production (equals 90 Gg·a−1 plant capacity). Even though the BtL route allows the lowest net production costs, it has some drawbacks compared to PBtL and PtL. Especially the low H to C ratio of biomass leads to limited fuel yields in the BtL process. These yields can be increased by a factor of about 3 when conducting the PBtL process with the same biomass input instead of BtL. The highest X-to-Liquid efficiency based on power input and energy in feedstock is found for PBtL (51.4%) followed by PtL (50.6%) and BtL (36.3%). For BtL 73% of the introduced carbon is lost as CO2. The total investment costs are highest for BtL, followed by PBtL and PtL. The net production costs are in the reverse order. The cost analysis reveals total PBtL investment costs of 742 M€ and net production costs of around 3 €·kg−1 with an electricity price of 105 €·MWh−1. The costs for electrolyzer and gasifier represent the largest shares of the total capital costs. As the net production costs are dominated for the electricity costs, low electricity prices and high capacities are advantageous for PBtL, while high electricity and low biomass costs favor BtL concept. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The greatest challenge in producing biomolecules at industrial scale is cost. In order to provide cheaper sources, the present study describes the production of biosurfactant using a low-cost medium supplemented with manganese. The feedstock used to produce biosurfactant was crude glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production. Results showed that 5% (v/v) of glycerol and 0.05 mM of manganese was the best combination to produce biosurfactant. The produced biosurfactant was able to reduce surface tension and showed emulsification activity in diesel fuel. The main functional groups of the biosurfactant were identified by 1H NMR and FTIR spectra. We identified the molecule as surfactin based on comparison with surfactin standard spectra described in the literature. This study showed conversion of low-value glycerol into value-added products as biosurfactant. The use of a by-product as a carbon source for biosurfactant production is a possible strategy for reducing production costs. In addition, biosurfactant production by Bacillus subtilis can be considered safe and commercially viable, because it is a non-pathogenic bacterium. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Freshwater macroalgae has competitive advantages compared to microalgae and marine macroalgae, such as lower separation and drying cost requirements and an abundance of available freshwater media. Municipal wastewater containing large quantities of nutrients (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus) is a valuable and underutilized resource. In this study, the cultivation of the naturally isolated filamentous freshwater macroalgae Spirogyra sp. was investigated in three different types of municipal wastewater including primary (PW), secondary (SW) and centrate (CW) wastewaters. Two different types of reactors including closed column photobioreactors and open rectangular aquarium reactors were operated under no and low air flow rates of less than (18 ± 2) cm−3·min−1, respectively. The SW, PW diluted with water to a 20 % volume fraction and CW diluted with water to a 2 % volume fraction appeared to promote ash-free biomass productivities of (2.17-6.68) g·m−2·d−1 and specific growth rates of (16.4–29.7) %·d−1. Nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies ranged from (50.6–90.6) % and (60.4–99.1) %, respectively. Based on ultimate analysis, the biomass produced a higher heating value of (12.4–17.1) MJ·kg−1, and also showed relatively consistent protein ((16.7–19.5) % of the dry mass fraction), carbohydrate ((41.5–55.0) %) and lipid ((2.8–10.0) %) contents. These results indicate the feasibility of using Spirogyra sp. to recover nutrients from multiple municipal wastewater sources with the simultaneous production of biomass that contains value-added biochemical components for bioenergy and biofuel applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to fluctuation in fuel prices in recent times the Indian economy is facing a heavy burden on the economic front to meet the energy supply demand. Due to large gap between the supply and demand of petroleum products. The government of India in its National Biofuel Policy is moving towards the development of biofuel as alternative source of energy by increasing its blends to 20 % by year 2017. In this path of development Karanja oil is being identified as second most important source of biodiesel production in India after Jatropha. But the poor stability and cold flow property associated with the Karanja biodiesel make it difficult for using it as alternative fuel to diesel. The storage of biodiesel is the major issue area for its long term utilization. The aim of present investigation is to optimize the storage period of Karanja biodiesel using various metals and antioxidants for a period of 6 months. The optimum result for OS of KB with same time and same amount of antioxidant for iron (Fe), aluminium (Al) and zinc (Zn) are 8.34, 8.40 and 8.20 h respectively with metal concentration level of 1.10, 0.85 and 1.45 ppm. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Climate suitability of 4 major energy species,i.e. sweet sorghum,cassava,switchgrass and Jatropha curcas, in marginal land in China was assessed according to the regional meteorological resources. Production potential of liquid biofuels and economic benefits of these 4 energy species were quantitatively compared in this study. The results showed that the suitable land for sweet sorghum,cassava,switchgrass and Jatropha curcas is 218.65×104,18.82×104,208.67× 104,and 46.19×104 hm2 respectively in cultivatable marginal land in China. The ethanol fuel production potential of sweet sorghum,cassava or switchgrass in suitable marginal land is 648.82× 104,23.85× 104 or 633.63× 104 tonnes respectively. And biodiesel production potential of Jatropha curcas is 40.42×104 tonnes. Comparing with Jatropha curcas and switchgrass,sweet sorghum and cassava have higher economic benefits for producing liquid biofuels,which can reach 2940 and 1322 ¥/hm2 in the most suitable marginal land. © 2018, Editorial Board of Acta Energiae Solaris Sinica.

AB  - The physicochemical properties of combustion particles that promote lung toxicity are not fully understood, hindered by the fact that combustion particles vary based on the fuel and combustion conditions. Real-world combustion-particle properties also continually change as new fuels are implemented, engines age, and engine technologies evolve. This work used laboratory-generated particles produced under controlled combustion conditions in an effort to understand the relationship between different particle properties and the activation of established toxicological outcomes in human lung cells (H441 and THP-1). Particles were generated from controlled combustion of two simple biofuel/diesel surrogates (methyl decanoate and dodecane/biofuel-blended diesel (BD), and butanol and dodecane/alcohol-blended diesel (AD)) and compared to a widely studied reference diesel (RD) particle (NIST SRM2975/RD). BD, AD, and RD particles exhibited differences in size, surface area, extractable chemical mass, and the content of individual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Some of these differences were directly associated with different effects on biological responses. BD particles had the greatest surface area, amount of extractable material, and oxidizing potential. These particles and extracts induced cytochrome P450 1A1 and 1B1 enzyme mRNA in lung cells. AD particles and extracts had the greatest total PAH content and also caused CYP1A1 and 1B1 mRNA induction. The RD extract contained the highest relative concentration of 2-ring PAHs and stimulated the greatest level of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) cytokine secretion. Finally, AD and RD were more potent activators of TRPA1 than BD, and while neither the TRPA1 antagonist HC-030031 nor the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) affected CYP1A1 or 1B1 mRNA induction, both inhibitors reduced IL-8 secretion and mRNA induction. These results highlight that differences in fuel and combustion conditions affect the physicochemical properties of particles, and these differences, in turn, affect commonly studied biological/toxicological responses. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Energy is an important criterion in determining the world’s economy. Due to continuous industrial development, increase in population and standard of living leads to energy crisis and also increase in consumption of fossil fuels. The world is presently confronted with the dual crisis of fossil fuel depletion and environmental degradation. All countries are looking for a new energy source that will last for long period, and no environmental pollution. Biodiesel proves to be a good alternative to fossil fuels. But the viability of biofuel is also the key parameter for suggesting it as an alternate source for CI engines. The selection of optimum biodiesel with the appropriate blend for the IC engine plays a vital role in the energy sector. The objective of this study is to identify the apt fuel blend using hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) with various evaluating criteria and the alternatives.FAHP with TOPSIS and PROMETHEE are hybrid MCDM methods that are used to evaluate the suitable blend. FAHP is applied to find the relative weights of the criteria, while PROMETHEE and TOPSIS are used to identify the best alternatives. The performances of the MCDM methods were also analyzed with each other. A four-stroke single cylinder, constant speed, direct injection with a rated output of 4.4 kW was used for exploratory analysis. NOx, Smoke, HC, CO, CO2, BTE, EGT, ID, CD and MRP were considered as the assessment criteria. The priority ranking positions of the fuel blend alternatives are attained by FAHP with TOPSIS &amp; PROMETHEE are B100&lt;B80&lt;B60&lt;B40&lt;Diesel&lt;B20. From the results, it is observed that B20 is the best blend. The proposed models have significantly increased the efficiency of decision-making process for the engine researchers to identify the optimum fuel blend by minimising the noxious emissions. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biodiesels derived from microalgae oil promise to be an alternative for the conventional diesel fuel due to their similarity in properties. In this present work, Ce–Ru–O catalysts are used as an additive to the NOME in the form of an emulsion. A single-cylinder, four-stroke direct injection compression ignition engine is made to run on B20+CeO2, and B20 dozed with different dosage levels of Ce0.95Ru0.05O2, Ce0.9Ru0.1O2, and Ce0.8Ru0.2O2 microemulsions. Ce–Ru–O at different concentrations is used to study the effect of metal oxide on emission characteristics of the fuel. Experimental results show that addition of microemulsion has a positive effect on emission characteristics and also acts as an oxidation catalyst. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We investigated the influence of liquid media-assisted condensation on the bio-oil yield using biomass derived from cassava rhizomes and stalks in a free-fall reactor. Benzene, diesel, engine lubricant, and ethanol were tested as the liquid medium. Exposure times varied from 60 to 120 min with biomass feed rates from 100 to 250 g/h. Engine lubricant and ethanol tended to decrease biomass yield while increasing gas yield. Benzene and diesel showed slightly increased biomass yield. With benzene, the bio-oil water content (28%) was insignificantly different from that without using any condensation substance. However, with diesel, the water content increased very slightly; with engine lubricant, it decreased to 25%; and with ethanol, it significantly decreased to 12%. Also, using diesel generated higher heating values (30 MJ/kg). © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Nowadays the development and application of alternative fuels (including biofuels) are highly important for several reasons, e.g., protection of the environment and people's health and achievement of sustainable development, etc. Diesel fuels are important in road transportation in the European Union and all over the world. So, it is necessary to develop alternative (bio)fuels for diesel engines. During the development of these alternative fuels, it is necessary to take into account that it does not endanger the cultivation of food and feed crops. According to the above-mentioned reasons, we studied the catalytic hydrogenation of mixtures of the middle distillates derived from thermal cracking of waste polypropylene (WPPCF) (5-30%), waste cooking oil (WCO) (20-45%), and straight-run gas oil (GO) (50%), on a sulfided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst to produce diesel fuel. We investigated the effects of feedstock compositions and process parameters (T = 300-360 °C, LHSV = 1.0-3.0 h-1, P = 40 bar, hydrogen/feedstock = 400 N m3/m3) on the main product's quality and yield. We concluded that good quality diesel fuel blending components with high alternative component content (approximately 50%) can be produced from feedstocks having 30/20% WPPCF, 20/30% WCO, and 50% GO at advantageous process parameters (T = 340-360 °C, LHSV = 1.0 h-1, P = 40 bar, hydrogen/feedstock = 400 N m3/m3). © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The industry application of bio-oil has been constrained due to its poor fuel properties. Ethyl acetate, acetone, n-octanol, and polyethylene glycol 400 as mutual solvents as well as ultrasonic treatment were employed to improve the chemical and physical properties of heavy bio-oil. When the ratio of n-octanol to heavy bio-oil was 3:1, ultrasonic power was 150 W, and exposure time was 12 min, the viscosity (40 °C) of heavy bio-oil decreased from 1244.60 to 6.05 mm2·s-1, the heat value increased to 41.02 MJ·kg-1, and the pH increased to 6.23. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results showed that no change is obvious in the TG curve for some of the blends after 60 days. Moreover, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) effectively verified that some of the blends were stable after 60 days and some were not, but no stratification was observed. FT-IR and TGA are fast and easy tools to examine the stability and homogeneity of the blends. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, the effects of adding graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) into jatropha methyl ester–diesel blended fuel (20% by volume jatropha methyl ester + 80% diesel; symbolized by JB20) on the performance, combustion, and emission characteristics of a diesel engine were experimentally investigated. The GNPs were added at different concentrations of 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg/L of JB20. These blends were investigated under various engine loads and speeds. The results showed that adding GNPs at 50–75 mg/L of JB20 achieved an increase of 25% in the thermal efficiency and a reduction of 20% in the brake specific fuel consumption compared to those of pure JB20. The peak cylinder pressure, highest rate of pressure rise, and maximum heat release rate were also increased by 6%, 5%, and 5%, respectively. Furthermore, the engine emissions of NOx, CO, and UHC were reduced by 40%, 60%, and 50%, respectively, at a GNP dosage of 25–50 mg/L. The results showed that the dose level of 50 mg/L had the optimum enhancement in the overall characteristics of engine performance and emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Acidic bentonite clay was obtained through surface modification of bentonite clay using hydrochloric acid as acidic precursor to increase the acidity of the bentonite. The modified catalyst was examined via X-ray fluorescence (XRF), XRD analysis, Brunauer Emmett and Teller surface area (BET), FTIR analysis and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) analysis. XRF analysis showed that the acid modification of bentonite clay results in an increase in the silica content and lower abundance of metal oxides, due to the dissolve of Fe2O3, MnO, CaO, Na2O. Ca2+, Na+ cations from the interlayer and octahedral sheets. FTIR spectroscopy showed that the acid activation decreased the intensity of the absorption bands at 915, 875 and 836 cm−1 which arise from the binding modes of OH groups. NH3-TPD analysis showed a considerable increase in the moderate and strong Bronosted acid cites on the modified bentonite compared to the native clay. The modified bentonite was evaluated as economic and efficient heterogeneous catalyst in catalytic cracking process of two nonedible vegetable oils to obtain the corresponding biofuels at moderate processing temperature of 250–280 °C. It was observed that the catalytic conversion was preceded under mild temperature and obtained efficient biofuels with approved physical and fuel properties according to ASTM specifications. The role of the catalyst ratio was considerable on the yield percent and the properties of the obtained biofuels. The catalytic activity-reaction mechanism was discussed based on NH3-TPD analysis. © 2018

AB  - We reported a facile, economic and green method based on biomimetic mineralization to acquire lipase-inorganic hybrid nanoflower, which was then employed as a biocatalyst for biodiesel production. In the hybrid nanoflower, enzyme molecules and Cu2+ ions were utilized as the organic and inorganic components, respectively. The morphology of nanoflower and the distribution and loading of proteins were systematically characterized by scanning electron microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy and ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, which indicated the successful encapsulation of lipase in the hybrid nanoflower. Using the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl caprylate as a model, lipase-inorganic hybrid nanoflower was observed to possess favorable catalytic activity and stability in the ester hydrolysis. Further, the hybrid nanoflower was used as a catalyst for biodiesel production, in which it could convert sunflower oil to biodiesel with 96.5% conversion and remain 72.5% conversion after being used for 5 cycles. Thus, the lipase-inorganic hybrid nanoflower is potential to be used as an economically viable biocatalyst for the production of biofuel as the future petrol-fuel replacement. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Hydroprocessed renewable diesel (HRD-76) and synthesized isoparaffin (SIP-76) have been produced in sufficient quantity for testing by the US Navy, and demonstrated as compatible replacements or blend stock with marine diesel (NATO F-76). Operational limitations with respect to the lubricity, seal swell and cold-flow properties, however, need to be addressed before using 100% HRD-76 or SIP-76. Aromatics are known to improve seal swell and low-temperature characteristics. In this study, three commercial aromatic fluids (Aromatic 100, 150 and 200) produced from petroleum refining were added to HRD-76 and SIP-76 at various concentrations to investigate their impacts on the properties of the biofuel blend. The composition, hydrogen content and physicochemical properties of these aromatic fluids were determined according to ASTM methods and compared with that of biofuels and F-76. The seal-swell capability of the aromatic fluids and biofuel blends was investigated using nitrile O-rings, while the effects of aromatic fluids on fuel low-temperature quality were evaluated using differential scanning calorimetry. In addition, ASTM D5304 and D2274 tests were conducted to investigate the impacts of adding aromatics to biofuels on long-term storage and oxidative stabilities. Although the composition and characteristics of these three aromatics fluids varied, all were capable of inducing o-ring seal swell and adjusting the density of biofuels without significantly affecting the biofuels’ stabilities. HRD-76 and aromatic fluid blends also exhibited liquid to solid phase transitions at lower temperatures and greater hydrophilicity than neat HRD-76. © 2017

AB  - The major obstacles for the production of drop-in fuel from traditional fast pyrolysis are low bio-oil yield, poor fuel heating value and high solid yield. To overcome these obstacles, we studied the introduction of high pressure hydrogen into the pyrolysis reactor, in a process known as catalytic fast hydropyrolysis (CFHP). CFHP of anisole, a bio-oil model compound, was performed at different temperatures and pressures, to determine the effects of those variables on the CFHP reaction network. Alkanes were observed at low temperature and high pressure, whereas aromatics were dominant at low pressure and high temperature. Aspen modelling and calculation of reaction equilibrium constants showed that there is a thermodynamic barrier for simultaneous pyrolysis and hydrogenation at 600 °C. Reduced heating rates and CFHP followed by second-stage hydroprocessing (SH) were proposed as a means to control reaction temperature and efficiently deoxygenate CFHP vapors. The two-stage CFHP followed by hydroprocessing produced nearly 18 mol% carbon yield to alkanes, and a total bio-oil carbon yield of 25 mol%. The approximate bio-oil higher heating value (HHV) and aromaticity were 43.4 MJ/kg and 28 wt%, respectively, both within the range of gasoline. © 2017

AB  - Four kinds of noble metal-like catalysts W2C/AC, W2N/AC, Mo2C/AC and Mo2N/AC were prepared and used for catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass to upgrade the fuel properties of biomass pyrolysis vapors. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) experiments were performed to analyze the volatile pyrolytic products in pyrolysis vapors. Effects of catalyst, pyrolysis temperature and catalyst-to-biomass ratio on the pyrolytic product distribution were examined thoroughly. Actual yields of major pyrolytic products were determined by an external calibration method. Results showed that tungsten-based catalysts performed better than molybdenum-based catalysts, and W2C/AC possessed comparable performance to Pd/AC catalyst. From the pyrolysis of biomass and its single component, W2C/AC and W2N/AC catalysts exhibited promising capability to promote the decomposition of lignin to generate monomeric phenolic compounds, especially stable phenolics. Meanwhile, they would also affect the holocellulose pyrolysis by decreasing anhydrosugars and linear aldehydes, while increasing furans, cyclopentanones and linear ketones. As for an overall effect, catalysis by W2C/AC and W2N/AC catalysts was capable to convert those undesirable pyrolytic products (containing aldehyde group, C[dbnd]C bond or carboxyl group) through decarbonylation, hydrogenation, decarboxylation and other reactions, and thus decrease the instability, acidity and oxygen content of pyrolytic products for obtaining high-grade bio-oil. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Generation of coproducts from nutrients is purported to improve the sustainability of algae-derived transportation fuels by minimizing life cycle impacts and improving economic sustainability. Although algae cultivation produces lipids that is upgraded to drop-in transportation fuel products, life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis have shown that without coproducts, energy/economic returns are diminishing regardless of processing methods. This study utilizes a combined flash hydrolysis (FH), hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), and coproduct conversion technology (atmospheric precipitation/AP; hydrothermal mineralization/HTM) to conserve the most recyclable nutrients for coproduct marketability. Six biofuel pathways were developed and compared in terms of "well-to-pump" energy, life cycle greenhouse gas (LC-GHG) emissions, and economic profitability: renewable diesel II (RDII), renewable gasoline (RG), and hydroprocessed renewable jet (HRJ) fuel, each were modeled for AP and HTM coproduct conversion. A functional unit of 1 MJ usable energy was employed. RG showed a promising energy-return-on-investment (EROI) due to multiple coproducts. All models demonstrated favorable EROI (EROI > 1). LC-GHG emissions tie in with EROI such that RG produced the least emissions. HRJ-HTM was determined to be the most profitable model with a profitability index (PI) of 0.75. Sensitivity analyses revealed that dewatering affects EROI and PI significantly. To achieve break-even, gasoline must sell at $4.10/gal, diesel at $5.64/gal, and jet fuel at $3.43/gal. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Bioderived lipids offer a potentially promising intermediate to displace petroleum-derived diesel. One of the key challenges for the production of lipids via microbial cell mass is that these products are stored intracellularly and must be extracted and recovered efficiently and economically. Thus, improved methods of cell lysis and lipid extraction are needed. In this study, we examine lipid extraction from wet oleaginous yeast in combination with seven different cell lysis approaches encompassing both physical and chemical techniques (high-pressure homogenization, microwave and conventional thermal treatments, bead beating, acid, base, and enzymatic treatments) to facilitate lipid extraction from a model oleaginous yeast strain, Lipomyces starkeyi. Of the seven techniques investigated, acid treatment led to the highest lipid recovery yields. Further exploration of acid treatment and integration with an economic model revealed that treatment at 170 °C for 60 min at 1 wt % H2SO4 and 8 wt % yeast solids represents a viable option for both lipid recovery yield and process economics, enabling experimental lipid recovery yields of 88.5-93.0% to be achieved at a corresponding estimated minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of 5.13-5.61/gallon of gasoline equivalent (GGE). The same acid treatment conditions applied to two other strains of oleaginous yeast (Cutaneotrichosporon curvatus and Rhodotorula toruloides) resulted in similar lipid recovery yields. In pretreatment experiments scaled up to 300 mL, slightly lower temperatures or shorter pretreatment times, along with higher yeast solids loading, resulted in higher lipid yields than the conditions identified from the small-scale runs. Two replicate runs carried out at 170 °C for 30 min using 1 wt % H2SO4 and 19 wt % yeast solids achieved an average lipid recovery of 96.1% at a corresponding estimated MFSP of 4.89/GGE. In all cases, the lipids are primarily triglycerides and free fatty acids comprised mainly of palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids, with smaller fractions of polar lipids. The fatty acid composition of the lipids extracted from the wet treated cell mass is the same as that in freeze-dried whole oleaginous yeast cell mass, suggesting the acid treatment renders all lipids extractable. This work demonstrates that acid treatment is a robust and effective cell lysis technique in a microbial lipid-based biofuel scenario and provides a baseline for further scale-up and process integration. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The liquid phase hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of guaiacol (GUA), a model compound of bio-oil, was studied on bimetallic (PtPd) and monometallic (Ru) catalysts supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate of Al-HMS(X) type with different Si/Al (X) ratios and on mesoporous zirconia modified with silica (m-ZrO2-SiO2) in the presence of methanol as a solvent. The catalysts were characterized by NH3-TPD, TEM, XPS, 27Al and 29Si solid-state NMR and N2 adsorption–desorption methods. The inﬂuence of сatalyst loading, temperature, solvent/guaiacol ratio and contact time on the catalytic performance was investigated. It was established that, decreasing the Si/Al ratio and, correspondingly, increasing the acidity of the catalysts based on Al-HMS led to increasing conversion of guaiacol. Phenol, catechol, and their methylated derivatives were the main products of guaiacol HDO reaction in methanol at low catalyst loading (guaiacol/metal ratio, 800). It was found that the fraction of completely hydrodeoxygenated products (cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane) greatly increased as the catalyst loading grew (guaiacol/metal ratio, 160). Conversion of guaiacol on PtPd/m-ZrO2-SiO2 catalyst was higher than that on PtPd/Al-HMS(10), in accordance with the larger number of acid sites on the catalyst surface; however, the undesirable heavy fraction of methylated by-products was also higher. Ru-based catalysts exhibited the highest catalytic activity and showed unusually high selectivity toward fully hydrodeoxygenated products (cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane) in the HDO of guaiacol in the presence of methanol. Guaiacol can be efficiently converted into alkanes, with quantitative conversion and selectivity to cyclohexanes of 78% over Ru/Al-HMS(10) catalyst under relatively mild conditions (200 °C, 5 MPa H2). Methylation under the influence of methanol, deoxygenation on acid sites and aromatic ring hydrogenation on metal sites proceeded in a parallel way according to the suggested reaction pathways. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, recycling of spent coffee grounds (SCG) as a potential feedstock for alternative fuel production and compounds of added value in Turkey was assessed. The average oil content was found (≈ 13% w/w). All samples (before and after extraction) were tested for scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), calorific value, surface analysis and porosity, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and elemental analysis to assess their potential towards fuel properties. Elemental analysis indicated that carbon represents the highest percentages (49.59% and 46.42%, respectively), followed by nitrogen (16.7% and 15.5%), hydrogen (6.74% and 6.04%), and sulfur (0.851% and 0.561%). These results indicate that SCG can be utilized as compost, as it is rich in nitrogen. Properties of the extracted oil were examined, followed by biodiesel production. The quality of biodiesel was compared with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D6751 standards, and all the properties complied with standard specifications. The fatty acid compositions were analyzed by gas chromatography. It was observed that coffee waste methyl ester (CWME) is mainly composed of palmitic (35.8%) and arachidic (44.6%) acids, which are saturated fatty acids. The low degree of unsaturation provides an excellent oxidation stability (10.4 hr). CWME has also excellent cetane number, higher heating value, and iodine value with poor cold flow properties. The studies also investigated blending of biodiesel with Euro diesel and butanol. Following this, a remarkable improvement in cloud and pour points of biodiesel was obtained. Spent coffee grounds after oil extraction is an ideal material for garden fertilizer, feedstock for ethanol, biogas production, and as fuel pellets. The outcome of such research work produces valuable insights on the recycling importance of SCG in Turkey. Implications: Coffee is a huge industry, and coffee has been widely used due to its refreshing properties. This industry generates large quantities of waste. Therefore, recycling of spent coffee grounds for producing alternative fuels and compounds of added value is crucial. Elemental analysis indicated that coffee waste can be utilized as compost, as it is rich in nitrogen. Coffee waste after oil extraction is an ideal feedstock for ethanol and biogas production, garden fertilizer, and as fuel pellets. The low degree of unsaturation provides excellent oxidation stability. Its biodiesel has also excellent cetane number, higher heating value, and lower iodine value. © 2018 A&WMA.

AB  - Following the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, COP21 (Paris, France), several countries have attempted to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. In order to reach this objective, microalgae could be used to capture carbon dioxide and transform it into a biomass composed essentially of lipids, carbohydrates and proteins. Moreover, cultivating microalgae does not require arable land, in opposition to several oleaginous plants used to produce biofuels. Despite the fact that microalgae could be transformed into several biofuels such as bioethanol (by fermentation of hydrocarbons) and biomethane (by anaerobic digestion), transforming lipids into biodiesel could allow the reduction of oil-based diesel consumption. However, microalgae biodiesel production costs remain high for a short-term commercialization. The microalgae lipids can be transesterified into biodiesel in the presence of catalysts (homogeneous or heterogeneous). In order to commercialize biodiesel from microalgae, biodiesel physicochemical properties must respect the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards. The aim of the study was to describe the current technologies available to produce biodiesel from microalgae. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Algae biomass is the most promising feedstock for biofuel production since it can provide a sustainable route to achieve independence from fossil fuel sources. Energy-positive biofuel production from algal biomass has been the major goal for many researchers in recent years. The search for efficient extraction and chemical conversion methods that produce high energy ratios has become an important endeavor in this field. In this regard, microwaves and ultrasound have been utilized as convenient mechanisms in algal biodiesel production. However, none of the studies reported on the energy analysis of the extraction and transesterification methods. Energy analysis of the extractive-transesterification processes using microwave (with ethanol and with ethanol and hexane as co-solvent) and ultrasound irradiations to produce biocrude from microalgae (Chlorella sp.) is presented in this paper. Power input and reaction volumes were varied to study the effects of power density and intensity on the biocrude yields. Results from this analysis show that a biocrude yield higher than 90% could be obtained with an energy input to output ratio of less than one when microwave irradiation is used as the heating mechanism. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - At low temperature, the presence of oleaginous compound with fatty acids bound to crystallize and cause operability problems with compression engines. In this present investigation, seven different fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) biodiesel from vegetable oils (such as sunflower, coconut, jatropha, rice bran, palm, neem and mahua) were prepared by transesterification and were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). Winterization of these synthesized biodiesel were carried out to find their usability at low temperatures (0 °C–20 °C) and the crystals formed were separated. Further, the differential scanning colorimetry (DSC) was employed to identify the onset of melting point of the biodiesel from vegetable oils. The results showed that crystal formation was observed for various biodiesel except sunflower oil that recorded no crystal formation with minimum temperature of 0 °C. These findings suggest that biodiesel synthesized from sunflower can be used as such at low temperatures compared to the other synthesized biodiesel from vegetable oil. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-fuels of the 2nd generation constitute a key approach to tackle both Greenhouse Gas (GHG) and air quality challenges associated with combustion emissions of the transport sector. Since these fuels are obtained of residual materials of the agricultural industry, well-to-tank CO2 emissions can be significantly lowered by a closed-cycle of formation and absorption of CO2. Furthermore, studies of bio-fuels have shown reduced formation of particulate matter on account of the fuels’ high oxygen content therefore addressing air quality issues. However, due to the high oxygen content and other physical parameters these fuels are expected to exhibit different ignition behaviour. Moreover, the question is whether there is a positive superimposition of the fuels ignition behaviour with the benefits of an alternative ignition system, such as a corona ignition. To shed light on these questions two oxygenic compounds, oxymethylene ether-1 (OME1) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) have been studied with respect to OH* emission throughout ignition and onset of flame-front propagation in a combustion chamber with a large optical access via a quartz window. OH* measurements have been recorded via a high-speed optical camera (5 kHz) coupled with 308 nm optical filter and image intensifier. Sealing material swelling tests have yielded a perfluoroelastomer (FFKM 72) as an ideal, cost-efficient material regardless of the applied fuel. Comparative measurements with both ignition systems for combustion of gasoline as well as moderate blend admixtures of OME1 and DMC have demonstrated the superior ignition stability with likewise implications on flame-kernel development for the corona ignition. Furthermore a strong influence of the mode of discharge on OH* formation rates was observed especially for the oxygenic blends. Finally, for admixture variations of both oxygenates, an increased OH* level was shown during discharge thereby proving the hypothesis of a positive superimposition of oxygenic fuel and corona ignition system.

AB  - The structure of premixed ethyl butanoate/O2/Ar flames stabilized on a flat burner at atmospheric pressure was studied by molecular beam mass spectrometry. Mole fraction profiles of the reactants, stable products, and major intermediates and temperature profiles were obtained in flames of stoichiometric (φ = 1) and rich (φ = 1.5) combustible mixtures. Experimental data are analyzed and compared with previously obtained experimental and numerical data for methyl pentanoate flames. The structure of ethyl butanoate flames is simulated using a detailed literature chemical-kinetic mechanism for the oxidation of fatty acid esters. The experimental profiles are compared with the simulated ones, and the conversion pathways of ethyl butanoate are analyzed. Based on a comparative analysis of experimental and simulated data, the main shortcomings of the model presented in the literature are identified and possible ways are proposed to improve the model. The decomposition of ethyl butanoate and methyl pentanoate are discussed based on an analysis of their conversion pathways; similarities and characteristic differences between their oxidation processes due to the structural differences of the molecules of the fuels are outlined. © 2018, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Supplying affordable, acceptable, and adequate sources of energy is one of the most important concerns of the communities. Due to the unbalanced distribution of fossil fuels, as well as their environmental effects, the utilization of renewable energies sources has been one of the main strategies. Due to the importance of transportation for societies, biofuels technologies is important part of researches, in particular algae. Algae are a type of single or multi-cellular organisms that are multiplying rapidly, and have photosynthesis-based growth and evolution. In this paper, after classifying and determining the main factors affecting the production of liquid fuels from microalgae, the feasibility and the best regions for production are discussed in the case study, Iran. The analysis method is multi criteria decision making in order to rank the best locations for microalgae growing. The results show that Iran has a high potential for microalgae utilization and the coastlines of Oman Sea and the Persian Gulf are the best regions for large-scale algae cultivation and processing projects. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The cultivation of microalgae for the production of biomass and associated valuable compounds has gained increasing interest not only within the scientific community but also at the industrial level. Microalgae cells are capable of producing high-value compounds that are widely used in food, feed, pharmaceutical, medical, nutraceutical, cosmeceutical, and aquaculture industries. For example, lipids produced by algae can be converted to biodiesel, other fuels and bio-products. Hence, high oil content algal biomass has been regarded as a potential alternative feedstock to replace terrestrial crops for sustainable production of bio-products. It has been reported that the interaction of microalgae and other microorganisms greatly enhances the efficiency of microalgal biomass production and its chemical composition. Microalgae-bacteria interaction with an emphasis on the nature of symbiotic relationship in mutualisitc and parasitic consortia has been extensively studied. For instance, it is well documented that production of vitamins or growth promoting factors by bacteria enhances the growth of microalgae. Little attention has been paid to the consortia formed by microalgae and other microorganisms such as other microalgae strains, cyanobacteria, fungi, and yeasts. Hence, the aim of this review is to investigate the impact of the microalgae-other microorganism interactions on the production of high value compounds. © 2018 Frontiers in Bioscience.

AB  - Environmental and economic concerns resulting from demand for fossil fuels corroborate the need for alternatives to reduce environmental and economic impacts arising from the increasing use of diesel-powered vehicles and machines. The diversification of raw materials used to produce biodiesel can allow the improvement of fuel quality and of emissions resulting from their use in engines. This study evaluated the emission of particulate matter (PM) using biodiesel from soybean and castor bean in diesel/biodiesel mixtures, as well as its viscosity and oxidation stability (prerequisites for quality). For this purpose, biodiesel with different proportions of soybean and castor bean (SyMx) were evaluated, where y and x represent soybean and castor bean biodiesel percentages, respectively: S100M0, S75M25, S50M50, S25M75 and S0M100, mixed with diesel (BX), in the following percentages: 7 (diesel B7), 25 (B25), 40 (B40), 50 (B50), 75 (B75) and 100% (B100). The smoke opacity, viscosity and oxidation stability were determined according to NBR 13037, NBR 10441 and EN 14112, respectively. Among the analyzed mixtures, the commercial diesel (B7) emitted higher amounts of PM, whereas other mixtures, which met the prerequisites for quality (B25 and B40), emitted smaller amounts of PM as increased castor bean biodiesel percentage in mixtures SyMx, as well as with the increase of biodiesel in the mixtures BX. They were also achieved gains in quality as a function of the different compositions SyMx. © 2018 Associação Brasileira de Engenharia Sanitária e Ambiental.

AB  - Biofuels, derived from renewable biological resource, are universally recognized as viable alternatives to fossils fuels foe powering automotive internal combustion engines. In this study, fuels blends with biofuels (methanol, butanol or ethanol) and pure ultra-low-sulfur oil were used in a turbocharged diesel engine to test its performance and exhaust emission compositions. It was found that addition of 2 wt. % methanol, butanol or ethanol to fuel blends reduced exhaust emissions on average by 4.15, 5.8, and 8.89%, respectively, when compared with ultra-low-sulfur diesel. The reason for the reduced emissions is absence of sulfur and sulfuric acid in the biofuel blends. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Transport biofuels are currently the fastest growing bioenergy sectors even they represent around 3-4% of total road transport fuel and only 6% of total bioenergy consumption today. Low oil prices and poor margins continue to challenge biofuel producers in Europe. Under current market conditions it is unlikely that the 7% cap will be reached in the EU by 2020. Since the past ten years, production of biodiesel from waste and animal fats has taken off, while the commercialization of cellulosic ethanol is lagging behind compared to former targets. Co-products are supposed to be credited with the area of cropland required to produce the amount of feed they substitute. If co-products are taken into account, the net use of land and feedstocks declines. Most existing biofuel regulations significantly undervalue the contribution of co-products when assessing the net land use and GHG impacts of biofuel production. Long-term transport shares are the most challenging to project because the range of possible vehicle technologies and fuel types in the future is very broad and future oil prices are uncertain. It is concluded that the rise in the use of biofuels has slowed down and sustainability criteria have been established regarding the use of land and the mitigation of environmental impacts caused by biofuel production. © 2018 General Jonas Zemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania.

AB  - The demand for higher output efficiencies, greater specific power output, increased reliability, and ever reduced emissions has been rising. Due to its availability one promising alternative is the use of butanol in internal combustion engines. In this study, the effects of n-butanol addition (5%, 15% and 25% by volume) to diesel fuel on the performance and exhaust emissions of a 6 cylinder four stroke turbocharged direct injection CI Diesel engine were investigated using GT-Power computational simulation tool. The simulations were performed by varying the engine speed between 1000 and 2000 rpm at four different loads of brake mean effective pressure (bmep) (4.5, 8.5, 10.5 and 12.75 bar). The performance and exhaust emissions of the engine when working with the three butanol-diesel blends were compared with neat diesel fuel. The results showed that the butanol-diesel blends reduced carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxide (NOX) by about 40% and 70% respectively, However carbon dioxide (CO2) and unburned hydrocarbon (HC) emissions increased. It was also found that the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) improved by more than 20% for butanol diesel blends when compared with the corresponding diesel fuel. Due to its optimum values in terms of emission and performance parameters 15% butanol-diesel blend was found to be the best choice. © 2018 Regional Energy Resources Information Center (RERIC).All Recived.

AB  - Microalgae have higher lipid production conversion efficiency via photosynthesis among all bio-organisms and are therefore considered the most promising feedstock for biofuel production. This experimental study was conducted to investigate the effects of light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation at various wavelengths and the type of sea water used for culture on the biomass growth rate and lipid characteristics of Nannochloropsis oculata. Microalgae were cultured separately in deep and surface sea water and irradiated with LEDs. The experimental results indicated that among the various culture conditions, culture in deep sea water under red LED irradiation yielded the largest microalgae biomass quantity. However, microalgae cultured in deep sea water under blue LED irradiation appeared to have the highest elemental carbon content, heating value, and crude microalgae lipid formation and lowest carbon residue. Hence, the use of deep sea water as a culture medium, together with blue LED irradiation, would lead to the production of microalgae biodiesel with superior fuel properties compared to those produced under various other conditions. Moreover, microalgae grown in deep sea water possessed significantly superior lipid characteristics and biodiesel properties compared to those grown in surface sea water. Hence, deep sea water is more effective for microalgae cultivation. In addition, microalgae biodiesel contained higher levels of both saturated and long carbon-chain fatty acids (ranging between C20 and C22) than used cooking-oil biodiesel. © 2018 Author(s).

AB  - To assure energy security source, a renewable nonedible plant such as Jatropha curcas oil (JCO) is attractive as a feedstock. However, the high viscosity of this vegetable oil is the main limitation on its fuel properties and makes it unsuitable for direct application in current diesel engines. Microemulsification is an alternative method for fuel production that reduces the by-products from the transesterification process. In this research, microemulsion fuels (MFs) were produced from crude JCO, diesel and ethanol in the presence of a surfactant. Three formulations of MFs with various composition of diesel and an ethanol-surfactant ratio were examined in terms of their biodiesel characteristics, performance and emission levels. For instance MF(E5), MF(E5)-LS1 and MF(E10)-LS1 were MFs without surfactant, ME with 5% and 10% of the ethanol-surfactant component, respectively. The high heating value, kinematic viscosity and water content of the MFs were close to the biodiesel standard and compatible for use with diesel engines. In addition, the MF(E5), gave an engine power, brake specific fuel consumption and exhaust gas temperature similar to those of petroleum-derived diesel. The emissions from these MFs showed a lower smoke emission than that of diesel, while the CO and CO2 emissions were similar to those of diesel. Thus MF(E5) showed great potential for use as biofuel with less exhaust smoke emission in diesel engines without modification. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of renewable microalgae is a potential promising technology for liquid biofuel production. This paper investigated the effect of ultrasonic pre-treatment of microalgae (Spirulina platensis) on HTL products distribution and oil quality. Cell disruption was enhanced with increasing of ultrasonic power and time. Liquefaction was promoted by larger ultrasonic power, but restrained by prolonged pre-processing time. Such promotion was found more pronounced at relatively lower liquefaction temperature. Combined with FT-IR, GC–MS and TG analysis, the ultrasonic pre-treatment increased the compounds at lower boiling point within the biocrude oil. The distillation characters of the hydrothermal oils were more near to the heavy Iraqi crude, with only 22 wt% in distillation zone of diesel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to determine farmers' willingness to adopt and allocate land for growing non-food oilseeds as bio-energy crops across the western US. A mail survey was conducted in three regions of the western US from randomly selected wheat farmers. Data was analyzed using Heckman's two stage selection model to correct for selection bias. Under favorable contracts, the study found that 58% of sample farmers were willing to adopt oilseeds as bio-energy crops and initially contribute an average of 160 acres of land for production per farm. Concerning farmers' adoption decisions, factors such as experience growing oilseed crops, availability of a nearby crushing facility, use of no till, being a first adopter and having a college degree positively affected adoption, while risk behavior, farm experience and gender negatively affected adoption. With regard to the land allocation decision, factors such as farm income and gender positively affected land allocation decisions, whereas percentage of land rented on a crop share basis, profit ratio (wheat/canola) and livestock ownership negatively affected land allocation decisions. © 2018

AB  - Energy economics is a vast topic. Many applied and agricultural economists today work on fuel economy, fossil fuel energy issues, energy sector economic analysis, electricity sector economic and policy issues, techno-economic analyses of energy alternatives as well as agricultural energy issues such as biofuels, and energy use in agriculture. Energy economists also employ a wide variety of modeling and analytical tools. We cover six broad topics: externalities, policy analysis, energy demand and supply analyses, electricity pricing, biofuels, and techno-economic analysis. Applied and agricultural economists have made and will continue to make major contributions to the literature and policy analysis in these areas. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The paper deals with performance measurement of combustion engines. Currently, in combustion engines is not used only fuel from fossil fuel (diesel, gasoline), but also the fuel of biological origin. Due to most engines are designed for fossil fuels, it is possible to expect a reduction of power parameters (lower calorific value of fuel) of biofuels. Whether the vehicle (tractor) fulfill the operational requirements of the user in that conditions, it is often necessary to control by measurement. The measurement can performed by using static (dynamometer) or dynamic methods. It is usually necessary to expect, that performance parameters of the engine with a turbocharger can be distorted by using dynamic methods. In the article is stated a comparison both of methods on road vehicle Skoda Octavia 1.8 turbo and tractor ZetorForterra 8641. © 2018, MM publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Increasing attention has been recently focused on producing biodiesel from non-edible organic materials to avoid competing on food sources. The focus of the present work is to assess the possibility of extracting oils from date seeds (DS), which is a waste biomass that can then be used in biodiesel production. Two cultivars of local date seeds, namely, Khalas and Allig, have been used. Oil was extracted by Soxhlet and Folch methods from DS particles in five size ranges (300 nm, 0.1–0.3 mm, 0.3–0.85 mm, 0.85–1.18 mm, and CloseSPigtSPi 1.18 mm) and compared to ungrounded DS. The size of the DS particles was found to have a clear effect on the oil extraction yield percentage (OEYP), which increased with the decrease in the particles size, excluding the nano-particles at which the OEYP reduced. The maximum OEYPs were achieved from Allig DS in the size range of 0.1–0.3 mm, which were 9.0 and 10.4%, using the Folch and Soxhlet extractions, respectively. The same size range, the maximum OEYPs, was also achieved from Khalas DS and was very close to those achieved from the Allig DS. The Soxhlet extraction was generally more effective than the Folch extraction in all size ranges. The difference in the effectiveness was minimum in the size range of 0.1–0.3 mm, and increased as the particles’ size increased. In the Folch process, the effects of the duration of main steps, namely, the ultra-sonication, orbital shaking, and centrifugation, on the OEYP, were evaluated. Using Allig DS in the size range of 0.1–0.3 mm, the effects of the times of ultra-sonication, above 1 min, and centrifugation on OEYP were insignificant, whereas the orbital shaking time had a slight negative effect. This work provides important information of the extraction process of oils from DS, and brings their use for biodiesel production closer to commercialization. © 2018, University of Tehran.

AB  - Many policies mandate renewable energy production to combat global climate change. These policies often differ significantly from first-best policy prescriptions. Among the largest renewable energy mandates enacted to date is the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which mandates biofuel consumption far beyond what is feasible with current technology and infrastructure. We critically review the methods used by the Environmental Protection Agency to project near- and long-term compliance costs under the RFS, and draw lessons from the RFS experience to date that would improve the program's efficiency. The lessons are meant to inform both future RFS rulemaking and the design of future climate policies. We draw two lessons specific to the RFS. First, incorporate uncertainty into rulemaking; second, implement multi-year rules. Multi-year rulemaking allows for longer periods between major regulatory decisions and sends greater certainty to markets. We also provide two more general recommendations: tie waiver authority to compliance costs or include cost containment provisions, and fund research and development of new technologies directly rather than mandating them. Future technological advancement is uncertain, and mandating new technologies has proven to be largely ineffective to date, particularly in fuel markets. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Complex mixture analysis is a costly and time-consuming task facing researchers with foci as varied as food science and fuel analysis. When faced with the task of quantifying oxygen-rich bio-oil molecules in a complex diesel mixture, we asked whether complex mixtures could be qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed on a single mass spectrometer with mid-range resolving power without the use of lengthy separations. To answer this question, we developed and evaluated a quantitation method that eliminated chromatography steps and expanded the use of quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry from primarily qualitative to quantitative as well. To account for mixture complexity, the method employed an ionization dopant, targeted tandem mass spectrometry, and an internal standard. This combination of three techniques achieved reliable quantitation of oxygen-rich eugenol in diesel from 300 to 2500 ng/mL with sufficient linearity (R 2 = 0.97 ± 0.01) and excellent accuracy (percent error = 0% ± 5). To understand the limitations of the method, it was compared to quantitation attained on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, the gold standard for quantitation. The triple quadrupole quantified eugenol from 50 to 2500 ng/mL with stronger linearity (R 2 = 0.996 ± 0.003) than the quadrupole-time-of-flight and comparable accuracy (percent error = 4% ± 5). This demonstrates that a quadrupole-time-of-flight can be used for not only qualitative analysis but also targeted quantitation of oxygen-rich lignin molecules in complex mixtures without extensive sample preparation. The rapid and cost-effective method presented here offers new possibilities for bio-oil research, including: (1) allowing for bio-oil studies that demand repetitive analysis as process parameters are changed and (2) making this research accessible to more laboratories.

AB  - The direct conversion of waste cooking oil (WCO) into bio-jet fuel was investigated over a core-shell hierarchical USY@Al-SBA-15 zeolite-supported NiMo catalyst. The core-shell structure showed better acid and pore size distributions. The synergetic effect of the core-shell micropore and mesopore structure significantly contributed to enhancing the selectivity for the jet fuel (C9–15 hydrocarbons) from 9.3 % over NiMo/USY up to 35.7 % over NiMo/USY@Al-SBA-15, with high isomerization (iso-/n-paraffins ratio = 2.7) and moderate aromatic fraction (18.7 %). The decarboxylation reaction was selectively enhanced. Optimal selectivity for jet fuel (39.7 %) was obtained at 380 °C and a high H2/oil ratio would decrease the yield of jet fuel. This catalyst showed excellent stability for the hydroconversion of WCO to hydrocarbons. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - The large demand for energy combined with ecological, economic, and social reasons encouraged the studies for alternative sources of fuel. The deoxygenation process of oils and fatty acids has emerged as a promising resource in obtaining fuels. This paper studied the deoxygenation process of oleic and stearic acids carried out in a distillation system, under the temperature of 450 °C over MCM-41, AlMCM-41-41, and HAlMCM-41 molecular sieves, which were synthesized by direct hydrothermal synthesis method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy in the infrared site (FTIR), adsorption and desorption of N2, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and acid-base titration. The results showed that stearic acid deoxygenates more than the oleic acid, and that the performance of HAlMCM-41 was superior to AlMCM-41, indicating that the total acidity positively influenced the process. Furthermore, from the stearic acid deoxygenation, it obtained mainly heptadecanes (C17:0) structures, while the oleic acid produces heptadecenes (C17:1). © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In this contribution, one-pot tandem conversion of fructose into biofuel components, including 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF), 2,5-(bis(ethoxymethyl)furan (BEMF) and ethyl levulinate (EL), was performed in an in-situ generated catalyst system through consecutive dehydration, etherification, and transfer hydrogenation. Specifically, ZrOCl2⋅8H2O was in-situ decomposed into HCl and ZrO(OH)2 in ethanol, which effectively catalyzed the dehydration/etherification of fructose to 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) and subsequent reductive etherification of EMF using ethanol as H-donor, respectively. EMF, BEMF and EL were detected as the main products, and total yield of detectable products of up to 65.4% was obtained at 200 °C in only 2 h. © 2018 Science Press

AB  - The aquatic plant Azolla became increasingly popular as bioenergy feedstock because of its high growth rate, production of biomass with high levels of biofuel-producing molecules and ability to grow on marginal lands. In this study, we analysed the contribution of all organs of Azolla to the total yield of lipids at vegetative and reproductive stages and in response to stress. Triacylglycerol-containing lipid droplets were detected in all (vegetative and reproductive) organs with the highest level in the male microsporocarps and microspores. As a result, significantly higher total yields of lipids were detected in Azolla filiculoides and Azolla pinnata at the reproductive stage. Starving changed the yield and composition of the fatty acid as a result of re-direction of carbon flow from fatty acid to anthocyanin pathways. The composition of lipids, in regard the length and degree of unsaturation of fatty acids, in Azolla meets most of the important requirements for biodiesel standards. The ability of Azolla to grow on wastewaters, along with their high productivity rate, makes it an attractive feedstock for the production of biofuels. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Biologically-derived hydrocarbons are considered to have great potential as next-generation biofuels owing to the similarity of their chemical properties to contemporary diesel and jet fuels. However, the low yield of these hydrocarbons in biotechnological production is a major obstacle for commercialization. Several genetic and process engineering approaches have been adopted to increase the yield of hydrocarbon, but a model driven approach has not been implemented so far. Here, we applied a constraint-based metabolic modeling approach in which a variable demand for alkane biosynthesis was imposed, and co-varying reactions were considered as potential targets for further engineering of an E. coli strain already expressing cyanobacterial enzymes towards higher chain alkane production. The reactions that co-varied with the imposed alkane production were found to be mainly associated with the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the lower half of glycolysis. An optimal modeling solution was achieved by imposing increased flux through the reaction catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (zwf) and iteratively removing 7 reactions from the network, leading to an alkane yield of 94.2% of the theoretical maximum conversion determined by in silico analysis at a given biomass rate. To validate the in silico findings, we first performed pathway optimization of the cyanobacterial enzymes in E. coli via different dosages of genes, promoting substrate channelling through protein fusion and inducing substantial equivalent protein expression, which led to a 36-fold increase in alka(e)ne production from 2.8 mg/L to 102 mg/L. Further, engineering of E. coli based on in silico findings, including biomass constraint, led to an increase in the alka(e)ne titer to 425 mg/L (major components being 249 mg/L pentadecane and 160 mg/L heptadecene), a 148.6-fold improvement over the initial strain, respectively; with a yield of 34.2% of the theoretical maximum. The impact of model-assisted engineering was also tested for the production of long chain fatty alcohol, another commercially important molecule sharing the same pathway while differing only at the terminal reaction, and a titer of 1506 mg/L was achieved with a yield of 86.4% of the theoretical maximum. Moreover, the model assisted engineered strains had produced 2.54 g/L and 12.5 g/L of long chain alkane and fatty alcohol, respectively, in the bioreactor under fed-batch cultivation condition. Our study demonstrated successful implementation of a combined in silico modeling approach along with the pathway and process optimization in achieving the highest reported titers of long chain hydrocarbons in E. coli. © 2018 International Metabolic Engineering Society

AB  - Glycerol acetals/ketals and their esters, produced from renewable raw materials, are highly valuable compounds, being used as oxygenated fuel additives and ecological solvents. A new method for obtaining glycerol acetal/ketal esters, difficult to synthesize using classical techniques, was developed. This method is based on the reversible reaction of 1,2-O-isopropylidene-glycerol esters (IPGEs) obtained from glycerin, by-product from biodiesel production, with low volatility aldehydes/ketones (e.g. furfural and ethyl levulinate, both obtained from lignocellulosic biomass), in the presence of a heterogeneous acid catalyst. To circumvent reaching equilibrium, the continuous removal of acetone (Ac) from the reaction mixture was done, the former being reused in the synthesis of IPGEs. The method viability was assessed by synthesis and characterization of eight new compounds from two classes: furfurylideneglycerol esters (FGEs) and ethyl levulinate glycerol ketal esters (ELGKEs). A detailed kinetic study was done throughout an experimental program, first developed in Asia 330, a modular range flow chemistry system, then in a continuous-flow process at micropilot scale. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Isobutanol as a more desirable biofuel has attracted much attention. In our previous work, an isobutanol-producing strain Escherichia coli LA09 had been obtained by rational redox status improvement under guidance of the genome-scale metabolic model. However, the low transformation from sugar to isobutanol is a limiting factor for isobutanol production by E. coli LA09. In this study, the intracellular metabolic profiles of the isobutanol-producing E. coli LA09 with different initial glucose concentrations were investigated and the metabolic reaction of fructose 6-phosphate to 1, 6-diphosphate fructose in glycolytic pathway was identified as the rate-limiting step of glucose transformation. Thus, redesigned carbon catabolism was implemented by altering flux of sugar metabolism. Here, the heterologous Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway from Zymomonas mobilis was constructed, and the adaptation of upper and lower parts of ED pathway was further improved with artificial promoters to alleviate the accumulation of toxic intermediate metabolite 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phospho-gluconate (KDPG). Finally, the best isobutanol-producing E. coli ED02 with higher glucose transformation and isobutanol production was obtained. In the fermentation of strain E. coli ED02 with 45 g/L initial glucose, the isobutanol titer, yield and average producing rate were, respectively, increased by 56.8, 47.4 and 88.1% to 13.67 g/L, 0.50 C-mol/C-mol and 0.456 g/(L × h) in a shorter time of 30 h, compared with that of the starting strain E. coli LA09. © 2018, Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - The chronic illness of transportation sector is its excessive dependence on petroleum products that necessitates immediate actions to mitigate negative externalities. Developing an environmentally benign, economically feasible, and socially acceptable fuel portfolio can generally, improve the sustainability of future transportation systems. This study aims to predict an optimal fuel portfolio based on different concerns for light-duty vehicles of Iran in the light of alternative fuels until 2025. Six potential fossil and renewable fuels including gasoline, diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquid petroleum gas (LPG), a mixture of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline (E85) and biodiesel, and one gasoline-electric hybrid technology competed through an integrated fuzzy multi-objective programming. Seven goals with environmental, cost, social and policy nature, as well as systematic constraints and fuel priority (obtained by the application of a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method) had to be met in the model. The solution of the model along with the sensitivity analysis of weights and aspiration levels indicated that with an acceptable possibility of achieving the goals, CNG had the greatest share in the optimal fuel portfolio followed by gasoline, LPG and diesel. Through the intended horizon, the fossil fuels’ share has declined such that 13.5% of the optimal portfolio was replaced by hybrid technology, biodiesel and E85 in 2025, and more importantly, carbon dioxide emission and fuel cost could be mitigated by 11% and 18%, respectively in the same year. Two scenarios focusing on environmental and cost goals were defined through assigning 70% and 80% of the weights to the related goals, respectively; the results revealed that the main characteristics of the optimal portfolio were stable. Likewise, the analysis of the aspiration and tolerance levels of the goals proved the stability of the model and revealed that these parameters play a sensitive role in the model and could affect the optimality and feasibility of the solutions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Upgrading of bio-oil obtained from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of algae is necessary for it to be used as a fuel. In this study, bio-oil obtained from HTL of Nannochloropsis sp. was upgraded using five different catalysts (Ni/C, ZSM-5, Ni/ZSM-5, Ru/C and Pt/C) at 300 °C and 350 °C. The upgraded bio-oil yields were higher at 300 °C; however, higher quality upgraded bio-oils were obtained at 350 °C. Ni/C gave the maximum upgraded bio-oil yield (61 wt%) at 350 °C. However, noble metal catalysts (Ru/C and Pt/C) gave the better upgraded bio-oils in terms of acidity, heating values, and nitrogen values. The higher heating value of the upgraded bio-oils ranged from 40 to 44 MJ/kg, and the nitrogen content decreased from 5.37 to 1.29 wt%. Most of the upgraded bio-oils (35–40 wt%) were in the diesel range. The major components present in the gaseous products were CH4, CO, CO2 and lower alkanes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, methyl ester of Sisymbrium plant seed oil with the chemical formula of C18H34O2 is produced for the first time, with the aid of ultrasonic waves and in the presence of a nanocatalyst. After measuring its characteristics and comparing with ASTM standard, it is tested and evaluated with different ratios of diesel fuel in a single-cylinder diesel engine. The reactions are accomplished in a flask by an ultrasonic processor unit and in the presence of CaO-MgO nanocatalyst. The engine tests were conducted based on the engine short time experiment. The results showed that with the increment of biodiesel ratio in the fuel blend, pollutants level of CO, HC, and smoke opacity are decreased comparing diesel fuel due to the improvement of the combustion process, and the amount of NOx emission is increased owing to high pressure and temperature of the combustion chamber. Also, produced biodiesel fuel causes an increment in the fuel consumption and exhaust gasses temperature. Overall, with regard to its effects on the engine and also being a native and easy cultivation plant, it can be resulted that Sisymbrium oil biodiesel and its blends with diesel fuel can be applied as an alternative fuel. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study conducted the updated simulations to depict a life cycle analysis (LCA) of the biodiesel production from soybeans and other feedstocks in the U.S. It addressed in details the interaction between LCA and induced land use change (ILUC) for biodiesel. Relative to the conventional petroleum diesel, soy biodiesel could achieve 76% reduction in GHG emissions without considering ILUC, or 66–72% reduction in overall GHG emissions when various ILUC cases were considered. Soy biodiesel's fossil fuel consumption rate was also 80% lower than its petroleum counterpart. Furthermore, this study examined the cause and the implication of each key parameter affecting biodiesel LCA results using a sensitivity analysis, which identified the hot spots for fossil fuel consumption and GHG emissions of biodiesel so that future efforts can be made accordingly. Finally, biodiesel produced from other feedstocks (canola oil and tallow) were also investigated to contrast with soy biodiesel and petroleum diesel. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Fuel biodegradation linked to sulfate reduction can lead to corrosion of the metallic infrastructure in a variety of marine environments. However, the biological stability of emerging biofuels and their potential impact on copper-nickel alloys commonly used in marine systems has not been well documented. Two potential naval biofuels (Camelina-JP5 and Fisher-Tropsch-F76) and their petroleum-derived counterparts (JP5 and F76) were critically assessed in seawater/sediment incubations containing a metal coupon (70/30 Cu-Ni alloy). Relative to a fuel-unamended control (1.2 ± 0.4 μM/d), Camelina-JP5 (86.4 ± 1.6 μM/d) and JP5 (77.6 ± 8.3 μM/d) stimulated much higher rates of sulfate reduction than either FT-F76 (11.4 ± 2.7 μM/d) or F76 (38.4 ± 3.7 μM/d). The general corrosion rate (r2 = 0.91) and pitting corrosion (r2 = 0.92) correlated with sulfate loss in these incubations. Despite differences in microbial community structure on the metal or in the aqueous or sediment phases, sulfate reducing bacteria affiliated with Desulfarculaceae and Desulfobacteraceae became predominant upon fuel amendment. The identification of alkylsuccinates and alkylbenzylsuccinates attested to anaerobic metabolism of fuel hydrocarbons. Sequences related to Desulfobulbaceae were highly enriched (34.2–64.8%) on the Cu-Ni metal surface, regardless of whether the incubation received a fuel amendment. These results demonstrate that the anaerobic metabolism of biofuel linked to sulfate reduction can exacerbate the corrosion of Cu-Ni alloys. Given the relative lability of Camelina-JP5, particular precaution should be taken when incorporating this hydroprocessed biofuel into marine environments serviced by a Cu-Ni metallic infrastructure. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As a renewable energy, biofuel has greatly attracted worldwide attention due to the growing demands for cleaner sources of energy as an intervention to mitigate the serious environmental problems associated with fossil fuel consumption. As an important non-food biodiesel plant, Pistacia chinensis has a promising prospect for bioenergy development. Based on the principles of multifactor integrated assessment, this paper provides an operational method for comprehensively evaluating the marginal land resources suitable for developing the plantation of Pistacia chinensis in Shaanxi province, China. The results show that the areas of marginal land resources suitable and fairly suitable for growing Pistacia chinensis in Shaanxi province are 1.21 million hectares and 4.45 million hectares, respectively. The suitable land resources are mainly located in Hanzhong (0.44 million hectares), Ankang (0.30 million hectares), and Shangluo (0.31 million hectares), most of which are moderate dense grassland (accounting for 50.65%), dense grassland (accounting for 21.83%), shrub land (accounting for 8.62%), and sparse forest land (accounting for 15.32%). The comparison between the results and field work data suggests that the pixel size of spatial data and soil organic matter content have important impacts on the final results. The outcome of this research can be used to implement specific policies for developing Pistacia chinensis in China and other countries especially the countries along the Silk Road.

AB  - Biofuels production is a fast growing and emerging industry. Occupational injuries are a serious problem due to their human, financial and social costs, yet little research has been published on injuries in the biofuels industry. Learning from past injuries are essential for preventing future occurrences, but the lack of injury information hinders this effort in the biofuels industry. The present study addresses this knowledge gap by utilizing data from over 900 workers’ compensation claims reported from 2008 to 2016 by ethanol and biodiesel facilities in the U.S. to characterize injury costs and severity. The total amount paid for each claim was used as a measure of injury severity, and the effects of age, tenure, type of claim, body part injured, nature and, cause of injury on the cost of work-related injuries were investigated. Contingency tables were used to classify the variable pairs, chi-square test and chi-square residuals were employed to evaluate the relation between the variable pairs and identify the at-risk groups. Results showed age, tenure of employee, type of claim, body part injured, nature of injury and, cause of injury have a significant influence in determining the claim amount. Age group 46–50, tenure group 1–2 years, strain and fractures injuries, slips, falls, or trips and, injuries to lower extremities were some of the at-risk groups identified. The findings from the study will assist biofuel producers to develop precisely targeted safety interventions that are effective in preventing worker injuries and also mitigating the financial and social losses from occupational injuries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although a relatively small contributor to annual anthropogenic CO2 emissions (~2.6%), commercial aviation activity is growing at ~5% per annum. As a result, alternative jet fuel (AJF) technologies have garnered interest as a means to achieve large, near-term emissions reductions for the industry. This analysis quantifies the potential for AJF to reduce aviation's CO2 emissions by assessing: the availability of AJF feedstock; AJF volumes that could be produced from that feedstock; the lifecycle emissions of AJF compared to petroleum-derived jet fuel; and the number of bio-refineries and capital investment required to achieve the calculated emission reductions. We find that, if the use of AJF is to reduce aviation's lifecycle GHG emissions by 50% or more by 2050, prices or policies will have to significantly incentivize the production of bioenergy and waste feedstocks, and AJF production will need to be prioritized over other potential uses of these resources. Reductions of 15% by 2050 would require construction of ~60 new bio-refineries annually (similar to growth in global biofuel production capacity in the early 2000s), and capital investment of ~12 billion USD2015 per year (~1/5 of annual capital investment in petroleum refining). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Since 2014 (Euro VI), heavy goods vehicles must be equipped with a complex exhaust gas post-treatment system including a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), a catalyst for the selective reduction of NOx (SCR), and a diesel particulate filter (DPF), with a required durability of 7 years or 700,000 km. Consequently, when biodiesel is used, especially pure biodiesel (B100), catalysts will be subjected over 700,000 km to kilogrammes of inorganic elements (Na, K, and P), even if they are limited to a few ppm in biodiesel fuel. The durability of the catalytic exhaust system is therefore questionable. This issue is of major concern to vehicle manufacturers. This study aims to make a detailed investigation of the impact of biodiesel use on the durability of the existing Euro VI catalytic systems, with a special focus on deactivation through poisoning for DOC and SCR catalysts, and on the physics and chemistry of particles and their reactivity. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Co-liquefaction of municipal sewage sludge (MSS) and lignocellulosic biomass such as rice straw or wood sawdust at different mixing ratios and the characterization of the obtained bio-oil and bio-char were investigated. Synergistic effects were found during co-processing of MSS with biomass for production of bio-oil with higher yield and better fuel properties than those from individual feedstock. The co-liquefaction of MSS/rice straw (4/4, wt) increased the bio-oil yield from 22.74% (bio-oil yield from liquefaction of MSS individually) or 23.67% (rice straw) to 32.45%. Comparable increase on bio-oil yield was also observed for MSS/wood sawdust mixtures (2/6, wt). The bio-oils produced from MSS/biomass mixtures were mainly composed of esters and phenols with lower boiling points (degradation temperatures) than those from individual feedstock (identified with higher heavy bio-oil fractions). These synergistic effects were probably resulted from the interactions between the intermittent products of MSS and those of biomass during processing. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Renewable Energies for Galápagos (ERGAL) project was launched in Ecuador as part of the “Zero fossil fuels on the Galápagos Islands” initiative. The ERGAL project strategy includes the “Jatropha for Galápagos” pilot project, which seeks to generate electricity from jatropha oil (JO) extracted from wild jatropha bushes, which are harvested by small-scale jatropha suppliers. Using life-cycle analysis, this study assessed the environmental impact of electricity produced from this biofuel under three systems: a blend system (BS) with 20% JO and 80% diesel, a reference system (RS) consisting of 100% diesel and a jatropha system (JS) made up of JO. The results show that the BS had slightly better environmental performance than RS, but worse than JS. Under the BS, the main environmental loads resulted from diesel combustion in electricity generation and the transportation of the raw material. An advantage of the BS is the low impact resulting from jatropha production, given that fertilizers are not used. However, this production strategy is highly dependent upon the presently limited yields from jatropha bushes. To increase the environmental sustainability of the BS, the logistics of transporting the fruits and improving their yields are key issues that should be considered. Finally, the low environmental impact of JS is due to diesel not being used in electricity production. However, fuel use for transportation of the high volumes of raw material and the refined product, coupled with the use of the purification substance as part of the refining are major contributors to environmental loads of JS. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Thermochemical processes can convert the biomass into fuels, such as bio-oil. The biomass submitted to pyrolysis process, such as fibers, are generally rich in silicon, an element that can lead to damages in an engine when there is high concentration in a fuel. High-resolution continuum source atomic absorption spectrometry (HR-CS AAS) is an interesting alternative for Si determination in the products and byproducts of the pyrolysis process because, besides the flame (F) and graphite furnace (GF) atomizers, it has enhanced the application of direct analysis of solid samples (SS) within GF. This study aimed the development of methods to determine Si in biomass samples, their products and byproducts using HR-CS AAS. A high-resolution continuum source atomic absorption spectrometer contrAA 700 equipped with F and GF atomizers was used throughout the study. HR-CS F AAS (λ = 251.611 nm, 1 detection pixel, N2O/C2H2 flame) was used to evaluate Si content in biomass and ash, after a microwave-assisted acid digestion with HNO3 and HF. HR-CS GF AAS (Tpyr = 1400 °C, Tatom = 2650 °C) has evaluated Si in pyrolysis water and bio-oil at 251.611 nm, and in peach pit biomass and ash at 221.174 nm using SS, both wavelengths with 1 detection pixel. Rhodium (300 μg) was applied as permanent modifier and 10 μg Pd + 6 μg Mg were pipetted onto the standards/samples at each analysis. Three different biomass samples were studied: palm tree fiber, coconut fiber and peach pit, and three certified reference materials (CRM) were used to verify the accuracy of the methods. The figures of merit were LOD 0.09–20 mg kg–1, and LOQ 0.3–20 mg kg–1, considering all the methods. There were no significant differences between the CRM certified values and the determined ones, using a Student t-test with a confidence interval of 95% (n = 5). Si concentration ranged from 0.11–0.92% m m–1, 1.1–1.7 mg kg–1, 3.3–13 mg kg–1, and 0.41–1.4% m m–1, in biomass, bio-oil, pyrolysis water and ash, respectively. Si remained mostly in the ash, leading to a mass fraction of up to 103%, even when the Si loss is not considered. Silicon concentration in bio-oil was below 1.7 mg kg–1, which is suitable for its application as a fuel. The developed methods using HR-CS AAS are suitable for Si determination in biomass, bio-oil, pyrolysis water, and ash. The application of bio-oil as an alternative fuel would be possible evaluating its Si content due to its low levels. The mass balance for Si has proved to be an important tool in order to evaluate the correct disposal of pyrolysis process byproducts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bio-oil, a promising candidate to replace fossil fuels, has received considerable attention for its sustainability, resource diversity and environmental benefits. Industrial production of bio-oil is urgently needed. In this study, a downdraft circulating fluidized bed reactor commercial-scale fast pyrolysis plant with biomass throughput of 1–3 t h− 1 is studied. Rice husk was processed at a fast pyrolysis temperature of 550 °C to evaluate the plant operation status. The system was continuously operated for 80.42 h. The thermal properties of the feedstock (rice husk), dust (separated from feedstock), char and heat carrier were analyzed and the bio-oil properties such as water content, pyrolytic water content, viscosity, density, pH, heating value, solid content and ash content were analyzed and presented. All the tested properties of the bio-oil meets the pyrolysis liquid biofuels standards in ASTM D7544-12 for Grade G biofuels, except for the water content of the bio-oil, which is slightly higher than that of Grade G biofuels. In energy balance analysis, the potential recovered energy of the three main products was 8.0 ± 1.1, 2.1 ± 0.1 and 5.3 ± 0.7 MJ kg− 1 for bio-oil, char and non-condensable gas, respectively, which shows that the largest portion of the energy in biomass was recovered in the bio-oil. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Food waste contributes to increase the environmental impact, besides the ethical issue. One interesting way of valorization is its conversion in biofuel, thus helping to boost the concept of circular economy. The target of this work was to find out the feasibility of the use of the oil included in solid food waste (SFW) to produce biodiesel that meets the European biodiesel standard EN 14214. For this purpose, Soxhlet extraction of the lipid fraction of SFW from different restaurants has been carried out. Fatty acid composition was analyzed and potential differences concerning the source of SFW were evaluated through principal component analysis. Results showed significant differences in the oil fatty acid composition depending on the restaurant. However, oil physical and chemical properties were similar, excepting the acid value. Due to the high free fatty acid content (acidity of 11.21 mg KOH/g) of the oil from fine dining restaurant residues, acid-catalyzed esterification pre-treatment to the alkaline transesterification was needed. The fatty acid composition of oils from SFW differs depending on the restaurant, but the range of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) is similar to that found in vegetable oils, showing a content of oleic acid (C18:1) between 36.39 and 41.57% w/w and linolenic acid (C18:2) of 21.37–38.63% w/w. Several chemical and physical properties of SFW oil biodiesel were analyzed. It was found that biodiesel fulfil the European standard EN 14214, with the exception of FAME yield, oxidation stability and glyceride content. For this reason and to improve biodiesel quality, further reaction optimization study, blending with diesel fuel or the use of additives is strongly recommended. It may be concluded, from this field trial, that oil from SFW from different restaurants may be mixed together and used to produce biodiesel. To corroborate this statement, further diesel engine tests are needed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising alternative fuel source which can promote energy security, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and minimize fuel consumption when paired with advanced combustion strategies. Pyrolysis is used to convert lignocellulosic biomass into a complex mixture of phenolic-rich species that can be used in a transportation fuel. Anisole (or methoxybenzene) can be used as a surrogate to represent these phenolic-rich species. Anisole also has attractive properties as a fuel component for use in advanced spark-ignition engines because of its high blending research octane number of 120. Presented in the current work are new measurements of laminar burning velocities, jet-stirred reactor (JSR) speciation of anisole/O2/N2 mixtures, and the development and validation of a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism for anisole. Homogeneous, steady state, fixed gas temperature, perfectly stirred reactor CHEMKIN simulations were used to validate the mechanism against the current JSR measurements and published JSR experiments from CNRS-Nancy. Pyrolysis and oxidation simulations were based on the experimental reactant compositions and thermodynamic state conditions including P = 1 bar and T = 675–1275 K. The oxidation compositions studied in this work span fuel-lean (ϕ = 0.5), stoichiometric, and fuel rich (ϕ = 2.0) equivalence ratios. Laminar burning velocities were measured on a heat flux stabilized burner at an unburnt T = 358 K, P = 1 bar and simulated using the CHEMKIN premixed laminar flame speed module. Ignition delay times of anisole were then simulated at conditions relevant to advanced combustion strategies. Current laminar burning velocity measurements and predicted ignition delay times were compared to gasoline components (e.g., n-heptane, iso-octane, and toluene) and gasoline surrogates to highlight differences and similarities in behavior. Reaction path analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to explain the pathways relevant to the current studies. Under pyrolysis and oxidative conditions, unimolecular decomposition of anisole to phenoxy radicals and methyl radicals was found to be important due to the relatively low bond strength between the oxygen and methyl group, ∼65 kcal/mol. Reactions of these abundant phenoxy radicals with O2 were found to be critical to accurately reproduce anisole's reactivity. © 2017 The Combustion Institute

AB  - An economic analysis for ethanol and electricity production in the sugarcane crushing industry in South Africa through first- and second-generation technologies, and integration strategies was carried out. The analysis included capital allowances to upgrade the energy efficiencies of existing sugar mills, to allow co-production of electricity, production of second-generation ethanol from hemicellulose, and export of lignocellulose residues from these facilities. Methodologies included mass and energy balances in Aspen Plus® and economic models in MS Excel to determine the required selling prices for electricity, sugarcane residues and ethanol, for these investments. The required selling price for electricity for the sugarcane crushing industry was US$ 97/MWhr, while that of bagasse residues was US$ 90/ton. A first-generation ethanol plant with electricity co-generation from bagasse has an ethanol selling price of US$ 0.84/l, which was highly dependent of the cane price, and reduced significantly when second-generation production from hemicelluloses of bagasse and trash was incorporated. The selling price of US$ 0.38/l for integrated second-generation ethanol at a sugar mill was the lowest, but however, was highly dependent on technological efficiency. Standalone second-generation ethanol was unfeasible due to the costs of the infrastructure needed to provide bagasse as a ­feedstock. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Aim of this paper is to present an engineering tool for the design and modeling of the upgrading of three biomass derived liquids (bio-oil, vegetable oil and algal oil) through hydrotreating process for the production of advanced biofuels. For each case, the appropriate approach was followed regarding the model compound selection for each bio-feedstock, the main reactor modeling, the products separation and purification and the make-up hydrogen production. Simulation runs were performed in ASPEN Plus™ and revealed the importance for make-up H2 production from recovered light gases and external fuel such as natural gas (the heat content on LHV basis if the inlet natural gas is 7.4% of the produced fuel in the jatropha oil case), showing also the beneficial impact of a good catalyst. The energy balance calculations showed that the most energy demanding components are the air compressor before reformer and make-up H2 compressor at the hydrogen production plant. The assumption of a chemical equilibrium can be regarded as a well-fitting and valid approach for the process design. The representation of bio-liquid by a model compound (i.e. palmitic acid in case of algal oil) may result in good estimations in terms of mass (0.845 kgG-Diesel/kgalgal-oil product yield) and heat balance of the total process (94.9% thermal efficiency) but all the detected fatty acid is suggested be taken into account for a more detailed analysis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The global awareness to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from aviation and thereby make the overall aviation sector more environmentally friendly has increased in recent years. In this context one main driver is seen in the development of advanced biofuels for aviation, which have already been used for some regular flights by various air carrier. Within this context this paper compares four different production processes for biokerosene located in northern Germany using two different types of biomass feedstock each. These conversion processes are then assessed in terms of technical, economic and environmental criteria based on data retrieved from an extensive process simulation. Main outcome of this analysis are mass and energy balances, kerosene production costs and GHG emissions for the investigated conversion routes. The results of the investigated criteria are scattering significantly; i.e. no “silver bulled” can be seen based on these findings. Nevertheless, the significant influence of the provision of the biomass feedstock becomes obvious. Generally spoken the more environmentally sound and economic viable the feedstock provision can be realized, the more promising is the resulting biokerosene related to the economic and environmental criteria assessed here. This result is more or less independent from the respective conversion route. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, we investigated the fractional distillation on bench scale of four organic liquid products (OLPs) obtained by thermal-catalytic cracking of crude palm oil using 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% (w/w) sodium carbonate as the catalyst. The main objective of this work was to obtain biofuels similar to fuels derived from petroleum such as jet fuel and diesel fuel. Thus, the fractionation experiments were carried out at atmospheric pressure and in two distillation temperature ranges, 160–245 °C and 245–340 °C, obtaining two distilled fractions denominated green jet fuel and green diesel, respectively. The distilled fractions (biofuels) have been physical-chemical characterized by Officials AOCS and ASTM Methods regarding specific gravity at 20 °C, kinematic viscosity at 40 °C, corrosiveness to copper, acid value, saponification value, refractive index, and distillation curve. The chemical composition of distilled fractions has been determined by GC–MS. The results of the fractionation of the OLPs show that sodium carbonate is an excellent catalyst regarding yield and selectivity for the production, firstly of green diesel and secondly of green jet fuel. Most physical-chemical properties of green jet fuel and green diesel fractions are within limits established by ANP No. 37 for conventional jet fuel [aviation kerosene (QAV-1/JET A-1)] and ANP No. 65 for commercial diesel (diesel S10), respectively. The experimental distillation curve of the green jet and green diesel fractions are similar to the standard distillation curve of aviation kerosene and diesel S10, respectively. Results from GC–MS analysis revealed that the size of the hydrocarbon chains constituting the green jet fuel (C10-C15) and green diesel (C14-C17) fractions obtained in the present study are in agreement with the length of the chains of hydrocarbons established for aviation kerosene and diesel S10, respectively. In parallel, the increase of catalyst in the thermal-catalytic cracking process improved the yield, selectivity, physical-chemical properties and chemical composition of both biofuels. Therefore, the results presented in this paper indicate that green jet fuel and green diesel fractions can be used as a partial or total substitute for aviation kerosene and diesel S10, respectively. © 2017

AB  - In this work we propose a data independent framework for the optimal integration of renewable sources of energy to produce fuels and power. A network is formulated using surrogate models for various technologies that use solar energy (photovoltaic, concentrated solar power or algae to produce oil), wind, biomass (to obtain ethanol, methanol, FT-liquids and thermal energy), hydroelectric, and waste (to produce power plant via biogas production). The optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model that evaluates the use of renewable resources and technologies and their integration to meet power and fuels demand; sustainability and CO2 emissions are also considered. The network can be applied to evaluate process integration at different scales, county to country level, including uncertainty availability of resources. Spain and particular regions are used as a case study. The framework suggests that larger integration uses the resources more efficiently, while considering uncertainty in resource availability shows larger cost to ensure meeting the demand. For the particular case considered, hydropower is widely used while biofuels are produced close to large populated regions when larger areas are evaluated; otherwise a more distributed solution is proposed. Reaching large fuel substitution is difficult at current biomass yields and technology state of development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Several alternative synthetic fuels are in discussion as a replacement for conventional fuels like Jet A-1 to cope with limited supplies of crude oil as well as their emissions connected with its use such as the greenhouse gas CO2. One of the alternative fuels which have received high attention recently is farnesane (2,6,10-trimethyldodecane), a biofuel produced from sugar using a biotechnological process. In this paper, combustion characteristics of farnesane were investigated by measuring its ignition delay time using a shock tube at elevated pressure (16 bar) and two different stoichiometries (φ = 1.0 and φ = 2.0) and the laminar burning velocity at atmospheric and elevated pressures (1, 3, and 6 bar). These results were compared to a conventional Jet A-1 fuel showing that farnesane has a similar combustion behavior. Furthermore, a reaction model was developed capable to predict the measured combustion properties. The calculation of the ignition delay times yields excellent results when compared to the measurements; the computations of the laminar flame speeds are in good agreement with the measurements. In addition, the reaction model was analyzed to get further insight into the main reaction steps of farnesane oxidation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Non-edible oils (Brassiceae family) were utilized for biodiesel production. Biodiesel was produced from four plants seeds oils and blended with ULSD. Two different methods were used for extraction of oil and the crude oil yields were 77.4 ± 2.14, 78.73 ± 3.1, 71.02 ± 2.15, 62.3 ± 3.4 (%) for B. napus, B. nigra, B. campestris and C. sativa plants, respectively. The oil obtained was pre-treated (chemical refinement through degumming, neutralization and bleaching) and was subjected to alkali-catalysed trans-esterification. Quality of produced biodiesel was compared with the fuel standards (ASTM D6751, ASTM D975, ASTM D7467 and EN 14214 and EN 590) and biodiesel properties were recorded to be in line with standards criteria except the kinematic viscosity of B. napus, B. nigra and C. sativa methyl esters and oxidative stability of B. napus and C. sativa. The fatty acids analysis by Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry revealed the highest proportion of erucic acid (43%) in methyl esters along with other minor components. The properties of methyl esters, both pure and blended were comparable with biodiesel fuels standards. So far, methyl esters properties of Brassiceae family plants are acceptable based on biodiesel standards and methyl esters can be used in blends with ULSD as a fuel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present work, usage of the carbonized mistalea (viscum album L.) as an eco-friendly, cheap and easy prepeared heterogeneous catalyst is proposed for partial hydrogenation reaction of biodiesel. The catalyst produced by carbonization process was carefully characterized by FTIR, SEM and BET methods and also elemental analysis. Effectiveness of the obtained catalyst was investigated by using for the partial hydrogenation of corn-oil biodiesel. The biodiesel product after partial hydrogenation has been investigated by means of Fatty acid methyl esters, oxidation stability, pour point and cloud point. Even if a small amount of the catalyst was used, it showed high catalytic activity for the partial hydrogenation reaction. As a result it can be reccomended as a potential catalyst for the similar studies in this area. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Renewable energy generation through biorefineries is increasingly considered as more sustainable in comparison with fossil-based fuels as well as single-product renewable energy systems. However, biorefineries have many system variations, and therefore, the evaluation of their environmental performance and comparison with conventional systems before large-scale deployment is essential. In this paper, the sustainability of three different biorefiney scenarios (Sc-1, Sc-2, and Sc-3) based on Eruca sativa (ES) as feedstock were investigated using a life cycle assessment approach from energy balance and environmental point of views. Biodiesel, electricity, ethanol, heat, glycerol, and/or biomethane were the marketable products taken into account under the conditions of these scenarios. According to the results obtained, we argue that although biorefineries offer unique features as most effective alternatives for mitigating climate change and reducing dependence on fossil fuels, the selection of biomass processing options and management decisions can widely affect the final evaluation results. Overall, providing transportation fuel through Sc-2 in which biodiesel, electricity, ethanol, heat, and glycerol were produced could decrease GHG emissions by approximately 140% compared with the combustion of neat diesel while also offering a total net energy gain (NEG) of 4.94E+08 MJ/yr. Nevertheless, if biorefineries are to be used for future transportation fuel production, a great deal of efforts should still be made to achieve better environmental performance in the Human Health and Ecosystem quality damage categories. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Thermal cracking of waste cooking oil (WCO) for production of liquid fuel has gained special interest due to the growing demand of renewable fuel, depleting fossil fuel reserves and environmental issues. In the present work, thermal cracking of WCO to produce liquid hydrocarbon fuels without any preprocessing has been studied. Moreover, non-isothermal kinetics of WCO using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) has been studied under an inert atmosphere at various heating rates. According to TGA result, active thermal decomposition of WCO was found to be between 318 and 500 °C. Furthermore, the temperature at which the maximum mass loss rate attained was shifted to higher values as the heating rates increased from 10 to 50 °C min−1 and the values were found to be approximately similar to that of R50. Besides, model-free iso-conversion kinetic methods such as Friedman (FM), Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS) and Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO) were used to determine the activation energies of WCO degradation. The average activation energy for the thermal degradation of WCO was found to be 243.7, 211.23 and 222 kJ mol−1 for FM, KAS and FWO kinetic methods, respectively. Additionally, the cracking of WCO was studied in a semi-batch reactor under an inert atmosphere and the influences of cracking temperature, time and heating rates on product distribution were investigated. From the reaction, an optimum yield of 72 mass% was obtained at a temperature of 475 °C, time of 180 min and a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The physicochemical properties studied were in accordance with ASTM standards. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - A relationship between exergy and HHV (higher heating value) for a fuel bridges a way for estimating the exergy of the fuel. The HHVs and exergy values of twenty eight rice husk samples and twenty four rice straw samples are investigated in this study to determine if there is a general relationship between exergy and HHV for rice residues. The results obtained from this study show that the HHVs of the rice husk samples are in the range of 9735.20–17285.00 kJ/kg whereas the exergy values are in the range of 10918.00–18458.00 kJ/kg. A specific relationship between exergy and HHV is observed for the rice husk samples, and the relative errors are −4.114%–2.621%. The HHVs of the rice straw samples are in the range of 10334.80–19942.90 kJ/kg whereas the exergy values are in the range of 11700.00–21506.00 kJ/kg. A specific relationship between exergy and HHV is observed for the rice straw samples, and the relative errors are −3.350%–2.027%. A general relationship between exergy and HHV is then observed for the rice residues, and the relative errors are −4.195%–2.623%. With these acceptable relative errors, the general relationship observed in this study can be used for expeditious calculation of the exergy of rice residues. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In-line hydro-treatment of bio-oil vapor from fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass (hydro-pyrolysis of biomass) is studied as a method of upgrading the liquefied bio-oil for a possible precursor to green fuels. The nobel metal (Pt) and non-noble metal catalysts (Mo2C and WC) were compared at 500 °C and atmospheric pressure which are same as the reaction conditions for fast pyrolysis of biomass. Results indicated that under the pyrolysis conditions, the major components, such as acids and carbonyls, of the fast pyrolysis bio-oil can be completely and partially hydrogenated to form hydrocarbons, an ideal fossil fuel blend, in the hydro-treated bio-oil. The carbide catalysts perform equally well as the Pt catalyst regarding to the aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon formation (ca. 60%), showing the feasibility of using the cheap non-noble catalysts for hydro-pyrolysis of biomass. © 2017, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Transport biofuels derived from biogenic material are used for substituting fossil fuels, thereby abating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Numerous competing conversion options exist to produce biofuels, with differing GHG emissions and costs. In this paper, the analysis and modeling of the long-term development of GHG abatement and relative GHG abatement cost competitiveness between crop-based biofuels in Germany are carried out. Presently dominant conventional biofuels and advanced liquid biofuels were found not to be competitive compared to the substantially higher yielding options available: sugar beet-based ethanol for the short- to medium-term least-cost option and substitute natural gas (SNG) for the medium to long term. The competitiveness of SNG was found to depend highly on the emissions development of the power mix. Silage maize-based biomethane was found competitive on a land area basis, but not on an energetic basis. Due to land limitations, as well as cost and GHG uncertainty, a stronger focus on the land use of crop-based biofuels should be laid out in policy. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Triglycerides and fatty acid derivatives can be converted to hydrocarbon-grade green diesel that are entirely fungible to the fossil fuels. In the present study, deoxygenation (DO) process of triolein was studied by using mesoporous SiO2-Al2O3 supported Co-Ca catalyst. The presence of active metals (Co-Ca) showed high DO activity exclusively via decarboxylation/decarbonylation (deCOx) pathways with maximum hydrocarbon n-(C8-C20) yield of 73%, and high selectivity of n-C15 and n-C17 fractions. This results suggested the acid-base active sites of catalyst provide selective deCOx pathway of triglycerides structure. In additional, the presence of high surface area of Co-Ca/ SiO2-Al2O3 enhance the metal dispersion for better accessment of large molecular reactant with catalyst during DO process. An optimum Co metal content (10 wt.%) for deCOx reaction was observed, while an excess Co content is not preferable due to tendency of cracking effect. The efficiency of Co-Ca/SiO2-Al2O3 was investigated by using non-edible feedstock (e.g. Ceiba oil and Sterculia oil) along with catalyst stability study were carried out. Resulst also indicated that degradation of DO activity was due to the formation of coke. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuels are an alternative to petroleum fuels in transportation. Among various biofuels, biodiesel has been mixed with diesel fuel for use in compression ignition (CI) engines. Many countries legislate that standard diesel fuels contain a certain amount of biodiesel to reduce exhaust emissions. An increase in biodiesel content to a 20% volumetric ratio (B20) requires only minor modification to existing vehicle systems. Since discrepancies in fuel properties between B20 and conventional diesel fuel, much research has been performed on B20 combustion and emissions for the implementation of vehicles. The present study investigated spatial B20 combustion and soot emission processes in an optical CI engine under various injection pressure conditions. Volumetric 20% of soybean biodiesel added to diesel fuel and both blend fuel and conventional diesel fuel were used as test fuels. Apparent combustion and emissions were observed with respect to auto-ignition, brake power, and thermal efficiency. In addition, visualization system permitted a profound analysis of the spatial combustion flame and soot propagation. A two-color photometric method extracted quantitative soot density from the captured combustion images, which allowed to study the soot formation and oxidation processes. Although soot emissions decreased significantly out of the engine, the variations in the soot formation and oxidation processes in the combustion chamber were remarkable. Compared with neat diesel flame B20 fuel produced higher flame temperature over all injection pressure conditions. While B20 flame temperature was increased, soot emission of B20 fuel was exhausted with higher concentrations. Under a low load and high speed condition, B20 emissions revealed different results from those of general bio-blends with high thermal efficiency regardless of the injection pressure. © 2017

AB  - Two diesel buses respectively certified to meet China Ⅲ and China Ⅴ emission standards were used as prototype vehicles, fixed on a heavy-duty chassis dynamometer and driven according to a typical city bus driving cycle to analyze the pollutant emissions and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The buses were fueled with diesel and waste cooking oil based biodiesel with 10 vol% blend ratio (B10). The emissions of total hydrocarbon(THC), CO, particulate matter (PM), and the number of solid particles with a diameter of 23 nm to 2.5 μm (referred to as "solid particulate number of PM2.5") from the bus certified to meet China Ⅴ (referred to as "China V bus") were 39.3%, 19.9%, 77.4%, and 28.4% lower than those from the other bus certified to meet China Ⅲ (referred to as "China Ⅲ bus"), while NOx emissions were 31.7% higher. Moreover, alkanes, alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, and oxygenated compounds in VOCs emitted from the China V bus were lower than those emitted from the China Ⅲ bus, suggesting lower atmospheric reactivity and smaller potential of secondary organic aerosol formation. Compared with the emission results of two diesel-fueled buses, the B10-fueled buses emitted smaller amounts of THC, CO, PM, and solid particulate number of PM2.5, lower oxygenated compounds but higher alkenes; slightly higher NOx emissions than China Ⅲ but slightly lower NOx emissions than China V. Consequently, the atmospheric reactivity of VOCs in exhaust gas from the bus fueled with B10 was higher than that from the diesel-powered bus. © 2018, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - The Nepal Ambient Monitoring and Source Testing Experiment (NAMaSTE) characterized widespread and under-sampled combustion sources common to South Asia, including brick kilns, garbage burning, diesel and gasoline generators, diesel groundwater pumps, idling motorcycles, traditional and modern cooking stoves and fires, crop residue burning, and heating fire. Fuel-based emission factors (EFs; with units of pollutant mass emitted per kilogram of fuel combusted) were determined for fine particulate matter (PM2.5), organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), inorganic ions, trace metals, and organic species. For the forced-draft zigzag brick kiln, EFPM2.5 ranged from 12 to 19gkg-1 with major contributions from OC (7%), sulfate expected to be in the form of sulfuric acid (31.9%), and other chemicals not measured (e.g., particle-bound water). For the clamp kiln, EFPM2.5 ranged from 8 to 13gkg-1, with major contributions from OC (63.2%), sulfate (23.4%), and ammonium (16%). Our brick kiln EFPM2.5 values may exceed those previously reported, partly because we sampled emissions at ambient temperature after emission from the stack or kiln allowing some particle-phase OC and sulfate to form from gaseous precursors. The combustion of mixed household garbage under dry conditions had an EFPM2.5 of 7.4±1.2gkg-1, whereas damp conditions generated the highest EFPM2.5 of all combustion sources in this study, reaching up to 125±23gkg-1. Garbage burning emissions contained triphenylbenzene and relatively high concentrations of heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Sb), making these useful markers of this source. A variety of cooking stoves and fires fueled with dung, hardwood, twigs, and/or other biofuels were studied. The use of dung for cooking and heating produced higher EFPM2.5 than other biofuel sources and consistently emitted more PM2.5 and OC than burning hardwood and/or twigs; this trend was consistent across traditional mud stoves, chimney stoves, and three-stone cooking fires. The comparisons of different cooking stoves and cooking fires revealed the highest PM emissions from three-stone cooking fires (7.6-73gkg-1), followed by traditional mud stoves (5.3-19.7gkg-1), mud stoves with a chimney for exhaust (3.0-6.8gkg-1), rocket stoves (1.5-7.2gkg-1), induced-draft stoves (1.2-5.7gkg-1), and the bhuse chulo stove (3.2gkg-1), while biogas had no detectable PM emissions. Idling motorcycle emissions were evaluated before and after routine servicing at a local shop, which decreased EFPM2.5 from 8.8±1.3 to 0.71±0.45gkg-1 when averaged across five motorcycles. Organic species analysis indicated that this reduction in PM2.5 was largely due to a decrease in emission of motor oil, probably from the crankcase. The EF and chemical emissions profiles developed in this study may be used for source apportionment and to update regional emission inventories. © 2018 Author(s).

AB  - In this paper, we have produced bio diesel from papaya and watermelon seed oil by trans-esterification process using methanol and KOH (catalyst) and a new biodiesel i.e. WP is produced which is a mixture of papaya seed oil biodiesel and watermelon seed oil biodiesel in 1:1 ratio is prepared. The blends (B0, B20, B30, B40, and B100) of WP with diesel and watermelon 100% and papaya 100% are used for further testing. The performance, combustion and emission test were conducted on single cylinder 4-stroke diesel engine using different blends of these biodiesels and the results showed that B20 is superior blend among other biodiesel blends. Further the performance and combustion characteristics of B20 is very close to diesel while the emission characteristics of B20 is better than that of diesel as the emission of CO, HC and smoke is 27.27%, 23.8%, 8.3% less for B20 than diesel respectively. Thus we concluded that B20 is the most suitable blend of WP for substitute of diesel which will reduce diesel consumption by 20%. © 2017

AB  - This paper examines alternative strategies for eliminating the use of oil for passenger transportation in light duty vehicles (LDVs: cars, SUVs and light trucks) by 2060, namely, deep reductions in the energy intensity (MJ/vkm) of LDVs combined with a shift to hybrid and/or all-electric vehicles, or combined with a shift of the residual fuel requirements to C-free fuels (either renewable biofuels or hydrogen produced from C-free energy sources, and used in a fuel cell). Different combinations of these measures have dramatically different implications concerning land area requirements (for biofuels), additional electricity requirements (for electric vehicles or to produce hydrogen electrolytically), and in the demand for potentially limiting metals (Pt, Ru, Li and Nd in particular). Recent estimates of battery, fuel cell and motor sizes in advanced vehicles, and corresponding material loadings, are combined with scenarios for the growth of the global vehicle fleet and recycling potential to estimate future material requirements. For any of the alternative to fossil fuels to be sustainable over the next century, it is essential that LDV energy intensity be pushed to the lowest technically achievable potential, that significant reductions in precious metal loadings be achieved, and that 90% or better recycling efficiency be achieved. Even then, longer term sustainability is not guaranteed, which implies that the primary emphasis in urban development and redevelopment over the next century should be to create cities with little to no dependence on the private automobile for transportation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Syngas and biogas are two typical biofuels generated from biomass wastes through gasification and anaerobic digestion processes, which are considered to be the future fuels for IC engines. In this work, the utilization of biogas and syngas produced from horticultural waste in a premixed spark ignition engine was investigated. An experimentally validated KIVA4-based CFD simulation integrated with CHEMKIN was performed to evaluate engine performance fuelled by syngas and biogas under both single and blended-fuel modes. Effects of ignition timing, hydrogen content in syngas and methane content in biogas on both energetic and environmental performance have been studied. The indicated thermal efficiency (ITE) of syngas fueled engine at wide open throttle (WOT) condition under maximum brake torque (MBT) operation was found to be higher than that of biogas fueled engine, meanwhile, with much lower NOx emission. In addition, a comparison of the engine performance between the single and blended-fuel modes under different syngas mixing ratios was conducted in terms of ITE and NOX emission. The results suggest that the utilization of syngas and biogas under blended-fuel mode can not only maintain the MBT energetic performance under single-fuel mode, but also show its potential in reducing NOx emission and lessening the tendency of knock onset. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Predicted scarcity of conventional fuels and their increasing cost have given rise to interest in alternative fuels like biofuels, ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol, hydrogen, producer gas, acetylene etc. in order to meet the energy requirement. Gaseous fuels are good for clean burning, but are costly. In the present study, a single cylinder, four strokes, direct injection, vertical, water cooled, variable compression ratio, multi fuel engine was used to operate in dual fuel mode. In this experiment acetylene was inducted at a flow rate of 7 lpm at various compression ratios of 18:1, 18.5:1, 19:1 and 19.5:1. Results were evaluated and compared on the basis of combustion, performance and emission parameters. Peak cylinder pressure and brake thermal efficiency are found to increase whereas exhaust gas temperature decreases with increase in compression ratio. The brake thermal efficiency was found to be maximum (21.18%) at 19.5:1 compression ratio. © 2017

AB  - In present study, engine exhaust was sampled for measurement and analysis of unregulated emissions from a four cylinder transportation diesel engine using a state-of-the-art FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) emission analyzer. Test fuels used were Karanja biodiesel blend (B20) and baseline mineral diesel. Real-time emission measurements were performed for raw exhaust as well as exhaust sampled downstream of the two in-house prepared non-noble metal based diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs) and a baseline commercial DOC based on noble metals. Two prepared non-noble metal based DOCs were based on Co-Ce mixed oxide and Lanthanum based perovskite catalysts. Perovskite based DOC performed superior compared to Co-Ce mixed oxide catalyst based DOC. Commercial noble metal based DOC was found to be the most effective in reducing unregulated hydrocarbon emissions in the engine exhaust, followed by the two in-house prepared non-noble metal based DOCs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The production of fuels and chemicals from renewable resources is increasingly important due to the environmental concern and depletion of fossil fuel. Despite the fast technical development in the production of aviation fuels, there are still several shortcomings such as a high cost of raw materials, a low yield of aviation fuels, and poor process techno-economic consideration. In recent years, olefin metathesis has become a powerful and versatile tool for generating new carbon-carbon bonds. The cross-metathesis reaction, one kind of metathesis reaction, has a high potential to efficiently convert plant oil into valuable chemicals, such as α-olefin and bio-aviation fuel by combining with a hydrotreatment process. Results: In this research, an efficient, four-step conversion of plant oil into bio-aviation fuel and valuable chemicals was developed by the combination of enzymatic transesterification, olefin cross-metathesis, and hydrotreating. Firstly, plant oil including oil with poor properties was esterified to fatty acid methyl esters by an enzyme-catalyzed process. Secondly, the fatty acid methyl esters were partially hydrotreated catalytically to transform poly-unsaturated fatty acid such as linoleic acid into oleic acid. The olefin cross-metathesis then transformed the oleic acid methyl ester (OAME) into 1-decene and 1-decenoic acid methyl ester (DAME). The catalysts used in this process were prepared/selected in function of the catalytic reaction and the reaction conditions were optimized. The carbon efficiency analysis of the new process illustrated that it was more economically feasible than the traditional hydrotreatment process. Conclusions: A highly efficient conversion process of plant oil into bio-aviation fuel and valuable chemicals by the combination of enzymatic transesterification, olefin cross-metathesis, and hydrotreatment with prepared and selected catalysts was designed. The reaction conditions were optimized. Plant oil was transformed into bio-aviation fuel and a high value α-olefin product with high carbon utilization. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - With the rapidly diminishing fossil fuel resources, development of a new strategy for synthesis of biofuels from renewable resources can provide a sustainable alternative to our energy demand. We present the design, synthesis, and characterization of a new porous organic network (TpPON) through acid-catalyzed condensation of 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (Tp) and triphenylamine (TPA). Ru0 nanoparticles are successfully fabricated at the porous surface of TpPON to obtain a novel catalytic system Ru@TpPON, which exhibits excellent catalytic performance together with outstanding stability for the hydrodeoxygenation of various vegetable oils to long-chain alkanes in water, and thus TpPON has wide potential for large-scale biodiesel production from renewable resources. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Supported bimetallic catalysts have been demonstrated to enhance catalytic activity, product selectivity, and catalyst stability over supported monometallic catalysts for a range of catalytic reactions. However, the surface structure and composition of bimetallic particles can differ significantly from the bulk due to variations in surface energies and interactions with adsorbates, making the design of bimetallic catalysts with targeted properties and reactivities challenging. We report here the influence of catalyst support (Al2O3 and TiO2) on the surface composition and structure of bimetallic Cu-Ni nanoparticles with varying Ni weight loading (0, 0.5, 1.5, 3, 5, and 10 wt %) at a constant Cu loading of 5 wt % and a correlation to catalytic reactivity and stability in furfural (FF) hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). Analysis via depth-profiling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggested that over a range of Ni compositions in Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, Cu and Ni were distributed evenly within bimetallic particles, although Cu and Ni segregated into contiguous monometallic domains at the particle surfaces. In contrast, on Cu-Ni/TiO2 catalysts near surface alloys formed, which were enriched in Cu at the particle surfaces and exposed only dispersed Ni species. The difference in compositional structure of the Cu-Ni particles on TiO2 and Al2O3 was attributed to strong and specific interactions between Ni and TiO2. On both supports the addition of Ni to Cu catalysts resulted in enhancements in the rate of FF HDO, although Al2O3 supported bimetallic catalysts promoted hydrogenation of the furan ring, forming mostly furfural alcohol and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, while TiO2 supported catalysts mostly resulted in carbonyl hydrogenolysis to form methyl furan (MF). Through optimization of support and bimetallic compositions, low-cost bimetallic catalysts were developed that demonstrated &gt;90% MF yields in FF HDO with good stability and regenerability. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the fossil energy consumption and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of polyol fuel produced via corn stover fast pyrolysis and bio-oil upgrading based on life cycle assessment (LCA). The required material and energy inputs involved in the unit processes of LCA are taken from Aspen Plus simulation models established according to a demonstration plant with annual polyol output of 1000 tonnes. The eBalance software with a Chinese Life Cycle Database (CLCD) is employed to perform this task. The research results show the net fossil energy input (FEI) and the net global warming potential (GWP) of polyol fuel are respectively 0.760 MJ and 0.0444 kgCO2,eq per MJ energy output under the proposed production pathway. Compared to petroleum-based gasoline and diesel, the net FEI of polyol fuel reduces by 42.9% and 42.2% respectively and the net GWP of polyol fuel decreases by 55.1% and 56.9% accordingly. Sensitivity analysis indicates the data uncertainty of the polyol yield and the electricity consumption for bio-oil production has significant impact on the GHG emissions. The polyol fuel is expected to partly replace petroleum-based fuels. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Biofuels from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of abundantly available forest residues in British Columbia (BC) can potentially make great contributions to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transportation sector. A life-cycle assessment was conducted to quantify the GHG emissions of a hypothetic 100 million liters per year HTL biofuel system in the Coast Region of BC. Three scenarios were defined and investigated, namely, supply of bulky forest residues for conversion in a central integrated refinery (Fr-CIR), HTL of forest residues to bio-oil in distributed biorefineries and subsequent upgrading in a central oil refinery (Bo-DBR), and densification of forest residues in distributed pellet plants and conversion in a central integrated refinery (Wp-CIR). Results: The life-cycle GHG emissions of HTL biofuels is 20.5, 17.0, and 19.5 g CO2-eq/MJ for Fr-CIR, Bo-DBR, and Wp-CIR scenarios, respectively, corresponding to 78-82% reduction compared with petroleum fuels. The conversion stage dominates the total GHG emissions, making up more than 50%. The process emitting most GHGs over the life cycle of HTL biofuels is HTL buffer production. Transportation emission, accounting for 25% of Fr-CIR, can be lowered by 83% if forest residues are converted to bio-oil before transportation. When the credit from biochar applied for soil amendment is considered, a further reduction of 6.8 g CO2-eq/MJ can be achieved. Conclusions: Converting forest residues to bio-oil and wood pellets before transportation can significantly lower the transportation emission and contribute to a considerable reduction of the life-cycle GHG emissions. Process performance parameters (e.g., HTL energy requirement and biofuel yield) and the location specific parameter (e.g., electricity mix) have significant influence on the GHG emissions of HTL biofuels. Besides, the recycling of the HTL buffer needs to be investigated to further improve the environmental performance of HTL biofuels. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Nowadays, biodiesel has become a very promising alternative to fossil diesel fuel, regarding environmental concerns and fuel resource depletion. Biodiesel is usually produced through homogeneous or heterogeneous transesterification of different fatty raw materials. Although main research has been carried out with homogenous catalysts, heterogeneous catalysts may be of interest due to ease of recovery and recycling, as well as readiness for continuous processing. In this work, calcined Mg-Al hydrotalcite (HT) was used for the heterogeneous transesterification of waste cooking oil. Three reaction parameters, namely, reaction time, amount of catalyst, and methanol-to-oil molar ratio, were optimized by means of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) at constant temperature (65 °C), using a Box-Behnken design. Optimal fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) content (86.23% w/w FAME/sample) was predicted by the model with an R-squared value of 98.45%, using 3.39 g of HT (8.5% w/w oil) and an 8:1 methanol-oil molar ratio, for a duration of 3.12 h. It was observed that calcination of HT, while avoiding the previous washing step, allowed the presence of chemical species that enhanced the effect of the catalyst. It can be concluded from this field trial that calcined and nonwashed Mg-Al hydrotalcite may be considered an effective basic catalyst for the production of biodiesel from waste cooking oil. Also, RSM proved to be a useful tool for predicting biodiesel yield. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - On a global scale many countries are still heavily dependent on crude oil to produce energy and fuel for transport, with a resulting increase of atmospheric pollution. A possible solution to obviate this problem is to find eco-sustainable energy sources. A potential choice could be the use of biodiesel as fuel. The work presented aims to characterise the transesterification reaction of waste peanut frying oil using colour analysis and wavelet analysis. The biodiesel production, with the complete absence of mucilages, was evaluated through a suitable set of energy wavelet coefficients and scalograms. The physical characteristics of the biodiesel are influenced by mucilages. In particular the viscosity, that is a fundamental parameter for the correct use of the biodiesel, might be compromised. The presence of contaminants in the samples can often be missed by visual analysis. The low and high frequency wavelet analysis, by investigating the energy change of wavelet coefficient, provided a valid characterisation of the quality of the samples, related to the absence of mucilages, which is consistent with the experimental results. The proposed method of this work represents a preliminary analysis, before the subsequent chemical physical analysis, that can be develop during the production phases of the biodiesel in order to optimise the process, avoiding the presence of impurities in suspension in the final product. © 2018 MDPI AG.

AB  - Due to rapid changes in food habits, a substantial amount of waste fat and used oils are generated each year. Due to strong policies, the disposal of this material into nearby sewers causes ecological and environmental problems in many parts of the world. For efficient management, waste cooking oil, a less expensive, alternative and promising feedstock, can be used as a raw material for producing biofuel. In the present study, we produced a biodiesel from hydrolyzed waste cooking oil with a subcritical methanol process using a synthesized solid super acid catalyst, a sulfated zirconium oxide supported on Santa Barbara Amorphous silica (S-ZrO2/SBA-15). The characterization of the synthesized catalyst was carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The catalytic effect on biodiesel production was examined by varying the parameters: temperatures of 120 to 200 °C, 5-20 min times, oil-to-methanol mole ratios between 1:5 to 1:20, and catalyst loadings of 1-2.5%. The maximum biodiesel yield was 96.383%, obtained under optimum reaction conditions of 140 °C, 10 min, and a 1:10 oil-to-methanol molar ratio with a 2.0% catalyst loading. We successfully reused the catalyst five times without regeneration with a 90% efficiency. The fuel properties were found to be within the limits set by the biodiesel standard. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The road passenger transport is responsible for a large share of energy consumption and pollutants emission in Europe. Efforts have been made in the definition of new policies to reduce the environmental impacts of this sector. However, an integrated and consistent assessment of the most promising policies is required, using specific European indicators. For that matter, a life-cycle analysis was applied to the road passenger transport, for the European Union with 27 countries (EU27) in 2010, following a basket-of-products methodology and considering three main stages: production, use, and end-of-life of vehicles. Simapro 8 software was used, along with Ecoinvent 3 database and the impact assessment method International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) 2011 Midpoint+. Changes in vehicle production processes, vehicle constitution, and energy sources for vehicle propulsion were analyzed. The policies resulting in a decrease in all impact categories are the use of smaller or lightweight vehicles by positively influencing use, production, and end-of-life of vehicles. The use of more recent vehicles technology or diesel vehicles show substantial reductions in, respectively, five and eight impact categories (out of 15), justifying their adoption in the European fleet. Generally, the most notorious policies compared to the actual transport paradigm, like compressed natural gas (CNG), biofuels, or electric vehicles use, show the greatest reduction in climate change (up to 46%) but also a very significant rise of impacts in the categories that in the conventional basket-of-products already resulted in the worst indicators after normalization. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Lipid extraction is a critical step in the downstream processing of biodiesel production from microalgae. Solvent extraction using mixtures of non-polar and polar solvents is one of the most well-known processes for this purpose. Hexane is the most common solvent of choice for large-scale lipid extractions due to its technical and economic advantages, especially its high selectivity toward lipids and low cost. In this study, extractions using mixtures of hexane and polar solvents were evaluated for their performance in order to develop a more efficient method for large-scale lipid extraction from microalgae. The combination of hexane and methanol resulted in the highest fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield for lipids from Tetraselmis sp. The effects of extraction conditions, including proportions of methanol to hexane, ratios of total solvent volume to dry biomass, and extraction time, on extraction yields were evaluated to determine optimum conditions providing higher lipid and FAME yields. The optimal conditions were as follows: proportion of hexane to methanol of 1:1, ratio of total solvent volume to dry biomass of 10 mL/g, and extraction time of 120 min. Finally, the selected solvent mixture and optimal conditions were applied to larger scale extraction experiments with scale-up factors of 10, 50, and 100. FAME yields of large-scale extractions were almost completely consistent with increasing scale-up factors. The results of this study suggest that a hexane and methanol mixture is a promising solvent for large-scale lipid extraction from microalgae. © 2018, The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Depletion of fossil fuel reserves and environmental issue have led to the development of biofuels. Plant derived oil, such as palm oil, has been claimed as one of the promising source of renewable energy. However, high oxygen content in palm oil makes it unsuitable to be directly used as fuel. In the present study, the performance of Ni/ZSM-5, Mo/ZSM-5 and NiMo/ZSM-5 catalysts was investigated in catalytic cracking of used vegetable oil (UVO) into green fuel. The catalytic cracking reactions were carried out in a fixed bed reactor at 4 hour-1(WHSV), continuously for 3 hours. Conversions of the two major fatty acids: palmitic acid (84.72%) and stearic acid (74.10%) were found highest at 350 °C with Mo/ZSM-5. The optimum palmitic acid and stearic acid conversion with Mo/ZSM-5 were found at 400 °C. Comparison study was also done with Pd/Al2O3 at 400 °C for its performance in catalytic cracking of UVO. Similar conversion for palmitic acid was obtained for Mo/ZSM-5 (84.72%) and Pd/Al2O3 (86.37%) at steady state. However, system with Mo/ZSM-5 as catalyst approached steady state earlier at 60 mins compared to that of Pd/Al2O3 at 120 minutes. © 2018, Malaysian Society of Analytical Sciences.

AB  - This study undertakes technoeconomic analysis of commercial production of hydro-processed renewable jet (HRJ) fuel from camelina oil in the Canadian Prairies. An engineering economic model designed in SuperPro Designer® investigated capital investment, scale, and profitability of producing HRJ and co-products (biodiesel, naphtha, LPG, and propane) based on biorefinery plant sizes of 112.5–675 million L annum−1. Under base case scenario, the minimum selling price (MSP) of HRJ was $1.06 L−1 for a biorefinery plant with size of 225 million L. However, it could range from $0.40 to $1.71 L−1 given variations in plant capacity, feedstock cost, and co-product credits. MSP is highly sensitive to camelina feedstock cost and co-product credits, with little sensitivity to capital cost, discount rate, plant capacity, and hydrogen cost. Marginal and average cost curves suggest the region could support an HRJ plant capacity of up to 675 million L annum−1 (capital investment of $167 million). © 2017

AB  - Raphanus sativus L. and Crambe abyssinica Hochst. are promising crops for supplying oil to chemical industries. They are not used for human consumption and can be grown off-season due to their short life cycle. However, drought may limit their growth, photosynthesis and productivity. Thus, the aim of this research was to evaluate the morphological and physiological responses of R. sativus and C. abyssinica subjected to water deficit to identify the strategies used by these species to tolerate the effects of water stress. Two independent experiments for R. sativus and C. abyssinica were conducted with different water replacements: 100% (control), 66% and 33% of the field capacity. The characteristics of water relations, gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, chloroplastidic pigments, morphology and root distribution in the soil profile were evaluated separately in both crops. The results indicate the ability of both species to control water loss. In R. sativus and C. abyssinica, the cell turgor and consequently photosynthesis and growth were maintained even under drought conditions. The maintenance of water status was achieved by osmotic adjustment in R. sativus, and also the root distribution and deepening in both species. Such responses allowed R. sativus and C. abyssinica to be classified as tolerant to drought conditions. © Australian Journal of Crop Science 2017.

AB  - The transformation of waste oils and fats into biofuels attracts great interest due to the low cost of these materials. The thermal and/or catalytic cracking of oils and fats is an alternative route to the classic transesterification process of biodiesel production when the raw material has low quality. In this work, thermal cracking of sodium soaps of residual fatty materials from Brazilian restaurants (brown grease mainly composed of fatty acids of soybean oil) was tested to assess the feasibility of yielding a high quality diesel-like product. The reactions occurred in a single stirred steel reactor of 300 ml at high temperatures (723 °K) at atmospheric pressure for 1h45 min. The organic liquid product was analyzed for acid and saponification value, thermogravimetric characteristics. The chemical composition of the liquid product diesel-like fractions was determined by FT-IR, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR 1H and 13C) and GC–MS. The hydrocarbons obtained were very similar to diesel oil and suitable for use, in pure form or in mixtures, in diesel oil engines. Yields above 60% and very low acidity (0.5 mg KOH/g) were obtained, meeting the requirements of ANP (Brazilian National Petroleum Agency) Resolution No 51 de 25/11/15. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Expanded ship automatization levels prompt better usefulness and security, and also decreased expenses and team numbers. Incorporated into the introduction is as of late authorized impetus observing framework for quick watch vessels, dispersed fire and flooding assurance framework, send direction arrangement of a profound flexibility little vessel, maritime programmed degaussing structures, coordinated minimal effort mine countermeasures framework and organized hydrographic study and route framework for inland conduits. Vitality is essential to the world as a driver of the present day society. As per estimations were done by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the aggregate worldwide vitality utilization is around 17500 TW h/yr. Before petroleum derivatives like coal, oil and flammable gas provided the most significant piece of this global usage, and they were far more significant than those of the sustainable power sources. In 2011, the creation of viable power source and worldwide vitality utilization expanded, despite the fact that sustainable power source was still substantially littler than petroleum derivatives. There are a few wellsprings of a viable power source, for example, hydro, wind, sunlight based, biofuel, and marine vitality. Be that as it may, since 71% of the world’s surface is secured via ocean, marine vitality is a significant asset for thought, particularly when confronted with a perpetually developing vitality request. Aquatic dynamism incorporates seaward wind vitality, wave, tidal, tidal ebb and flows, warm, and saltiness slope vitality. © TJPRC Pvt. Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is produced by transesterification of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from oleaginous microalgae feedstock. Biodiesel fuel properties were studied and compared with biodiesel standards. Qualitative analysis of FAME was done while cultivating mixed microalgae consortia under three concentrations of coal fired flue gas (1%, 3.0% and 5.5% CO2). Under 1% CO2 concentration (flue gas), the FAME content was 280.3 μg/mL, whereas the lipid content was 14.03 μg/mL/D (day). Both FAMEs and lipid contents were low at other CO2 concentrations (3.0 and 5.5%). However, mixed consortia in the presence of phosphate buffer and flue gas (PB + FG) showed higher saturated fatty acids (SFA) (36.28%) and unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) (63.72%) versus 5.5% CO2 concentration, which might be responsible for oxidative stability of biodiesel. Subsequently, higher cetane number (52) and low iodine value (136.3 gI2/100 g) biodiesel produced from mixed consortia (PB + FG) under 5.5% CO2 along with 50 mM phosphate buffer were found in accordance with European (EN 14214) standard. Results revealed that phosphate buffer significantly enhanced the biodiesel quality, but reduced the FAME yield. This study intended to develop an integrated approach for significant improvement in biodiesel quality under surplus phosphorus by utilizing waste flue gas (as CO2 source) using microalgae. The CO2 sequestration from industrial flue gas not only reduced greenhouse gases, but may also ensure the sustainable and eco-benign production of biodiesel. © 2018

AB  - The effects of temperature, reaction time, biomass/water feedstock ratio, NaOH concentration, and ZSM-5 catalyst amount were investigated relative to the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of sugarcane bagasse. The experimental results showed that the maximum yield of bio-oil (46.9%) was achieved with the following conditions: 10 g of sugarcane bagasse, 200 mL of distilled water, 30 min, and 285 °C. It was seen that the products of oxygenation (phenols, acids, ketones, alkenes, and esters) were abundant in the bio-oil. With the addition of NaOH, the residue yield decreased remarkably, and the yield of organics dissolved increased. The yields of acids and furfurals in the bio-oil decreased with the presence of NaOH during HTL. Additionally, ZSM-5 effectively decreased the acidic compounds and improved the liquid properties during HTL. Sugarcane bagasse in HTL with catalysts significantly improved the quality of bio-oil with lower oxygen content and higher HHV. Moreover, the gaseous products H2 and CH4 were noticeably affected by the temperature, NaOH concentration, and ZSM-5 amount.

AB  - Carbon nanotube (CNT) was synthesized during combustion in a diesel engine by using biodiesel, fatty-acid methyl ester (FAME), as main fuel. Ethanol which is also known as biomass-derived material was blended with main fuel. These mixed fuel acted as a carbon and heat source. Ferrocene as a catalyst source for CNT growth and molybdenum/sulfur as a promoter were added into mixed fuel. CNTs produced in each experimental condition were assessed mainly by scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope whether CNT was really synthesized or not. Gas compositions of an exhaust from an engine were examined by two types of gas chromatograph, thermal conductivity detector for O2 CO, CO2 and flame ionization detector for C1–C3 low molecular hydrocarbons. As a comparative study, experiments using 1-decanol and n-dodecane as main fuel were carried out. The former is an emerging material which has been applied for a diesel engine operation in recent years. The latter has been utilized as surrogate fuel of commercial transport fuel in order to mimic several properties of real fuel. Obtained results indicated that FAME and 1-decanol had a propensity to produce larger CO amount which led to CNT formation than that produced from n-dodecane based fuel even at a low ethanol fraction in fuel. We believe that our outcomes will provide fruitful information that high-valued material like CNT can be produced from biomass-derived materials through a diesel engine which generates electrical power in addition to CNT production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana grown under air (0.04% CO2) and 1 and 5% CO2 concentrations was evaluated to determine its potential for CO2 mitigation coupled with biodiesel production. Results indicated that the diatom cultures grown at 1 and 5% CO2 showed higher growth rates (1.14 and 1.29 div day−1, respectively) and biomass productivities (44 and 48 mgAFDWL−1 day−1) than air grown cultures (with 1.13 div day−1 and 26 mgAFDWL−1 day−1). The increase of CO2 resulted in higher cell volume and pigment content per cell of T. pseudonana. Interestingly, lipid content doubled when air was enriched with 1–5% CO2. Moreover, the analysis of the fatty acid composition of T. pseudonana revealed the predominance of monounsaturated acids (palmitoleic-16:1 and oleic-18:1) and a decrease of the saturated myristic acid-14:0 and polyunsaturated fatty acids under high CO2 levels. These results suggested that T. pseudonana seems to be an ideal candidate for biodiesel production using flue gases. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Using renewable feedstock sources for biodiesel production seems to be a promising strategy and even more so when enzymatic catalysis with lipases are used. However, it is well known that these enzymes could be inactivated by reaction conditions such as temperature or alcohol concentration. In this work, the effect of temperature and initial water activity (aw) value on immobilised recombinant Rhizopus oryzae lipase (rROL) were studied. Methanolysis and ethanolysis reactions using alperujo oil with three different stepwise addition strategies were employed. RESULTS: Recombinant 1,3-positional selective rROL covalently immobilised on polymethacrylate amino-epoxy activated support showed maximum initial reaction rate at low aw value (0.093). It was found that 30 °C was the optimal temperature in terms of biocatalyst stability during transesterification reactions. Adding alcohol at once, ethanol was clearly a better acyl-acceptor in terms of stability than methanol. Productivity was found to be 2-fold higher when five pulses of ethanol were used instead of methanol. CONCLUSIONS: Alperujo oil has great potential as a low cost feedstock for biodiesel production through enzymatic catalysis using a nearly semi-continuous alcohol addition strategy. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - In this study, the effect of doping hexanol into biodiesel which is from neat cashew nut shell biodiesel oil on the emissions and the performance characteristics was studied in a constant speed diesel engine. The main purpose of this work is to reduce various emissions and also to improve the performance of the diesel engine when fueled with blends of hexanol and neat cashew nut shell biodiesel. Cashew nut shell oil is not edible, and hence it can be used as a viable alternative to diesel. Cashew nut shell biodiesel is prepared by conventional transesterification. Hexanol with 99.2% purity was employed as an oxygenated additive. Experimental studies were conducted by fueling diesel as a baseline and by fueling hexanol and neat cashew nut shell biodiesel mixture. A fuel comprising 10% (by volume) of hexanol and 90% (by volume) neat cashew nut shell biodiesel was referred to as CNSBD900H100 and fuel comprising 20% (by volume) of hexanol and 80% (by volume) of neat cashew nut shell biodiesel was referred to as CNSBD800H200. This study also investigated the possibility of using pure biofuel in an unmodified naturally aspirated diesel engine. The outcome of this study showed that adding hexanol at 10% and 20% (by volume) to cashew nut shell biodiesel results in a reduction in emissions. In addition, a significant improvement in brake thermal efficiency and reduction in brake-specific fuel consumptions were achieved. Hence, it could be concluded that hexanol could be a viable and promising additive for improving the drawbacks of biodiesel when it was used to fuel an unmodified diesel engine. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass constitutes a promising technology to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. The product, pyrolysis liquids, can either substitute heavy fuel oil directly, or be upgraded via e.g. hydroprocessing to diesel and petrol. This study presents a systematic evaluation of production costs and CO2 mitigation potentials of different fast pyrolysis value chain configurations. The evaluation considers types of localisations, emissions from electricity and hydrogen production, biomass feedstocks, and final products. The resulting production costs were found to be in the range of 36–60 EUR/MWh for crude pyrolysis liquids, and 61–90 EUR/MWh upgraded to diesel and petrol. Industrial integration was found to be favoured. The CO2 mitigation potential for the pyrolysis liquids was in the range of 187–282 t-CO2/GWh biomass. High variations were found when upgraded to diesel and petrol –best-case scenario resulted in a mitigation of 347 t-CO2/GWh biomass, while worst-case scenarios resulted in net CO2 emissions. Favourable policy support, continued technology development, and/or increased fossil fuel prices are required for the technology to be adapted on an industrial scale. It was concluded that integration with existing industrial infrastructure can contribute to cost reductions and thus help enable the transformation of traditional forest industry into biorefineries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The pyrolysis residues of high-ash sludge are rich in the metallic oxides of silicon (Si), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al), enabling high-ash sludge to achieve complete pyrolysis without the addition of wave-absorbing materials. Therefore, these residues offer obvious advantages when compared with traditional sludge when pyrolyzed under microwave irradiation. The differences in final pyrolysis temperatures caused by different microwave powers have significant effects on the characteristics of pyrolysis products. By increasing the microwave power, the lower heating value of bio-gas increased with the increase in syngas output, the lower heating value of bio-oil first increased and then decreased with changes in hydrocarbon yields, and the specific surface area of bio-char first increased and then decreased; however, the adsorption capacities of heavy metals, such as copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), and nickel (Ni) increased gradually. The yields of bio-gas and bio-oil increased from 10.01% to 2.98%–14.02% and 3.52%, respectively, as the input power increased from 700 W to 1300 W. Thereby, energy recovery efficiency reached the maximum at 5.15% with a microwave power of 1300 W. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lipases namely Mucor miehei, Pseudomonas cepacia, Rhizopus delemar, Geotrichum candidum, Candida rugosa, Porcine pancreas-II, Pseudomonas fluorescence, and Candida antarctica lipase-B (Novozyme-435) were employed for biodiesel synthesis from spent coffee oil. Around 96% oil-to-biodiesel conversion was obtained using Novozyme-435 as a catalyst at 1:5 oil-to-methanol molar ratio and 40ºC. Total spent coffee grounds generated at the North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus (NWU PC) was estimated which could be used to produce 162 L of biodiesel. A waste valorization strategy was devised for converting organic wastes produced at the NWU PC to bioenergy. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The properties of biodiesel differ depending on feedstock fatty acid content. Moreover, biodiesel fatty acid composition influences the combustion process. For these reasons, noise emissions of a direct injection Perkins diesel engine fueled with olive pomace oil methyl ester (monounsaturated methyl esters) and palm oil methyl ester (saturated methyl esters) were studied under several steady-state engine operating conditions. In this work, different approaches for sound prediction of the engine based on Neural Network (NN) models, such as Product Unit NN (PUNN), Radial Basis Function NN (RBFNN) and response surface models have been proposed. Error was measured considering Mean Square Error (MSE) and Standard Error of Prediction (SEP). It can be concluded that the use of a hybrid model combining PU and RBF improves noise prediction accuracy, providing an acceptable value of both MSE and SEP when monounsaturated methyl ester/diesel fuel blends are used. However, best results for saturated methyl ester/diesel fuel blends were achieved by PUNN model. Whereas taking into account the simplicity of the model, PUNN model is the most appropriate for both monounsaturated and saturated methyl ester/diesel fuel blends. Response surface models have shown worse results based on the coefficient of correlation. Also, the effect of independent variables in the models has been studied and an inverse relationship between frequency and engine noise has been found. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Environmental pollution and the declining global supply of accessible fossil fuels are the key drivers of the search for alternative sources of energy. Biodiesel, a renewable liquid transport fuel, is commercially-produced using heterogeneous catalysts. Heterogeneous catalysts obtained from seashells appeared as promising alternatives thanks to their low preparation cost and increased efficiency in transesterification. In this study, shells from Chicoreus brunneus (known as Adusta murex) were calcined, hydrated, and dehydrated to produce CaO heterogeneous nanocatalyst for the transesterification of rice bran oil into biodiesel. Field emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, surface area measurement (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method), and X-ray diffraction were used to characterise the seashell-derived catalyst. The properties of the rice bran oil-derived biodiesel (acid value, calorific value, density, oxidation stability, and flash point) conformed to the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) D6751 and European EN 14214 biodiesel standards, except for kinematic viscosity. Therefore, the impact of the parameters used for production of the CaO heterogeneous nanocatalyst (calcination temperature and time) and the transesterification reaction (catalyst loading and methanol to rice bran oil ratio) on the kinematic viscosity of RBO-derived biodiesel were determined. A model for the transesterification process was developed using a combination of artificial neural networking with ant colony optimisation. The model predicted that C. brunneus-derived CaO catalyst prepared at 1100 °C for 72 min could be used to produce biodiesel from rice bran oil with a minimum kinematic viscosity (4.42 mm2 s−1) confirming to both the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 biodiesel standards in a transesterification reaction operating with a 35:1 methanol to rice bran oil molar ratio and 0.5 wt% catalyst mass. © 2017

AB  - In order to reduce the harmful emissions from marine diesel engines, the use of alternative fuels is a promising option. In this study, the combustion process and NOx emissions and composition ratios of waste cooking oil biodiesel on a marine auxiliary diesel engine were investigated experimentally. Four different blended ratios of biodiesel and diesel were selected. The results showed that the peak of heat release rate (PHRR) decreased with the increasing biodiesel blended ratios at most of the operation conditions. The maximum reductions of PHRR were 11.04% and 19.86% at speeds of 1050 rpm and 1500 rpm. The brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) increased but the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) changed little when the biodiesel blended ratio increased. The maximum increments of BSFC were reached at B50 and were 7.0%–8.3% and 5.1%–6.1% at 1050 rpm and 1500 rpm under different engine loads. With the increase of biodiesel blended ratios, NOx emissions decreased and NO2/NOx increased slowly due to the decline of in-cylinder temperature. While NO2/NOx decreased significantly with the increasing engine speed and load for the reduction of in-cylinder cooler regions. In general, the waste cooking oil biodiesel can be considered as an alternative fuel for marine auxiliary diesel engines. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The biodegradable fraction of municipal solid waste (BMSW), dominantly composed of starchy and lignocellulosic materials, has high potential to be used for liquid biofuel production. Hot water or dilute acid treatment at high temperature was utilized for the solubilization or hydrolysis of the starch fraction and pretreatment of the lignocellulosic fraction. The treatment liquor, which was rich in sugars and starch, was evaluated for acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE) production by Clostridium acetobutylicum, and it was found that phenolic compounds, especially tannins, critically inhibited the butanol production. To improve ABE production, the extraction of phenolic compounds prior to hot water or dilute acid treatment was evaluated. Among the evaluated extractants, i.e., acetone, ethanol, butanol, and water, ethanol showed the highest amount of tannin extraction, resulting in an 87% reduction in tannin content. Dilute acid treatment of the ethanol extracted BMSW at 140 °C for 60 min resulted in a liquor containing 23 g/L glucose and 41 g/L soluble starch, which was fermented to the highest ABE concentration of 17 g/L with productivity of 0.24 g/L/h. The fermentation of liquor obtained by dilute acid treatment of butanol, acetone, and water-extracted BMSW was accompanied by 9, 6, and 4 g/L ABE production. Even by hot water treatment, the liquor obtained from ethanol extracted BMSW was fermented to the highest ABE concentration of 8 g/L. In addition to the liquor, the pretreated lignocellulosic material was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis and ABE fermentation, leading to production of 5–6 g/L ABE. This process resulted in the production of 83.9 g butanol, 36.6 g acetone, and 20.8 g ethanol from each kg of BMSW. Moreover, the co-production of ethanol by ABE fermentation reduced concerns about organic extractor loss in the extraction process, which was inescapable in the tannin extraction process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work reports on the study of biofuel production from biooil obtained by cardoon pyrolysis (Cynara cardunculus L.). The main process was carried out at 700 °C and at 50 cm3 min−1 nitrogen flow rate for 1 h. The liquid yield in such pyrolysis process was 38.91% (wt/wt). Two solvents were used for biofuel extraction, namely ethyl ether and ethyl acetate, to achieve a 34.72% yield in biofuel. Subsequently, a distillation process in the range of kerosene (200–275 °C) was performed to finally obtain “biokerosene” which was used to feed both a self-manufactured jet engine and an internal combustion engine (ICE). In the jet engine, experimental tests were run for four kerosene/biofuel mixtures in the range 0–20% biofuel, in atmospheric conditions (20 °C and 1015 mbar) and setting the engine in a slightly sloped arrangement in order to prevent excessive displacements. Fuel pressure at maximum power was recorded as 6 bar, which yielded 0.00252 kg s−1 fuel flow rate. Results –even for the mixture with 20% biofuel content– were found to be similar to those for pure kerosene. The turbocharger yield was 74% with 200,000 rpm and 0.091 kg s−1 air flow rate for all conditions, which equates to an approximate power of 100 hp for the use of the turbocharger in self-propulsion. On another note, the ICE was operated using a 80–20% diesel-biokerosene mix and was observed to show a satisfactory behaviour in terms of torque and power yields. The use of such biofuels to feed jet and ICE engines represents an excellent alternative to fossil fuels, and therefore quality improvement is a key topic for further research in the area. © 2017

AB  - n-Butanol is an option of biofuel with potential to be used in the transportation industry. There is little information about performance of engines running with this alcohol and thus is very difficult to evaluate its advantages. A way to bypass this limitation is to use numerical simulation, mainly 1D models, to represent the whole engine and preview its performance running with different fuels. The lack of information about n-butanol and its combustion properties are big challenges to surpass when building these virtual models. A way to overcome these challenges is numerically model an engine and adjust the fuel properties until the numerical results are in agreement with test results. The aim of this work is to estimate fuel properties of an n-butanol-gasoline blend by means of numerical simulation, allowing the comparison of its performance against other fuels. Starting with a virtual engine model, the fuel properties were adjusted based on test measurements until a good agreement between numerical results and measured results was obtained. After numerical calibration, some of the main n-butanol fuel parameters (BU40) needed by 1D codes were obtained, like liquid fuel heat of vaporization @ 298 K = 583 kJ/kg, density = 813 kg/m3, liquid fuel abs. entropy @ 298 K = 3015.78 J/kg-K, critical temperature = 563 K, critical pressure = 4.5 MPa, gaseous fuel abs. entropy @ 298 K = 4723.79 J/kg-K, among others. The properties thus obtained leaded to well approximated results, where numerical to experimental results for indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) are lower than 0.1 bar, lower than 8% for peak cylinder pressure (PCP) and lower than 7% for rate of heat release (ROHR). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Numerous studies have examined the oxidation of PAHs found in diesel particulate matter (PM) by ozone, but no studies have investigated the ozone oxidation of biodiesel exhaust PM. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), found in high abundance in biodiesel PM, can potentially alter the kinetics of the reactions between atmospheric oxidants such as ozone and particle-phase PAHs. In this study, the heterogeneous reactivity of 16 EPA PAHs upon 24 h exposure to 0.4 ppm ozone in the presence (PAH + FAMES) and absence (PAH-only) of FAMEs was investigated at room temperature and 50% relative humidity. The ozone-reactivity of the PAHs detected in 20% biodiesel (B20) exhaust PM was also investigated. In the absence of FAMEs, the pseudo-first order ozone reaction rate constant, kO3,of PAHs varied from 0.086 ± 0.030 hr−1 (chrysene) to 0.184 ± 0.078 hr−1 (anthracene). In the presence of FAMEs, kO3 of the PAHs varied between 0.013 ± 0.012 hr−1 (benzo[b]fluoranthene) and 0.168 ± 0.028 hr−1 (benzo[a]pyrene), and with the exception of benzo[a]pyrene, the kO3of PAHs were 1.2–8 times lower compared to those obtained during the PAH-only ozone exposure. Only one PAH, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), did not show a significant change in kO3 with addition of FAMEs. Phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene, the only PAHs detected in the B20 PM, had kO3 values about 4 times lower in B20 PM than those obtained when spiked PAHs-only were exposed to ozone. The kO3 values of phenanthrene and fluoranthene in the B20 PM were 2 times higher than rates obtained when the PAH mix was exposed to ozone in the presence of the FAMEs. In contrast, pyrene's kO3 in the B20 PM was about 2 times lower than that obtained for the PAH + FAMEs exposure. Observed differences in PAH behavior demonstrate individual PAH heterogeneous reactivity with gas-phase ozone is sensitive to PAH (vapor pressure, solubility/sorption to matrix components, chemical reactivity) as well as substrate properties (PAH and O3 diffusivity in the matrix that may evolve with reaction progress). Saturated FAMEs were not reactive with ozone (kO3 range = 0.004 ± 0.003 to 0.012 ± 0.026 hr−1), but compared to PAHs, up to two times higher kO3 was measured for the unsaturated FAMEs (range 0.087 ± 0.015 to 0.329 ± 0.023 hr−1) during PAH + FAMEs exposures. These changes in substrate composition during atmospheric aging would be expected to affect PAH diffusivity and therefore heterogeneous reactivity over time. The factor of 1.2–8 decreased heterogeneous reactivity of PAHs in the presence of the FAMEs mix and the B20 PM matrix suggests that the presence of FAMEs in the diesel fuel supply may lead to increased PAH atmospheric lifetimes and longer range PAH transport. Predictive methods to quantify changes in PAH reactivity with gas-phase oxidants as a function of substrate composition and characteristics (viscosity, polarity, degree of unsaturation) are needed as biodiesel is increasingly present in our diesel engine fuel supply from a variety of feedstocks at different blend ratios. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Salinity stress has been verified to be a successful approach to enhance lipid production in high-starch marine algae, and salinity-induced carbon flow switching has been proposed as an algal response specific to brackish water. With the aim of testing this assumption, Chlorella sorokiniana SDEC-18, a low-starch freshwater alga, was grown in BG11 medium with NaCl addition at various concentrations (0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 g/L). The results showed that salinity stress promoted carbon redistribution and starch conversion to lipid. The most desirable lipid productivity of 19.66 mg/L·d occurred in the medium with 20 g/L NaCl, about 2.16 times as high as that in the BG11 medium control. Moreover, microalgae with salinity stress were able to produce biodiesel with a more suitable cloud point, due to a decrease in the saturated fatty acid content. This therefore confirms that low-starch freshwater microalgae can also carry out salinity-induced carbon flow switching. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Algae production process is a key cost center in production of biofuels/bioproducts from microalgae. Decline in the growth of algae in outdoor ponds during non-optimal conditions is one of the hurdles for achieving consistently high algal production rates. An optimal controller can be used to overcome this limitation and provide reliable growth in outdoor conditions. A model predictive controller (MPC) was developed to optimize the algal growth, predicted by flux balance analysis, under natural disturbances, embedding within the cost function, the economic and environmental constraints associated with the process. The model, developed in MATLAB, was validated on a 30-L continuous algal culture under light, temperature and a combination of light and temperature disturbances. The MPC proved effective in minimization of a decrease in growth under these natural disturbances. The growth rates with MPC were observed to be 79–116% higher as compared to the non-MPC growth. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present experimental analysis, two non-edible oils namely neem oil and pumpkin seed oil were considered. They are converted into respective biodiesels namely neem oil methyl ester (B1) and pumpkin seed oil methyl ester (B2) through transesterification process and their physical and chemical properties were examined using ASTM standards. Diesel was used as a baseline fuel in Kirloskar TV1 model direct injection four stroke diesel engine. A fuel preheater was designed and fabricated to operate at various temperatures (60, 70, and 80 °C). Diesel showed higher brake thermal efficiency (BTE) than biodiesel samples. Lower brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) was obtained with diesel than B1 sample. B1 exhibited lower BSFC than B2 sample without preheating process. High preheating temperature (80 °C) results in lower fuel consumption for B1 sample. The engine emission characteristics like carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), and smoke were found lower with B1 sample than diesel and B2 except oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission. In preheating of fuel, B1 sample with high preheating temperature showed lower CO, HC, and smoke emission (except NOx) than B2 sample. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative fuel that is gradually replacing petroleum-based diesel use. Although biodiesel is considered friendlier to the environment, the potential toxic effects of biodiesel to aquatic organisms are still uncertain due to the wide range of feedstocks used to generate the fuel. The aquatic cladoceran Daphnia magna (D. magna) has been commonly used as a lethal and/or sub-lethal toxicological model organism in ecological risk assessments for contaminated water environments. In this work, we evaluated whether significant differences exist in the sensitivity of freshwater aquatic life to different biodiesels. The acute toxicity of three plant-based biodiesels was investigated using D. magna over a 96-h period. In addition, diesel fuel was tested as a reference. Increased immobility was observed as time progressed following exposure. Testing revealed of the four fuel products, diesel proved most toxic to D. magna, with half maximal effective concentration (EC50) values of 4.7 μg/mL (24 h) and 3.4 μg/mL (72 h). Among the biodiesels, safflower methyl biodiesel was most toxic, with EC50 values of 1026 μg/mL (24 h) and 71 μg/mL (48 h). Our data indicate that although not all biodiesels were toxic, the short-term exposure of D. magna to sub-lethal concentrations of biodiesels affects their mobility and thus decreases their reproductive potential. Overall, this research provides insights into the sub-lethal effects of biodiesels on an aquatic organism. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The present work submits an investigation about the effect of urea injection parameters on NOx emissions from a four-stroke four-cylinder diesel engine fueled with B20 blended biodiesel. An L9(34) Taguchi orthogonal array was used to design the test plan. The results reveal that increasing urea concentration leads to lower NOx emissions. Urea flow rate increment has the same influence on NOx emission. The same result is obtained by an increase in spray angle. Also, according to the analysis of variance (ANOVA), urea concentration and then urea flow rate are the most effective design parameters on NOx emissions, while spray angle and mixing length have less influence on this pollutant emission. Finally, since the result of confirmation test is in good agreement with the predicted value based on the Taguchi technique, the predictive capability of this method in the present study could be deduced. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A novel process was developed for the biorefining of floatable wastewater scum and other waste oils from water treatment facilities into biodiesel and other value-added bio-products. To test the scalability and commercial potential of the technology, a 7000 l/year pilot-scale system was designed and built. Scum from a wastewater treatment facility, located in St. Paul, Mn, was collected and converted into methyl esters (biodiesel) according to the process chemistry. All of the incoming and outgoing process streams were sampled, tested, weighed and recorded to calculate both the process efficiency and product quality. Data from the pilot-scale system operation was compared to laboratory results and the theoretically expected values for each individual unit operation. The biodiesel was tested using a third party laboratory and confirmed it met all of the US EPA's test requirements for commercial-grade biodiesel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Kernels recovered from fruit pits of 14 apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) genotypes are tested for future application as feedstock for biodiesel production. The difference between the lowest and the highest oil yield between studied samples is over twofold and reached between 27.1 and 58.7% (w/w) dw. The oleic and linoleic acids are the two dominant fatty acids in apricot kernel oils; however, their content is affected meaningfully by the variety and amounted to 38.5–67.2 and 26.4–54.8%, respectively. Two significant correlations (p &lt; 0.000005) are found between oil yield in kernels of different apricot genotypes and two fatty acids, oleic and linoleic (r = 0.947 and r = −0.927, respectively). The biodiesel parameters of 14 apricot genotypes are calculated empirically according to previously developed equations based on the fatty acid methyl esters composition of the potential feedstock. The European biodiesel standards of kinematic viscosity, cetane number, density, and iodine value are met for 13 investigated samples. The exception was noted for genotype HL PSŠ 5. The recorded differences between minimum and maximum value of individual biodiesel parameters calculated empirically for various apricot genotypes differed as follows: 0.20 mm2 s−1 (kinematic viscosity), 4.9 (cetane number), 0.06 MJ kg−1 (higher heating value), 0.0028 g cm−3 (density), 15.6 I2/100 g (iodine value), 1.67 °C (CFPP), and 2.15 h (induction period). The logarithmic regression model in comparison to linear regression model, better expressed the relationship between physicochemical properties of biofuel and the ΣPUFA/(ΣSFA + ΣMUFA) ratio. To confirm the usefulness of the applied empirical equations for biodiesel parameters prediction of the apricot feedstock, five cold-pressed apricot kernel oils of different origin and with a varied composition of fatty acids are tested experimentally and compared with the values calculated empirically. Practical Applications: Apricot kernels have limited use in food industry due to a high content of the amygdalin. Therefore, application of apricot kernels as potential feedstock for the biodiesel production seems to be reasonable, especially due rich oil yield (up to even 60%). In this paper the impact of the apricot genotype on the potential application in the biodiesel industry as well as the relationship between the oil yield and apricot biodiesel quality is described. Obtained biodiesel parameters of 14 apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) genotype oils can help estimate the economic perspectives of utilization as a potential energy source. The present study may contribute to the more targeted use of the apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) kernels and promotes the efficient management of the plant material and environmental sustainability. Kernels recovered from fruit pits of 14 apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) genotypes are tested for future application as feedstock for biodiesel production. High oil yield 27–58.7% (w/w) dw and predomination of the oleic and linoleic acids 38.5–67.2 and 26.4–54.8%, respectively, is recorded in the tested genotypes. The European biodiesel standards of kinematic viscosity, cetane number, density, and iodine value are met for all investigated samples, with the exception of genotype HL PSŠ 5. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Environmental economists might recommend a cap-and-trade program as a good way to lower emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), but US carbon cap-and-trade legislation was proposed and failed to become law. Instead, the biofuel use mandate is the primary existing GHG reduction program in the United States. The mandate effectively requires a rising amount of GHG abatement each year, but allows regulated parties to buy and sell credits to meet annual obligations. Although many aspects of the biofuel mandate look similar to a cap-and-trade program, there are additional requirements, such as feedstock eligibility limitations and waivers. The existence of the mandates is presumably conditional on all the legal requirements, but these conditions represent a departure from a strict GHG cap-and-trade program. We estimate GHG abatement costs of the mandate and compare them to a hypothetical cap-and-trade program targeting vehicle fuels. The mandate abatement cost is found to be higher than a hypothetical GHG cap-and-trade. Our results show that the RFS might be judged as a feasible substitute for a cap-and-trade regime that can deliver GHG reductions, but at a higher cost reflecting its multiple objectives. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study presents a preliminary assessment of biodiesel production from waste sources available in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) for energy generation and solution for waste disposal issues. A case study was developed under three different scenarios: (S1) KSA population only in 2017, (S2) KSA population and pilgrims in 2017, and (S3) KSA population and pilgrims by 2030 using the fat fraction of the municipal solid waste. It was estimated that S1, S2, and S3 scenarios could produce around 1.08, 1.10 and 1.41 million tons of biodiesel with the energy potential of 43423, 43949 and 56493 TJ respectively. Furthermore, annual savings of US $55.89, 56.56 and 72.71 million can be generated from landfill diversion of food waste and added to the country's economy. However, there are challenges in commercialization of waste to biodiesel facilities in KSA, including waste collection and separation, impurities, reactor design and biodiesel quality. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In an RCCI (reactivity controlled compression ignition) engine, the double injection strategy is a technical tool to control its combustion process. In this study, the effects of two key injection parameters, namely dwell and split fraction, are numerically investigated in a gasoline and biodiesel fueled RCCI engine. In the engine, gasoline is used as the premixed fuel; meanwhile, biodiesel is directly injected into the air-fuel mixture. The coupled KIVA4-CHEMKIN code was used to simulate the in-cylinder combustion process and the emissions formation. The gasoline/biodiesel reaction mechanism, which consists of 107 species and 425 reactions, was implemented in the code for detailed chemistry calculation. During the simulation, the dwells between 1st and 2nd SOI (start of injection) timings were varied at 5, 15, 25 and 35°CA, while the 1st SOI timing was fixed at −35 °C ATDC. Besides, the 1st pulse fractions were changed at 30%, 50% and 70%; accordingly, the rest of the biodiesel was injected through the 2nd pulse. The combustion characteristics (including in-cylinder pressure, HRR (heat release rate), ignition delay, PPRR (peak pressure rise rate) and combustion duration), engine performance and emissions (NO and soot) formations were compared under various operating conditions. The results show that double injection strategy results in longer ignition delay. In contrast with the dwells of 15° and 25°CA, the cases with dwells of 5° and 35°CA could result in acceptable PPRR, longer combustion duration, but slightly lower IMEP (indicated mean effective pressure). However, short dwell of 5°CA displays better results on NO and soot emissions. The combustion process with long dwell of 35°CA is both reactivity and mixing controlled. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The potential of Gracilaria gracilis (G. gracilis) and Cladophora glomerata (C. glomerata) macro-algae species harvested from Caspian Sea for biocrude oil production under Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) reaction at 350 °C and 15 min has been investigated. Furthermore, the effect of using recycled aqueous phase as the HTL reaction solvent was studied. The biocrude yield for G. gracilis and C. glomerata was 15.7 and 16.9 wt%, respectively with higher heating value (HHV) of 36.01 and 33.06 MJ/kg. The sources of each existing component in bio-oil were identified by GC–MS based on their suggested reaction pathways. Moreover, after two series of aqueous solution recycling, experiments showed that the bio-oil yield significantly increased compared with the initial condition. This increasing directly relates with recovery of carbon content from the aqueous solution residue. © 2017

AB  - In this study, numerical analysis of fuel structures on engine soot particles’ mass and size were done by CFD combustion modelling using diesel and different levels of unsaturated biodiesel fuels through the KIVA4-CHEMKIN platform. The proposed numerical approach, with a quad-component skeletal mechanism of biodiesel blend surrogates along with a multi-step phenomenological soot particle model, could capture the soot particle characteristics of test fuels with acceptable accuracy under engine combustion conditions. The reduction of exhaust soot from biodiesel combustion, compared to diesel fuel, was attributed to the suppressed soot precursors formation and lower number of particles in total. However, it was concluded that the biodiesel fuel with a higher fraction of unsaturated FAMEs (more double carbon bonds C[dbnd]C) contributed more to the formation of soot precursors, thus producing a higher amount of soot particles in mass and numbers as a consequence of accelerated soot particle nucleation and soot surface growth. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Effect of reaction variables of in situ transesterification on the biodiesel production, and the characteristic differences of biodiesel obtained from aerobic granular sludge (AG) and algae-bacteria granular consortia (AAG) were investigated. The results indicated that the effect of variables on the biodiesel yield decreased in the order of methanol quantity > catalyst concentration > reaction time, yet the parameters change will not significantly affect biodiesel properties. The maximum biodiesel yield of AAG was 66.21 ± 1.08 mg/g SS, what is significant higher than that of AG (35.44 ± 0.92 mg/g SS). Although methyl palmitate was the dominated composition of biodiesel obtained from both granules, poly-unsaturated fatty acid in the AAG showed a higher percentage (21.86%) than AG (1.2%) due to Scenedesmus addition. Further, microbial analysis confirmed that the composition of biodiesel obtained from microbial granules was also determined by bacterial community, and Xanthomonadaceae and Rhodobacteraceae were the dominant bacteria of AG and AAG, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The tire industry is currently considering natural rubber from guayule (Parthenium argentatum Gray) as a viable alternative to imported Hevea natural rubber, or petroleum-based synthetics, to meet expanding materials needs of the industry. However, only 5–10% of the harvested guayule plant is converted into rubber latex. For economic sustainability, the industry must identify viable uses for the balance residual, termed bagasse. Bioenergy production has been considered, but conversion facilities must be co-located to avoid additional costs in transportation of the bagasse. This study investigated the economics of processing a minimum of 200 metric ton per day (MTPD) of guayule bagasse to produce biofuels in a biorefinery co-located with a guayule latex processing facility. A unique aspect of the simulated process was the use of the tail gas reactive pyrolysis (TGRP) technology that formulates an intermediate bio-oil with less oxygenates and therefore requires only mild upgrading to fuel products. This achieved a yield of 16.2%, distributed in the gasoline (9.7%), jet fuel (5.6%), and diesel (0.9%) carbon ranges. The capital cost was estimated at $58.74 million (MM), and the annual operating cost was estimated at $14.19 MM. A discounted cash flow rate of return (DCFROR) analysis was conducted to evaluate the economic feasibility based on a 30-year plant life and 10% internal rate of return. The minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) calculated was 1.88 $/L for gasoline, 1.84 $/L for jet fuel and 1.91 $/L for diesel fuel, clearly showing the limitations imposed by economies of scale of the current guayule bagasse availability. However, there is a potential to reduce the MFSP by increasing the facility capacity and utilizing the valuable co-products that accompany guayule pyrolysis biorefining. Sensitivity analysis indicates the MFSP of gasoline can be lowered to 0.96 $/L considering the most optimistic scenario, comprising an integrated large facility of 2000 MTPD, lower cost of hydrogen, and the sale of a premium-quality residual guayule biorefinery coke. © 2017

AB  - The aim of this work is to propose and to validate a dynamical model for an esterification reaction that was carried out in a relatively new configuration for biodiesel production process: a packed bed reactor with input, output, and recycle. More specifically, the reagents of the esterification process were free fatty acids (FFA) contained in canola oil and low cost methanol (LCM), whereas a commercial cation exchange resin (Purolite CT725) was used as a solid-acid catalyst. The effects of both the LCM volumetric inflow rate and the inflow FFA molar fraction were investigated. The dynamical model was built considering the following assumptions: 1) the reactor was modeled as a CSTR due to the high ratio of recycling volumetric flow to reactor volumetric inflow and 2) the kinetic expression in the model is written in terms of activity coefficients in the light of the non-ideal behavior of the esterification reaction. A satisfactory agreement between the experimental data and the proposed model was obtained. Thus, the resulting model may be advised as a valuable tool for the analysis, control, and optimization of continuous packed bed reactors where the esterification of FFA in the presence of solid acid catalyst is carried out to produce biodiesel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sweden has ambitions to phase out fossil fuels and significantly increase the share of biofuels it uses. This article focuses on Stockholm County and biogas, with the aim to increase the knowledge about regional preconditions. Biogas-related actors have been interviewed, focusing on the demand side. Biogas solutions play an essential role, especially regarding bus transports and taxis. Long-term development has created well-functioning socio-technical systems involving collaboration. However, uncertainties about demand and policy cause hesitation and signs of stagnating development. Public organizations are key actors regarding renewables. For example, Stockholm Public Transport procures biogas matching the production at municipal wastewater treatment plants, the state-owned company Swedavia steers via a queuing system for taxis, and the municipalities have shifted to “environmental cars”. There is a large interest in electric vehicles, which is expected to increase significantly, partially due to suggested national policy support. The future role of biogas will be affected by how such an expansion comes about. There might be a risk of electricity replacing biogas, making it more challenging to reach a fossil-free vehicle fleet. Policy issues strongly influence the development. The environmental car definition is of importance, but its limited focus fails to account for several different types of relevant effects. The dynamic policy landscape with uncertainties about decision makers’ views on biogas seems to be one important reason behind the decreased pace of development. A national, long-term strategy is missing. Both the European Union and Sweden have high ambitions regarding a bio-based and circular economy, which should favor biogas solutions. © 2017

AB  - In this study, an integrated biomass conversion concept of producing liquid biofuels from fresh water macroalgal biomass was investigated. The algal biomass was collected from the Song river, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India and processed under laboratory. 0.650 g dry wt m−2of algal biomass was harvested from the freshwater river. The collected algal biomass contained mainly 2 macroalgae species. Lipid extraction was done by soxhlet extraction method using chloroform: methanol (2:1) as solvent. 18.6% of lipid was obtained from macroalgae biomass. Blends of algae biodiesel with, butanol and diesel fuel (A5B25D70 and A10B30D60) were prepared by Inline blending method on a volume basis. Oil extracted algal biomass was further hydrolyzed for release of fermentable sugar. The theoretical yield of conversion of fermentable sugars to bioethanol was estimated and found to be 61.0%. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the sustainability of producing synthetic fuels from biomass using thermochemical processing and different upgrading pathways. Life cycle assessment (LCA) models consisting of biomass collection, transportation, pre-treatment, pyrolysis and upgrading stages were developed. To reveal the environmental impacts associated with greater post-processing to achieve higher quality fuels, six different bio-oil upgrading scenarios were analysed and included esterification, ketonisation, hydrotreating and hydrocracking. Furthermore, to take into account the possible ranges in LCA inventory data, expected, optimistic and pessimistic values for producing and upgrading pyrolysis oils were evaluated. We found that the expected carbon dioxide equivalent emissions could be as high as 6000 gCO2e/kg of upgraded fuel, which is greater than the emissions arising from the use of diesel fuel. Other environmental impacts occurring from the fuel production process are outlined, such as resource depletion, acidification and eutrophication. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Waste cooking oil, which can be used as a raw material for biodiesel fuel (BDF), contains two kinds of oil components: triglycerides (TGs) and free fatty acids (FFAs). Therefore, both alkaline-type and acid-type catalysts are needed to produce BDF from waste cooking oil. In this study, an alkaline-type grafted fibrous catalyst bearing OH- ions was synthesized by radiation-induced emulsion grafting of 4-chloromethylstyrene onto a polyethylene-coated polypropylene (PE/PP) nonwoven fabric, amination with trimethylamine, and further treatment with NaOH. Furthermore, an acid-type catalyst bearing H+ ions was synthesized by radiation-induced emulsion grafting of ethyl p-styrenesulfonate onto a PE/PP nonwoven fabric, saponification with NaOH, and protonation with HNO3. The OH- and H+ densities of the grafted fibrous catalysts were controlled by the grafting yield. The maximum OH- and H+ densities of the catalysts were 3.6 mmol-OH-/g-catalyst and 3.4 mmol-H+/g-catalyst, respectively. The performances of the catalysts were evaluated in the batchwise transesterification of TGs and ethanol, and the batchwise esterification of FFAs and ethanol. In both cases, TGs and FFAs were gradually converted into BDF. The mixed oil and four actual waste cooking oils, which contained both TGs and FFAs, were completely converted into BDF by sequential catalytic reactions with the acid-type grafted fibrous catalyst and then the alkaline-type grafted fibrous catalyst. © 2017

AB  - Biodiesel produced form waste cooking oil (WCO) has increasingly attracted the attentions as an alternative fuel due to lower particulate emissions and other beneficial factors such as low cost. The present study investigated the production of biodiesel (BFD) as one of the effective methods in solving energy crises and environmental pollution. To increase the consumption of biofuels, a high yield biodiesels (96%) was produced as an alternative to fossil fuels by electrolysis method using graphite electrodes through trans-esterification reaction of WCO and KOH in presence of methanol. This reaction was done in 2 h without side saponification reaction. Biodiesel decreases the environmental effects of waste oil and can cause a new application for using the waste oil. The effect of the catalysis amount, oil/alcohol molar ratio, the amount of co-solvent, water amount, reaction temperature, voltage and the reaction time on biodiesel production were investigated confirming this method as a highly effective way for obtaining high yields. Increasing the catalyst beyond a known level decreases the reaction yield due to saponification side reactions; in consequence, an optimum amount of the catalyst should be used. Without inserting the electricity current in the environment temperature, trans-esterification reaction is done slightly in a long time but proper voltage should be used to obtain high yield, complete the reaction and decrease the reaction time. The purpose of this study is to show that the rheology of the biodiesel is a strong function of the shear history. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass (bamboo waste) nitrogen-enriched pyrolysis was carried out in a fixed bed with NH3 atmosphere at 400–800 °C, and formation mechanism of N-containing species was explored in depth. Results showed that N-enriched pyrolysis greatly increased bio-oil and gas yields. H2 yield increased sharply to 130 mL/g (32.93 vol%) and became the main composition at higher temperature, while CH4 and CO yields deceased, and the lower heating value of gas reached ∼14 MJ/Nm3. For bio-oil, the content of phenols (main compositions) and N-containing species increased significantly, and the maximums reached 61.33% and 11.47%, respectively. While that of acetic acid (disappeared), O-containing species (aldehydes/ketones/furans/esters) and aromatics decreased largely accordingly. For biochar, Nitrogen content increased, and it contained abundant pyridininc-N, pyrrolic-N, quaternary-N, and pyridone-N-oxide. Possible reaction pathways of biomass N-enriched pyrolysis was proposed based on products evolution. In conclusion, biomass N-enriched pyrolysis could obtain high-valued N-containing chemical species and functional biochar. © 2017

AB  - In this study, biodiesel was synthesized in an enzymatic transesterification process from Hevea brasiliensis, crude non-edible oil, using lipase immobilized on spherical silica aerogels. Enzymatic transesterification is preferred to chemical methods as it is milder and is more environmentally friendly. Lipase based transesterification of Hevea brasiliensis under optimal conditions provided high FAME (fatty acid methyl esters) yields up to 93%. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the process for maximum FAME yield. The maximum yield was obtained at a temperature of 35 °C, water content of 15% (v/v %) and methanol/oil molar ratio of 8:1. Percent yields of FAME from the transesterification process followed second order model. Even after 10 cycles of reuse, lipase immobilized on spherical silica aerogel showed only 10.7% reduction in percentage yield of FAME. The results from this study demonstrate the viability of economical biodiesel production using waste products as both source and catalyst. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Jatropha curcas has been introduced as a low-cost energy crop in Burkina Faso for the production of straight vegetable oil (SVO) and biodiesel. It is cultivated in different plantation systems including smallholder inter-plantings with annual crops, large-scale monoculture, afforestation on marginal land, in traditional hedge systems along contour stone walls, and in living fences. We performed Life Cycle Assessment of these Jatropha systems using empirical data on yields and carbon stocks, and accounting for changes in agro-ecosystem provisioning and regulating services that occurred after the land conversion to Jatropha. The study found that all J. curcas production pathways substantially reduced greenhouse gas emission (68–89%) and saved energy (65–90%) compared to diesel fuel. Highest values are achievable under the assumption that by-products (husks, seed cake, glycerin) are used for energy generation. The decentralized production of SVO supplied by feedstocks from intercropping and hedgerow systems seems to be most promising option. However, very low land-use efficiency (6.5–9.5 GJ ha− 1 production) characterized Jatropha intercropping and monoculture plantations, rendering the plant a competitor to food crops and increasing the risk of conversion of savanna land to Jatropha cultivation. Jatropha plantings on marginal lands largely failed. High labor requirements constrain integration of Jatropha plantation systems within small farmholdings. Currently, the traditional hedge systems show the lowest land-use replacement potential and labor needs while providing multiple ecosystem services, but alone cannot satisfy rural energy needs. In order to reach energy supply targets without claiming more land and compromising other ecosystem services, the J. curcas plantation systems in Burkina Faso need to be made more efficient through plant breeding and improved agronomic management. © 2017 International Energy Initiative

AB  - To synthesis biodiesel from palm oil in one-time addition of methanol and solvent-free medium using CBD fused with C-terminal of lipase from G. stearothermophilus (GSlip-CBD) was immobilized onto magnetic cellulose nanosphere (MCNS). The immobilized matrix traits were preconceived by FT-IR, TEM and XRD. Perceptible biodiesel yield 98 and 73% was synthesized by GSlip-CBD-MCNS in 4 h and GSlip-MCNS in 6 h under the optimized conditions of oil:methanol ratio (1:3.5), temperature (55 and 50 °C) and enzyme loading (15 U). Intriguingly, the operational stability of GSlip-CBD-MCNS was an easily attainable owing to the magnetic properties and could be reused up to 8th and19th cycles with 94 and 45% of biodiesel yield respectively, compared to GSlip-MCNS. Thus GSlip-CBD-MCNS could be a potential biocatalyst for higher yield of biodiesel and reusability in one step addition of methanol. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays, biofuel production is a fast expanding industry and is facing a growing dilemma about a feedstock source capable of keeping up with demand. Recently, macroalgae have been attracting a wide attention as a source for biofuel. In the present study, ten macroalgae were collected and screened as biodiesel feedstocks. As a result of their high biomass production and relatively high lipid content, Ulva lactuca, Padina boryana and Ulva intestinalis showed the highest significant lipids and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) areal productivities among the studied species. Saturated fatty acids (SAFs) showed insignificant differences in the selected species, with noticeably significant higher polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) content in U. lactuca by 4.2 and 3 times, with respect to P. boryana and U. intestinalis, respectively. The recorded increase in PUFAs was attributed to higher content of C16:4n-3, C18:3n-3 and C18:4n-3. By lipid fractionation, P. boryana showed significant higher concentration of neutral lipids (37.7 mg g−1 CDW, representing 46.7% of total fatty acids) in comparison to U. lactuca and U. intestinalis, which showed 16% and 17% lower neutral lipid fractions, respectively. In addition, biodiesel characteristics of the studied macroalgae complied with that of international standards. Furthermore, oil-free residual biomass can be readily converted into fermentable sugars or biogas due to its high carbohydrates content, which adds to the economics of macroalgae as biofuel feedstock. In conclusion, the present study confirmed that macroalgae represent an attractive alternative renewable feedstock for biodiesel and other biofuels. © 2017 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan

AB  - Average carbon chain length is a key parameter that defines the quality of liquid biofuels. In this paper, a method for the determination of carbon chain lengths of fatty acid mixtures is presented. The approach is based on proton relaxation rates measured by time domain nuclear magnetic resonance. The spin–spin relaxation rates R2 were used for the estimation of the carbon chain lengths. The method was examined for the set of samples with different mean lengths of the main linear carbon chain. Samples were prepared using four different fatty acids and mixtures of two, three or four of these fatty acids. The correlation coefficient between the known and measured values was equal to 0.994. Based on the relaxation theory, a linear-like dependence between the relaxation rate and carbon chain length was briefly shown, which endorses the experimental results. The developed methodology for determining carbon chain lengths offers robustness and rapidity, which are significant advantages when it comes to online use of the method in real industrial environments. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Organic sources of biodiesel such as microalgae are considered as potential renewable energy resources. These organisms are considered as sunlight-driven cellular factories that convert carbon dioxide to high amounts of lipids that can be used for biofuel production. This paper describes the possibility of using Desmodesmus sp. (I-AU1) for biodiesel production by evaluating its fatty acid profile distribution pattern and estimating the fuel-derived physical and chemical properties from fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) obtained from the trans-esterified microalgal oil. Growth rate, oil content, biomass, and lipid productivity of the algal strain have been investigated under nitrogen-starved (0.375 g L−1 NaNO3 in BG 11 medium) autotrophic condition for 22 days. Maximum average biomass yield of Desmodesmus sp. (I-AU1) is 0.745 g L−1 having 36.14% lipid content per dry weight of biomass, with a specific growth rate of 0.20 day−1. Fatty acid profiling of the biodiesel obtained from Desmodesmus sp. (I-AU1) contained total saturated fatty acid (SAFA) methyl esters of 31.02%, while the total monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) (C18:1) is 25.64%. Percentage composition of SAFA and MUFA for the microalga was 56.66%, which is high compared to that of most of related studies. Fuel properties were determined by empirical equations and were found to be within the limits of biodiesel standards ASTM D6751 (American) and EN 14214 (European). The quality properties of the biodiesel were low density (0.88 g cm−3), low kinematic viscosity (2.81 mm2 s−1), cetane number (43.47), oxidation stability (5.96 h), and cold filter plugging point (−7.41 °C). Hence, Desmodesmus sp. (I-AU1) has potential as a feedstock for the production of quality biodiesel. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Quantification models based on the processing of FTIR spectra by partial least squares regression (PLS) were created in order to develop a method for the determination of 2-ethylhexyl nitrate (2-EHN) in diesel fuels. The set of standards was prepared using 2-EHN, biodiesel (FAME) and various mineral diesel fuels (2-EHN free). The standards were prepared in the concentration range of 2-EHN of 0–2436 mg kg−1. The set of the standards was divided into the calibration, validation and test sets. While the calibration set was used to build the model, validation set was used in order to optimize the model parameters. The test set of the standards was used to assess the predictive ability and repeatability of the model. Several hundreds of various models were developed and compared in order to find a suitable combination of the preprocessing methods and number of latent variables. The most promising model was developed using mean centered spectra in the form of their first derivative and smoothed using Gap-Segment derivative. The model showed quite good predictive ability and repeatability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The marine auxiliary diesel engines installed in the large transoceanic ships are used in order to generate the electricity but at the same time these engines are able to produce a significant amount of the harmful exhaust gas emissions. Therefore the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) concluded an agreement, which has to control generating of gaseous emissions in maritime transport. From this reason started to be used some of the alternative fuels in this branch. There was performed a study, which investigated emissions of the auxiliary marine diesel engine during application of the experimental fuels. The different testing fuels were created using the ratios 0%, 50%, 80% and 100% between the biodiesel and the ULSDF (Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel Fuel). The experimental measurements were performed at the different engine loading levels and various engine speeds in order to investigate an influence of the mixed fuels on the engine operational characteristics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Oil meal is a by-product of the oil industry (peanut meal, sesame meal, and camellia meal). Oil is extracted from seeds, and the leftover meal is then pelletized, and this process generates a large amount of waste oil meal in Taiwan. In this study, peanut meal, sesame meal, and camellia meal derived fuels were prepared from the waste oil meal with waste cooking oil. The combustion behaviors of the oil meal derived fuels were also investigated. The characteristics of the derived fuel made from oil meal with waste cooking oil showed that the ash content is less than 10% and its calorific value reached 5000 kcal/kg. Additionally, the activation energy of the oil meal and waste cooking oil was analyzed by the Kissinger method. The results show that the fuel prepared in this work from the oil meal mixed with waste cooking oil is suitable for use as an alternative fuel and also avoids food safety issues. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) represents a promising source for biofuel production and other bioactive compounds because of their high availability and high biomass yield. The present work aims to determine the possibility for biofuel production and other active compounds from seasonally collected water hyacinth. The water hyacinth samples were collected at four seasons (2014/2015) from River Nile, Giza, Egypt, and the biofuel (biodiesel and bioethanol), lipids, glycerol content, carbohydrates and other biochemical compounds were determined in addition to physico-chemically characterized of produced biodiesel The obtained results indicated that, water hyacinth samples showed variable lipid contents (6.79–10.45%), which by transesterification produced biodiesels (3.22–6.36%) and sediment (pigments+glycerol). Biodiesel composed either totally of saturated fatty acids (Myristic acid) of winter and autumn samples, However, Myristic and Stearic acids with small proportion of pentadecanoic acid of summer and spring samples by 8.1 and 7.9% respectively. The monounsaturated fatty acid, Oleic, was only recorded in the summer sample by11.6%. So biodiesels produced from water hyacinth have good stability and acceptability to be used in diesel engines, the co-products (sediment) composed of pigments and glycerol reached to 4.69 mg/g and 1.05 mmol/L respectively in winter season. Also, pretreatment of water hyacinth by acid at mild conditions was found to be effective with high yield of fermentable sugars and production of ethanol during 120–180 min for different seasonally collected plants. From the results, we can conclude that the produced biodiesel (from water hyacinth) was within the recommended standards and met the criteria required to be a diesel substitute compared with the Egyptian fuel standards In addition, it is possible to use its pigments as natural coloring substances in food industry, and glycerol can be incorporated in different petrochemical industries. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Biodiesels have come up as a very strong alternative for diesel fuel. Biodiesels such as Jatropha Oil Methyl Ester (JOME) are comparable in performance with that of the diesel engine. The thermal efficiency of engines fuelled with biodiesels was found lower than conventional diesel fuel but due to the bio-origin, the emission characteristics are much better. However, biodiesel increases the NOx emissions as these are rich in oxygen, hence nanoparticles are used in this experiment to curb the high temperatures and reduce the NOx formation. The experiment on naturally aspired diesel engine was conducted with four prepared test fuels other than neat diesel and neat biodiesel. The 50 and 150 of alumina nanoparticles were added separately to the pure diesel and pure Jatropha biodiesel to form the nano emulsions using ultrasonicator. The properties of nanoemulsion were evaluated using dynamic light scattering technique using zetasizer. The performance and emission characteristics of multi-cylinder diesel engine with these nanoemulsions were compared with that of neat fuels. The results showed that using nanoparticles with diesel and biodiesel can contribute in a more efficient, economical, and eco-friendly engine operation. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Depending on the number of C5 units, limonene and bisabolene are recognized as representative monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, respectively. Limonene and bisabolene are important pharmaceutical and nutraceutical products used in the prevention and treatment of cancer and many other diseases. In addition, they can be used as starting materials to produce a range of commercially valuable products, such as pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, and biofuels. The low abundance or yield of limonene and bisabolene in plants renders their isolation from plant sources non-economically viable. Isolation of limonene and bisabolene from plants also suffers from low efficiency and often requires harsh reaction conditions, prolonged reaction times, and expensive equipment cost. Recently, the rapid developments in metabolic engineering of microbes provide a promising alternative route for producing these plant natural products. Therefore, producing limonene and bisabolene by engineering microbial cells into microbial factories is becoming an attractive alternative approach that can overcome the bottlenecks, making it more sustainable, environmentally friendly and economically competitive. Here, we reviewed the status of metabolic engineering of microbes that produce limonene and bisabolene including microbial hosts, key enzymes, metabolic pathways and engineering of limonene/bisabolene biosynthesis. Furthermore, key challenges and future perspectives were discussed. © 2018, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - In this study, an experimental investigation of engine performance and emissions is performed on a DI diesel engine using stabilized emulsified fuels, blends of biodiesel, diethyl ether, water and diesel. And the study is concluded by determining the optimal fuel fractions with respect to engine performance and emissions. Experiments are done gradually to obtain the optimum values for each fuel, biodiesel, diethyl ether and emulsified fuel, in blend fuel. As a result of experimental studies the optimal blend fuel fractions, with respect to engine performance, for biodiesel utilization, for diethyl ether utilization and for emulsified fuel utilization are found to be B20, DEE5 and E10, respectively. In other words, the optimum emulsified fuel is formed as a blend of 20% biodiesel, 5% DEE, 10% tap water, 2% surfactant and 63% pure diesel, by mass. Considering the results obtained, performance and emissions are presented for the optimum emulsified fuel utilization and also with comparison to the standard engine data. Reminding the results of experiments are conducted at the maximum torque condition, in conclusion a small reduction in engine torque and power, and a 5.7% reduction in SFC, and improvements up to 19% in brake efficiency, and a 12.5% reduction in NO emission, and a 29% reduction in smoke emission, and remarkable reductions in CO and increases in HC emissions are observed. © 2017

AB  - The study aims to demonstrate the overall environmental sustainability of biomethane production by anaerobic digestion of the separately collected organic fraction of municipal solid waste. There is a great interest in the utilisation of biofuels produced from biowaste in the transport sector, due to the benefits of reduced pollutant emissions and diversified transport fuel supplies. An attributional, process-based life cycle assessment study quantifies and compares the potential environmental impacts of an anaerobic digestion plant, where the produced biogas is upgraded to biomethane for the transport sector instead that directly burned in a combined heat and power unit. The avoided impacts related to the utilisation of biomethane instead of diesel, petrol or natural gas have been evaluated with reference to a vehicle fleet made of passenger cars and small rigid trucks. They appear large enough to make the biomethane production the cleanest option for the management of biowaste. The global warming and non-renewable energy potentials of the Biowaste-to-Biomethane scenario improve of 79% and 36%, respectively, with reference to the Biowaste-to-Energy scenario. A sensitivity analysis evaluates the effect of several key parameters. Some of them are peculiar for the analysed application, such as the composition of the vehicle fleet, specific biomethane consumptions of these vehicles, and methane slip in the biogas upgrading unit. Some other parameters are more general, such as the final destination of solid digestate, gas engine efficiency, national electric energy mix. The results of the analysis provide data and information to policy-makers, planners and operators that would like or have to approach the management of the separately collected organic fraction of municipal solid waste. They also inform on the environmental advantages connected with the utilisation for road transportation of biomethane produced from this waste fraction. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Coffee is one of the most popular beverages, directly linked with tradition, highlighting its cultural and social effect worldwide. Coffee consumption has been continuously increasing, generating huge amounts of solid residues in return in the form of Spent Coffee Grounds (SCG). In recent years, global environmental awareness and strict legislation have driven research towards the implementation of sustainable processes. Innovative and environmentally sound methodologies for the exploitation of waste-streams have gained interest among the scientific community. In the frame of circular economy, wastes are perceived as sources for the recovery of high value-added compounds. In this review, several scenarios, regarding the exploitation of this low-cost feedstock with huge valorization potential, are being presented via either physicochemical or biotechnological routes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic bioethanol (LCB) is a biofuel produced from the nonfood feedstock, with the great potential of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions savings. Crop residues are considered to be suitable feedstock for its production, however, the amount of the feedstock needed for a production is large, making the supply of the plant rather complex and expensive. Therefore, selection of an optimal LCB plant location plays an important role in reducing supply costs and GHG emissions. The main objective of this study was to define the adequate approach for determining the location of LCB plant. As an appropriate basis, the p median mathematical model was selected and further adapted. The general objective of the model is minimization of both internal and external biomass transport costs. The necessary input for the model testing is selection of biomass and mapping of its potentials. The model was tested for the problem of LCB plant location in Serbia, considering both road and inland waterway transport of biomass. Novi Sad was selected as the optimal macro location of the plant in Serbia. The comparative analysis pointed out that, in the case of Serbia, depending on the selected location and transport mode, the biomass transport costs can range from 7 €/t to 18 €/t and have a share from 13.5% to 30% in the plant supply costs. Additionally, the costs savings in the case of applying multimodal instead of road transport can be from 1 €/t up to 9 €/t of biomass, respectively 5 €/t up to 45 €/t of produced bioethanol. Based on the results, effectiveness of the defined approach for the selection of LCB plant location can be verified. The results directly pointed out the importance of the transport costs analysis at the selection of a LCB plant location and the positive effects of using inland waterways for the biomass transportation. Obtained results can be further used for detailed analysis of environmental impacts, first of all GHG emissions saving. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-oil derived via fast pyrolysis is being developed as a renewable fuel option for petroleum distillates. The compatibility of neat bio-oil with 18 plastic types was evaluated using neat diesel fuel as the baseline. The plastic materials included polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyoxymethylene (POM), POM copolymer, high density polyethylene (HDPE), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG), polythiourea (PTU), four nylon grades, and four thermosetting resins. Specimens of each material were immersed in the test fuels for a period of 16 weeks to achieve full saturation. Except for PP and HDPE, the plastic materials underwent higher volume expansion in bio-oil than in the baseline diesel (which was negligible in most cases). This volume increase corresponds to the higher polarity of the bio-oil. PPS, PET, and PTFE were unaffected by bio-oil exposure, but modest swelling (between 2 and 5%) occurred for the two acetals (POM and POM copolymer), Nylon-12, PBT, PETG, and the four resin grades. More moderate swelling (8-15%) was noted for Nylon-6, Nylon-6/6, and Nylon-11, and excessive swell (>40%) occurred for PTU. The nonpolar nature of PP and HDPE matches that of diesel, leading to higher solubility (swell) in this fuel type. The relatively low volume expansion following exposure indicates that many of the existing infrastructure plastics (excluding PTU) should be suitable for use with bio-oil. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A novel strategy for the synthesis of high-density biofuel using two biomass-derived oxygenated compounds, furfural and guaiacol, with a variety of heterogeneous catalysts is proposed. In the first step of this strategy, furfural is converted with high yields and selectivity to cyclopentanol (CPOL) over Mg-Al supported Cu catalysts. Then, the cyclopentanol is used to alkylate guaiacol over a series of HY zeolites to generate C9-C16 oxygenates with an appropriate molecular weight to be used as transportation fuels. Finally, in the last step of this catalytic strategy, the C-alkylation products are successfully hydrodeoxygenated over ruthenium nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes (Ru/MWCNT), producing a liquid mixture of cyclic hydrocarbons with high density (0.865 g mL-1 at 20 °C) and excellent low-temperature properties. This overall reaction route is a promising approach for converting biomass-derived compounds into transportation fuel precursors. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel is currently produced from a catalytic transesterification reaction of edible and nonedible oils with methanol. New policies are encouraging the development of advanced biofuels produced from lignocellulosic feedstocks or industrial waste as animal fat. This material is less expensive than current oils but usually has high content of free fatty acids and a pre-esterification reaction becomes necessary, increasing the cost of the catalytic process. The production of biodiesel using supercritical alcohols is appropriate for materials with high acidity and water content; therefore, the use of this method for animal fat is a promising alternative. Two different processes have been studied: a single-step direct transesterification using supercritical ethanol and a two-step process of hydrolysis and esterification. Ethanol, instead of methanol, has been used as the reagent because it can be produced from biomass via fermentation, resulting in a complete renewable biofuel. The final conversion and degradation of unsaturated fatty acid esters, which is the main drawback of these high temperature and pressure processes, have been studied through the change of several parameters such as temperature, ethanol:animal fat molar ratio, and reaction time. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Micro-mesoporous ZSM-5/MCM-41 composites were prepared and then loaded with varied contents of NiMoW by the wet impregnation method. The hydrocracking conversion of crude palm oil to liquid biofuels with the prepared catalysts was carried out in a batch reactor at 400°C for 2 h. ZSM-5/MCM-41 composite exhibited 51.00% conversion with a yield of 9.23% gasoline, 20.60% kerosene, and 21.17% diesel. Upon loading of NiMoW, the catalysts exhibited an improved conversion (≥ 62.60%) and a reduced formation of coke, which resulted from combined properties of ZSM-5 with MCM-41 and the presence of dispersed NiMoW. The contents of impregnated metals also affected the performance of catalysts. Using ANOVA analysis (p < 0.05), we found that 8:8:8 wt.% NiMoW-ZSM-5/MCM-41 catalyst was suitable for the production of biofuels, when considering the efficiency and cost-effectiveness. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In the present paper, laboratory produced, animal origin biofuels (swine lard and turkey lard had been used as raw material for biofuel production) were evaluated in terms of physicochemical parameters and compared with commercial mineral diesel fuel and its mixture with rapeseed oil methyl esters. Basing on the results of physicochemical parameters assessment, mixtures containing 75% share of bio-component were preselected for further engine tests. The engine tests were performed on a medium-duty, turbocharged, Common Rail, Direct Injection (CRDI) diesel engine, using factory control maps. The scope of experiments included steady state measurements for two rotational speeds (1500 and 3000 RPM), for which full load sweep had been performed. Two injection strategies were utilized: single pulse (for 3000 RPM) and multi-pulse injection (1500 RPM). The research covered evaluation of engine performance parameters and full exhaust emissions. Furthermore, detailed combustion analysis was performed. The study confirmed that high quality fuel can obtained from waste fatty material. The mixtures containing up to 75% of bio-component are suitable for modern CRDI combustion engines, though slight deterioration of engine performance parameters can be expected. An average brake specific fuel consumption increased by 13% compared to reference, for biodiesel mixtures derived from animal fatty material. At the same time a 3% increase against rapeseed oil/diesel mixture was recorded. This was correlated with a minor reduction of brake fuel conversion efficiency, but the average drop didn't exceed 2% for all examined biodiesels. A significant reduction in exhaust gas emissions was observed, when comparing biofuel operation to reference diesel. The use of swine lard methyl ester/diesel mixture caused average reduction of hydrocarbon concentration (THC) by 13%, carbon monoxide (CO) by 22% and carbon dioxide (CO2) by 7%. The turkey biodiesel emission results were respectively: 9%, 20% and 6% reduced. NOx emission increased on average by 7% for both animal origin biofuels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present work, different types of castor biodiesels were synthesized by using slow pyrolysis process of raw castor oil in the presence of different types of catalysts. These catalysts as anhydrous sodium hydroxide (NaOH), alumina (Al2O3), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), potassium hydroxide (KOH) and molecular sieve catalyst zeolite (ZMS-5) combined with anhydrous sodium hydroxide (ZMS-5 combined with NaOH) were used for yielding these biodiesels. So, the effects of variation of the catalyst type and its concentration on both yield of castor biodiesels and the pyrolysis temperature ranges were investigated. It was noticed that through the pyrolysis process, two grades of synthesized biodiesels were obtained in the presence of different types of catalysts. The first at the start of the pyrolysis was yellowish one, termed as Castor Biodiesel Number 1 (CBD1). And the second type was brownish biodiesel, called as Castor Biodiesel Number 2 (CBD2), while the rest was the black and heaviest, termed as bio-mazot. It was found that the highest total yields of biodiesels were obtained in the presence of 1% by volume of both NaOH and ZMS-5 combined with NaOH. Thus, four biodiesels were yielded and termed as CBD1h, CBD2h, CBD1hz, CBD2hz. And the different physical properties of these four biodiesels were measured according to American Society of Testing Material (ASTM). Also, the chemical compositions of these four biodiesels were determined by using Gas Chromatography Mass (GC-Ms) spectrum as well as the functional groups using Infra-Red (IR) spectrum. In addition, the performance of a single cylinder four stroke direct injection compression ignition engine fueled by two different blends as 5 and 10% by volume of CBDh and CBDhz with gas oil was measured. Thus, the main conclusion was derived from both physical and chemical investigations as well as engine performance that these synthesized biodiesels could be used as a good alternative of gas oil. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Alternative fuels have been a major concern in today's era due to its promising characteristics in internal combustion engines. The computational analysis is a proven method by many researchers in determining combustion, performance and emission characteristics of an internal combustion engine, offering accurate results at par with experimental results. An attempt is being made by the author(s) in this paper for performing numerical study of nine (9) different alternative biofuels and pure diesel. Comparison has been carried out with the results of pure diesel in a single cylinder, naturally aspirated, water cooled, direct injection diesel engine with different engine load (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%), constant compression ratio (CR17.5), higher nozzle opening pressure (220 bar) and advance injection timing (23° CA before TDC). The study was performed after validating results of two experimental data using the proposed tool, which have shown that the numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental results. The numerical results of the different biofuels have depicted the possibility of using the fuels as alternative fuel for internal combustion engine. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The different catalytic behaviour of solid acid catalyst and mineral acid catalyst towards the acid-treatment of bio-oil was investigated. The hydrogen ions in the mineral acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid homogeneously dispersed in the reaction medium made the conversion of main components of bio-oil including carboxylic acids, sugars and phenolics more efficient. In comparison, there was a steric hindrance for these components of bio-oil to access the hydrogen located in the local surface of the solid acid catalyst such as Amberlyst 70. This negatively affected their conversions during the acid-treatment. However, the inhomogeneous distribution of hydrogen ions from Amberlyst 70 in the reaction medium created high concentration of hydrogen ions in the local vicinity of the solid catalyst surface of the catalyst, which is found to be crucial for the occurrence of the etherification reactions. Understanding how the dispersion of hydrogen ions of catalyst affect the esterification of bio-oil can provide useful information for the development of the effective catalysts for upgrading of bio-oil. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An attempt has been made to optimize biodiesel production from Bombax ceiba oil (BCO) through calcium oxide nanoparticles (CaO-NPs) catalyzed transesterification. Characterization of CaO-NPs synthesised by solution combustion method was carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Brunauer-Emmett Teller (BET) and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The influence of reaction parameters was studied and optimized by using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) in combination with central composite design (CCD). Two-stage transesterification technique was employed for biodiesel production and 96.2% yield of Bombax ceiba methyl ester (BCME) was achieved under optimum conditions. The CaO-NPs were reused up to 5 cycles with appreciable loss of yield. From the kinetic study performed at different reaction temperatures (55 °C, 60 °C and 65 °C) Ea = 35.99 kJ/mol was obtained. Fuel properties of produced methyl ester were also determined and compared with ASTM standards for biodiesel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Vegetable oils, biodiesel and alcohols are important alternative fuel resources for diesel engines. Prominent fuels of the three types include: soybean oil which has efficient amount of productivity, biodiesel made of waste oils which do not affect food security and alcohols with high number of carbons. There is potential to use quaternary blends of diesel fuel, waste oil methyl ester, soybean oil and higher alcohols, such as propanol and pentanol, in diesel engines for the purpose of increasing the use of biofuels and decreasing fossil fuel consumption. In this work, diesel fuel (D) was mixed with biodiesel (B), and biodiesel-vegetable oil (VO)-alcohol blends using the higher alcohols of propanol (Pro) and pentanol (Pen). Test fuel blends of DB (50 vol% D-50 vol% B), DBVOPro (40 vol% D-40 vol% B-10 vol% VO-10 vol% Pro), DBVOPen (40 vol% D-40 vol% B-10 vol% VO-10 vol% Pen) were prepared through the splash blending method and tested in a diesel engine. The key fuel properties such as density, lower heating value, viscosity and cetane number were measured. Engine performance and exhaust emission tests of the blends were carried out on a four-cylinder, four-cycle diesel engine generator at various loads (0, 3, 6, 9 kW) with fixed engine speed of 1800 rpm. According to engine test results, mean brake specific fuel consumptions (BSFCs) of DBVOPro increased compared to DB and DBVOPen at all engine loads. As compared to DB blend, DBVOPro presented the best mean oxides of nitrogen (NOx) with a reduction of 11.9%. However, formation of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions have been increased with the addition of each of the higher alcohol to DB. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In response to existing global focus on improved biodiesel production methods via highly efficient catalyst-free high temperature and high pressure technologies, this study considered the comparative study of catalyst-free technologies for biodiesel production as an important research area. In this study, therefore, catalyst-free integrated subcritical lipid hydrolysis and supercritical esterification and catalyst-free one step supercritical transesterification processes for biodiesel production have been evaluated via undertaking straight forward comparative energetic and environmental assessments. Energetic comparisons were undertaken after heat integration was performed since energy reduction has favourable effects on the environmental performance of chemical processes. The study confirmed that both processes are capable of producing biodiesel of high purity with catalyst-free integrated subcritical lipid hydrolysis and supercritical esterification characterised by a greater energy cost than catalyst-free one step supercritical transesterification processes for an equivalent biodiesel productivity potential. It was demonstrated that a one-step supercritical transesterification for biodiesel production presents an energetically more favourable catalyst-free biodiesel production pathway compared to the integrated subcritical lipid hydrolysis and supercritical esterification biodiesel production process. The one-step supercritical transesterification for biodiesel production was also shown to present an improved environmental performance compared to the integrated subcritical lipid hydrolysis and supercritical esterification biodiesel production process. This is because of the higher potential environment impact calculated for the integrated subcritical lipid hydrolysis and supercritical esterification compared to the potential environment impact calculated for the supercritical transesterification process, when all material and energy flows are considered. Finally the major contributors to the environmental outcomes of both processes were also clearly elucidated. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant organic carbon source and has received a great deal of interest as renewable and sustainable feedstock for the production of potential biofuels and value-added chemicals with a wide range of designed catalytic systems. However, those natural polymeric materials are composed of short-chain monomers (typically C6 and C5 sugars) and complex lignin molecules containing plenty of oxygen, resulting in products during the downstream processing having low-grade fuel properties or limited applications in organic syntheses. Accordingly, approaches to increase the carbon-chain length or carbon atom number have been developed as crucial catalytic routes for upgrading biomass into energy-intensive fuels and chemicals. The primary focus of this review is to systematically describe the recent examples on the selective synthesis of long-chain oxygenates via different C-C coupling catalytic processes, such as Aldol condensation, hydroalkylation/alkylation, oligomerization, ketonization, Diels-Alder, Guerbet, and acylation reactions. Other integrated reaction steps including, for example, hydrolysis, dehydration, oxidation, partial hydrogenation, and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) to derive corresponding key intermediates or final products are also reviewed. The effects of catalyst structure/type and reaction parameters on the catalytic performance along with relevant reaction mechanisms are in detail discussed. Apart from this, the formation of other useful compounds containing C-X bonds (X = O, N, and S) derived from biomass-based substrates for producing fuel additives and valuable chemicals is also briefly reviewed. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Bioconversion of biodiesel-derived crude glycerol into carotenoids and lipids was investigated by a microbial conversion of an oleaginous red yeast Sporidiobolus pararoseus KM281507. The methanol content in crude glycerol (0.5%, w/v) did not show a significant effect on biomass production by strain KM281507. However, demethanolized crude glycerol significantly supported the production of biomass (8.64 ± 0.13 g/L), lipids (2.92 ± 0.03 g/L), β-carotene (15.76 ± 0.85 mg/L), and total carotenoids (33.67 ± 1.28 mg/L). The optimal conditions suggested by central composite design were crude glycerol concentration (55.04 g/L), initial pH of medium (pH 5.63) and cultivation temperature (24.01°C). Under these conditions, the production of biomass, lipids, β-carotene, and total carotenoids were elevated up to 8.83 ± 0.05, 4.00 ± 0.06 g/L, 27.41 ± 0.20, and 53.70 ± 0.48 mg/L, respectively. Moreover, an addition of olive oil (0.5 − 2.0%) dramatically increased the production of biomass (14.47 ± 0.15 g/L), lipids (6.40 ± 0.09 g/L), β-carotene (54.43 ± 0.95 mg/L), and total carotenoids (70.92 ± 0.51 mg/L). The oleic acid content in lipids was also increased to 75.1% (w/w) of total fatty acids, indicating a good potential to be an alternative biodiesel feedstock. Meanwhile, the β-carotene content in total carotenoids was increased to 76.7% (w/w). Hence, strain KM281507 could be a good potential source of renewable biodiesel feedstock and natural carotenoids. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Generation of biodiesel from microalgae has been extensively investigated; however, its quality is often not suitable for use as fuel. Our investigation involved the evaluation of biodiesel quality using a native isolate Chlorella sorokiniana MIC-G5, as specified by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), after transesterification of lipids with methanol, in the presence of sodium methoxide. Total quantity of lipids extracted from dry biomass, of approximately 410–450 mg g−1 was characterized using FTIR and 1H NMR. After transesterification, the total saturated and unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were 43% and 57%, respectively. The major FAMEs present in the biodiesel were methyl palmitate (C16:0), methyl oleate (C18:1), and methyl linoleate (C18:2), and the 1H NMR spectra matched with criteria prescribed for high-quality biodiesel. The biodiesel exhibited a density of 0.873 g cm–3, viscosity of 3.418 mm2 s−1, cetane number (CN) of 57.85, high heating value (HHV) of 40.25, iodine value of 71.823 g I2 100 g−1, degree of unsaturation (DU) of 58%, and a cold filter plugging point (CFPP) of –5.22°C. Critical fuel parameters, including oxidation stability, CN, HHV, iodine value, flash point, cloud point, pour point, density, and viscosity were in accordance with the methyl ester composition and structural configuration. Hence, C. sorokiniana can be a promising feedstock for biodiesel generation. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We report the development of a two-step pyrolytic fractionation approach that is especially applicable to processing oleaginous algae feed stocks. The first step is a low-temperature pyrolysis (T ∼ 300-320 °C) to produce bio-oils from degradation of protein and carbohydrate fractions. Solid residues left behind can subsequently be subjected to a second higher temperature pyrolysis (T ∼ 420-430 °C) to volatilize and/or degrade triglycerides to produce fatty acids, their derivatives, and long chain hydrocarbons. Thus, pyrolytic fractionation can be used to "fractionate" oleaginous biomass and separately recover triglyceride degradation products. Proof-of-concept micropyrolyzer and subsequent lab-scale fixed-bed experiments were performed using oleaginous Chlorella sp. and Scenedesmus sp. to demonstrate the pyrolytic fractionation technique and determine bio-oil yields. As expected, triglyceride-specific bio-oils were rich in hydrocarbons and free fatty acids, were nearly free of water, short-chain organic acids, and other carbohydrate degradation products, and had low N-content. Due to production of "high quality" triglyceride-specific bio-oil vapors, pyrolytic fractionation would allow product upgrading via in situ gas-phase catalytic processes to generate drop-in fuels (hydrocarbons) or specialty chemicals (e.g., fatty amides), without the need to condense the vapors. A conceptual process design is developed and energy requirements for pyrolytic fractionation are assessed and discussed. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - To fulfill the need of renewable, sustainable, and cleaner form of fuel, scientists are attracted toward biodiesel and hydrotreated vegetable oil or green (renewable) diesel. Biodiesel is generally obtained from vegetable oil by the process of transesterification while green diesel is obtained by hydrogenation. However, chemically both are completely different and thus their physical properties are highly affected. In present work, authors have compared the important properties of Pongamia biodiesel, algal biodiesel and hydrotreated vegetable oil. It is observed that both the biofuels may be blended for use in diesel engines as this will complement their fuel characteristics. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Policymakers in many countries are facing the challenge of phasing out fossil fuels from the vehicle fleet. Until 2008, Sweden seemed to have managed a shift toward flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs), i.e. vehicles that can be driven on a combination of ethanol and gasoline. Every year, sale shares increased, reaching in 2008 almost 25% of the market. But then, the sales dropped to 5% of new sold cars in 2011. In this paper, the development of the flex-fuel market is analyzed by studying the underlying factors such as the market of FFVs and other “green vehicles,” fuel prices, national and local incentives, fueling stations, and the reporting of ethanol as a fuel in media. These factors are then analyzed through econometric analysis of a time series of share of FFVs sales in Sweden between 2002 and 2011 and descriptive statistics of municipal data of share of FFVs sales between 2005 and 2011. Findings show that fuel-efficient diesels entering the market, E85 (ethanol mixed with 15% gasoline) losing its economic advantage, and changes in the rebate structure have been the most significant factors for the decline. The effect of local incentives such as parking subsidies, fueling stations, and exemption from the congestion charging in Stockholm is harder to establish. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The present study investigates the combined effect of oxygen enrichment and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on the performance and emission characteristics of a cardanol biofuel blend, namely B20M10 (20% cardanol, 70% diesel and 10% methanol by volume). The tests are conducted on a four-stroke single-cylinder diesel engine at different loading conditions. Intake air is enriched by 7% of the atmospheric oxygen concentration and exhaust gas is recirculated by 10, 15 and 20% of the total intake charge. Research results reveal that the oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission decreases as the percentage of EGR increases from 0 to 20%. The results shows 11.8% lower NOx B20M10 at 7% oxygen enrichment and 20% EGR when compared to B20M10 without oxygen enrichment and 0% EGR. Higher carbon monoxide (CO), unburnt hydrocarbon (HC) and smoke, and lower brake thermal efficiency are obtained for higher EGR percentages. From the studies it can be stated that B20M10 cardanol biofuel blend with 7% intake air oxygen enrichment and 15% EGR shows better reduction in NOx emissions with minimum penalty of performance and other emission characteristics. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This experimental study was carried out on a CI engine using Mangifera indica biodiesel for performance optimization using the Taguchi method and grey relational analysis (GRA). This paper presents the combined effect of six input parameters, namely compression ratio, injection pressure, injection nozzle geometry, additive, fuel fraction and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), in controlling seven output variables, namely brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake thermal efficiency (BTE), CO, HC, CO2, NOx and smoke. Five levels were selected for each input parameter and unequal weightage assigned to each output variable. Taguchi's L25 orthogonal array has been applied for reducing the number of experiments. The data obtained from the experiments has been analyzed using S/N ratio and GRA to obtain the optimum combination of six input parameters. The results of the analysis were further confirmed through experiments. The tests were conducted on a CI engine at part load and full load to optimize the performance. Deviations in predicted values of grey relational grade (GRG) are 4.48 and 2.61% of the experimental values at part load and full load, respectively, justifying the application of the Taguchi GRA method for multi-objective optimization of CI engine performance. The GRG improvements with Mangifera indica biodiesel blend are 57.5% at part load and 68.3% at full load compared to GRG at initial settings of the diesel engine. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Using of renewable biofuel, in particular liquid biodiesel, is appropriate in order to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in sphere of agricultural production. Development of energy saving equipment and related technologies is actual for the biofuel production and increasing efficiency of technical devices using biodiesel in the conditions of agrarian enterprises. Existing and promising equipment for the production of diesel biofuels does not fully ensure the energy efficiency of the technological process in the conditions of the agricultural producer. Increasing of energy efficiency level during diesel biofuel using by improving the technical equipment for its production and consumption is the aim of the work. The following tasks were formed to achieve the goal: justification of receiving biodiesel with circulating mixers technology, justification of diesel biofuels using for the machinery exploitation in agricultural production. Circulating mixing which is carried out by repeated transfer of the emulsion over a closed loop was proposed for the process of biodiesel production. Diesel biofuel is proposed to be produced from oil of the second time hot pressing or from the grain waste oil. Produced diesel biofuel can be used for the energy supply of grain dryers, tractor aggregates and other agrarian machinery and equipment. The use of biological fuels will achieve a significant increase in the energy efficiency of agricultural production and the reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. © Scientific Horizons 2018.

AB  - In a circulating reactor the emulsion traversing is provided by means of a disk injection nozzle in the process of diesel biofuel generation. In the process of emulsion floating through the disk injection nozzle is formed a turbulent stream which provides a necessary efficiency of emulsion traversing within the fixed height. But to determine the rational values of geometric and technical parameters of the circulating reactors it is necessary to conduct an experimental investigation of changes of the emulsion flow speed. That is why the goal of the research is to determine the speed of the emulsion flow depending on the discharge of the hydro-station pump and the gap clearance between the disks of the injection nozzle. To determine the speed of the emulsion flow in the circulating reactors, which are fitted with a disk injection nozzle, an experimental machine was developed. The experimental machine consisted of a disk injection nozzle, service capacity, hydro-station for emulsion pumping, frequency converter for changing the rotation frequency of a hydro-pump, digital analyzer of the parameters of energy consumption, tachometer for measuring the rotation frequency of the pump shaft. During the experiment, the gap clearance between the disks of the injection nozzle and the rotation frequency of the pump were changed, the speed of the emulsion flow was measured. The analysis of the experimental data of a disk injection nozzle made it possible to determine the dependence of speed changes in the emulsion flow on the flow length depending on the gap clearance between the disks of the injection nozzle under various values of discharge of the hydro-station pump. As follows from the experiment, a set of equations which describe the speed dynamic in the emulsion flow has been found. Knowing the speed of the emulsion flow, both the character of the liquid traversing and the rational length of the emulsion flow can be determined. Knowing the rational length of the emulsion flow, the efficient diameters of a disk injection nozzle and of circulating reactor can be chosen. © Scientific Horizons 2018.

AB  - As a non-toxic, renewable fuel with little or no modifications in diesel engines, biodiesel has the potential to replace diesel fuel. Biodiesel produced from used cooking oil reduces the total processing cost, minimises pollution and environmental degradation. Accordingly, there is a need for scale-up production. In this study, two steps procedures: Acid-catalysed and transesterification were employed to reduce the free fatty acid (FFA) content of waste cooking oil for an improved biodiesel yield. Furthermore, some physicochemical properties such as flash point, cloud point, pour point, density, sulphur content, and viscosity were measured according to the ASTM Testing Method. A rare 96.3% biodiesel yield was achieved using the two steps, and the physicochemical properties of all blends were in line with the set standards. Unlike conventional industrial diesel production, individuals can use the techniques in this study to maximally produce biodiesel from waste vegetable oil, to perverse the environment in addition to job creation. © 2018, Nova Science Publishers, Inc..

AB  - Neem seed oil and oil cake after oil extraction are available in plenty especially in tropical countries. A detailed study has been made on the preparation of Neem Oil Methyl Ester (NOME) biodiesel from Neem oil. The NOME oil was tested for different fuel properties as per standard test methods and its efficiency and emission in a constant speed direct injection diesel engine. The engine exhaust emissions such as carbon monoxide (CO), unburnt hydrocarbon (HC) are found substantially lower for the NOME oil compared to that of diesel fuel mode. Raw hides/skins are the raw material for the leather industry and they are preserved with large amounts of common salt and these salts are removed during leather processing which causes soil and groundwater pollution. To develop less salt preservation technology, the Neem oil cake after oil extraction along with the minimum quantity of salt has been used as a preservative for raw hides and skins. The skin preserved with this bio-additive salt combination has no adverse effect on the quality of final leather. There was a substantial decrease in TDS in the soak liquor effluent by this new method. These studies indicate that both Neem oil and oil cake can be used effectively in two major manufacturing industries, i.e., automobile and leather industry to minimize environmental degradation in air, soil and, water. © 2018, Nova Science Publishers, Inc..

AB  - Background: Due to the increasing demands of energy and depletion of fossil fuel, bamboo is considered to be one of the most important renewable biological resources on the basis of its advantages of rapid growth ability and rich reserves. Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are the three most important constituents in moso bamboo. Their concentrations and, especially, their microscopic distributions greatly affect their utilization efficiency and other physical properties as a biomass resource. However, no studies have achieved a quantitative visualization of the distribution of lignocellulose concentrations in transverse sections of bamboo. Therefore, this study proposed the use of quantitative multivariate spectral analysis to reveal the micro-chemical distribution of lignocelluloses in bamboo based on an integration of FTIR macro-and micro-spectroscopic imaging techniques. Results: Multivariate calibration models for the quantitative determination of lignocelluloses of bamboo were developed based on FTIR macro-spectroscopy, and the quantitative calibration models based on the FTIR character-istic bands showed an excellent performance with determination coefficients of 0.933, 0.878, and 0.912 for cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, respectively. These quantitative models were then utilized to the FTIR micro-spectroscopy of bamboo transverse sections which were corrected using a direct standardization algorithm. Subsequently, the micro-chemical distributions of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin were obtained based on the integration of the multivariate calibration models and corrected FTIR micro-spectroscopy. The combination of the multivariate calibration models and calibration transfer algorithm resulted in a final quantitative visualization of the chemical distributions of lignocelluloses in moso bamboos. Conclusions: Integration of the FTIR macro-and micro-spectroscopic imaging techniques can provide comprehensive information that can be used to exploit the resource of moso bamboo to develop biofuels and biosynthetic materials. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - City transport causes the biggest part of road transport emissions. Besides, by engaging mainly fossil fuels in the city transport, we are responsible for air pollution in urban areas. On the other hand, passengers transport (private and public, individual and mass) may contribute substantially to reduce the negative impact on the environment by application of alternative fuels and declining of the use of fossil fuels. The main alternative fuels for drive systems in transport are the following: electricity, hydrogen, and biofuels. Synthetic fuels are option as a technology. Some of them are very effective but too expensive technologies. Another way is introduction of flexible transport (from door to door, on demand, etc.) which application enables to decrease the number of cars in urban centers to avoid congestions and the negative impact on the environment. This paper points out that public transport has a special role in the process of decreasing fossil fuel dependence, and the necessity for rapid alternative technology implementation, as well as development of the public transport system itself. Proposed is the introduction of public passenger transport from door to door that offers a comfort comparable to personal cars (specifically for handicapped persons) and helps to lowering congestions on the roads. © 2018, Serbian Academic Center.

AB  - Endophytic fungi are the microorganisms which asymptomatically colonize internal tissues of plant roots and shoots. Endophytes produce a broad spectrum of odorous compounds with different physicochemical and biological properties that make them useful in both industry and agriculture. Many endophytic fungi are known to produce a wide spectrum of volatile organic compounds with high densities, which include terpenes, flavonoids, alkaloids, quinines, cyclohexanes, and hydrocarbons. Many of these compounds showed anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, anti-neoplastic, anti-leishmanial and anti-proliferative activities, cytotoxicity, and fuel production. In this review, the role of volatile compounds produced by fungal endophytes in fuel production and their potential application in biological control is discussed. © The Author(s).

The study aimed to assess the ability of CO2 biofixation, biodiesel and other biocompounds production by Spirulina sp LEB 18 cultured in air-lift photobioreactor. The microalgae presented a rich macronutrient composition: protein (47.3%), carbohydrates (13.4%) and a high lipid content (32.7%) in a media with nitrogen reduction, CO2 using air-lift photobiorector. Furthermore, 160 mg.L.d-1 of CO2 was biofixed, generating a maximum biomass yield of 0.02 g.L.d-1. The lipids evaluated for biodiesel production presented a theoretical yield of 19.8% for in situ transesterification and 47.9% for conventional transesterification. The microalgal biomass has potential for producing biodiesel that can be applied instead or in mixture with traditional diesel fuel. The study of obtaining energy associated with the production of other high value-added biocompounds from the microalgal biomass is of high importance because in this way, the viability of biofuel production by this microorganism can be increased. © 2018, Brazilian Archives of Biology and Technology.

AB  - The potential of oils extracted from tilapia filleting wastes for the production of biodiesel is analyzed. Crude oils, extracted from heads, carcasses and viscera, were analyzed for physical, chemical and yield factors. DIC with three treatments (heads, carcasses and viscera) and five replications were employed for the statistical analysis of data. There were significant differences in oils (p<0.05). Since viscera oil had the highest yield rate, it was selected for further studies. Later, treatments comprised neutral crude oil and refined oil from viscera, with different volumes of NaOH 16%. DIC, 2x3, with three replications was applied for statistical analysis. Variables comprised acidity index, saponification index, peroxide index and iodine index. Yield of all types of biodiesel obtained were assessed. Oil from viscera was the most adequate oil for the production of biodiesel due to its high yield and compliance to ANP norms. © 2018 University Center of Maringa. All rights reserved.

AB  - Production of biodiesel from used oils as diesel substitute is particularly important because of the decreasing oil reserves and the environmental problems associated with the use of fossil fuels. In this study, Biodiesel was synthesized from high acid value Waste Cooking Oil (WCO) and Used Palm Oil (UPO) using synthesized nanoparticles of 12-tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) catalyst. Under optimized conditions the biodiesel yield was 91% from WCO and 96.5% from UPO. The methyl esters obtained from WCO and UPO were found to be in accordance with the ASTM standards for biodiesel. Performance characteristics of biodiesel obtained from WCO and UPO were studied on a four stroke diesel engine under loaded conditions. The results show an increase in Brake Thermal Efficiency (18.6 & 8.1 %) and Mechanical Efficiency (23 & 16.5 %) for biodiesel obtained from WCO and UPO when compared with diesel. Nanoparticles of TPA successfully reduced the NOx emission by 42 % and 19 %, respectively in contrast to diesel. © EM International.

AB  - In this article an economical, efficient and eco-friendly method developed for the catalytic synthesis of biodiesel is presented. Honeycomb monoliths were coated with zirconia (ZrO2) and its modified forms such as Mo (VI)/ZrO2, Cr (VI)/ZrO2 Ca (II)/ZrO2 and Ba (II)/ZrO2 by using dip and dry method. These catalytic materials were characterized for their physico-chemical properties such as surface acidity, surface basicity, crystalinity, functionality, morphology and elemental analysis. ZrO2, Mo (VI)/ZrO2 and Cr (VI)/ZrO2 coated on honeycombs were used as solid acid catalysts for the esterification of Milletia pinnata oil with methanol to reduce the percentage of free fatty acids. ZrO2, Ca (II)/ZrO2 and Ba (II)/ZrO2 were used as solid base catalysts for the transesterification of esterified Milletia pinnata oil with methanol to synthesize biodiesel. The catalysts were also prepared in their powder forms and their catalytic activities were compared with that of their honeycomb coated forms. The effect of reactivation and reusability of catalytic materials on their catalytic activity is also discussed. It was observed that a two-fold increase in the catalytic activity of honeycomb coated forms was obtained when compared to the powder form of the catalysts. © 2018 Scientific Publishers.

AB  - The paper presents a numerical study (Eulerian multiphase approach) on the influence of physical characteristics of different fuels (density and dynamic viscosity) on the fuel flow pattern at the injection nozzle exit considering different fuels and operating parameters of a diesel engine (fuel temperature and compression ratio). A new term, Nozzle Uniformity Coefficient (NUC) was introduced to define the fluid flow pattern at the injection nozzle exit and to correlate its value with a further development of the spray in the combustion chamber. The results of the analysis show that the structure of the fluid flow pattern is the most homogeneous in the case of low fuel temperatures and low back pressures. Fuel velocities have an immediate effect on the spray development, the air-fuel mixing process, and the depth of jet penetration into the combustion chamber. The average values of biodiesel fuel velocities are lower compared to those of diesel fuel. In view of the increasing use of fuels from renewable sources (biofuels), a logical conclusion is that it is necessary to correlate the injection system components with their physicochemical properties. © 2018 Transactions of Famena.

AB  - This study presents the combustion and emission results using a blend of unrefined triglycerides (straight vegetable oils) and regular unleaded gasoline in a compression ignition engine typically used in farming machinery. Most farm equipment is powered by diesel engines. A sizable cost of producing a crop on a farm can be attributed to fuel-diesel in such cases. Farmers and researchers have been interested in the use of alternative fuels, especially triglycerides, which could potentially bring down the fuel cost portion of the farm input costs. One of the major drawbacks of using unrefined triglycerides is poor cold flow properties due to high density and viscosity. To overcome this, the triglycerides can be blended with gasoline to lower the density and viscosity. This blend has been used in existing diesel engines without the need for any modification to the engine or its control system. The experiments were conducted on a 4.5-L Tier 3 engine. The fuel used was a blend of unrefined canola triglyceride and regular unleaded gasoline (10% by volume). Measurements include mass fraction burned combustion pressure, fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. The fuel consumption of TGB10 was lower than most straight vegetable oils found in the literature, but higher than diesel. The peak pressure of TGB10 was slightly higher than diesel and occurred earlier than diesel. The brake-specific NOx was lower than diesel at lower and no load points. Particulate matter emissions of TGB10 were higher than diesel at rated speed. Total hydrocarbon emissions were generally higher than diesel. CO emissions were lower than diesel except at low or no load points where they were significantly higher. © IMechE 2017.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. is an auspicious biofuel crop with commercial plantations. Seed oils are non-edible and do not compete with food production. However, it is a semi-domesticated species with unknown yield potential and nutritional requirements. Therefore, field trials were conducted at the farm attached to the Waste Water Treatment Plant located at Abu Rawash, Giza Governorate, Egypt. The trial was for two consecutive years (2013-2014 and 2014-2015) in three years old J. curcas plantation. Each plant was raised in a 2×3m plot in a sandy soil. The effect of N, P, and K on seed yield, oil content, and oil yield were evaluated. The treatments were three rates of K; 0.0, 30 and 60 g K2O/plant; four rates of P; 0.0, 50, 100 and 200 g P2O5/plant; and four rates of N; 0.0, 25, 50 and 100 g N/plant, using flood irrigation with sewage effluents. The treatment K0P0N100 produced the highest seed yields at 2.56 T/ha and 4.05 T/ha furthermore, the seed oil yields were 0.79 and 1.19 T/ha in each season. In conclusion, applications of N fertilizer proved to be valuable for Jatropha curcas in Egypt. © 2017 @ author (s).

AB  - Algae biofuels represent one of the most promising solutions to the current global energy crisis and climate change because of their potentially high yield, high production rate, biodegradability, non toxicity, carbon neutrality, and low emission profile. Moreover, non-arable land and non-potable water can be used for the production of algae biofuel with minimal attention and resource consumption. In this study, we compared algae biofuel and other conventional biofuels in terms of performance as well as combustion and emission characteristics of compression ignition engines. A thorough review of the available relevant literature and a critical analysis has been presented. The study results indicate that algae biofuel blends can be efficiently used as an alternative, renewable, and eco-friendly fuels without major modification to the existing engine. Algae biofuels contain an optimal combination of unsaturated fatty acids and oxygenated nature, the presence of excess oxygen molecules facilitates complete combustion of fuel resulting in better thermal performance along with reduced undesirable emission. This clean and green fuel is definitely the fuel of the future. © TJPRC Pvt. Ltd.

AB  - Various researches were being done all around the world to find an alternate fuel due to rising pollution in the environment which causes climatic change and harms the living beings. Preferences are given to biodiesel in a diesel engine and blending of nanoparticles with them reduces pollution, improves the performance characteristics of IC engines. Further improvement in the performance and emission reduction can be very well done by blending nano additives compared to other modifications in engine and exhaust system. Main pollutants coming from an engine are oxides of nitrogen (NO x ) and oxides of carbon (CO). This paper analyses the chances of employing biodiesel as an alternate for diesel by mixing them withnanoadditives. Relativestudy of diesel and biofuel emulsion fuel has been made in this paper. Using these types of fuel could enhance performance and reduce emission from an IC engine. © TJPRC Pvt. Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels synthesized from lignocellulose-derived platform chemicals are very attractive for sustainable development. Here we reported a new and facile route to synthesize multi-substituted cycloalkanes with a high density and low freezing point using isophorone and furanic aldehydes (furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural), by solvent-free aldol condensation, followed by hydrodeoxygenation. Catalysts were screened and NaOH showed good performance. The reaction conditions including catalyst dosage, isophorone/furanic aldehyde ratio, temperature and solvent were optimized, and finally the yields of 70.0% for isophorone/furfural and 72.8% for isophorone/5-hydroxymethylfurfural were obtained. Pt/HZSM-5 was prepared as the bifunctional catalyst for hydrodeoxygenation of the condensed product. The resultant multi-substituted cyclohexanes derived from isophorone/furfural and isophorone/5-hydroxymethylfurfural have a density of 0.813 g mL -1 and 0.846 g mL -1 respectively and both have a freezing point lower than -75 °C, and are very promising as stand-alone fuels or additives of other biofuels. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this work was to perform a prospective life cycle assessment of the third-generation biodiesel (3G) produced from the heterotrophic cultivation of Phormidium autumnale, using sucrose as the carbon source. Materials and Methods: The study focused on the optimization of the process parameters, in the life cycle assessment and in the biofuel quality analysis in diverse microalgae-based scenarios. Results: In the best scenario, the production of microalgal biodiesel has positive energy production (50.59 MJ/kg) associated with low consumption of water (28.38 m 3 /kg) and low CO 2 emissions (9.18 kg CO 2 -eq/kg). In terms of composition, this oil was predominantly saturated (45.20%), monounsaturated (34.70%), and polyunsaturated (19.90%), resulting in a biodiesel that complies with U.S., European, and Brazilian standards. Conclusion: The high potential capacity for lipid production obtained is interesting for the generation of quality biodiesel that meets or surpasses the most stringent U.S., European, and Brazilian fuel standard requirements. © 2018 Siqueira et al.

AB  - Bio-ethanol is considered as an important renewable fuel to partly replace fossil-derived fuels. In this study, bioethanol production, which includes cellulase production, saccharification of the cellulose content of sesame seed residue, and ethanol production, was investigated. Out of the hundreds of cellulase-producing bacterial strains isolated from sesame seed residue during this study, the B isolate was found to have the highest cellulase enzyme production. This isolate was identified as Bacillus cereus by 16S rRNA sequencing. The effects of different growth parameters, including inoculum concentration, incubation time, temperature, pH, and carbon and nitrogen sources, were investigated to optimize the growth conditions of the bacterifum. The maximum cellulase activity was achieved with an inoculum concentration of 3% after 48 h in a basal medium at a pH of 7 and an incubation temperature of 35 °C. The best nitrogen and carbon sources were yeast extract and sesame seed residue, respectively. The results showed the liberation of 2.3 g/L of reducing sugar by the dinitrosalicylic acid method. This total reducing sugar produced 15 g/L of ethanol after 48 h when Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as a fermentation agent. Hence, bioethanol was successfully produced from the cellulose of sesame seed residue using the cellulase enzyme from B. cereus. © 2018, BioResources. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, biodiesel is drawing attention as a renewable and clean alternative to fossil diesel fuel because of numerous advantages such as higher flash point, cetane number and density. However, the high viscosity of biodiesel is one of the critical shortcomings and it causes poor atomization, decrease in engine performance and increase in exhaust emissions. To overcome this shortcoming, in this study, the effects of main transesterification reaction variables on the viscosities of produced safflower oil methyl and ethyl esters (biodiesel) were investigated as a full factorial experimental design, and optimum parametric values giving the lowest viscosity were determined. Density and viscosity were measured according to ISO 4787 and DIN 53015 standards. Sodium ethoxide (C 2 H 5 ONa) was utilized as a catalyst, and 90 and 120 minutes of reaction duration were kept constant for methanolysis and ethanolysis reactions. According to the results, the optimal reaction parameters were determined as: 0.75 % catalyst concentration, 8:1 alcohol to oil molar ratio and 56 °C reaction temperature for methanolysis; 1.00 % catalyst concentration, 12:1 alcohol to oil molar ratio and 70 °C reaction temperature for ethanolysis. Based on the reaction parameters, the methyl and ethyl esters were produced with the lowest viscosities of 3.989 mm 2 /s and 4.393 mm 2 /s, respectively. In the light of results obtained in this study, similar studies on production of biodiesels from different oils and alcohols can be performed. © 2018 Mert Gulum, Atilla Bilgin, published by Sciendo.

AB  - The biodiesel fuel is a future fuel due to has oxygen in its chemical composition enhances thereby the chemical reaction process during combustion. The waste sunflower oil is selected for biodiesel preparation because it is commonly used as cooking oil. Furthermore, due to the climate circumstances of the Middle-east, very suitable for production the sunflower oil in a huge amount. This paper concern on studying the impact of using biodiesel prepared from waste sunflower oil and Iraqi conventional diesel on compression ignition engine performance and emissions. The samples of fuel were examined in a single cylinder, air cooled, naturally aspirated and four-stroke compression ignition engine. The biofuel is prepared by mixing the waste sunflower oil into a volumetric percentage of (5%,10%,15%,20%). The engine speed at which the engine performance and emissions measured are (1000,1300,1600,1900,2200,2500) rpm with different engine load. The practical results reveal that the CO, HC emissions are reduced up to (24.375%,35.71%) respectively, but the NOX and CO2 emission are increased by (22.62%,36.90%) respectively. The engine brake specific fuel consumption is increased by (12.11%). © Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Roads are one of the most important factors affecting the environmental life within an urban area. Roads physically replace wildlife habitat and often reduce life’s quality nearby, fragment the remaining habitat, and cause increased mortality through vehicle collisions. Although road ecology is a growing field of study, relatively little of this research, and relatively few mitigation projects, has been done in urban landscapes. Road projects are generally intended to improve the economic and social welfare of people. But for all the positive aspects of road projects, they may also have significant negative impacts on nearby communities and the natural environment. Road ecology is the study of the ecological effects (both positive and negative) of roads and highways (public roads). These effects may include local effects, such as on noise, water pollution, habitat destruction/disturbance and local air quality; and wider effects such as habitat fragmentation, ecosystem degradation, and climate change from vehicle emissions. The design, construction and management of roads, parking, spatial distribution of the intersections and other related facilities as well as the design and regulation of vehicles can change their effect. Roads can have both negative and positive effects on air quality: a) Negative effects-Air pollution from fossil (and some biofuel) powered vehicles can occur wherever vehicles are used and are of particular concern in congested city street conditions and other low speed circumstances. Emissions include particulate emissions from diesel engines, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide and various other hazardous air pollutants including benzene. Concentrations of air pollutants and adverse respiratory health effects are greater near the road than at some distance away from the road. Road dust kicked up by vehicles may trigger allergic reactions. Carbon dioxide is non-toxic to humans but is a major greenhouse gas and motor vehicle emissions are an important contributor to the growth of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere and therefore to global warming; b) Positive effects-The construction of new roads which divert traffic from built-up areas can deliver improved air quality to the areas relieved of a significant amount of traffic. The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Study carried out for the development of the roads estimated that it would result in improved air quality in Beijing city centre. In this study, Combing the traffic characteristics at the intersection of urban road and the use of environmental protection facilities to set up an environmental data collection scheme at the intersection of urban road in Beijing, then combining the conditions of the facilities and the surrounding to determine the point of monitoring, frequency of monitoring, monitoring index and monitoring method environment was necessary. By analysing the concentration of particles at different monitoring points, the mean value and variance of the hourly concentration were compared and analysed. By further analysing, the correlation between particle concentration and traffic characteristics and fitting estimation of data，the spatial diffusion model of particulates at the intersection was established. Finally the distribution of particles at the intersection of urban roads is obtained. That is the distribution of particulate matter on the cross section of intersection was higher in the centre and then decreased to the two sides. The higher the concentration of particulate matter at the point near the intersection parking line, the greater the fluctuation. The fluctuation of particle concentration on the sidewalk is higher than that on the driveway. The regularity of PM2.5 in particulate matter is consistent with that of PM10 in particulate matter. © Foundation Environmental Protection & Research-FEPR.

AB  - During the last decades the Bulgarian transport policy is directed mainly towards the construction of modern fast and safe road infrastructure. It corresponds to the geopolitical location of the state in Southeast Europe. Thus, reliable transport corridors will be provided to neighbour states and EU member states. The construction of transport corridors is directly related to the usage of internal combustion engine fuels, used for the vehicles in Bulgaria. The vehicles are based mainly on petrol and diesel engines as the entry of other engines goes at a slow pace. Diesel has become a fuel for trucks and agricultural machinery due to the low fuel consumption and the high efficiency of the diesel engines. On the other hand, the diesel exploitation inevitably reflects on the environment and its pollution because of the volume and the specificity of the waste gases emitted during combustion. Directive 2020 / EU provides the permanent increase of biofuels use. The developed toolbox consists of mathematical model and its optimization for production and use of biofuels, as follows: production and technological criteria, territorial distribution of logistic and production units and environmental pollution with waste gases, consisting mainly CO2.The results of the toolbox implementation may be used for future effective transport policy for permanent and balanced development of Bulgaria in the next years. © 2018 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Union of Chemists in Bulgaria.

AB  - The methyl ester production process from neutralized waste cooking oils was optimized by using alkali-catalyzed (KOH) single-phase reaction. The optimization process was performed depending on the parameters, such as catalyst concentration, methanol/oil ratio, reaction temperature and reaction time. The optimum methyl ester conversion efficiency was 90.1% at the optimum conditions of 0.7 wt.% of KOH, 25 wt.% methanol/oil ratio, 90 min reaction time and 60°C reaction temperature. After the fuel characteristics of the methyl ester obtained under optimum conditions were determined, the effect on engine performance, CO and NOx emissions of methyl ester was studied in a diesel engine with a single cylinder and direct injection. Compared to diesel fuel, engine power and torque decreased when using methyl ester, and specific fuel consumption increased. NOx emission increases at a rate of 18.4% on average through use of methyl ester.

Analysis of engine oil samples from vehicles with different fuels is carried out. Fuel is diesel fuel, biodiesel and a two-fuel system with two fuels - rapeseed oil and diesel fuel. The abrasion wear of biodiesel is increased. Wear in dual fuel system is within the standard exchange interval in the zone of emergency wear of metallic particles and carbon. The article evaluates the adjustment of the oil exchange interval to limit negative effects on wear surfaces. Shortening the interval to the optimum level for biodiesel is 1/3, for dual fuel system is 1/2. Vegetable oil in engine oil causes a change in the character of lubrication. Shortening the interval to 1/2 is necessary to minimize negative effects. © 2018. Published by Manufacturing Technology.

AB  - With the increased availability of low-cost natural gas (NG), co-conversion of natural gas and biomass-to-liquid (GBtL) fuels has gained interest from industry and the U.S. Department of Energy due to the potential to improve liquid fuel yields while lowering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this article, we explore the conceptual process design and cost comparison of liquid biofuels using both biomass-derived gas intermediates and natural gas, as well as studies on quantification and assessment of sustainability metrics including life cycle/GHG emissions. Additionally, we have performed sensitivity analysis to understand the impact from variations of the biomass-to-NG ratio, design assumptions, and NG prices on process economics. This is to understand key cost drivers, parameters influencing the environment, and to discover opportunities to optimize the use of NG along with biomass. Our analysis shows that different blending ratios of natural gas/biomass have a large effect on the economic and environmental performance of the GBtL fuels. Co-processing NG enables the economic feasibility of converting biomass to the liquid fuel but at the expense of environmental sustainability. This study determined that the maximum amount of NG that can be blended with biomass would be 28% to meet the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) GHG emission targets for advanced fuels, with a resulting minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of $2.75 per gallon gasoline equivalent (GGE). In addition, the paper demonstrates the impact of the co-conversion operation on equipment design, raw materials, utility consumption, and overall process economic performance for the GBtL system. A secondary outcome: This study shows that renewable liquid fuel could be cost competitive with fossil-derived liquid fuel if further improvements and optimizations could be made to blending ratios of NG, optimization of heat integration of the process, and reduction of excess hydrogen and excess electricity production. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - A new class of renewable diesel fuels has been synthesized by acid catalyzed condensation of 2-tridecanone with a series of diols that can be generated from biomass. These fuels exhibit comparable net heats of combustion (NHOCs) to conventional biodiesel, while maintaining derived cetane numbers between 82-91, values which are 20-30 units higher than conventional biodiesel and 40-50 units higher than petroleum-derived diesel fuel. The short combustion delays of the dioxolane fuels make them compelling blendstocks to enhance the combustion efficiency of petroleum-derived diesel fuel by increasing the cetane number and oxygen content of the blends. In addition, careful selection of the renewable diol allows for custom tailoring of viscosity and freezing point. Unlike conventional biodiesel which is often generated from plant or animal derived triglycerides, 2-tridecanone and other methyl ketones, along with the diols, can be efficiently generated from biomass sugars or CO 2 /H 2 via fermentation with metabolically engineered microorganisms. This biosynthetic approach may allow for the generation of these fuels on industrially relevant scales while eliminating competition with food sources and promoting responsible use of land resources. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This paper reports on the spray structure of the biofuels, ethanol, and butanol generated by a multihole direct-injection spark-ignition injector, which is studied in a constant volume chamber. The spray shape and structure are analyzed using two-phase structured laser illumination planar imaging where both laser-induced fluorescence and Mie-scattering light are recorded simultaneously for the extraction of instantaneous laser-induced fluorescence/Mie-scattering ratio images. Quantitative planar measurements of the droplet Sauter mean diameter are conducted, using calibration data from phase-Doppler anemometry. The resulting Sauter mean diameters are presented for ethanol and butanol at various fuel temperatures at different times after the start of injection. It is found that an increase in fuel temperature results in a faster atomization and higher evaporation rate, which leads to reduced spray tip penetration and smaller droplet Sauter mean diameter. At equivalent conditions, butanol consistently showed larger spray tip penetration in comparison to ethanol. This behavior is due to the higher surface tension and viscosity of butanol resulting in the formation of larger droplets and larger Sauter mean diameters in the whole spray region. Finally, the butanol injection also shows larger cyclic variations in the spray shape from injection to injection which is explained by the internal nozzle flow that is influenced by larger fuel viscosity as well. The Sauter mean diameter distribution is also compared to phase-Doppler anemometry data showing good agreement and an uncertainty analysis of the structured laser illumination planar imaging-laser-induced fluorescence/Mie-scattering technique for planar droplet sizing in direct-injection spark-ignition sprays is presented. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Almost all passenger cars (PC) in Brazil are flex fuel (can run any proportion of petrol and ethanol) and diesel fuel is prohibited to these cars; diesel is available for vans and pickup trucks, as well petrol and ethanol. However, there is a proposal under discussion to introduce diesel PC in Brazilian market, arguing that they have better autonomy and emit less CO2 and pollutants. The goal of this paper is to show the impact on pollutants and CO2 emissions from diesel PC being offered as a main option; it will be discussed also an alternative scenario, the environmental impact if Internal Engine Combustion (ICE) vehicles are banned in favor of electric ones. Data analysis was performed on type-approval tests of petrol / flexfuel light duty vehicles (LDV). For the first case, the projection for introducing PC diesel in SPMR market shows a significant increase in NOx emission, small rise for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and little reduction for HC, CO and total CO2, although with significant rise for fossil CO2. The alternative scenario, replacing ICE PC with electrics, shows high reduction for NOx, some gain for CO2 and PM2.5 and small decrease for CO and HC. Thus, the use of diesel PC will lead to NOx increase; by other hand, biofuels can reduce CO2 but will increase NMHC and CO emissions. Electric PC may be a good option but requires time to replace ICE vehicles and bringing effective environmental gain. © 2018 WITPress. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, research on noncatalytic methods for biodiesel production has increased, mainly processes under supercritical conditions that allow the processing of waste vegetable oils (WVO) without the need to use catalysts, where the absence of catalyst simplifies the processes of purification of biodiesel. The high consumption of alcohol and energy to maintain the appropriate conditions of pressure and temperature of the reaction has turned the processes of supercritical conditions into an unfeasible method. However, the stages of biodiesel purification and methanol recovery are more straightforward, allowing the reduction of the total energy consumption by 25% compared to alkaline methods. Therefore, the present work describes a study through Aspen Plus® of the production of biodiesel by a process in supercritical conditions with WVO as raw material. Also, a solar collector arrangement was structured using the TRNSYS® simulator to supply energy to the process. To evaluate the economic feasibility of the proposed process, the installation of a pilot plant in Mexicali, Baja California, was considered. The internal rate of return (IRR) and the net present value (NPV) were determined for ten-year period. The planned system allows supplying solar energy, 69.5% of the energy required by the process, thus reducing the burning of fossil fuels and the operation cost. Despite the additional investment cost, for the solar collectors, the process manages to maintain a competitive production cost of USD 0.778/l of biodiesel. With an IRR of 31.7%, the investment is recovered before the fifth year of operation. The integration and implementation of clean technologies are vital in the development of the biofuels.

AB  - Biodiesel is a clean renewable fuel used as alternative energy source to diesel and it is commercialized as a minor component in diesel blends. Similarly to diesel, biodiesel spill is a source of contamination for the ecosystem making necessary to provide effective remediation strategies. Bioremediation is a technology that has been applied with success to clean up hydrocarbon-contaminated environments. In this study, fungal bioaugmentation strategy was compared with natural attenuation during bioremediation of a sandy soil contaminated with diesel, biodiesel and blends (B20 and B50). Respirometric assays simulating the contamination of soil were carried out in Bartha flasks used to measure microbial CO2 production. Penicillium sp. AV4 isolated from the wastewater of a biodiesel factory has the ability to degrade the fuels and was used in bioaugmentation. After 111 days, CO2 evolution demonstrated no significant difference in soil microbial activity between fungal augmentation and natural attenuation treatments for all fuels. The lack of influence of Penicillium sp. AV4 can be related to its inability to compete with soil microorganisms and/or increase its metabolic activity. During natural attenuation, B50 showed a higher CO2 production, followed by the B100, B20 and diesel, which is less biodegradable. Therefore, from a biodegradation perspective, biodiesel could be more beneficial than diesel during bioremediation spill. © 2018, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - The four types of biofuels obtained by methanol transesterification of: rapeseed expired oil (BP I), waste animal fats (BP II), frying vegetable oils (BP III), and rapeseed oil (BP IV) were studied on the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-9) cells using the clonogenic assay. Colony test results showed that tested biofuels inhibited the ability of CHO-9 cells to form colonies, depending on the type and concentration of the biofuel being tested. The strongest action in reducing CHO-9 cell proliferation capacity was demonstrated by biofuel II and biofuel III. Biofuel IV had the least effect on the ability of the CHO-9 cells to colonize. The results suggest that biofuels might play a role in molecular mechanisms associated with cellular proliferation and immune responses, that should be confirmed in the future studies on genotoxicity of biofuels. © 2018, Middle Pomeranian Scientific Society of The Environment Protection.

AB  - Molecular structure transformation is a critical step for synthesis of aviation biofuels from triglycerides, to yield alkanes, aromatics and cycloalkanes. To this end, triglycerides were treated by catalytic cracking coupled with rectification to obtain hydrocarbon fuels, and the molecular weight of the liquid product was adjusted to the desirable boiling range of aviation fuel. To further modify the molecular structures, the pyrolytic hydrocarbons were partially converted into aromatics and cycloalkanes by a two-step process. Different raw materials including soybean oil, rubber seed oil, waste cooking oil and acidified oil were cracked with a 5 wt% base catalyst at 350-450 °C (under the atmospheric pressure) in a benchtop reactor. Afterwards, the linear hydrocarbons of C8-C15 size were transformed into aromatics by HZSM-5 at 350 °C for 6 h. Then, a portion of the aromatics were converted into cycloalkanes catalyzed by Pd/AC at 200 °C and 6 MPa (H 2 ) for 6 h. As a result, a desirable mixture of linear hydrocarbons, aromatics and cycloalkanes was obtained with a similar composition and properties to traditional fossil aviation fuels. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The processes of oxidative depolymerization and acidic hydrolysis have consistently been used to the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass (wheat straw, sawdust and lignin) which permitted to obtain high content of soluble organic compounds in the hydrolysate (44-94 g COM/L) and to enhance the RS concentration from 1% to 36%. The introduction of the Clostridium acetobutylicum bacteria in the acidogenic biocatalyst resulted in even greater increase in the content of volatile fatty acids and ethanol in the end product. The maximum among the studied substrates yields of butyric acid and ethanol were observed when the pretreated straw was hydrolyzed (27% (0,82 g/L) and 17,4% (0,44 g/L), respectively). It was shown that the addition of glycerol as a substrate makes it possible to increase the output of butyric and acetic acids as a result of the pretreated biomass conversion; glycerol added to straw up to the ratio of 1:1 enhanced the maximum butyric acid and VFA yields up to 32% (0.96 g/L) and 72% (2.67 g/L), respectively. © 2018.
Процессы окислительной деполимеризации и кислотного гидролиза последовательно применены для предобработки лигноцеллюлозной биомассы (солома, опилки и лигнин), что позволило получить высокое содержание в гидролизате растворимых органических веществ (44-94 г ХПК/л) и увеличить концентрацию восстанавливающих сахаров с 1% до 36%. Внесение бактерий Clostridium acetobutylicum в кислотогенный биокатализатор привело к еще большему повышению содержания в конечном продукте летучих жирных кислот и этанола. При этом максимальный среди исследованных субстратов выход масляной кислоты и этанола был получен в результате конверсии соломы - 27% (0,82 г/л) и 17,4% (0,44 г/л), соответственно. Было показано, что добавление глицерина в качестве субстрата позволяет увеличить выход масляной и уксусной кислот в процессе конверсии предобработанной биомассы; при добавлении к соломе глицерина в соотношении 1:1 максимальный выход масляной кислоты и летучих жирных кислот составил 32% (0,96 г/л) и 72% (2,67 г/л), соответственно.

AB  - Antioxidants are an alternative to prevent or retard the degradation of biofuels. In this study was utilized biodiesel obtained from the soybean oil transesterification, by methylic route, using sodium methoxide as catalyst. The synthetic antioxidants, butylhydroxyanisole (BHA), terc-butylhidroquinone (TBHQ) and butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) were added separately and in misture to the biodiesel. The induction period and the relative protection factor (RPF) were evaluated by the Rancimat method at temperatures 110, 115, 120 and 125ºC. The results showed that the highest RPF was for the tests containing the antioxidant TBHQ. The multi-response optimization indicated that the mixture containing only TBHQ was the condition with better performance on the RPF, with the predicted value of 31.27 at a temperature of 110°C. A similar value was obtained experimentally, showing the efficiency of design used and the validity of the obtained models confirmed by statistical analysis of the obtained data. © 2019, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - Phenolic compounds are an important component of pyrolysis oil (bio-oil). Understanding their reaction behaviours during hydrogenation helps to clarify the reaction network during hydrotreatment of bio-oil. This study investigated the hydrogenation of typical phenolic compounds in bio-oil in water, which is an important fraction of bio-oil, and in methanol, which is used to esterify bio-oil. The results indicated that hydrogenation of the phenolics is more efficient in water than in methanol. With water medium, both the unsaturated oxygen-containing functionalities and the benzene ring of the phenolics can be effectively hydrogenated. In comparison, with methanol medium, only the unsaturated oxygen-containing functionality can be hydrogenated, while the hydrogenation of the benzene ring is rather difficult. Stereoselectivity was also observed in the hydrogenation of phenolics with three or more hydroxyl groups/methoxyl groups. For phenolics with two hydroxyl groups/methoxyl groups, the hydrogenation produces both cis- and trans-configurations. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The article focuses on types of biofuels and ways of using them in internal combustion engines. The study shows that for diesel engines the most promising is the use of biofuels obtained from vegetable oils. In agriculture, the use of mixture diesel biofuels is economically feasible. The analysis of physicochemical properties of vegetable oils and their mixtures with diesel fuel is carried out. The flammability of petroleum diesel fuel, rapeseed oil and sunflower oil in the combustion chamber of a diesel engine is studied. Findings of the research show that the flammability of mixture diesel biofuels with small additives of vegetable oils (up to 10 %) practically does not differ from the flammability of petroleum diesel fuels. However, the use of these fuels leads to a reduction in the smokiness of the exhaust gases by 13⋯17 % and a decrease in the emission of nitrogen oxides by 2⋯3%. © BMSTU, 2018.

AB  - A great diversity of fruits is used in the food industry to obtain different products such as juices, sauces and foods. However, the food industry produces high amounts of residues. Passion fruit and guava are worldwide known fruits and very used by the food industry and generate tons of seed as residue. This work aims to study the extraction of oils from passion fruit and guava juice industries residues, their characterization and potential application as raw materials to obtain biodiesel and bio-oil. The passion fruit and guava seed oils content were 25 and 9%, respectively. In both oils, polyunsaturated fatty acids are predominant. Biodiesel obtained by esterification/ transesterification of both seed oils match most of the parameters specified for biodiesel in Brazil. Bio-oils obtained by thermal cracking of the seed oils were mainly composed by hydrocarbons similar to those observed in petroleum diesel. © 2018 Sociedade Brasileira de Química

AB  - Research focused in the present paper to evaluate the combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of refined biodiesel (refined biofuel) such as sunflower oil methyl ester (SOME) with the partial addition of n-butanol (butanol) in it. Various characteristics of butanol-SOME blends with varying volume percentage of butanol such as 5, 10, 15, and 20 in butanol-SOME blends were compared with the characteristics of neat SOME (100%) and neat diesel (100%). It is investigated that with an increase in butanol content from 5% to 20% in butanol-SOME blends at full load condition, brake-specific fuel consumption, and NOx emissions were increased by 11% and 43%, respectively, while brake thermal efficiency (BTE) was decreased by 8%. At full load condition, for all the selected fuels hydrocarbon (HC) emissions were found to be negligible, i.e., less than 0.12 g/kWh. Carbon monoxide (CO) emissions at full load condition for the four butanol-SOME blends were observed to be four to six times more than observed CO emissions in case of neat SOME and neat diesel. Various characteristics of all the selected fuels were compared in order to finalize the promising alternate sustainable renewable fuel. Thus, study reports the solution for increase in demand and price of shortly diminishing conventional diesel fuel which is widely used for power generation and also to reduce the serious issues concerned with environmental pollution due to usage of neat diesel.

AB  - In this paper, continuous hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of liquid phase pyrolysis (LPP) oil in lab-scale is discussed. Pyrolysis oil is derived from the bioCRACK pilot plant from BDI - BioEnergy International GmbH at the OMV refinery in Vienna/Schwechat. Three hydrodeoxygenation temperature set points at 350, 375, and 400°C were investigated. Liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) was 0.5 h-1. Hydrodeoxygenation was performed with an in situ sulfided metal oxide catalyst. During HDO, three product phases were collected. A gaseous phase, an aqueous phase and a hydrocarbon phase. Experiment duration was 36 h at 350 and 375°C and 27.5 h at 400°C in steady state operation mode. Water content of the hydrocarbon phase was reduced to below 0.05 wt.%. The water content of the aqueous phase was between 96.9 and 99.9 wt.%, indicating effective hydrodeoxygenation. The most promising results, concerning the rate of hydrodeoxygenation, were achieved at 400°C. After 36/27.5 h of experiment, catalyst deactivation was observed. © 2018 Treusch, Schwaiger, Schlackl, Nagl, Pucher and Siebenhofer.

AB  - In this study, acidic deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have been studied as catalyst in transesterification of soybean oil with methanol to produce biodiesel. p-Toluenesulfonic acid-based deep eutectic solvent (P-DES), composed of p-toluenesulfonic acid and choline chloride (1:3, mol/mol), was found to be an efficient transesterification catalyst for biodiesel production. The optimum conditions for the transesterification process were as follows: 8% P-DES catalyst, 8:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil, reaction temperature of 110℃ and 2 h reaction time. The transesterification yield could reach 98.66±0.17%. And the P-DES exhibited as a heterogeneous catalyst after the reaction, which could be separated easily. And P-DES could remove the trace amount of by-product (glycerol) in the final biodiesel product, making this process more simple and cleaner. ©2018 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - Gamma (γ)-terpinene, a monoterpene compound, which is generally used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries, due to its physical and chemical properties, is expected to become one of the more influential compounds used as an alternative biofuel in the future. It is necessary to seek more sustainable technologies such as microbial engineering for γ-terpinene production. In this study, we metabolically engineered Escherichia coli to produce γ-terpinene by introducing a heterologous mevalonate (MVA) pathway combined with the geranyl diphosphate synthase gene and γ-terpinene synthase gene. Subsequently, the culture medium and process conditions were optimised with a titre of 19.42 mg L−1 obtained. Additionally, in-depth analysis at translation level for the engineered strain and intermediate metabolites were detected for further analysis. Finally, the fed-batch fermentation of γ-terpinene was evaluated, where a maximum concentration of 275.41 mg L−1 with a maintainable feedstock of glycerol was achieved. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This paper addresses the techno-economic evaluation and optimisation of processes converting lignocellulosic biomass into liquid fuels, through the development of a suitable framework and the modelling and design of Biomass to Liquids (BTL) processes. In particular, the focus is on the production of drop-in fuels through gasification and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. Several conversion technologies are presented and evaluated in the literature, but the comparison of different options is hazardous because of the different assumptions and methodologies adopted in each study. A systematic and consistent approach is therefore developed to explore the trade-offs of alternative process configurations and of the operating conditions. The comparison presented in this study explores the trade-offs of different technological options in terms of competing economic and thermodynamic objectives. Results show that for 200 MW th biomass input plant capacities, production costs are in the range of 1.0-1.4 € l -1 for technologies producing up to about 0.5 kJ FT kJ th -1 and close to being neutral in terms of electricity balance. For technologies using electrolysis the conversion can increase to 0.8 kJ FT kJ th -1 with production costs of 1.8 € l -1 . The electricity storage capacity, in this case, is of 0.5 kJ e kJ FT -1 , corresponding to a net electricity requirement of about 0.4 kJ e kJ th -1 . © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Biodiesel demand is increasing all over the world and the inhibition of microbial growth during the storage of this biofuel is extremely important. There are few studies involving the evaluation of biocides specifically for biodiesel. In the present work, we synthesized and evaluated a set of biocide candidates from chemical transformations in triacylglycerides. Samples of pure biodiesel with the products were evaluated against microorganisms which have been isolated from biodiesel/diesel blends (fungi A. Niger, A. fumigatus, C. albicans and S. cerevisiae; and bacteria B. subtilis and Acinetobacter sp.). None of the products inhibited the growth of bacteria. Four nitrated derivatives presented fungicidal activity. The nitrated derivatives were also evaluated as cetane number improvers for B7 biodiesel/diesel blend. The nitrates of soybean methoxylated ethylene glycol esters increased the cetane number by more than three points. Despite showing modest biocide activity, the results can guide the planning of new products from triacylglycerides. © 2018 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.

AB  - Growing concern about replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, coupled with society's concerns about environmental preservation, are the main reasons why governments have sought strategies for increased production and consumption of renewable and sustainable fuels. Radish (Raphanus sativus L.) belongs to the group of oilseeds of the Brassicaceae family, being widely cultivated in the south and central-west regions of Brazil, with physical and chemical characteristics propitious to the production of biofuels. In this context, the objective of the present work was to evaluate three different methods of oil extraction: solvent extraction, cold pressing and swelling technique, to evaluate the potential of radish oil in biodiesel production using methanol, ethanol and a mixture of both containing 60% and 40% respectively, and to evaluate the composition of fatty acids. The methodology consists firstly in the extraction of the oil, followed by transesterification reaction using 10 mL of pretreated oil and sodium hydroxide in the proportion of 1% in mass, relative to the oil. The oil samples were used in the transesterification reactions with methanol, ethanol and a mixture of methanol (60%) and ethanol (40%) in different proportions and temperatures. The results indicated that, for the oil extraction processes, the seed swelling technique presented a high extraction yield (34%). The composition of fatty acids showed presence of approximately 30% of saturated compounds and around 50% of compounds with chain up to 18 carbons, also had presence of erucic acid (up to 41%), and a high percentage of oleic acid (up to 30%). Regarding the transesterification reactions, the highest yield occurred with the use of methanol, about 86%. Thus, in the light of the results, it can be concluded that radish oil has great potential for biodiesel production, but, other analyzes, such as acidity and flash point, should be performed to more specifically evaluate the physicochemical characteristics of biodiesel. © 2018 the Author(s).

AB  - Bio-oil from coconut shell pyrolysis has a very acidic pH and is corrosive due to the presence of phenolic compounds. Phenol is corrosive and can cause damage to the engine. If the bio-oil is intended to be used as an alternative diesel fuel, the phenol content needs to be removed. Phenol actually has an economic value that can be used as disinfectants, resins, pesticides, explosives, drugs and dyes. Separation of phenol from bio-oil can be carried out using liquid-liquid extraction method by utilising solvent as separator, where the liquid phase separation utilises the different solubility of compound to be separated between carrier and solvent solution. In this work, bio-oil produced by pyrolysis of coconut shell was extracted using aqueous methanol as a solvent. The extraction process was carried out for 60 min, and then separated using separating funnel through two phases, i.e., the extract phase and the raffinate phase. The extract phase and the raffinate phase of each extraction processes are analysed with gas chromatography (GC) to obtain the concentration of each component. The objective of this work is to study the effects of the temperature and speed of stirring on the distribution coefficient and the yield of phenol extraction from bio-oil produced by pyrolysis of coconut shell. The analysis results show that the highest distribution coefficient and the yield of phenol extraction was obtained at 50°C and 250 rpm stirring speed. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2018.

AB  - Hydroprocessing of liquid biomass is a promising technology for the production of "second generation" renewable fuels to be used in transportation. Its products, normal paraffins, can be further hydrotreated for isomerization in order to improve their cold flow properties. The final product, usually referred to as "paraffinic diesel," is a high cetane number, clean burning biofuel which is rapidly gaining popularity among researchers and the industry. Nevertheless, the costly isomerization step can be omitted if normal paraffins are to be directly mixed with conventional diesel in low concentrations. In this work, nonisomerized paraffinic diesel produced through hydrotreating of used cooking oil (hydrotreated used cooking oil (HUCO)) has been used in 4 blends (up to 40% v/v) with conventional diesel fuel. The blends' properties have been assessed comparatively to European EN 590 and EN 15940 standards (concerning conventional automotive diesel fuels and paraffinic diesel fuels from synthesis or hydrotreatment, resp.). Furthermore, the HUCO blends have been used in a standard stationary diesel engine-generator set. The blends have been considered as "drop-in replacements" for standard diesel fuel. As such, no engine modifications took place whatsoever. The engine performance and exhaust emissions of steady-state operation have been examined in comparison with engine operation with the baseline conventional diesel fuel. © 2018 Iraklis Zahos-Siagos and Dimitrios Karonis.

AB  - Energy consumption is continuously growing world-wide. Due to tightening environmental regulations and to reduce dependency on fossil fuels the demand for alternative fuels is increasing in the EU. At the same time the use of first generation biofuels is limited because of their inappropriate properties and feedstocks. First generation biofuels are mainly produced from edible feedstocks. So this is important to investigate the utilisation of waste based sources and new methods to produce new, alternative fuel components with better properties. Waste fatty acids can be promising feedstocks for alternative fuel production, since hydrocarbons can be produced from them with oxygen removal reactions. There is little information about the hydrogenation of fatty acid mixtures in the literature; most of the studies are about the conversion of model compounds. Real waste fraction with high fatty acid content (&gt; 90 %) has high oxygen and olefinic double bond content (&gt; 78 %). These are heat and oxidation sensitive compounds. Hydrocarbon fraction with mainly normal-paraffins can be produced with the hydrogenation of these compounds. These paraffins are good blending components of engine fuels with favourable performance properties. The aim of our work was to study the production of high quality diesel fuels with alternative component content from the different mixtures of waste fatty acids and highsulphur, crude oil based light gas oil fractions. The quality improvement of mixtures of unrefined, winter grade gas oil fraction and fatty acids (10, 20 and 30 wt%) was carried out on a commercial, sulphided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst. Our goal was to achieve the most complete hydrogenation of the unstable fatty acids (saturation and oxygen removal) and to practically remove the sulphur content of the gas oil fraction, furthermore, to saturate the aromatics (especially the polycyclic ones) as much as possible.

AB  - This paper focuses on design of Integrated Bioethanol Supply Chain (IBSC) model that would account for economic, environmental and social aspects of sustainability. A mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to design an optimal IBSC. The model uses the delivered feedstock cost, energy consumption, and GHG emissions as system performance criteria. The efficiency of proposed supply chain design model is proved on a Bulgarian case study for biofuel production as the biomass supply chain is considered. The obtained from the design results have shown that the optimal BG IBSC configuration for 2020 includes 7 bioethanol plants and 4 plants for solid waste utilization. To meet the consumption needs of biofuel by 2020, the hybrid bioethanol plants should use mostly as raw materials wheat straw and corn cobs, which are available. Copyright © 2018, AIDIC ServiziS.r.l.

AB  - The utilization of biofuels in spark ignition and compression ignition engines is the trend of the recent time. The great expectations are inserted into n-butanol as a fuel, especially for spark ignition engines. The short time use of n-butanol in the SI (spark ignition) combustion engine does not make a big problem (start of the cold engine, change of the air-fuel ratio). The purpose of this contribution is the effect of long-term use of n-butanol as a fuel for SI engine. For this purpose the small portable generator was used. The harmful emissions, fuel consumption and power of the generator was measured then the generator was operated for 300 hours on 100% n-butanol with 80% of nominal load and the measurement was repeated. The generator was loaded with adjustable electrical resistance. As a reference fuel the petrol BA 95 with no biocomponent was used. During the operation on n-butanol no technical problems occurred with the generator. After 300 hours of operation on n-butanol the performance parameters slightly decreased with little impact on production of harmful emissions components. © 2018, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

AB  - The development of biofuels for compression ignition engines is heading primarily to utilization of vegetable oils. Combusting of 100% vegetable oil in unmodified CI engine is usually not possible due to higher viscosity of the vegetable oil. In order to use 100% vegetable oil in CI engine the oil needs to be preheated, esterified or hydrotreated. Alternatively, in order to use raw vegetable oil in CI engine without preheating it is possible to use vegetable oil diesel fuel blends or vegetable oil - butanol - diesel fuel blends in order to lower the viscosity of the fuel. The contribution focuses on comparison of the effect of sunflower and rapeseed vegetable oils on operational parameters of the turbocharged compression ignition engine, especially on production of solid particles. The measurement was carried out according to standardized NRSC test cycle. 5% and 20% concentration of vegetable oils in diesel fuel were used as a test fuels for the measurement while the diesel fuel was used as a reference. The count and size of solid particles were measured by means of EEPS particle analyser. Based on the measured values it can be stated that the slight increase of performance parameters occurred with strong effect on emissions production, especially on production of solid particles. © 2018, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

AB  - In the near future, more emphasis must be put on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in road transportation, house heating, agricultural activities, marine transport etc. This study concentrated on the use of alternative fuels in engine-driven applications of non-road machineries and decentralized energy production. Today, the engines are mainly designed for crude oil derived fuels and liquid renewable fuels are blended with crude oil based fuels to fulfill the requirements of renewable energy usage. Due to the environmental reasons on one hand and to the agricultural needs, on the other hand, different blends of bio- and fossil fuels are becoming more popular. In Europe, the maximum FAME content in diesel fuel is 7 vol% according to the EN 590: 2013 but higher percentages are also available and targeted around the world. For example in the United States, the 20% blend fraction is becoming more common. For these reasons, B20 fuels were chosen to be investigated in this study. Special emphasis was put on improving blending issues since fuel blending may cause some operating risks. The main aim was to research widely the properties of animal-fat based methyl ester (AFME) and B20 fuel blend produced from it. AFME is a waste based fuel and produced in Ostrobothnia region, Finland. The aim was to find out in which engine applications the fuels are feasible and investigate if the fuels fit in the quality of automotive fuel Standards. According to the results, AFME is a feasible option to increase self-sufficient energy production in Ostrobothnia. © 2018, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of renewable energy sources decreases the consequences of greenhouse gas emission from fossil fuels. Biodiesel, an easily burning and biodegradable fuel, is an alternative to conventional diesel fuel. The esterification of long-chain fatty acids and transesterification of triglycerides are two major reactions widely used to convert vegetable oils or animal fats into biodiesel. As solid acid catalysts are considered promising candidates for biodiesel production, we have synthesized a series of organic knitted porous polyaromatics (OPPs) using pyrene, anthracene, and naphthalene as monomers via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, followed by crosslinking reactions. The resultant polymers showed good surface morphology, stability and swelling property, high capacity for functionalization due to the unreacted bromomethyl groups on the surface, and excellent hydrophobicity. The sulfonated polymer microspheres obtained by the surface sulfonation showed good surface acidity; thus, they can be employed as heterogeneous solid acid catalysts for the esterification of long-chain fatty acids and transesterification of triglycerides, and they are reusable without any leaching of functional groups. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

AB  - The objective of this experimental work is to design an original microfluidic mixer for continuous emulsification of small fractions of water in a lipid phase. This system is aimed to be integrated on-line in the process so as to avoid the use of a surfactant. The currently targeted application is a better combustion of water-supplemented alternative biofuels in boilers, turbines, or internal combustion engines in general. Therefore, mean size of droplets of water in the emulsion should be 5-10 μm, and the water content should not exceed ∼20%. Microsystems developed in this work are designed so as to enhance different flow perturbations that are favorable for the emulsification process. The microchannels for the fluids admittance have different sections: 300 × 300 μm2 and 600 × 600 μm2. As a consequence, an impinging flow is developed at the crossing of the inlet microchannels of the two phases which has for effect a significant stretching of the fluids. Then, depending on the continuous phase, Rayleigh instabilities can be developed in the straight parts of the outlet channels (600 × 600 μm2) and/or the enhancement of fluid splitting is obtained; thanks to a singularity (bend) located in the same outlet channels. Two different continuous phases are tested (gasoil and sun flower oil) for which the flow rate is about (65-100 ml/min). The water fraction is varied in the range 7-24%. It is shown that the length of the outlet microchannels is a crucial parameter. Considering an oil phase with low viscosity, such as gasoil, a too long channel can promote coalescence. On the opposite, longer outlet channels are needed with more viscous fluids (like sunflower oil) in order to develop Rayleigh instabilities which is, in this case, the more efficient way to obtain emulsions in this kind of microsystem. On a general point of view, concerning the size of the water droplets, dispersion of water is much more efficient with this microsystem using gasoil rather than vegetable oil as the continuous phase. Considering the targeted application, emulsions with an average size of water droplets of about 10 μm were obtained with gasoil as the continuous phase. Copyright © 2018 by ASME.

AB  - New completely green biofuels with rapeseed oil as the main component were formulated. They not only fulfil the principles of green chemistry and thus do not contain any environmentally harmful additives, but also match the currently valid standards for biodiesel regarding their physicochemical properties. Using a vegetable oil as a fuel component, its major drawbacks, high kinematic viscosity and high freezing point, had to be fixed. It could be shown that the properties of mixtures of rapeseed oil with and without its corresponding fatty acid methyl ester, so-called biodiesel, can be adjusted by several further components. For this purpose, different furan derivatives and terpenes could be used to fulfil the American and European viscosity standards for biodiesel. The furan derivatives stem from sugar and cellulose, whereas terpenes are mainly constituents of essential oils of trees and the peels of citrus plants as well as producible by the bio-transformation of sugarcane. With furan derivatives as further fuel components, the amount of necessary biodiesel could be drastically reduced, and cloud points below -20 °C were obtained. Using terpenes, these conditions could be matched without any biodiesel in the formulations, and cloud points even below -40 °C were achieved. To further characterise these biofuel formulations, ignition, combustion and emission tests were performed on an up-to-date 2.2 L diesel engine using a blend of rapeseed oil, rapeseed oil-based biodiesel and 2-methylfuran. The results showed that the properties of the formulated biofuel were similar to or even better than those of common diesel despite the high requirement profile of modern diesel formulations. Besides improving the relevant physicochemical parameters of the fuel, 2-methylfuran also increased its oxygen content. This enhanced the soot oxidation and therefore led to a complete inhibition of soot emissions. Nevertheless, the main drawback of biofuels in general, slightly higher NOx emissions than diesel, still remained, which requires a common exhaust gas aftertreatment of diesel engines. In the scope of this paper, the new formulations are discussed with regard to the concept of green and sustainable chemistry. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Microalgae oil is expected to be a relevant source of biofuel in the future as it is more favorable to confront the problems of food shortages and greenhouse emission challenges raised by conventional biofuels. Therefore, in this study, a most common kind of microalgae that have a great potential, Chlorella protothecoides, was evaluated as fuel in terms of its combustion and emission characteristics in a Diesel engine-powered generator set at constant engine speed of 1500 rpm under various loads after converting its oil to biodiesel by typical base-catalyzed transesterification process. A biodiesel/diesel blend at the rate of 20% by volume was tested too. According to results obtained, using biodiesel resulted in an increase in fuel consumption, in a slight reduction of efficiency, and in sharp reductions in both unburned hydrocarbon emissions and smoke opacity especially at light loads, despite increasing NOx emissions were observed when compared with conventional petroleum diesel. In addition, premixed combustion ratio was higher for biodiesel than for diesel while total combustion duration took shorter for biodiesel especially at higher loads. The overall results of the study reveals that the combustion parameters of the biodiesel studied here are within the typical ranges of conventional biodiesel fuels. © 2018 Society of Thermal Engineers of Serbia.

AB  - Egypt is one of the countries that suffer from a deficit in the trade balance due to the high value of imports of crops used for the production of biofuels, which account for about 40% of the deficit in the trade balance. It also suffers from the high value of petroleum imports, which amounted to about 17% of the deficit in the trade balance. The problem of the study is the energy crisis and the increasing deficit in the trade balance. The objective of the study is cultivate non-food plants, such as jatropha for biofuel production, which contains about 35-40% of the oil in the seed. A study was conducted to determine the feasibility of using jatropha as one of the sources of bio-fuel production, The most important results show that the Jatropha plant project is profitable and economically feasible, as the sensitivity analysis proved the resilience of this project against the risk, such as increasing costs and decrease in revenue at the same time.Net profit is about 3391.92 pounds, Also, the oil extraction project of the seeds of Jatropha proved economically feasible. Therefore, the study is recommends adopting and applying bio-fuel production from Jatropha plant. © 2018 ISISnet: Innovative Scientific Information Services Network. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study assesses greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation options for the agriculture sector. The Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) model was used to develop a framework to assess future trends in energy demand and associated GHG emissions for the agriculture sector and to assess various GHG mitigation options associated with energy consumption. A business-as-usual (reference) scenario and 32 GHG mitigation scenarios were developed for the years 2009-2050 using the LEAP model. A case study for Alberta, Canada, was conducted. In the model, GHG mitigation scenarios were developed for the energy demand side (e.g., farm machines, farm transportation, lighting, and ventilation) based on efficiency improvements and the use of renewable energy. The mitigation scenarios were divided into two planning horizons based on technology penetration: slow penetration (2009-2050) and fast penetration (2009-2030). For each planning horizon, 16 scenarios were assessed. Of all farm machines, efficient diesel tractors have the highest GHG mitigation potential: 12.35 MT of CO2 equivalent by 2050 and 4.7 MT of CO2 equivalent by 2030. In addition, GHG abatement cost curves show that biodiesel tractors and efficient diesel tractors have the highest GHG mitigation potential, with attractive abatement costs of -$62 and -$11 tonne-1 of CO2 mitigated by 2050, respectively. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - As the result of the European Union (EU) directives, the amount of alternative components used in fuels is continuously growing in Europe. One of the most common used biofuel is biodiesel which is produced by base- or acid-catalysed transesterification of triglycerides with an alcohol (usually methanol). Biodiesel has lot of drawbacks such as low thermal and oxidation stability, unfavourable cold flow properties, lower energy content, etc. Due its disadvantages the EU diesel standard (EN 590:2013) limits its blending rate to 7 V/V %. Fatty acids are derived from renewable sources; bio-paraffins in gas oil boiling range can be produced from them by catalytic oxygen removal reactions. The obtained bio-paraffins can be promising alternative fuel blending components or valuable petrochemical feedstock. Thus during our experimental work we demonstrated the bio-paraffin purpose hydrotreating of waste fatty acid mixture from vegetable oil processing on sulphided NiMo/Al2O3-P catalyst. The effects of process parameters (temperature: 300 – 345 °C, pressure: 40 bar, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV): 0.75 – 3.0 h-1, H2/feedstock ratio: 450 – 600 Nm3/m3) on the quality and quantity of the main products were investigated. Based on the results we have determined the favourable process parameters for the production of bio-paraffins. The theoretical yields were approximated over 90%. Utilization ideas were proposed for the produced bio-paraffin mixture. Copyright © 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - A total of 123 Trichoderma strains were isolated from different habitats and tested for their ability to degrade cellulose and xylan by simple plate screening method. Among strains, more than 34 and 45% respectively, exhibited higher cellulolytic and xylanolytic activity, compared to the reference strain T. reesei QM 9414. For strains efficiently degrading cellulose, a highest enzyme activity was confirmed using filter paper test, and it resulted in a range from 1.01 to 7.15 FPU/ml. Based on morphological and molecular analysis, the isolates were identified as Trichoderma. The most frequently identified strains belonged to Trichoderma harzianum species. Among all strains, the most effective in degradation of cellulose and xylose was T. harzianum and T. virens, especially those isolated from forest wood, forest soil or garden and mushroom compost. The results of this work confirmed that numerous strains from the Trichoderma species have high cellulose and xylan degradation potential and could be useful for lignocellulose biomass conversion e.g. for biofuel production. © 2018 Polish Society of Microbiologists.

AB  - Biodiesel is a biofuel that has great potential to become an alternative fuel as it can be directly used in the Compression Ignition (CI) engine with very little or without any modification needed. From this review, it is identified that the quality of the biodiesel produced and the final performance of the engine is mainly depending on biodiesel feedstock, biodiesel production and engine technology. Different feedstock has a different composition, hence will produce biodiesel with different fuel properties that contribute to engine performance and emission. Nevertheless, proper production process and advanced engine technology can overcome the biodiesel drawback. © Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this is to assess the knowledge of the restaurant owners about the production of biodiesel from restaurant waste oils. Objective: The objective is to create awareness about the production of biodiesel from restaurant waste oils among restaurant owners. Materials and Methods: It is a questionnaire-based survey. A set of 15 questions to assess the knowledge on waste oil management and subsequent production of biodiesel were given to 60 restaurant owners. The data were collected and statistically evaluated. Result: As per the results of the survey, 70% of the owners reuse little amount of oil for cooking and the remaining wastes are dumped in an unknown manner which may be hazardous. Almost 63% of the participants are aware that waste oil does cause pollution and more than 50% of them are ready to produce biodiesel from waste oil if they are taught to do so. Conclusion: Waste oil is not a big concern in India, as people are not aware of the negative consequences of it. Thus, this survey created awareness for reusing the waste oil in the production of biodiesel which is cost efficient and thus favored the business community in a useful way. © 2018, JPR Solutions.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant biomaterial on Earth and holds enormous potential as a source of fermentable sugars for cost-effective biofuel production. The main obstacle is the intractable and convoluted structure and composition of lignocellulosics which are mainly made of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose. However, nature has equipped microbes with enzymes that can deconstruct lignocellulose and release fermentable sugars. In this study, we selected bacteria (belonging to 6 different genera) from nature that had been grown in minimal culture media with cellulose or lignin as the sole carbon source, and assessed their lignocellulolytic activities in qualitative and quantitative assays. Through sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, we discovered a novel lignocellulolytic bacterial species, Chryseobacterium gleum, capable of degrading both cellulose and lignin. In addition, a few other bacterial species previously known to degrade either cellulose or lignin were found to have lignocellulolytic activities. The majority of these bacterial species were found to produce extracellular lignocellulolytic enzymes. Lignocellulolytic bacteria identified in this study may serve as sources of genes/enzymes which might find applications in biofuel production and other industrial applications. © 2018, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry.

AB  - The marine hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium Alcanivorax borkumensis is well known for its ability to successfully degrade various mixtures of n-alkanes occurring in marine oil spills. For effective growth on these compounds, the bacteria possess the unique capability not only to incorporate but also to modify fatty intermediates derived from the alkane degradation pathway. High efficiency of both these processes provides better competitiveness for a single bacteria species among hydrocarbon degraders. To examine the efficiency of A. Borkumensis to cope with different sources of fatty acid intermediates, we studied the growth rates and membrane fatty acid patterns of this bacterium cultivated on diesel, biodiesel and rapeseed oil as carbon and energy source. Obtained results revealed significant differences in both parameters depending on growth substrate. Highest growth rates were observed with biodiesel, while growth rates on rapeseed oil and diesel were lower than on the standard reference compound (hexadecane). The most remarkable observation is that cells grown on rapeseed oil, biodiesel, and diesel showed significant amounts of the two polyunsaturated fatty acids linoleic acid and linolenic acid in their membrane. By direct incorporation of these external fatty acids, the bacteria save energy allowing them to degrade those pollutants in a more efficient way. Such fast adaptation may increase resilience of A. Borkumensis and allow them to strive and maintain populations in more complex hydrocarbon degrading microbial communities. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - There is a growing concern on the use of alternative sustainable energy source to overcome the energy crisis. Hence, biodiesel from cyanobacteria has drawn the attention of the scientific community. The present study was carried out to find potential utilization of Microcystis bloom for biodiesel production. Microcystis bloom samples were collected from Beira Lake, Sri Lanka and Soxhlet extraction method with Isopropanol: n-hexane (3:2) solvent system was employed to extract lipids. In the present study, biodiesel B6 blend was prepared and the properties of B6 blend were compared with ASTM D 7467 (American Society for Testing and Materials standard for B6 – B20 Biodiesel blends)and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation specifications for no: 02-grade auto diesel to confirm the fuel properties and the usability respectively. Biodiesel B6 blend was subjected to determination of fuel properties and density at 15oC (ASTM D 1298/4052), Viscosity Kinematic at 60oC (ASTM D 445), Calorific value (Gross) (ASTM D240), Cloud point (ASTM D 2500), Lubricity (HFRR wear sear dia at 60oC) (ASTM D 6079), Sulphur content (ASTM D 4294) and CFPP (Cold Filter Plugging Point) value (ASTM D 6371) were 831.00 kg/m3, 2.83cSt., 11180.00kcal/kg, 6oC, 405.00 µm, 2310.00 ppm and 4oC. The results revealed that biodiesel B6 blend complied with ASTM standards for lubricity, kinematic viscosity and sulfur content (S5000). The fuel properties of kinematic viscosity, density, sulfur content and CFPP value complied with the Ceypetco auto diesel specifications and the energy content of the blend was higher than Ceypetco auto diesel specifications. The results of the present study revealed that the Microcystis bloom can be utilized as a potential candidate to produce biodiesel. © Global Science Publications.

AB  - Achieving low cost and high efficiency lignocellulose deconstruction is a critical step towards widespread adoption of lignocellulosic biofuels. Certain ionic liquid (IL)-based pretreatment processes effectively reduce recalcitrance of lignocellulose to enzymatic degradation but require either costly separations following pretreatment or novel IL compatible processes to mitigate downstream toxicity. Here we demonstrate at benchtop and pilot bioreactor scales a separation-free, intensified process for IL pretreatment, saccharification, and fermentation of sorghum biomass to produce the sesquiterpene bisabolene, a precursor to the renewable diesel and jet fuel bisabolane. The deconstruction process employs the IL cholinium lysinate ([Ch][Lys]), followed by enzymatic saccharification with the commercial enzyme cocktails Cellic CTec2 and HTec2. Glucose yields above 80% and xylose yields above 60% are observed at all scales tested. Unfiltered hydrolysate is fermented directly by Rhodosporidium toruloides-with glucose, xylose, acetate and lactate fully consumed during fermentation at all scales tested. Bisabolene titers improved with scale from 1.3 g L-1 in 30 mL shake flasks to 2.2 g L-1 in 20 L fermentation. The combined process enables conversion of saccharified IL-pretreated biomass directly to advanced biofuels with no separations or washing, minimal additions to facilitate fermentation, no loss of performance due to IL toxicity, and simplified fuel recovery via phase separation. This study is the first to demonstrate a separation-free IL based process for conversion of biomass to an advanced biofuel and is the first to demonstrate full consumption of glucose, xylose, acetate, and lactic acid in the presence of [Ch][Lys]. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - On this research, the potential of oleoresin extracted from the tree Copaifera reticulata was analyzed for the production of biofuel starting from the transesterification process. Properties like viscosity, acid, moisture, flash point and melt fluidity index were determined for both the raw and the chemically modified oleoresin. Its behavior on low temperatures and its oxidative stability were included on the characterization. It was determined that the route used for the production of biodiesel is not suitable because it generates a high loss of oleoresin, since the overall performance in biofuel production was approximately 10%. Still, refining processes and transesterification had a positive effect on the oxidative stability of oleoresin. With respect to raw oleoresin, the stability of refined oleoresin and copaiba biodiesel increased to 46 and 47 ºC, respectively. According to the fluidity points, in all cases the behavior on cold fluidity significantly exceeds the established ranges. Copaiba biodiesel showed a fluidity point below -39 ºC. According to the values of viscosity and density, the use of oleoresin in its raw or modified forms, although directly conditioned, could be considered in mixtures with gasoil or other biofuels to improve their low temperature properties. Further studies are needed to establish efficient routes for the chemical modification of oleoresin. © 2018, Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, UNAM. All rights reserved.

AB  - The future supply of energy to meet growing energy demand of rapidly exapanding populations is based on wide energy resources, particularly the renewable ones. Among all resources, lignocellulosic biomasses such as agriculture, forest, and agro-industrial residues are the most abundant and easily available bioresource for biorefineries to provide fuels, chemicals, and materials. However, pretreatment of biomass is required to overcome the physical and chemical barriers that exist in the lignin–carbohydrate composite and pretreatment facilitate the entry of biocatalysts for the conversion of biomass into fermentable sugars and other by-products. Therefore, pretreatment of the biomass is necessary prerequisite for efficient hydrolysis of lignocelluloses into different type of fermentable sugars. The physiochemical, biochemical and biological pretreatment methods are considered as most promising technologies for the biomass hydrolysis and are discussed in this review article. We also discussed the recent advancements and modern trends in pretreatment methods of lignocelluloses conversion into ethanol with special focus on fermentation methods. © 2018 Frontiers in Bioscience.

AB  - Throughout the world, the fossil fuel has supplied around the 80% of the energetic requirements, in Colombia alone 95.1% of energetic demand is made by the transportation sector solely, supplied by oil, kerosene, gasoline and diesel, this sector has an extremely small participation with biofuel of 3%, which is represented only by biodiesel. Microalgae had been proposed as biofactories with a remarkable third generation biofuels production. The culture of the microorganism comprehends interesting characteristics as countless environments where its natural growth could be replicated in fresh, salty and even sewage waters, with a higher growth rate and a higher oil production. The implementation of enzymes in the transesterification process have generated a good curiosity in the field, due to its mild reactions conditions, lesser energetic requirements, a high standard in the selection of the enzymes with the objective of avoiding the formation of soaps, creating in this way cleaner products and sub-products, in which the separation of the phases biodiesel/glycerol, give the possibility to recuperate the bio catalyzer and high output of reactions. However, the high volume of medium required to obtain lipids is one of the major drawbacks to test the viability of these enzymes. The present study aims to design an enzymatic transesterification process for the production of biodiesel form synthetic Chlorella oil. The synthetic oil was designed according to the lipid profile of C 16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3 from Chlorella spp CHL2 cultured on Bold Basal media under limited concentrations of NaNO3. The enzymatic transesterification efficiency was evaluated by the implementation of a 22 experimental factorial design (temperature and lipase concentration) under a 3: 1 molar ratio of alcohol:oil and a fixed reaction time of 6 hours. The obtained results show that, in order to obtain superior yields of biodiesel (&gt;91%) the transesterification process must be carried out under temperature conditions close to 38°C and lipase concentrations of 5%.

AB  - The transition from the use of fossil fuels to alternative and innovative fuels is a complex process involving two main points: the research of a new generation of raw materials and the development of the related technology. Regarding to raw materials, vegetable oils have the capacity to storage large a+mounts of energy, a capacity directly related to their chemical structure, which have similar carbon chains to the common fuels such as gasoil or diesel. However, vegetable oils, which are mostly constituted by triglycerides, cannot be easily used as such. Additionally, they contain significant amounts of oxygen atoms incorporated in the form of carboxyl groups. Consequently, they need to be treated through a deoxygenation process to be converted into useful fuels. Selective deoxygenation can be obtained by promoting the reactions of decarboxylation and decarbonylation in limited presence of hydrogen or even in absence of this gas. Selective decarboxylation of fatty acids results in the elimination of carboxylic groups producing CO2 and a paraffin hydrocarbon (n-alkane with one less carbon atom than the starting fatty acid) while selective decarbonylation leads to the formation of CO, H2O and an olefinic hydrocarbon (the corresponding alkene). When realized over triglycerides these reactions imply also the cracking of the glycerol moiety producing light hydrocarbons. Additionally, ketonization occurs producing high molecular weight ketones that can later be cracked to lighter methyl-ketones. Such pyrolytic processes may bring different benefits, such as the production of high-cetane-number linear hydrocarbons within the diesel range coming from biological sources, which are fully compatible with existing engines and infrastructure. Also, by-products as CO2 could be recovered and used in an integrated biorefinery. Previously, we studied the deoxygenation of oil a non-edible oil (Jatropha curcas oil) and waste cooking vegetable oil in a hydrogen free atmosphere using ?-Al2O3, CaO and Mg-Al mixed oxides (obtained from treated hydrotalcite) as catalysts. Mg-Al mixed oxides (calcined hydrothalcite) revealed interesting catalytic activity. This communication reports on the analysis of the chemical composition of the products obtained during the catalytic pyrolysis of Jatropha curcas oil, at different temperatures and reaction times, using the same catalyst. In the experiments, it was evidenced that the liquid biofuel recovered at 400 °C was composed mainly by hydrocarbons (66 mol % including n-paraffins and aliphatics), this amount increased for the product recovered at 425 °C (77 mol % including n-paraffins and aliphatics). Those compositions are not very different from that of commercial Diesel B7 (91 mol % of hydrocarbons including n-paraffins and aliphatics). It is suggested that Jatropha curcas oil deoxygenation proceeds mainly through the reactions of decarboxylation and ketonization (also involving a decarboxylation). While, ketonization reaction was favored at the lowest temperature tested, it was evident that decarboxylation reaction was predominantly by increasing the temperature.

AB  - Background: Biodiesel is a green fuel consisting of long chain fatty acid monoalkyl esters, which can be blended with diesel or used alone which is usually produced from vegetable oils/fats by either lipasecatalyzed transesterification. In this investigation, an enzyme (Novozym 435) catalyzed process was optimized to prepare methyl esters from crude Citrullus colocynthis oil (CCO) by transesterification of CCO with methanol. However, as per our knowledge, lipase-catalyzed transesterification have not been used for biodiesel production from Citrullus colocynthis. Objective: The purpose of this work was to transesterify the CCO in the presence of Candida antarctica lipase as catalyst and methanol. Additionally, the physicochemical parameters/fuel properties of the Citrullus colocynthis methyl ester (CCME) were assessed and compared. Methods: Lipase-catalyzed reactions were carried out in three necked flask (50 mL) attached with reflux condenser and thermometer, immersed in oil bath at constant stirring speed (400 rpm). The reaction mixture was consisted of CCO and varying the calculated amount of methanol, tert-butyl alcohol, and Novozym 435. The experimental parameters reaction time, methanol/oil molar ratio, reaction temperature, tert-butanol content, Novozym 435 content and water content were optimized for the transesterification reaction. The CCME yield was measured using gas chromatograph. The fuel properties of the produced CCME were determined as per American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and European (EN) biodiesel standard methods. Results: In this study, an enzymatic catalyst was employed to synthesize the CCME from CCO via transesterification. Several variables affecting the CCME yield were optimized as lipase quantity (4%), water content (0.5%), methanol/oil molar ratio (5:1), reaction temperature (43 °C), reaction medium composition (80% tertbutanol/ oil), and reaction time (3.7 h). A CCME yield of 97.8% was achieved using enzyme catalyzed transesterification of CCO under optimal conditions. The significant biodiesel fuel properties of CCME, i.e. cloud point (0.70 °C); cetane number (49.07); kinematic viscosity (2.27 mm 2 /s); flash point (143 °C); sulfur content (2 ppm) density (880 kg/m 3 ) and acid value (0.076 mg KOH/g) were appraised. CCME also exhibited long-term storage stability (4.80 h) and all the biodiesel fuel properties were within the range of standards (ASTM D6751 and EN 14214). Conclusion: The lipase-catalyzed transesterification produced better conversion than the base-catalyzed reaction. The fuel properties of CCME were within the limits of the ASTM D6751 and EN14214 standards. Furthermore, CCME showed good oxidative stability and a long shelf life due its high natural antioxidant content. CCME showed better fuel properties and long-term storage stability due to which it can be used as a potential alternative fuel. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Background: Lipid-producing microorganisms, said to be oleaginous have been recognized since several years. We had investigated the effects of medium components and culturing situations on cell growth and lipid accumulation of oleaginous yeasts which were analytically examined so as to enhance lipid yield for biodiesel production. Objective: The main objective of this study was to explore oleaginous yeast, Yarrowia lipolytica isolated from soil and optimization of culture conditions and medium components to obtained better quality microbial oil for biodiesel production. Methods: Fifty yeast strains were isolated from soil from different regions of Lahore and eleven of them were selected for oil production. The isolated yeast colonies were screened to further check their lipid producing capabilities by the qualitative analysis. Five yeast strains were designated as oleaginous because they produced more than 16% of oil based on their biomass. To estimate the total lipid content of yeast cells, the extraction of lipids was done by performing the procedure proposed by Bligh and Dyer. The transesterification of yeast oils was performed by using different methods. There were three different strategies customized to transesterifying microbial oil using base catalyzed transesterification, acid catalyzed transesterification and enzyme-based transesterification. After completion of transesterification, sample was used for fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were analyzed by gas-chromatograph with ionization detector type MS. Results: The isolate IIB-10 identified as Yarrowia lipolytica produced maximum amount of lipids i.e. 22.8%. More amount of biomass was obtained when cane molasses was utilized as carbon source where it produced 29.4 g/L of biomass while sucrose and lactose were not utilized by IIB-10 and no biomass was obtained. Similarly, meat extracts showed best results when it was used as nitrogen source because it resulted in 35.8 g/L biomass of Yarrowia lipolytica IIB-10. The culturing conditions like size of inoculum, effect of pH and time of incubation were also studied. The 10% of inoculum size produced 25.4 g/L biomass at 120 h incubation time, while the pH 7 was the optimum pH at which 24.8 g/L biomass was produced by Yarrowia lipolytica IIB-10. GC-MS analysis showed that biodiesel produced by transesterification contained similar fatty acids as found in vegetable oil for this reason it is widely accepted feedstock for biodiesel production. Conclusion: The analysis of fatty acids methyl esters showed the similar composition of microbial oil as in vegetable oils and high amount of methyl esters were obtained after transesterification. Therefore, potentially oleaginous yeast could be used to generate a large amount of lipids for biodiesel production that will be the better substitute of petroleum-based diesel and will also control the environmental pollution. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - In this research work the impact of fuel injection advance on combustion and gas emissions in a thermal barrier coated diesel engine is examined. The engine is fuelled with lower blends of Honge biodiesel extracted from a non-edible oil feedstock by transesterification process and blended with diesel in various proportions from 0-30% in steps of 5% by volume. The engine combustion chamber components including inlet and exhaust valves, cylinder head and piston crown were coated with yttria stabilized zirconia ceramic material over nickel aluminium alloy bond coat for 300 μm thickness. Fuel injection timing was advanced 4° CA from standard injection timing of 23° CA BTDC by changing the thickness of advance shim. Experimental results confirmed that in coated engine biodiesel blend B15 showed significant reduction in carbon monoxide, unburnt hydrocarbon, smoke emission with slight increase of NOx emission than other fuels tested. At part loads, blend B15 shows significant reduction in CO emission of 18.65%, HC emission of 17.24%, smoke reduction of 29% with slight increase in NOx of 5.38% in injection advance of 27 CA BTDC. At peak loads, B15 experienced emission reduction in CO of 10%, HC of 10.4%, Smoke of 9.85% and slight increase in NOx of 2.94%. Diesel posed higher HRR of 46.25 J/deg and higher cylinder peak pressure of 71.456 bar followed by B15 blend of HRR 43.25 J/deg, peak cylinder pressure 67.33 bar in injection advance. © 2018 EM International.

AB  - n-Butanol is a promising renewable biofuel and has a lot of advantages as a gasoline additive compared with ethanol. Though the combustion of pure n-butanol has been extensively investigated, the chemical structures of large hydrocarbons doped with n-butanol, especially for aromatic fuels, are still insufficiently understood. In this work, rich premixed toluene/n-butanol/oxygen/argon flames were investigated at 30 Torr with synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS). The blending ratio of n-butanol was varied from 0 to 50%, while the equivalence ratio was maintained at a quite rich value (1.75) for the purpose of studying the influence of n-butanol on the aromatic growth process. Flame species including radicals, reactive molecules, isomers and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were identified and their mole fraction profiles were measured. A kinetic model of toluene/n-butanol combustion was developed from our recently reported toluene and n-butanol models. It is observed that the production of most toluene decomposition products and larger aromatics was suppressed as the blending ratio of n-butanol increases. Meanwhile, the addition of n-butanol generally enhanced the formation of most observed C2-C4 hydrocarbons and C1-C4 oxygenated species. The rate of production (ROP) analysis and experimental observations both indicate that the interaction between toluene and n-butanol in their decomposition processes mainly occurs at the formation of small intermediates, e.g. acetylene and methyl. In particular, the interaction between toluene and n-butanol in methyl formation influences the formation of large monocyclic aromatics such as ethylbenzene, styrene and phenylacetylene, making their maximum mole fractions decay slowly upon increasing the blending ratio of n-butanol compared with toluene and benzyl. The increase of the blending ratio of n-butanol reduces the formation of key PAH precursors such as benzyl, fulvenallenyl, benzene, phenyl and propargyl, which leads to a remarkable reduction in the formation of PAHs. © 2018 the Owner Societies.

AB  - Mesoporous Ti-Mo bi-metal oxides with various titanium-molybdenum ratios were successfully fabricated via a facile approach by using stearic acid as a low-cost template agent. thermal gravity (TG)/differential scanning calorimetry (DSC. analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm, NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM. and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements indicated these materials possessing mesoporous structure, sufficient pore size and high acid intensity. The catalytic performance of prepared catalysts was evaluated by esterification of free fatty acids in Jatropha curcas crude oil (JCCO. with methanol. The effects of various parameters on FFA conversion were investigated. The esterification conversion of 87.8% was achieved under the condition of 180°C, 2 h, methanol to JCCO molar ratio of 20:1 and 3.0 wt.% catalyst (relative to the weight of JCCO). The mesoporous catalysts were found to exhibit high activities toward the simultaneous esterification and transesterification of JCCO. Furthermore, the catalyst could be recovered with a good reusability. © 2018 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - Candlenut oil (CNO) is a potentially new feedstock for biodiesel (BDF) production. In this paper, a two-step co-solvent method for BDF production from CNO was examined. Firstly, esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) (7 wt%) present in CNO was carried out using a co-solvent of acetonitrile (30 wt%) and H2SO4 as a catalyst. The content of FFAs was reduced to 0.8 wt% in 1 h at 65℃. Subsequent transesterification of the crude oil produced was carried out using a co-solvent of acetone (20 wt%) and 1 wt% potassium hydroxide (KOH). Ester content of 99.3% was obtained at 40℃ in 45 min. The water content in BDF was 0.023% upon purification using vacuum distillation at 5 kPa. The components of CNO BDF were characterized using a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry and gas chromatography-flame ionization detector. The physicochemical properties of BDF satisfied the ASTM D6751-02 standard. The gaseous exhaust emissions from the diesel engine upon combustion of the BDF blends (B0–B100) with petrodiesel were examined. The emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons were clearly lower, but that of nitrogen oxides was higher in comparison to those from petro-diesel. © 2018 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - Detrital soil contamination during wood harvesting cannot be avoided without a further cleaning step. The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of Piedmont soil on pinewood pyrolysis products. Ash content was varied at 0.56%, 1.16%, 2.77%, 4.40%, 6.87%, 8.35%, and 15.52% by adding soil to woodchips to mimic the highly soilcontaminated biomass that can be found in biorefineries. This study found that bio-oil yield decreased from 47.1% to 26.3% with an increase in ash content from 0.56% to 15.52%. However, the oxygen content of the bio-oil decreased and the carbon content increased, which led to an increase in heating value from 22.5 to 24.9 MJ kg-1. Inorganics in the soil aided in the catalytic cracking and dehydration reactions for bio-oil formation. A slight increase in the total acid number (106 to 117 mg KOH g-1) and water content (20.72% to 24.99%) was observed with more soil inclusion in the pyrolysis. The effect of soil on biochar O/C and H/C ratios was minimal even though the heating value decreased with an increase in soil content. This study showed that soil (4%wt to 7%wt) in the biomass assisted in deoxygenating the bio-oil and lowered the total mass yield while keeping the total energy yield almost constant. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - An eco-friendly and low-cost lignosulfonate-based acidic carbonaceous catalyst (LS-SO3H) was effectively fabricated using the sulfite pulping by-product of sodium lignosulfonate as a precursor by facile one-step simultaneous carbonization and sulfonation, and employed for the synthesis of promising biofuel furan derivatives from biorenewable feedstocks. The catalyst preparation conditions significantly affected the preparation and properties of LS-SO3H. A relatively high catalyst preparation yield (40.4%) with strong -SO3H density (1.33 mmol g-1) were achieved when the lignosulfonate was treated in concentrated H2SO4 solution at 120 °C for 6 h. The preparation yield of LS-SO3H was nearly twice as much as that of one-step prepared catalyst using alkaline lignin (another technical lignin from pulping) as a precursor. The as-prepared LS-SO3H had similar textural characteristics to the frequently-used two-step prepared carbonaceous catalyst involving pyrolysis carbonization and sulfonation. LS-SO3H was found to show good catalytic activity for the synthesis of 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) in ethanol medium, affording around 86%, 57% and 47% yields from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), fructose and inulin, respectively. Also, a high HMF yield of 83% could be obtained from fructose when DMSO was replaced as reaction medium. The used LS-SO3H was readily recovered by filtration, and remained active in recycle runs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.

AB  - The consolidation of marine fuel oil in modern times has kept it at a leading position in technological research in the industrial area. The marine fuel oil is based on the distillation residues of crude oil and is divided into two categories: distillate fuel (diesel oil) and residual fuel oil. The quality of the particular fuel has direct effects on the ignition quality of the diesel engines. The fuel sulfur content is dependent on the type of crude oil from which it originates. Sulfur is undesirable, because during the combustion is converted to sulfur dioxide (S02), which is acidic, corrosive, and contributory to the phenomenon of acid rain. This paper proposes the mixing of the biodiesel fuel in marine fuel oil at a rate of 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% and a study of the physicochemical suitability parameters. Alongside, presented is a study of the production costs for the mixtures according to the prices of raw materials biodiesel manufacturing (used frying oil [UFO], rape seed oil, animal fat, and sun oil) and marine fuel oil price. © 2018 Old City Publishing, Inc.

AB  - As an ideal clean energy, biomass is friendly to the environment. Bio-oil is a brown and black viscous liquid obtained by rapid pyrolysis of biomass under anoxic conditions. As a kind of liquid fuel, it has the disadvantages of high acid value, high water content, high viscosity and low calorific value. In addition, bio-oil is the mixture of hundreds of chemicals. Carboxylic acids enhance corrosion resistance of bio-oil. Amounts of water reduce the calorific value of the bio-oil. Aldehydes and other labile compounds make the bio-oil coking or polymerize easily during storage, with the increased viscosity, affecting the quality of the bio-oil. In this experiment, in order to reduce the content of carboxylic acid in bio-oil, the carbon-based solid acid catalysts were used to catalyze esterification of bio-oil. In the experiment, 4 kinds of carbon-based solid acid catalysts were prepared by incomplete carbonization and carbonization-sulfonation. They were starch-TsOH, sucrose-TsOH, glucose-TsOH and corn flour-sulfuric acid. The catalysts were characterized by FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), indicating that the carbon-based solid acid catalyst is an aromatic carbon compound with sulfonic groups. Esterification was carried out with acid and alcohol as model compounds. Among the 4 catalysts, starch-TsOH had the highest esterification rate, and the conversion of acetic acid reached 91.58%. The effects of reaction temperature, reaction time, catalyst mass fraction and ratio of alcohol to acid on the conversion of acetic acid were investigated by single factor experiment. Response surface methodology was used to optimize the catalytic esterification conditions of the bio-oil model compound. The optimum reaction conditions were as follows: reaction temperature 100℃, alkyd ratio 3.37, reaction time 2.49 h, and catalyst mass fraction 5.26%, and the acetic acid conversion rate reached 95.51%. Under these conditions, 3 validation experiments were carried out, the conversion rates were 94.89%, 94.26% and 95.01%, respectively, and the relative deviation was 0.83%, which was very close to the predicted value. This indicated that the model was reliable for the analysis and prediction of the optimum esterification conditions. Under the optimum reaction conditions, the starch-TsOH catalyst was reused 5 times, and the activity of the catalyst was investigated. The results showed that the catalyst was deactivated seriously after 4 times, and the conversion rate of acetic acid was reduced to 52.14%. After esterification of bio-oil with methanol, ethanol and n-butanol, the carboxylic acid was converted into neutral ester, and the acid value was reduced by 82.82%-91.41%. Moreover, after esterification, the density and viscosity of bio-oil decreased obviously, and the calorific value increased. The bio-oil and esterified bio-oil were analyzed by FTIR and GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometer), which showed that some carboxylic acids in bio-oil were converted into esters, some acetals were produced, and phenols were unchanged basically. So, in the future experiments, we should consider how to make better use of phenolic compounds. After esterification and dehydration of bio-oil, the water content of bio-oil was reduced to 2.5%, and the calorific value was increased. The effect was significant, which indicated the necessity of water separation. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. All right reserved.

AB  - The use of renewable energy sources is becoming increasingly necessary, if we are to achieve the changes required to address the impacts of global warming. Biomass is the most common form of renewable energy, widely used in the third world but until recently, less so in the Western world. Latterly much attention has been focused on identifying suitable biomass species, which can provide high-energy outputs, to replace conventional fossil fuel energy sources. The type of biomass required is largely determined by the energy conversion process and the form in which the energy is required. The potential of reclaimed land of mines to act as a biofuel source, providing fuel to supplement conventional power stations, is examined, together with the replacement of fuels in gas or diesel boilers for the production of thermal energy. © 2018, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

AB  - Saccharification of lignocellulose is a necessary procedure for deconstructing the complex structure for building a sugar platform that can be used for producing biofuel and high-value chemicals. In this study, a carbon-based solid acid catalyst derived from sodium lignosulfonate, a waste by-product from the paper industry, was successfully prepared and used for the hydrolysis of hemicellulose in corncob. The optimum preparation conditions for the catalyst were determined to be carbonization at 250 °C for 6 h, followed by sulfonation with concentrated H2SO4 (98%) and oxidation with 10% H2O2 (solid-liquid ratio of 1:75 g mL-1) at 50 °C for 90 min. SEM, XRD, FT-IR, elemental analysis and acid-base titration were used for the characterization of the catalysts. It was found that 0.68 mmol g-1 SO3H and 4.78 mmol g-1 total acid were loaded onto the catalyst. When corncob was hydrolyzed by this catalyst at 130 °C for 12 h, the catalyst exhibited high selectivity and produced a relatively high xylose yield of up to 84.2% (w/w) with a few by-products. Under these conditions, the retention rate of cellulose was 82.5%, and the selectivity reached 86.75%. After 5 cycles of reuse, the catalyst still showed high catalytic activity, with slightly decreased yields of xylose from 84.2% to 70.7%. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.

AB  - Due the environmental appeal, the demand of new processes and inputs has been increasing considerably in the last decade. Biodiesel is a biodegradable fuel obtained from vegetable oils or animal fats, including those discarded after use. The methyl and ethyl transesterification routes for biodiesel production were tested by using residual frying oil as raw material through the homogeneous basic catalyst, such as sodium hydroxide. In present work, it was evaluated the efficiency of the eugenol on the oxidation stability of the methyl and ethyl biodiesels synthesized from residual frying oil. The chromatographic analysis determined that the conversion of the yield to the methyl and ethylic esters (biodiesel) was 90.6% and 87.3% (m/m), respectively. For both biodiesel samples a rise of the eugenol concentration added resulted in an increase of the induction period (oxidation stability parameter evaluated by Rancimat method), with a consequent reduction of the acid number. Taking these results into account, it can be concluded that the samples obtained after eugenol addition can be used as biodiesel. © 2018, Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Departamento de Quimica.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable and non-toxic biofuel that can be produced by the esterification reaction. In this reaction, acid catalysts are used and, due to the numerous advantages, heterogeneous catalysts are gaining space. Polysulfone (PSF) and sulfonated polystyrene (PSS) membranes were prepared to catalyze the esterification reaction of oleic acid with methanol, producing biodiesel. Several morphological types of membranes were obtained: dense, porous and electrospun. The reaction conditions were: temperature of 100 °C, molar ratio of 10:1 (methanol:oleic acid), 5% catalyst and time of 2 hours. By means of the BET and BJH methods it was possible to obtain the surface area of the membranes, volume and pore size. The consumption of oleic acid and the formation of the ester were confirmed by the analyzes of CGMS and the FTIR bands, respectively. For the membranes that presented the PSS, 2 hours of reaction were enough for almost total consumption of oleic acid, except for the dense membrane.

AB  - The techniques used to monitor the quality of the biodiesel are intensely discussed in the literature, partly because of the different oil sources and their intrinsic physicochemical characteristics. This study aimed to monitor the thermal degradation of the fatty acid methyl esters of Sesamum indicum L. and Raphanus sativus L. biodiesels (SILB and RSLB, resp.). The results showed that both biodiesels present a high content of unsaturated fatty acids, ∼84% (SILB) and ∼90% (RSLB). The SILB had a high content of polyunsaturated linoleic fatty acid (18: 2), about 49%, and the oleic monounsaturated (18: 1), ∼34%. On the other hand, RSLB presented a considerable content of linolenic fatty acid (18: 3), ∼11%. The biodiesel samples were thermal degraded at 110°C for 48 hours, and acid value, UV absorption, and fluorescence spectroscopy analysis were carried out. The results revealed that both absorption and fluorescence presented a correlation with acid value as a function of degradation time by monitoring absorptions at 232 and 270 nm as well as the emission at 424 nm. Although the obtained correlation is not completely linear, a direct correlation was observed in both cases, revealing that both properties can be potentially used for monitoring the biodiesel degradation. © 2018 Maydla dos Santos Vasconcelos et al.

AB  - In this research biodiesel is produced from goat tallow in the presence of homogenous catalysts such as KOH and NaOH using trans-esterification process. For this purpose, effect of several parameters such as temperature, reaction time, methanol to oil ratio, type and concentration of a catalyst has been investigated. The results showed that the maximum biodiesel yield (96 and 98 %) was obtained using NaOH and KOH, respectively, and optimal conditions were determined. Also, to improve some properties of biodiesel, biodiesel was mixed with diesel at different ratio (B5-B100) and their properties such as flash point, cloud point, pour point, viscosity and density were measured. It was found that the properties of produced biodiesel is in the range of standard and can be used as a biofuel. © Esmaeli H., Foroutan R., 2018.

AB  - Beef tallow is a major waste from slaughterhouses and the production rate is rising due to increasing human population. Conversion of waste beef tallow into potential hydrocarbons and biofuels is of great interest. This work focused on catalytic cracking of beef tallow using ZSM-5 to generate a light liquid fuel. A batch reactor was used to investigate the effect of operating conditions for generation of liquid hydrocarbons using a central composite design of experiment to determine the maximum conversion. The experimental variables included reaction temperature between 350 and 450°C, reaction time from 20 to 60 min, and catalyst loading between 1.0 and 10.0% w/w. The liquid products obtained were subsequently distilled at 350°C and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for their chemical composition. The optimum condition for the highest liquid product conversion of 73% w/w was found at 443°C, 60 min and catalyst loading of 6.3% w/w. For the final light liquid fuel, different short chain hydrocarbons between C7-C21 were identified. It contained mainly kerosene (36%), but with physical properties similar to diesel. © International Journal Of Renewable Energy Research, 2018.

AB  - International institutions are proliferating over a wide range of issue areas, creating what have recently been described as regime complexes. More than complicated arrangements, regime complexes are structures: they are more than the sum of their parts, i.e. individual international regimes. While the concept of international regimes holds strong promise in this direction, academic research on regime complexes has mostly focused on how agents shape regime complexes but less on how complexes influence agents. This contribution aims at filling this gap by studying the effects that regime complexes might have on global governance, focusing more narrowly on the effects of regime complexes on non-state actors' (NSAs) strategies with regard to agenda setting for new international regulations. More precisely, we hypothesise that regime complexes create an 'emulsifying effect' for pro-active NSAs to push for new regulations whereby the collective effect of non-state actors within and across regime complexes become greater than the sum of their individual effects within individual regimes. We use the examples of food security and biofuels regulations at the international level as a case study with a special focus on the European Union. © 2018 University Association for Contemporary European Studies.

AB  - The importance of biodiesel production was studied and analyzed based on research papers and theses published by different authors in various e-journals. The hike in fossil fuel prices with increase in usage demands, has forced the research to find new alternatives to petroleum fuels. Despite this, there is a crucial need to protect the environment from harmful effects of fossil fuels. Biodiesel is a renewable alternate fuel substitute that can be obtained by using various chemical methods such as transesterification, acid-catalyzed methanolysis etc. detailed survey of available literature is taken to review the different research achievements on different aqueous as well as land species for producing biodiesel as an alternative fuel for a compression ignition engine, problems associated with their production, such as the oil quality and quantity and also the methodology used for their production. In addition to this, general properties of oils taken from different natural species as well as techniques of biodiesel production and utilization have been collected. © 2018 PENERBIT AKADEMIA BARU.

AB  - This paper demonstrates the results of testing the performance of tractors using fossil diesel, biodiesel, and blends of biodiesel and fossil diesel. The results of tests conducted in stationary and non-stationary conditions indicate that, in contrast to fossil diesel, the use of biodiesel and blends of biodiesel and fossil diesel reduce the power of engine and drawbar power, and increase specific fuel consumption. Thermal efficiency slightly improves with biodiesel blends. The differences become notable with bigger share of biodiesel in the blend. However, the changes are less notable regarding the differences in heating value, which is the result of complete combustion. Use of different fuels, compared to use of fossil diesel only, reduces the CO emission and temperature of exhaust fumes, and increases the CO2 emission and NOx. At maximum load, the difference between the parameters measured in stationary and non-stationary conditions is minimal. On the other hand, at lower loads, the load variable formed in non-stationary conditions of testing becomes noticeable which results in greater differences. However, decrease in engine power and increase in fuel consumption using biodiesel significantly deteriorated the exploitation characteristics of plowing tractors (production efficiency was reduced by 12.87% and fuel consumption per unit of cultivated area was increased by up to 21.63%). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Crude pyrolysis bio-oil contains significant quantities of carboxylic acids which limit its utility as a biofuel. Vapour phase ketonisation of organic acids contained within biomass fast-pyrolysis vapours offers a potential pre-treatment to improve the stability and energy content of resulting bio-oils formed upon condensation. Zirconia is a promising catalyst for such reactions, however little is known regarding the impact of thermal processing on the physicochemical properties of zirconia in the context of it's corresponding reactivity for the vapour phase ketonisation of acetic acid. Here we show that calcination progressively transforms amorphous Zr(OH)4 into small tetragonal ZrO2 crystallites at 400 °C, and subsequently larger monoclinic crystallites &gt;600 °C. These phase transitions are accompanied by an increase in the density of Lewis acid sites, and concomitant decrease in their acid strength, attributed to surface dehydroxylation and anion vacancy formation. Weak Lewis acid sites (and/or resulting acid-base pairs) are identified as the active species responsible for acetic acid ketonisation to acetone at 350 °C and 400 °C, with stronger Lewis acid sites favouring competing unselective reactions and carbon laydown. Acetone selectivity is independent of acid strength. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This study describes properties of biomasses of Moringa oleifera Lamarck for energetic applications of production of biodiesel and briquettes. The seeds collected of the mature pods were the initial biomasses used of this plant. The seeds were separated into husks and oilseed grains, from which the oils were extracted by mechanical pressing and by solvent extraction. The crude oilmixed (of pressing and by solvent) was degummed, neutralized,washed, dried and characterized. The purified oilwas converted into methyl biodiesel in homogeneous alkaline transesterification, which was purified and characterized. The residual peels and pies had their calorific powersmeasured and compared with classic agricultural residues: firewood, sugarcane bagasse and coconut husks.Moringa culture was compared to soybeans in agricultural and biodiesel production perspectives. The analytical results show that the biomasses of the moringa are favorable as renewable biofuels like biodiesel or briquettes due to the good calorific power and simple and accessible productive technology. The production of briquettes starting from the biomasses of the moringa would be recommended with the uses of the pod husks, seed peels and pies (cakes) of extraction of the oil. The agricultural management and the simple productive technologies applied to the moringa are favorable for social inclusion by enabling family agriculture. © F.S.G. Pereira et al.

AB  - Rice bran is a by-product of great production worldwide and its use for the synthesis of biodiesel does not affect the food chain and therefore it is an excellent alternative for the production of biofuels with low carbon footprint. In this work, the synthesis of biodiesel was carried out from the raw rice bran oil of a kernel variety called "Morelos rice." The stability and corrosivity characteristics of biodiesel were determined. Biodiesel stability was determined both under storage conditions and under accelerated oxidation conditions, and its corrosivity was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at 110°C under aerated conditions. The results showed that, due to the high instability of the rice bran, its raw oil had a high content of free fatty acids. The synthesized biodiesel showed excellent stability under storage conditions of up to five months, and its oxidative stability was much higher than that established in international standards. On the other hand, biodiesel showed low corrosivity and this was only significant once oxidative degradation began. © 2018 J. Zuñiga-Díaz et al.

AB  - A nanostructured iron (Fe) catalyst for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) was prepared and evaluated using a silica nanospring (NS) support. FTS offers an approach of producing biofuels from synthesis gas (syngas) produced via biomass gasification. The Fe/NS catalysts were prepared using three different methods: (i) incipient wetness impregnation, (ii) precipitation and (iii) modified sol-gel, in order to obtain different sizes of deposited Fe nanoparticles on the NS support and investigate the influence of particle size on FTS. The Fe decorated catalysts were calcined and then activated with either H2, CO or H2 + CO mixture. The prepared Fe/NS catalysts were characterized before the FT reaction by BET surface area, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in order to find correlations between physico-chemical properties of catalysts and catalytic performance. The decoration of Fe nanoparticles of different sizes onto NS using the various methods ranged from 1.7 to 10 nm. The FTS performance was also evaluated in a quartz fixed-bed microreactor (H2/CO of 2:1, 270 °C) and the products trapped and analyzed by GC-TCD and GC–MS to determine CO conversion and reaction selectivity. These results show that the highest CO conversion (76.6%) and a wide distribution of light hydrocarbon (C6 to C14) were obtained for Fe/NS catalyst prepared by impregnation and activated with CO after 12 h of the FT reaction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium L.) seed oil is available for biodiesel production as a wild plant species. In the present study, the cocklebur seeds collected from Muslubelen, Yozgat, Turkey, at 1440 m in 2014 were sown in the Bozok University Agriculture Faculty Topçu Research Area during 2015 and 2016. The maximum crude oil ratio was obtained as 35%. Oleic and linoleic acid contents of cocklebur seed oil were determined as 11.37% and 76.97%, respectively. Some important fuel properties such as density, flash point, water content, copper strip corrosion, iodine value, linolenic acid, methyl ester, and sulfated ash content values were measured and compared to the EN 14214 and ASTM D6751 standards. These values were found to be within the standard ranges. Cost analysis of the cocklebur plant was also performed and compared to other field crops. According to our results, it seems that agronomic production of cocklebur will be possible in marginal areas because its genetic properties enable cocklebur to grow in dry areas. Therefore, production of cocklebur as an industrial plant may contribute to energy shortages without competing with food production. In areas devoid of sufficient irrigation possibilities, agriculture based on grain and cereal decreases the biodiversity. Production of drought-tolerant plants such as cocklebur in these areas will have positive effects on conservation and development of biodiversity in the ecosystem. © TÜBİTAK.

AB  - The quality determination of biofuels requires identifying the chemical and physical parameters. The key physical parameters are rheological, thermal and electrical properties. In our study, we investigated samples of diesel blends with rape-seed methyl esters content in the range from 3 to 100%. In these, we measured basic thermophysical properties, including thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity, using two different transient methods - the hot-wire method and the dynamic plane source. Every thermophysical parameter was measured 100 times using both methods for all samples. Dynamic viscosity was measured during the heating process under the temperature range 20-80°C. A digital rotational viscometer (Brookfield DV 2T) was used for dynamic viscosity detection. Electrical conductivity was measured using digital conductivity meter (Model 1152) in a temperature range from -5 to 30°C. The highest values of thermal parameters were reached in the diesel sample with the highest biofuel content. The dynamic viscosity of samples increased with higher concentration of bio-component rapeseed methyl esters. The electrical conductivity of blends also increased with rapeseed methyl esters content. © 2016 Zuzana Hlaváčová et al., published by De Gruyter Open 2016.

AB  - Biodiesel, one of the renewable energy sources has gained attention for decades as the alternative fuel due to its remarkable properties. However, there are several drawbacks from the industrial production of biodiesel such as the spike in the production cost, environmental issues related to the usage of homogeneous catalyst and profitability in long term. One of the solutions to eliminate the problem is by utilizing low cost starting material such as palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD). PFAD is a byproduct from the refining of crude palm oil and abundantly available. Esterification of PFAD to biodiesel will be much easier with the presence of heterogeneous acid catalyst. Most of acid catalyst preparation involves series of heating process using conventional method. In this study, microwave was utilized in catalyst preparation, significantly reducing the reaction time from conventional heating method. The catalyst produced was characterized using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Brunauer Emmet and Teller (BET), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Temperature-Programmed Desorption - Ammonia (TPD-NH3) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) while percentage yield and conversion of the PFAD were analysed by gas chromatography - flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and acid-base titration, respectively. It has been demonstrated that the percentage yield of biodiesel from the PFAD by employing sulfonated glucose acid catalyst (SGAC) reached 98.23% under the following conditions: molar ratio of methanol to PFAD of 10:1, catalyst loading of 2.5% and reaction temperature of 70oC. The microwave-assisted SGAC showed its potential to replace the SGAC produced via conventional heating method.

AB  - Biodiesel is a fuel comprised of mono-alkyl esters of long-chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils or animal fats. Biodiesel is now well-adopted fuel with benefit of being a renewable energy source and decreasing pollutant. The cotton seed oil contains 18 - 26% and it contains long chain fatty acid. Cotton seed oil is rich in palmitic acid (22-26%), oleic acid (15-20%), linoleic acid (49-58%) and 10% mixture of other acid. The FFA present in the raw cotton seed oil is 3.7%. After transesterification, it is reduced to 1.9%. Similarly, the corresponding value of viscosity also is reduced from 34 Cst to 11.1 Cst. With the recent developments in the fuel injection system and more sophisticated components to meet emission norms, a good variety of fuels can be successfully used in Compression Ignition (CI) engines. Cotton seed oil can be easily blended with diesel in three different blends B10, B20 and B30. Initially the properties of cotton seed oil like calorific value, density, viscosity, %FFA, iodine value, and saponification value were identified and compared with diesel properties. A single cylinder, water cooled, direct injection CI engine at a constant engine speed of 1500 rpm was used for testing at various load conditions. The combustion and emission performance of the engine was obtained and compared with that of diesel. The effect of injection pressure on the engine performance was observed by varying the fuel injection pressure from 195 bar to 215 bar. From combustion analysis B30 blend seems to have better thermal efficiency compared to diesel at high loads. The NOx level was minimum for B30 blend and was better for all blends compared to diesel at high injection pressures. © IAEME Publication.

AB  - In this paper, the commercial 5%Pd/C and 5%Pt/C catalysts and synthesized 5%Pt/MN-270 and 5%Pd/MN-270 were used in the hydrogenolysis of lignocellulosic material (softwood sawdust) to obtain liquid fuels in the form of hydrocarbons. As lignin has a very complex structure, anisole was used as a model compound. It was found that the use Pt-containing catalysts based on hypercrosslinked polystyrene in both processes of anisole and lignin-containing feedstock conversion allowed obtaining the highest yield of oxygen-free hydrocarbons (up to 96 wt. %). Besides, the polymer based catalysts showed high stability in hydrogenolysis process in comparison with the commercial carbon based catalysts. Copyright © 2018 BCREC Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biofuel from vegetable oil becomes one of the most suitable and logical alternatives to replace fossil fuel. The research focused on various metal ratio Zinc/Molybdenum/HZSM-5 (Zn-Mo/HZSM-5) catalyst to produce liquid hydrocarbon via catalytic hydrocracking of Ceiba penandra oil. The catalytic hydro-cracking process has been applied in this study to crack Ceiba pentandra oil into a gasoil range hydro-carbon using Zn-Mo/HZSM-5 as a catalyst. The effect of various reaction temperature on the catalytic hydrocracking of Ceiba pentandra oil were studied. The Zn-Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst with metal ratio was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method. This process used slurry pressure batch reactor with a mechanical stirrer. A series of experiments were carried out in the temperature range from 300-400 oC for 2 h at pressure between 10-15 bar. The conversion and selectivity were estimated. The liquid hydrocarbon product were identified to gasoline, kerosene, and gas oil. The results show that the use of Zn-Mo/HZSM-5 can produce gas oil as the most component in the product. Overall, the highest conver-sion and selectivity of gas oil range hydrocarbon was obtained when the ZnMo/HZSM-5 metal ratio was Zn(2.86 wt.%)-Mo(5.32 wt.%)/HZSM-5 and the name is Zn-Mo/HZSM-5-102. The highest conversion was obtained at 63.31 % and n-paraffin (gas oil range) selectivity was obtained at 90.75 % at a tem-perature of 400 oC. Ceiba pentandra oil can be recommended as the source of inedible vegetable oil to produce gasoil as an environmentally friendly transportation fuel. Copyright © 2018 BCREC Group. All rights reserved.

Deployment of improved engines is aided by the wide availability of well-defined fuels, sometimes with more stringent specification of properties such as the sulphur content and the vaporisation and combustion characteristics (e.g. the octane rating). Fuel regulation has also led to the inclusion of low-carbon fuel components such as ethanol and biodiesel in mainstream road fuels. These trends will probably continue over the next few decades, and so it is important to understand their implications for commercial-scale fuel production and distribution. This paper provides a technical explanation of the linkages between the properties of commercial-scale fuels, the technologies used to make them and the ‘landscape’ of the fuels industry (e.g. the distribution systems and the interlinked markets for non-fuel products and energy). Industrially relevant examples are used to explain how the refining industry has adapted, and is still adapting, to the changes in the sulphur and volatility specifications, the mandated biocontent and the changes in engine technology. This paper is not intended to make a case for any specific type of fuel but does aim to explain the principles by which refined fuels can be adapted to meet future specifications or to work in conjunction with alternative fuel components. It covers current issues such as the lower sulphur content, the increased biocontent and the emerging theme of higher-octane-number gasoline as a route to a higher engine efficiency. © 2017, © IMechE 2017.

AB  - Fuel additives for automotive applications have been in use for almost as long as the automobile has existed. They provide significant benefits, both in making fuels fit for purpose and to deliver protection and performance benefits. Performance benefits can range from protection against degradation, through recovery of lost performance, all the way to enhanced engine function. This has become particularly important with the tension between increasingly stringent long emissions requirements, the encouragement of renewable biofuel content and the drive to improved engine efficiency and reduce fuel consumption. The paper discusses where performance fuel additives provide their benefits and how they are evolving to work with latest generations of fuel and engines, and provides an overview of the current and upcoming industry engine tests for fuels and their additives. © 2017, © IMechE 2017.

AB  - Jatropha curcas is a plant that accumulates high-quality oil in its seeds, which is capable of being transformed into liquid biofuel. However, several aspects of its flowering are still unknown, which is a key step in the production of fruits, seeds, and oil. Flowering is a complex process that is regulated by various factors at the molecular level, including microRNAs (miRNAs). There is evidence suggesting that the miRNAs of the miR156 and miR172 families play a key role in the flowering transition of plants. For this reason, the dynamics of miR156 and miR172 were studied during a production cycle of J. curcas. Our results reveal that J. curcas has a mechanism for the expression of these miRNAs that differs from that reported for the vast majority of angiosperms, since the expression of both families of miRNAs was positively correlated with the phenological state of J. curcas. We discuss the implications of these findings and how the regulatory mechanisms of miR156 and miR172 differ from what has been reported thus far. © 2018, Sociedade Botanica do Brasil.

AB  - The physiochemical properties of biodiesel are significantly influenced by its fatty acid composition (FAC). This research investigates FAC of Jatropha biodiesel (JB) synthesized using feedstocks originated from the east (JBEM) and west (JBWM) Malaysian regions together with biofuel properties. The critical properties of pure biodiesels and blends were analysed according to ASTM D6751/EN 14214 standards. The JB properties were precisely regulated by its FAC features such as saturated fatty acids (SFAs), unsaturated fatty acids (USFAs), degree of unsaturation, and long chain saturated factor. The influence of SFA and USFA was inversely associated over biodiesel properties. The presence of higher SFA greatly affects biodiesel properties like the cetane number, cold filter plugging point, kinematic viscosity, density, cloud point, and pour point; conversely, the fuel properties such as oxidation stability, iodine value, acid value, water content, and flash point were improving with USFA contents. Blending of biofuels with petro diesels considerably improved their fuel properties. © 2018 Author(s).

AB  - Two promising alternative fuel candidates for spark-ignition engines, 2-butanone and 2-methylfuran, have been identified in the context of the Cluster for Excellence ‘Tailor-Made Fuels from Biomass’. To further explore the potential of these fuels for spark-ignition engine application, experimental and numerical investigations into the occurrence of the abnormal combustion phenomenon of hot surface–induced pre-ignition have been conducted, with pure ethanol, RON97 E10, and pure iso-octane as reference fuels. For the experimental investigations, a single-cylinder engine with a compression ratio of 11, equipped with a glow-plug to create a hot spot in the cylinder, was operated at 1500 r/min and 1500 mbar charge pressure. Each fuel was tested with several glow-plug temperatures until a minimum pre-ignition frequency of 2% was observed. The results show that 2-methylfuran reaches its 2% pre-ignition frequency at a glow-plug temperature of 880 °C, which is 16 °C higher than the 2% pre-ignition frequency of ethanol at 864 °C and 10 °C less than RON97 E10 with 890 °C. Iso-octane showed the lowest pre-ignition resistance with a 2% pre-ignition frequency at a glow-plug temperature of 853 °C, and 2-butanone was most resistant against pre-ignition in this study with a 2% pre-ignition frequency at 932 °C. Further numerical investigations, including zero-dimensional ignition delay time calculations and three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulations, revealed a clear connection between the surface ignition frequency of these fuels and their reaction kinetics. © 2017, © IMechE 2017.

AB  - Increasing demand for fossil fuels worldwide coupled with environmental concerns has intensified the focus on Renewable Energy Sources. So-called ‘2nd generation’ biofuels, produced from residues, waste or cellulosic material, present distinct advantages over fossil fuels and can contribute to energy security and sustainable development of society. This paper aims to demonstrate that Greece holds sufficient resources to support indigenous and possibly economic production of 2nd generation biofuels in order to meet the European Union ‘Renewable Energy Directive’ targets. These mandate 10% share of biofuels in the transport sector for member states by 2020 with continuous penetration of advanced biofuels towards the 2030 horizon (RED II). A market analysis has been performed to review the biofuels market in Greece and investigate the availability of 2nd generation resources, followed by economic feasibility assessment of their production routes. Individual results identify substantial market gap, with potential to be filled through indigenous production of 2nd generation biofuels. This presents significant short to medium term growth opportunity as well as an attractive investment, provided appropriate technological pathways and feedstocks are selected that minimize overall supply-chain and productions costs, further supported by robust policies. In order to pursue this growth potential, careful central planning, de-risking and policy support from the government is required, followed by a radical reformation of the biofuels industry. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Consumption and use of natural resources is a high concerning issue in modern days. Increase in fuel price, limited resources of fossil oil and great concerns on environmental matters has led the researchers and scientists to concerted and escalating research and development efforts in search of renewable and environmental friendly alternative energy sources. In this connection, recent strong demand for renewable fuels has resulted in increased production of biofuels worldwide for solving transportation fuel problems. Currently, biofuels from palm oil is being established as a great source of alternative fuel. Palm oil can be used to produce biodiesel, which is also known as palm oil methyl ester. Palm oil biodiesel is often blended with other fuels to create palm oil biodiesel blends. This paper highlights on biofuel/biodiesel production from palm oil, use, advantages and limitations.

AB  - One of the difficulties of using microalgae for the production of biofuels is the development of an efficient and economically feasible process for oil extraction from these unicellular organisms. Current methodologies involve toxic solvents (such as chloroform, benzene and methanol, among others), high energy requirements and high capital cost. The extraction processes using organic solvents in a Soxhlet apparatus with or without the assistance of ultrasound irradiation have shown promising results. In this context, the main objective of this study was to improve the oil yield of Acutodesmus obliquus using different mixtures of ethanol and hexane. Ethanol to hexane volume ratios of 1:1, 2:1 and 1:2 (vol/vol) were used at 60 °C. The best extraction yield in relation to the total lipid content of the microalgae biomass was 92% for Soxhlet and 59% for ultrasonic irradiation using 1:2 (vol/vol) ethanol:hexane for extraction times of 12 and 2 h, respectively. These extraction yields were significantly better than those of the pure solvents, i.e., 24% and 217% higher than ethanol and hexane via Soxhlet and 55% and 68% higher than the ultrasound-assisted extraction procedure. The ethanol to hexane volume ratio of 1:2 (vol/vol) presented a superior performance in both Soxhlet and ultrasound-assisted extraction procedures by extracting a large amount of polar, non-polar and neutral lipids. Similar yields to the Soxhlet (12 h) with the ethanol:hexane 1:2 (vol/vol) solvent mixture were obtained with ultrasound (for 40 min) followed by Soxhlet (4 h) extraction leading to a reduction of 164% in energy consumption. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rapid decarbonisation of the transport sector calls for increased use of biofuels. Part of the increase may be covered by fuels produced from logging residues, wood chips and round wood. This article addresses the economic potential and possible impacts of increased production of such wood based biofuels on the forest industries and production of wood based heat and power in the European Economic Area. A global model for the markets and trade of forest biomass and products, the EFI-GTM was applied for the analysis. The results indicate, firstly, that policy choices will have strong impacts on the allocation of biomass use between heat and power production and the production of liquid biofuels. Hence, the policy makers must have very clear goal setting for the preferred ways to solve the shift from the fossil fuel based energy system to a less carbon intensive one. Nevertheless, because large investments in biofuel production take time to plan and construct, and because the annual forest growth exceeds the harvests of wood in various parts of Europe, there is time to adjust the policies to control the market development. Secondly, even assuming the goal of limiting the global warming to 2 °C, the European forest industry production is projected to be rather little affected by the increased competition for biomass with the energy sector. This is because the rivalling regions are facing similar biomass demand challenges. Also, the relatively abundant wood biomass resources in Europe help the European forest industry to maintain its market shares. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Businesses employ different strategies to manage legislative requirements; however, there is little science-based understanding of the strategies that are in use. This study introduces a general legislation maturity model for businesses that includes company profiles, strategies and activity levels in relation to legislative requirements. Four strategies, namely defensive, adaptive, proactive and lead, are described through a case study of legislative sustainability requirements for biofuels in the EU that are organised according to their urgency and validity to biofuel producers, and the associated activity levels. This model will help managers to identify the strategies they employ, more systematically select strategies, understand the spatial and temporal scales and more efficiently allocate legislation management resources. The legislation maturity profiles, strategies, activities and urgency-validity framework are applicable in other industries. © Copyright 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The vehicle fleet in the Ceará state has grown 180% over the last ten years. The growth of the resulting emissions is unknown in view of the expansion of this fleet in the greater Fortaleza Metropolitan Area (FMA). The largest fleet in the FMA is in the Fortaleza city itself, where flex fuel vehicles predominate (∼30%). Flex fuel motorcycles increased significantly (greater than 800%) between 2010 and 2015. This paper aims to estimate the road vehicle emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), aldehydes (RCHO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) from the main road vehicle fleets of Fortaleza and its metropolitan area using a macrosimulation, bottom-up method, between 2010 and 2015. The results showed that road vehicle emissions of CO, NMHC and RCHO increased mainly by Otto cycle vehicles increase due to the introduction of flex fuel vehicles; however, the NOx and PM emissions noticeable reduction is also a result of emission policies that seed the introduction of new technologies. In 2015, more than 70,000 tons of CO (21.2 ton/1000person), 8000 tons of NMHC (2.5 ton/1000person), 290 tons of RCHO (0.09 ton/1000person), 15,000 tons of NOx (4.4 ton/1000person) and 600 tons of PM (0.2 ton/1000person) were emitted in the region under study. Comparing with other Brazilian regions, FMA emit higher levels of pollutants per inhabitant than the state of São Paulo and the state of Rio de Janeiro but lower levels than Porto Alegre city. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of commercial-grade nutrients such as agricultural fertilizers is important for commercial microalgae cultivation, and this is particularly the case for biofuel production which is associated with low added value. Nitrogen is a very important macronutrient in microalgae cultivation, and ammonium sources are cheaper than nitrate sources. However, the growth response and cellular composition can be altered by the different nutrient sources. In the study reported here, we investigated the effects of different ammonium doses and commercial-grade macronutrients from agricultural fertilizers on the growth of Scenedesmus sp. BR003, a promising genus for biofuel production. Five growth media were developed using fertilizers and evaluated during Scenedesmus sp. cultivation under autotrophic conditions. The growth media differed in terms of their composition and concentration of macronutrients. We found that all commercial-grade media supported equal or higher cell concentrations, dry weight, water-soluble proteins, neutral carbohydrates, and total lipid production compared to the conventional BG11 medium. However, the commercial-grade growth medium with the highest ammonium content affected the coenobium pattern of Scenedesmus sp. BR003. Commercial-grade nutrient sources were a low-cost alternative to improve the growth of Scenedesmus sp. BR003. The different fertilizers also allowed for manipulation of microalgae chemical composition and phenotypic plasticity to target traits of commercial interest. Our results demonstrate the potential of using ammonium from agricultural fertilizers as a nitrogen source in combination with other commercial-grade macronutrients sources. In addition, this work demonstrates the ability of a robust Scenedesmus strain to grow in media of different compositions, even when a high dosage of ammonium was used. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature and the University of Milan.

AB  - Bioenergy is an effective energy form used by developing countries. It covers about 38% of the energy consumed primarily obtained from the biomass in about 13% of the world. Due to the energy production costs, much attention has currently been paid on alternative bioenergy sources in the developing countries. Biofuels may be used instead of fossil fuels to produce power, heat, and/or some chemicals. Its production with local resources suggests a reproducible alternative streamlining the economic and social improvement in developing countries, in case the bioenergy projects are established economically viable and well planned with local cooperation. Biofuels are important resources which can take place with fossil-based fuels. Generally speaking, biofuels offer several benefits such as the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, regional social and structural development, sustainability in energy provision, and agricultural development. In this study, a life cycle analysis of a full-scale biogas plant was conducted. In the life cycle analysis, the ecological effects of the biogas process, the by-products from the biogas production, and the cogeneration unit where the electricity generation is performed are evaluated quantitatively according to the ISO 14040. The functional unit of the plant was designed for 30 tons per day big cattle manure, 5 tons per day poultry manure, and 15 tons per day cheese whey of industrial biogas plant. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - The dewaterability of sludge from two conventional activated sludge (CAS) and three membrane bioreactor (MBR)-based wastewater treatment plants is investigated prior to and after anaerobic digestion. The concentration and composition of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) mostly affect the dewaterability of all raw sludge samples. Better sludge dewaterability is observed when the concentration of proteins, carbohydrates, uronic acids, and humic acids is below approximately 400, 250, 200, and 40 mg/L, respectively. In contrast, the specific resistance to filtration (SRF) increases in the sludge samples with a higher EPS concentration. The MBR results in a lower EPS production and a uronic acid-dominating EPS composition. This especially affects the dewaterability of one MBR sludge, also characterized by high salinity and a smaller particle size. Anaerobic digestion results in a higher SRF for both CAS and MBR sludge, with the particle-size distribution having the preponderant effect on the digested sludge dewaterability. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Fractionation of bio-oil is in favor of upgrading bio-oil to transport fuel or chemicals. The microalgae Dunaliella tertiolecta was hydrothermally liquefied to form a bio-oil, which was split into two layers during cooling: the lower layer contained organics with relatively high molar mass from 78 to 389 g mol−1, while the super layer with relatively low molar mass from 44 to 121 g mol−1. The lower layer of hydrothermally liquefaction (HTL) bio-oil was further fractionated into ethanol phase (oil 1) and dichloromethane phase (oil 2), and the super layer yielded 1 or 3-4 fractions of extracts (oil 3) via single-stage or multistage liquid-liquid extraction respectively. The compositions of each fraction were analyzed by GC-MS in detail. Dichloromethane, chloroform, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, iso-octanol, petroleum ether, carbon tetrachloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, ethyl acetate were compared in terms of their extraction capabilities to organics of bio-oil. The results indicated the chloroform and dichloromethane have the highest comprehensive extraction capabilities. In multistage extraction, when dichloromethane was used as extractant, the extraction distribution ratio (calculated using COD, chemical oxygen demand) was 0.66 in first-stage, then sharply dropped with an increase in stage number, 2nd∼3rd stage extractions achieved the maximum extraction percentage (approximately 53%). That the optimum combination of chloroform, benzene and 1,1,1-trichloroethane fractionated the super layer of HTL bio-oil can obtain very low oxygen content fraction: hydrocarbons (purity of hydrocarbons: relative content 97.9%) from the 2nd stage of multistage extraction. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fast pyrolysis followed by catalytic hydroconversion is a value chain aimed to transform lignocellulosic biomass into biofuel or chemicals. During hydroconversion, desired catalytic deoxygenation reactions are in competition with thermal side reactions like condensation or oligomerization. These undesired pathways lead to high molecular weight compounds (i.e. macromolecules) that are responsible for catalyst deactivation and severe plugging of the reactor. We investigate here the impact of a phenolic compound on the formation of these macromolecules. Catalytic hydroconversion of a fast pyrolysis bio-oil and a bio-oil/guaiacol (50/50 wt%) mixture were carried out in a batch reactor using a NiMo/alumina catalyst. An extended analytical strategy has been developed involving size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and liquid state 13C NMR dedicated to the in depth characterization of effluents as well as physicochemical analysis of the fresh and used catalyst (XRD, Hg porosimetry, N2 physisorption, STEM). This strategy allowed bringing new insights on aromatic structures larger than 1000 g.mol−1 and their formation mechanism. This formation can be chemically inhibited by the introduction of organic component such as guaiacol. This stabilization was mainly observed and explained at low temperature and short reaction time. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this research, we evaluated the effect of diesetrol fuel blends (comprised of diesel, biodiesel, and ethanol) on diesel engine exhaust emissions. Biodiesel is a clean fuel of vegetable origin produced from the transesterification of waste cooking oil collected from restaurants. So as to ameliorate the properties of the biodiesel combustion such as cetane number, viscosity and cloud point, ethanol was added to it with the obtained ethanol-biodiesel blend added to the diesel. In general, four samples containing different percentages of the three fuels were provided as diesel (100%, 97%, 94% and 91%) and biodiesel (2%, 4% and 6%) and ethanol (1%, 2% and 3%), shown as ExByDz. Full load motor testing was carried out and the engine performance and emission parameters were evaluated at speeds of 1700, 2100, 2500 and 2900 rpm. The results of the experiments showed that using fuel mixture diesetrol, power, and torque of motor did not exactly remain constant, hydrocarbon emissions decreased about 10% and carbon dioxide (CO2) increased around 7% by all diesetrol fuel blends. In general, using D91B6E3 fuel blend, the tested motor had the best efficiency, performance, and emission. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Dairy cattle treated wastewaters are potential resources for production of microalgae biofuels. A study was conducted to evaluate the capability of Arthrospira platensis cultivated in dairy farm wastewater for biodiesel production. The biomass of Arthrospira platensis was found to be 4.98 g L−1 and produced 30.23 wt% lipids to dry biomass cultivated in wastewater which was found nitrogen stressed in photo bioreactor. The extracted lipid displayed a suitable fatty acid profile for biodiesel, although the content of linolenic acid was found a little higher than the standard EN14214. It was found that nitrogen stressed medium increase the total lipid content but temperature and intensities of light were the most important factors to control the quantity of linolenic acid and hence the quality of biodiesel, while the optimum CO2 helped to achieve maximum biomass and triacylglycerols. The Arthrospira platensis offer a good option for the treatment of wastewater before final discharge. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Jatropha curcas Linnaeus (Jatropha curcas L.) seeds have been found to be an ideal sustainable and low-cost source of catalyst and oil feedstock for biodiesel production. Jatropha cake, remained dregs after jatropha curcas oil (JCO) extraction, has been treated by two different techniques; calcination and potassium hydroxide (KOH) activation to be used as novel heterogeneous catalysts for the transesterification reaction. The effect of calcination and KOH activation on the jatropha cake has been characterized. The basic strength and basicity of the catalysts have been determined as well. The effect of different operating conditions has been studied using JCO and waste cooking oil (WCO) to evaluate the efficiency of the catalysts. The catalysts produced higher biodiesel yield using JCO than WCO. In the case of using JCO, the two catalysts produced close biodiesel yield. Calcined jatropha cake (CJC) has been chosen as the optimum catalyst for its better reusability and lower preparation cost than KOH activated jatropha cake (KJC). The optimum operating conditions of the JCO transesterification process has been determined as 60 min reaction time, 6:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, 1 wt.% catalyst loading, 400 rpm and 60 °C. Biodiesel production yield of JCO was achieved to 94 and 96% with CJC and KJC catalysts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The in situ (one-step) acid-catalyzed transesterification step for conversion to biodiesel of biomass from oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica grown on waste cooking oil (WCO) is studied. The process yield of biodiesel was optimized by investigating effects of various parameters, namely, biomass, methanol, chloroform, catalyst, temperature, time and sonication. A Plackett-Burman statistical design of experiments revealed that biomass is the most significant factor influencing biodiesel (FAME, fatty acid methyl ester) production. Subsequently, a one variable design (OVD) of experiments for increased biomass loadings showed higher yields of FAME with no additional requirement of reactants, solvents or special equipment. The biomass grown on WCO had a lipid productivity of 0.042 g L-1 h−1 and 4 g of this loading gave a high FAME yield of 0.88 g in 8 h at 50 °C with methanol: chloroform (10:1) and acid catalyst (0.2 M H2SO4,1.0 ml g−1). The FAME profile had desirable amounts of saturated (32.81%), monounsaturated (36.41%), polyunsaturated (30.59%) methyl esters. The predicted and experimentally determined physico-chemical properties of FAME were found in accordance with specified international standards. Thus, the direct one-pot in situ transesterification reaction using Y. lipolytica biomass grown on WCO provides a high yield of biodiesel with potential applicability while simultaneously addressing the management of this pollutant. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aviation industry is committed to reducing its environmental impact and has established ambitious goals to decrease CO2 emissions by 50% by to 2050. The replacement of fossil fuels by jet-biofuels is one of the main strategies to attain the emission targets. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide a detailed survey on land availability for sugarcane production, one of the most promising feedstock options for jet-biofuels, in the Brazilian state of São Paulo, where the technological resources are concentrated. This analysis was carried out by integrating georeferenced information on land use, protected areas, soil fertility, terrain slope and climatic conditions into a conditional decision support procedure, based on Boolean inference techniques. Our results showed that 3,501,590 ha would be potentially available for sugarcane expansion in the year 2013. Almost 80% of the mapped lands have high economic potential once they are located in a distance lower than or equal to 25 km from the processing units. If properly included in the productive sector, the available lands could increase sugarcane production by 73% in relation to current levels. That could lead to a growth of 147% (20.6 billion liters) in the ethanol production compared to the production obtained in 2015. Nevertheless, long-term policies, logistic improvements and environmental standard definitions on jet-biofuels still remain as major challenges to boost feedstock production, as well as, to implement financial and regulatory measures necessary to promote jet-biofuels production and use. © 2017

AB  - Distillate of upgraded palm biodiesel was blended in different volume percentages (5, 10, 15, and 20%) with jet A-1. The mixture can be used as a replacement for petroleum Jet fuel. Physical properties of blends were measured and compared with those of jet A-1. Empirical equations were developed to predict the properties of blended fuel, including density, kinematic viscosity, freezing point, H/C ratio, and acid value. The statistical analysis indicated that the proposed equations predictions agree well with the experimental data. The predicted model shows an (R2) between 0.99–0.98, indicating good fitting between the experimental data and proposed model. The distillate of upgraded palm biodiesel was miscible with the kerosene jet A-1 in all volume fractions under study 5–20%. The economic analysis shows that the production cost per unit of the produced bio jet fuel was much higher than the selling price of the petroleum jet fuel. This price difference is due to the raw materials cost; as the palm oil used is nearly three times that of crude oil. The economic evaluation study reveals that the operating cost of prepared bio jet equals to 2360 $/ton, which is a promising result. © 2017

AB  - With the non-advanced portion of the US Renewable Fuel Standard having been largely met by corn ethanol, many states are looking to cellulosic crops as the next source of biofuels. In Indiana, attention is turning to biojet fuels and renewable diesel as forming the demand for these crops. This paper seeks to determine the optimal manufacturing site locations and supply chain logistics for the conversion of biomass sources to jet fuel and renewable diesel within Indiana. A sequential start-up model is developed for this application, using a mixed integer non-linear (quadratic) program, in which firms sequentially optimize unit costs by choosing the conversion site location, scale, and feedstocks. The results indicate that firms wish to locate conversion sites near biomass sources as opposed to fuel destinations, and that early entrants to the industry gravitate towards counties rich in corn stover, a less expensive residue. However, even with existing subsidies firms would barely break even. Finally, the benefits of the sequential model are elucidated in contrast to a social planner's model, with the key benefit being that the sequential model can generate supply curves independent of demand levels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The search for beneficial biofuels with positive energy gains and reduced carbon dioxide emissions is a key target of the road transportation sector. This work focuses on alternative fuels for fossil fuel substitution in the transportation sector and we have examined the production of three different types of synthetic fuels: Dimethyl Ether, Synthetic Natural Gas and the diesel fraction of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis products. We analyze different pathways to make green synthetic fuels starting from waste carbon dioxide recovered from various sources and residual biomass. Processes for biofuel production that combine high temperature co-electrolysis in a solid oxide electrolysis cell (supplied with renewable electricity) to a downstream catalytic reactor that upgrades further the electrolysis-derived syngas are investigated. The integrated co-electrolysis catalytic upgrade is a way to “recycle” CO2 to either a gas or liquid fuel depending on the selected catalytic route. We have considered two different sources for waste carbon dioxide recovery: the CO2-rich off-gas of biogas-to-biomethane plants and CO2 that could be available from fossil fuel power plants with carbon capture. Residual biomass is the other CO2 source analyzed in this work. Fuel demand and, the CO2 and renewable electricity resources available on a regional scale have been assessed to develop a case study of synthetic fuels production in Italy. Results show how synfuel production from biogas off-gas and residual biomass allow to cover a limited percentage of the overall fuel demand (ranging from 1.5% to 37% depending on the synfuel), while using carbon dioxide recovered from fossil power plants could potentially provide enough synfuel to cover completely the fuel demand using Dimethyl Ether or Synthetic Natural Gas. However, an increase of renewable electricity would be needed (ranging from 50% to a three-fold increase depending on the synfuel). Finally, the impact of fuel substitution on the overall carbon dioxide emissions has been investigated showing that a complete substitution of fossil fuels using synfuels produced from waste recovered CO2 could lead to an emission reduction of almost 40% with respect to the current fossil fuel dominated scenario. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Jatropha (Jatropha curcas) has been widely touted as a feedstock for biofuel production and way to combat rural poverty. In some cases, using Jatropha for rural economic development has led to unfulfilled expectations and failed programs. I investigated the expectations of an agricultural community in Nigeria toward a Jatropha biodiesel development project initiated by a private university and how community and project leaders perceived the impact of the program’s eventual abandonment. Willingness to adopt the project appeared largely due to its association with the university and expatriate staff. Community leaders’ enthusiastic support resulted in high expectations of poverty alleviation and community improvements. Given the community-perceived slow progress of the project and its ultimate dissolution, the community–university relationship and intra-community relations, including potential disempowerment of community leaders, were affected. The overall impact was, however, mitigated by other university-backed community programs and continued support by community leaders for using Jatropha for development. © 2017 Community Development Society.

AB  - The potential of lipid accumulation by oleaginous yeast Cryptococcus vishniaccii grown on amaranth seed aqueous extract (AAE) media was assessed. Maximum cell biomass productivity of 104 mg/L/h, lipid productivity of 54 mg/L/h, and lipid content of 52.31% were recorded on AAE when carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio increased from 134 to 147 after removal of ammonia nitrogen. The lipid droplet (LD) size (2.32 ± 0.38 μm) was visualized by fluorescence microscopy using Nile red stain indicating maximum accumulated triacylglycerol (TAG) at C:N 147. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profile obtained after transesterification of extracted lipid revealed the presence of palmitic acid (16:0), palmitoleic acid (16:1), stearic acid (18:0), oleic acid (18:1), and linoleic acid (18:2). Data showed the presence of high monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) content (68.17%) depicting improved winter operating conditions of biodiesel. Various quality parameters of biodiesel were evaluated and compared to the American and European biodiesel standards specifications. Based on the lipid productivity, distribution of fatty acids, and evaluated properties obtained; the lipid accumulation by C. vishniaccii utilizing amaranth seeds as substrate could serve as a feasible feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - An economic analysis was performed to determine the economic potential and commercialization barriers of producing renewable gasoline and diesel (RGD) fuel blendstocks via formate-assisted pyrolysis (FAsP) followed by hydrodeoxygenation processes. A process model was simulated using Aspen Plus® to estimate material and energy balances for the conversion of 2000 dry MT per day of pine sawdust. Scenarios were considered for the regeneration of formate salts from either -biomass-derived and natural-gas-derived carbon monoxide. The material and energy balances were used to calculate capital and operating costs of RGD fuel production. An economic model was built using capital and operating costs to estimate the minimum selling price (MSP) of RGD fuel. The MSP of RGD fuels were estimated at $4.58 per gallon of gasoline equivalent (GGE) and $4.80 per GGE for natural gas and biomass-derived CO scenarios, respectively. The total capital investments of these plants were $448 million and $497 million. The feedstock cost was found to be the major cost contributor to the MSP of RGD fuel. Improving FAsP process yields will significantly reduce the production cost of RGD fuel. It has been learned that an increase in deoxygenation of bio-oil in pyrolysis reactor decreases the capital and operating costs of bio-oil upgrading to RGD fuel. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - The significance of mileage to the fruitful operation of a trucking organization cannot be downplayed. Fuel is one of the biggest variable expenses in a trucking wander. An attempt is made in this research to improve the combustion efficiency of a diesel engine for better fuel economy by introducing hydroxy gas which is also called browns gas or HHO gas in the suction line, without compromising performance and emission. Brown’s gas facilitates the air-fuel mixture to ignite faster and efficient combustion. By considering safety and handling issues in automobiles, HHO gas generation by electrolysis of water in the presence of sodium bicarbonate electrolytes (NaHCO3) and usage was explored in this research work over compressed pure hydrogen, due to generation and capacity of immaculate hydrogen as of now confines the application in diesel engine operation. Brown’s gas was utilized as a supplementary fuel in a single-cylinder, four-stroke compression ignition (CI) engine. Experiments were carried out on a constant speed engine at 1500 rpm, result shows at constant HHO flow rate of 0.73 liter per minute (LPM), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) decreases by 7% at idle load to 16% at full load, and increases brake thermal efficiency (BTE) by 8.9% at minimum load to 19.7% at full load. In the dual fuel (diesel +HHO) operation, CO emissions decreases by 19.4, 64.3, and 34.6% at 25, 50, and 75% load, respectively, and unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) emissions decreased by 11.3% at minimum load to 33.5% at maximum load at the expense of NOx emission increases by 1.79% at 75% load and 1.76% at full load than neat diesel operation. The negative impact of an increase in NOx is reduced by adding EGR. It was evidenced in this experimental work that the use of Brown’s gas with EGR in the dual fuel mode in a diesel engine improves the fuel efficiency, performance, and reduces the exhaust emissions. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Energy shortage, global warming, and climate changes call for the creation and breakthroughs of renewable and sustainable energy technologies, and thus biofuels from microalgae have been the object of ever-increasing interest. Microalgal biodiesel production presents as one of the promising options for biofuel production, since most microalgal species contain rich lipids. However, large amounts of residues are left behind after microalgal biodiesel production. In an effort to improve the potential economics of microalgal biofuels, it is essential to make full use of microalgal post-extracts. This Focus Article determines the theoretical yields of microalgal biodiesel and biomethane together with the relevant calorific values during the continuous production. Based on the investigated species, the microalgal biodiesel and biomethane yields widely range from 6 to 134 g/kg-VS and from 0.24 to 0.63 L/g-VS, respectively, while the total calorific values experience the range of between 6.88 and 18.80 MJ/kg-VS. Microalgal biodiesel production is not always required before anaerobic digestion, especially for those microalgal species with low lipid contents. Net energy ratio and cost-effectiveness analysis are highlighted in order to evaluate the viability of the biorefinery process. Well-funded research and development programs can help develop technologies and policies, thus driving the industry toward prosperity. WIREs Energy Environ 2018, 7:e273. doi: 10.1002/wene273.

AB  - Studies on the environmental analysis of biofuels by fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing (BFPH) have so far focused only on the environmental impacts from direct emissions and have included few indirect emissions. The influence of ignoring some indirect emissions on the environmental performance of BFPH has not been well investigated and hence is not really understood. In addition, in order to avoid shifting environmental problems from one medium to another, a comprehensive assessment of environmental impacts caused by the processes must quantify the environmental emissions to all media (air, water, and land) in relation to each life cycle stage. A well-to-wheels assessment of the total environmental impacts resulting from direct emissions and indirect emissions of a BFPH system with corn stover is conducted using a hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) model combining the economic input–output LCA and the process LCA. The Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other environmental Impacts (TRACI) has been used to estimate the environmental impacts in terms of acidification, eutrophication, global climate change, ozone depletion, human health criteria, photochemical smog formation, ecotoxicity, human health cancer, and human health noncancer caused by 1 MJ biofuel production. Taking account of all the indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the net GHG emissions (81.8 g CO2 eq/MJ) of the biofuels are still less than those of petroleum-based fuels (94 g CO2 eq/MJ). Maize production and pyrolysis and hydroprocessing make major contributions to all impact categories except the human health criteria. All impact categories resulting from indirect emissions except eutrophication and smog air make more than 24% contribution to the total environmental impacts. Therefore, the indirect emissions are important and cannot be ignored. Sensitivity analysis has shown that corn stover yield and bio-oil yield affect the total environmental impacts of the biofuels more significantly than the biomass transportation distance and biofuel transportation distance.

AB  - In this study, the experimental optimization of ultrasound assisted biodiesel production in presence of heterogeneous catalyst was investigated. Three catalysts namely; CaO, calcined dolomite and calcium diglyceroxide (CaDG) were taken into account for comparative purpose. D-optimal experimental plan was applied to obtain regression models which were subsequently used for the detection of optimum process conditions. Maximum biodiesel yields were calculated as 98.7%, 95.9% and 86.3% for CaO, calcined dolomite and CaDG respectively. Furthermore, supplemental experiments were conducted around optimum process conditions to test the validity of the regression models and to refine the optimum results. Finally, in the case of CaO catalyst, maximum biodiesel yield (99.4%) was obtained at the following conditions; catalyst loading: 5.35% (wt.of oil), methanol/oil ratio: 7.48, ultrasonic power: 40 W, time: 150 min, and reaction temperature: 60 °C. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - N-butanol, as a biofuel, could be one kind of engine fuel to relieve energy crisis and reduce particle emission. In this paper, n-butanol was applied to a spark-ignition engine equipped with dual-injection system. Three different fuel injection approaches were tried, including direct injection of gasoline and n-butanol with different volume mixing ratio (GNDI), n-butanol intake port injection combined with gasoline direct injection (N-GxDI) and gasoline intake port injection combined with n-butanol direct injection (G-NxDI), and finally the best method was recommended based on combustion and particle emission characteristics. Experiments were conducted under stoichiometric and rich mixture (excess air coefficient was at 0.9) condition to obviously present particle emission characteristics, including particle number (PN), particle matter (PM) and particle distribution. The results indicated that with the rising of n-butanol blending volume ratio (NBr) for GDNI, indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) increased firstly and decreased afterward, total particle matter (TPM) decreased constantly, however, total particle number (TPN) and nucleation mode particle number (NPN) dropt first and then rose, accumulation mode particle number (APN) increased continuously. 20% was regarded as the best NBr, because it had the highest IMEP, TPN could be decreased by 8.63%, and TPM could be decreased by 30.88% compared with GDI under stoichiometric condition; With the increasing of fuel (gasoline or n-butanol) direct injection ratio (DIr) for G-NxDI and N-GxDI, IMEP decreased constantly, TPM increased continually, however, TPN and NPN both decreased firstly and increased afterward, APN increased endlessly. There was also one best DIr to achieve the lowest TPN; Comparing three injection approaches, N-GxDI with 40% DIr was the best, because it owned the lowest TPN which was decreased by 51.07% and TPM could almost be ignored compared with GDI under stoichiometric condition. However, this approach had to sacrifice 1% decrease of IMEP compared with pure gasoline intake port injection, while the value was still above GDI. © 2017

AB  - The effects of blended additive on properties of bio oil were investigated by adding n-butanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethyl acetate to bio-oil. The blended additive, which consisted of 2.421 wt% n-butanol, 2.327 wt% DMSO and 3.252 wt% ethyl acetate, was obtained through simplex lattice of mixture design. A 24 h aging experiment at 80 °C revealed that blended additive can improve bio-oil stability, and the effect of the blended additive was superior to that of a single additive. The viscosity of the bio-oil containing optimal blended additive was 8.21 mm2/s, whereas that of a single additive ranged within 8.89–9.78 mm2/s. During the long aging process (12, 24, 36 and 48 h), the increase in viscosity and water content of the blank group was larger than that of the control group. Thermo–gravimetric analysis (TGA) results showed that the residual mass fraction of the bio-oil rose with aging time, and the trend increase of blank was larger than that of control. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometer (GC–MS) findings showed that the content of phenols was highest in bio-oil samples and decreased with increasing aging duration. The total contents of ketones, aldehyde and furans diminished with aging time. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, microalgae digestate and secondary effluent were used to grow microalgae in a tertiary wastewater treatment, and then, the biomass was co-digested for biogas generation. A 30 L closed-photobioreactor was used for microalgae cultivation. The biomass, mainly composed by Scenedesmus sp., reached and maintained a concentration of 1.1 gTSS/L during 30 days. A complete removal of N-NH4+ and P-PO43− and high nitrates and organic matter removals were achieved (58% N-NO3− and 70% COD) with 8 d of HRT. The potential biogas production of the cultivated microalgae was determined in batch tests. To improve their biodegradability, a novel method combining their co-digestion with activated sludge after a simultaneous autohydrolysis co-pretreatment was evaluated. After the co-pretreatment, the methane yield increased by 130%. Thus, integrating microalgae tertiary treatment into activated sludge systems is a promising and feasible solution to recover energy and nutrients from waste, improving wastewater treatment plants sustainability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this paper is to investigate the heating behavior of biomass materials under microwave pyrolysis process. A detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed based on the finite volume method using ANSYS CFX (14.0) software to describe the heat and mass transfer during the microwave processing of biomass pellets. The article presents a modeling approach for incorporating the basic fundamentals of microwave pyrolysis process in the form of source terms for mass, momentum, heat and species into the general transport equations for nitrogen and volatiles in the gas phase and wood and bio-char in the solid phase. The model covers the complex coupling between several key elements of the process including microwave heating, pyrolysis kinetics, phase change, rapid variation in mixture properties and gas phase transport. The developed CFD model is validated through the experimental trials in a custom-built microwave pyrolysis unit. The model predicts the maximum temperature, temperature rates and temperature profiles during the process. Close agreement is obtained between the results obtained from the experiments and simulations. It was found that the biomass temperature is affected by the microwave absorbed power which is a function of biomass mixture properties and the released volatile during the process. The results also indicated that increase in microwave power level increases the maximum obtained temperature; however, the amount of absorbed power within the material decreases significantly in higher temperature levels. As temperature and power requirement are vital factors in making microwave processing viable, a useful CFD tool that provides this information could be invaluable for industry. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The efficiency of cyanobacterial strains as biodiesel feedstock varies with the dwelling habitat. Fourteen indigenous heterocystous cyanobacterial strains from rice field ecosystem were screened based on growth kinetic and fuel parameters. The highest biomass productivity was obtained in Nostoc punctiforme MBDU 621 (19.22 mg/L/day) followed by Calothrix sp. MBDU 701 (13.43 mg/L/day). While lipid productivity and lipid content was highest in Nostoc spongiaeforme MBDU 704 (4.45 mg/L/day and 22.5% dwt) followed by Calothrix sp. MBDU 701 (1.54 mg/L/day and 10.75% dwt). Among the tested strains, Nostoc spongiaeforme MBDU 704 and Nostoc punctiforme MBDU 621 were selected as promising strains for good quality biodiesel production by Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) and Graphical Analysis for Interactive Assistance (GAIA) analysis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The paper experimentally investigates the performance and exhaust emissions of a variable compression ratio engine fueled with 100%, 90%, 70% and 50% Jatropha bio-diesel and turpentine oil. In this paper, highly viscous Jatropha biodiesel is blended with relatively low viscosity turpentine oil in various proportions resulting in effective viscosity comparable with that of standard diesel with a view to developing a new alternative fuel which is comparable equally cost effective and eliminates dependency on conventional diesel fuel. Experimental analysis is carried out on ATE Make VCRE_MF single cylinder, naturally aspired, four stroke, and variable compression ratio diesel engine to study combustion performance and emission properties via conventional diesel fuel and different blends of Jatropha biodiesel with turpentine oil. Dual biofuel blend is found to be the greatest substitute to fossil (diesel) fuel in all aspects such as emissions and performance. Experiments have been accompanied at CR (compression ratio) of 15.5:1, 17:1, 18.5:1 and 20:1. Further, dual biofuel blend (JBT 50) resulted at full load and compression ratio 20, there was 2.17% increase in brake thermal efficiency and 13.04%, 17.5%, 4.21% and 30.8% decrease in CO, HC and NOx and smoke opacity respectively while CO2 was observed to increase by 11.04% respectively. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work evaluated the growth potential, lipid productivities and the fatty acids methyl esters profiles of 6 chlorophytes and 6 cyanobacteria isolated from the northeast of Brazil, aiming to predict the quality of the biodiesel that could be produced from these microalgae. Among the chlorophytes, Chlorella sp. (D101Z) stood out as having the greatest daily cell division rate (2.42 d−1). Among the cyanobacteria examined, the species Synechocystis sp. (M3C) and Synechococcus nidulans (D109WC) showed elevated lipid (54.2 and 93.8 mg L−1 d−1 respectively) and biomass productivities (0.39 and 0.69 g L−1 d−1 respectively). The lipids produced by the chlorophytes were mainly saturated, monounsaturated, and tri-unsaturated esters, while the cyanobacteria produced high levels of saturated esters and fatty acids with different degrees of unsaturation. Statistical analyses indicated D101Z and D109WC as promising species, as they showed high lipid productivity and the biodiesel produced from their lipids demonstrated low cold filter clogging point values, with a low iodine index for D101Z; the rather high iodine index of D109WC, however, disqualified it for biodiesel production purposes. Among the species studied, only the chlorophyte Monoraphidium contortum (D173WC) and the cyanobacteria D109WC did not meet all of the quality specifications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The chromium polluted water hyacinth was subjected to pyrolysis to understand its pyrolytic characteristic in a fixed bed. The results indicated that chromium has a positive effect on the bio-oil produced, accompanied by a decrease of gas yield and moderate formation of char. The maximum bio-oil yield obtained from Cr-WH pyrolysis reached the maximum of 63.1 wt.%. The acid number and high heating value of the Cr-WH pyrolytic bio-oil were 85.04 mgKOH/g and 26.72 MJ/kg, respectively. GC-MS analysis of the bio-oils showed that the amount of nitrogenous compounds, alcohols and phenols increased, while the number of esters reduced in the Cr-WH pyrolytic bio-oil which indicated that chromium promoted bond rupture of lignin and changed the degradation process of protein. Furthermore, after pyrolysis, Cr may transfer from the toxic state of ions into an amorphous state in the char, which reduce its harm to the environment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The potential ecological impacts of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), as a biofuel feedstock, have been assessed under different environmental conditions. However, limited information is available in understanding the integrated analysis of nitrogen (N) dynamics including soil nitrate ((Formula presented.)), nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and (Formula presented.) leaching under switchgrass land management. The specific objective was to explore N dynamics for 2009 through 2015 in switchgrass seeded to a marginally yielding cropland based on treatments of N fertilization rate (N rate; low, 0; medium, 56; high, 112 kg N ha−1) and landscape position (shoulder, backslope, and footslope). Our findings indicated that N rate impacted soil (Formula presented.) (0–5 cm depth) and surface N2O fluxes but did not impact (Formula presented.) leaching during the observed years. Medium N (56 kg N ha−1) was the optimal rate for increasing biomass yield with reduced environmental problems. Landscape position impacted the N dynamics. At the footslope position, soil (Formula presented.), soil (Formula presented.) leaching, and N2O fluxes were higher than the other landscape positions. Soil N2O fluxes and (Formula presented.) leaching had downward trends over the observed years. Growing switchgrass on marginally yielding croplands can store soil N, reduce N losses via leaching, and mitigate N2O emissions from soils to the atmosphere over the years. Switchgrass seeded on marginally yielding croplands can be beneficial in reducing N losses and can be grown as a sustainable bioenergy crop on these marginal lands. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The main aim was to integrate FW-recycling with cultivation of Rhodotorula glutinis and anaerobic digestion (AD) for bio-energy and -fuel recovery. Mixed FW was mechanically macerated (Pcon) and hydrolysed (at 250 g L−1 water) via chemical (Ch), thermal (Th) and TCh (combined Ch and Th) treatments. Cleared hydrolysates from individual pre-treatment processes were used as culture medium for cultivation of R. glutinis, while the residual solids (RS) were subjected to AD. Pcon cultivation yielded maximal R. glutinis dry weight biomass (5.18 g L−1) and total fatty acid contents (1.03 g g−1 DWbiomass). Dominant fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were Palmitic – (C16:0–26%); Stearic – (C18:0–17%) and Oleic acids (C18:1–38%), ideal for bio-diesel production. Highest methane yields (actual ∼0.139 m3 kg−1 volatile solids) were measured from AD of Th-derived RS. Thus integrated FW recycling approaches will be more feasible for generating energy and economic incentives. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Diversification of energy sources in the road transport sector is becoming a global trend with the emergence of economically and technologically viable alternative fuels, such as electricity, biofuels, compressed natural gas, and others. With the transport sector generating over 50% of global oil demand, this trend obviously holds great significance. The Russian Federation, while being one of the world's major oil producers as well as energy consumers, is falling behind on this trend. However, the prospects for change are quite tangible. The article presents a long term outlook for changes in the Russian road transportation sector's fuel mix. The calculations demonstrate that switching to natural gas and electricity will reduce the share of petroleum products from 95% in 2015 to 74–86% by 2040. Nevertheless, the extent of support by the Russian Government for the infrastructural development will be the key factor to determine the end result. The incentives for natural gas and electric vehicles will also play a large role. The issue of fuel mix diversification will have to be resolved against the background of a 75% increase in the sector's energy consumption, expected in the next 20 yr. Petrol will remain a key fuel for transportation but its share will decrease from 59 to 40-47%, while the share of diesel will remain at 34-39%. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 37: 498–504, 2018. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog.

AB  - Abstract: Catalytic cracking of vegetable oils is an alternative method for the production of biofuels. The use of catalysts such as MCM-41 with zirconium results in the presence of acid sites that favor the cracking reactions, where their catalytic activity can be evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis. The present work aimed to prepare and determine the physicochemical properties of a catalyst based on MCM-41 incorporated with different percentages of zirconium. The materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, adsorption and desorption of N2, energy-dispersive X-ray, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermogravimetry (DTG). In addition, their catalytic behavior has been evaluated in the catalytic cracking of sunflower oil, through the TG/DTG/DSC thermal analysis techniques. The amount of the zirconium oxide incorporated into MCM-41 support has not destroyed the typical structure of MCM-41, and the insertion promoted a change to the pore diameter and pore volume, indicating the presence of oxide inside the pores and on the external area. All catalysts developed activity in sunflower oil cracking, even at low percentage of ZrO2, especially the Zr2-MCM-41 sample, which obtained more efficiency. Thus, all catalysts are promising for use in cracking, and thermogravimetric analysis has been proved effective for monitoring the catalytic activity. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Due to the increasing amount of polyurethane waste, chemical recycling of these materials is a topic of growing interest for many researchers. The primary purpose of polyurethane feedstock recycling is to recover the starting polyol. In this study glycerolysis using glycerine from two sources and two purity grades is proposed as a method of chemical recycling. The main effort of this paper focuses on the employment of commercial glycerine of analytical grade and waste glycerine without purification derived from the biodiesel production, as a decomposing agent for polyurethane recycling. In this study, the influence of polyurethane to glycerine mass ratio (PU/GL) and the type of decomposing agent on the chemical structure by FTIR, 1H NMR and GPC was examined. FTIR analysis of the glycerolysates showed absorption peaks similar to the virgin polyol. Those results are in compliance with GPC chromatograms, which showed for all samples, well-defined peak at ca. 13 min of retention time. The molecular weight of glycerolysates was ranging from 800 to 1300 g mol−1 depending on PU/GL mass ratio. The novel decomposition agent, namely waste glycerine derived from biodiesel production was successfully used in glycerolysis process. © 2017, The Author(s).
