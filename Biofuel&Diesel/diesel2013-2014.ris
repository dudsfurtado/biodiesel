AB  - Commonly considered strategies for reducing the environmental impact of light-duty transportation include using alternative fuels and improving vehicle fuel economy. We evaluate the air qualityrelated human health impacts of 10 such options, including the use of liquid biofuels, diesel, and compressed natural gas (CNG) in internal combustion engines; the use of electricity from a range of conventional and renewable sources to power electric vehicles (EVs); and the use of hybrid EV technology. Our approach combines spatially, temporally, and chemically detailed life cycle emission inventories; comprehensive, fine-scale state-of-the-science chemical transport modeling; and exposure, concentration-response, and economic health impact modeling for ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). We find that powering vehicles with corn ethanol or with coal-based or "grid average" electricity increases monetized environmental health impacts by 80% or more relative to using conventional gasoline. Conversely, EVs powered by lowemitting electricity from natural gas, wind, water, or solar power reduce environmental health impacts by 50% or more. Consideration of potential climate change impacts alongside the human health outcomes described here further reinforces the environmental preferability of EVs powered by low-emitting electricity relative to gasoline vehicles.

AB  - Biofuels, especially biodiesels derived from renewable sources, are becoming increasingly important because of environmental and energy concerns. However, biodiesels composed of long chain unsaturated fatty acid esters are prone to oxidation. One such biodiesel is non-edible high acid value Calophyllum inophyllum oil-based biodiesel produced through a two-stage esterification process and one-stage transesterification process. In this study, the oxidation stability of biodiesel treated with three prominent antioxidants, namely pyrogallol, propyl gallate and tert-butylhydroxyquinone was evaluated. The induction period of biodiesel with or without antioxidant was measured according to the EN14112 standard using a Rancimat instrument. Antioxidants were added at 500 ppm, which in general improved the induction period. The samples were kept for 70 days and different properties that change during storage, namely induction period, density and kinematic viscosity were monitored. For all samples, oxidation stability decreased and kinematic viscosity increased because of the formation of oxidation products. Pyrogallol showed the best effect in retaining oxidation stability of Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel. © W. S. Maney &Son Ltd 2014.

AB  - Speciated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were measured in diesel exhaust from three heavy-duty trucks equipped with modern aftertreatment technologies. Emissions testing was conducted on a chassis dynamometer at two ambient temperatures (-7 and 22 °C) operating on two fuels (ultra low sulfur diesel and 20% soy biodiesel blend) over three driving cycles: cold start, warm start and heavy-duty urban dynamometer driving cycle. VOCs were measured separately for each drive cycle. Carbonyls such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde dominated VOC emissions, making up ∼72% of the sum of the speciated VOC emissions (ΣVOCs) overall. Biodiesel use led to minor reductions in aromatics and variable changes in carbonyls. Cold temperature and cold start conditions caused dramatic enhancements in VOC emissions, mostly carbonyls, compared to the warmer temperature and other drive cycles, respectively. Different 2007+ aftertreatment technologies involving catalyst regeneration led to significant modifications of VOC emissions that were compound-specific and highly dependent on test conditions. A comparison of this work with emission rates from different diesel engines under various test conditions showed that these newer technologies resulted in lower emission rates of aromatic compounds. However, emissions of other toxic partial combustion products such as carbonyls were not reduced in the modern diesel vehicles tested. © This article not subject to U.S. Copyright.

AB  - Biofuels are proposed to play an important role in several mitigation strategies to meet future CO2 emission targets for the transport sector but remain controversial due to significant uncertainties in net impacts on environment, society, and climate. A switch to biofuels can also affect short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), which provide significant contributions to the net climate impact of transportation. We quantify the radiative forcing (RF) and global-mean temperature response over time to EU on-road fossil diesel SLCFs and the impact of 20% (B20) and 100% (B100) replacement of fossil diesel by biodiesel. SLCFs are compared to impacts of on-road CO2 using different approaches from existing literature to account for biodiesel CO2. Given the best estimates for changes in emissions when replacing fossil diesel with biodiesel, the net positive RF from EU on-road fossil diesel SLCFs of 3.4 mW/m2 is reduced by 15% and 80% in B20 and B100, respectively. Over time the warming of SLCFs is likely small compared to biodiesel CO2 impacts. However, SLCFs may be relatively more important for the total warming than in the fossil fuel case if biodiesel from feedstock with very short rotation periods and low land-use-change impacts replaces a high fraction of fossil diesel. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biomass-derived chemical products may offer reduced environmental impacts compared to their fossil-derived counterparts and could improve profit margins at biorefineries when coproduced with higher-volume, lower-profit margin biofuels. It is important to assess on a life-cycle basis the energy and environmental impacts of these bioproducts as compared to conventional, fossil-derived products. We undertook a life-cycle analysis of eight bioproducts produced from either algal-derived glycerol or corn stover-derived sugars. Selected on the basis of technology readiness and market potential, the bioproducts are propylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, acrylic acid, polyethylene, succinic acid, isobutanol, and 1,4-butanediol. We developed process simulations to obtain energy and material flows in the production of each bioproduct and examined sensitivity of these flows to process design assumptions. Conversion process data for fossil-derived products were based on the literature. Conversion process data were combined with upstream parameters in the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model to generate life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fossil energy consumption (FEC) for each bioproduct and its corresponding petroleum-derived product. The bioproducts uniformly offer GHG emissions reductions compared to their fossil counterparts ranging from 39 to 86% on a cradle-to-grave basis. Similarly, FEC was lower for bioproducts than for conventional products. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The extensive use of fossil fuels is increasingly recognized as unsustainable as a consequence of depletion of supplies and the contribution of these fuels to climate change by GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions into the atmosphere. Microalgae indicate alternative renewable sustainable energy sources as they have a high potential for producing large amounts of biomass which in turn can be used for production of different third-generation biofuels at large scale. Microalgae transform the solar energy into the carbon storage products, leads to lipid accumulation, including TAG (triacylglycerols), which then can be transformed into biodiesel, bioethanol and biomethanol. This paper reviews the selection, production and accumulation of target bioenergy carrier's strains and their advantages as well as the technological development for oil, biodiesel, ethanol, methanol, biogas production and GHG mitigation. The feedstock of promising algal strain exhibits the suitable biofuel production. The current progress of hybrid-technologies (biomass production, wastewater treatment, GHG mitigation) for production of prime-products as biofuels offer atmospheric pollution control such as the reduction of GHG (CO2 fixation) coupling wastewater treatment with microalgae growth. The selection of efficient strain, microbial metabolism, cultivation systems, biomass production are key parameters of viable technology for microalgae-based biodiesel-production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The numerous challenges associated with declining fossil fuel reserves as energy sources, have accounted for a shift to biofuels as alternatives. However, transesterification of animal fats and edible vegetable oils using homogeneous acids and bases for biodiesel production is recently considered unsustainable by industries, particularly due to food versus fuel competition, and economic and environmental challenges associated with the feedstocks and catalyst systems, respectively. The paper therefore presents a critical review on the prospects of non-edible oil (i.e. algae oil) for biodiesel production via heterogeneous catalysis. It covers the advantages of algae oil exploitation over edible oil feedstocks, progress made in the oil extraction, available heterogeneous catalyst systems and reaction mechanisms, optimum transesterification conditions and the way forward. As the economic feasibility of biodiesel production from algae is supported by the valorization of glycerol as by-product, we have also highlighted key available heterogeneous catalysts to upgrade glycerol into more useful industrial products. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study describes algal biofuel production, bioelectricity generation and wastewater treatment using Leptolyngbya sp. JPMTW1 (KF977831). The experiments were conducted in an AMFC (Algal Microbial Fuel Cell) photobioreactor (single-chamber). The pH, EC (electrical conductivity), COD (chemical oxygen demand) and TDS (total dissolved solids) decreased from 8.01 to 7.0, 982 to 854 (mS/cm), 255 to 112 (mg/L) and 490-427 (mg/L), respectively, over course of 7 days. Biomass production, rate of biomass production, chlorophyll a, b and "total chlorophyll" content increased with increasing time and were observed to be 3300 mg/L, 471.42mg/L/day, 0.981 mg/L, 0.173 mg/L and 1.156mg/L after 7 days. Lipid production and rate of lipid production were 1068.383 mg/g dry wt. biomass and 152.62mg/g dry biomass/day. FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) spectra revealed the presence of protein, lipid, FAs (fatty acids), triglycerides and ester functional groups. FAME (fatty acid methyl esters) profile revealed the presence of C16:0, C18:2n-6, C18:1 and C16:1. The generation of electric potential by Leptolyngbya sp. JPMTW1 increased significantly (p≤0.05) from 0.0211 to 0.264 mV within 7 days. The maximum power density (0.008 mW/cm2) was obtained at cell potential at 12mV. This study shows that simultaneous production of biofuel, bioelectricity and wastewater treatment is possible by Leptolyngbya sp. JPMTW1.

AB  - Alcohols (not only ethanol but also methanol, propanol, butanol and pentanol) are receiving increasing attention as components for blending with conventional fuels (gasoline and diesel or biodiesel fuels) because they can be an efficient means to increase the renewable fraction of fuels and to reduce emissions. Mathematical models for predicting evaporation losses in storage and fuel distribution systems require information about diffusion coefficients, among other characteristic parameters of the alcohols and of the alcohol-air gaseous mixtures. Nine equations in the literature have been described and applied to the binary gaseous mixtures alcohol-air to estimate the diffusion coefficient. Other equations were discarded because they are not applicable to alcohol-air systems. The resulting diffusion coefficients were plotted against temperature for the five mentioned alcohols, and the results were compared with experimental data obtained from measurements with capillary glass tubes immersed in a controlled temperature glycerine bath at 25 °C, 30 °C, 40 °C and 50 °C. The diffusion coefficients were determined from the variation of the height of the liquid column and the vapour pressure. From comparing the standard deviations with respect to the experimental data, although the best fit for all alcohols was reached with the Arnold equation (0.0247 cm 2/s), it was concluded that there is not a unique optimal formula for all alcohols. Additionally, all the revised equations underestimate the effect of temperature for methanol, ethanol and propanol. Specific logarithmic equations were proposed in this work for estimating the diffusion coefficient for each alcohol, and finally, a four-parameter equation was also proposed for the five alcohols studied, which provided excellent agreement (standard deviation 0.0045 cm2/s). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The obtaining of Ecodiesel, a biofuel applicable to diesel engines which keeps the glycerin as monoglyceride (MG), was achieved through a selective ethanolysis process of sunflower oil, by application of Lipozyme RM IM, a Rhizomucor miehei lipase immobilized on macroporous anion exchange resins. This biocatalyst that was already described in the synthesis of conventional biodiesel has also shown its efficiency in the present selective enzymatic process, after optimization of the influence of various reaction parameters. Thus, an adequate activity is obtained that is maintained throughout five successive reuses. Quantitative conversions of triglycerides (TG) with high yields to fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) were obtained under mild reaction conditions that correspond to the transformation of TG in a mixture of two moles of FAEE and a mole of MG, thus avoiding the glycerol production. Thus, the selective transesterification reaction of sunflower oil with absolute ethanol can be carried out under standard conditions with oil/ethanol volume ratio 12/3.5. (mL), at constant pH obtained by the addition of 50. μl of aqueous solution of 10. N NaOH, reaction temperature of 40C and 40. mg of Lipozyme RM IM. Under these experimental conditions six successive reactions can be efficiently carried out. © 2014 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of bioethanol and gasoline as a premixed injection source on the combustion performance and exhaust emissions characteristics of a dual-fuel combustion engine. The ignition source of dual-fuel combustion was biodiesel derived from soybean oil. The premixing ratio was calculated based on the total input energy and was varied from 0.2 through 0.8. Experiments were conducted using a single cylinder diesel engine with a re-entrant geometry type combustion chamber.Experimental results show that dual-fuel combustion has a higher maximum combustion pressure (Pmax), shorter ignition delay, significantly lower NOx and soot emission, but it has higher HC and CO emission when compared to single-fuel combustion. In a comparison of bioethanol and gasoline during dual-fuel combustion, biodiesel-bioethanol dual-fuel combustion showed lower Pmax, longer ignition delay, and higher IMEP than biodiesel-gasoline dual-fuel combustion. The increase in the premixing ratio for both dual-fuel combustion modes increased the ignition delay and IMEP, and decreased Pmax. With the increase in the premixing ratio, fuel consumption increased during biodiesel-gasoline dual-fuel combustion, but decreased during biodiesel-bioethanol dual-fuel combustion. NOx significantly decreased during biodiesel-bioethanol dual-fuel combustion; however, biodiesel-gasoline dual-fuel combustion had a limited effect on NOx reduction. HC and CO emissions were increased by bioethanol or gasoline premixing. The biodiesel-bioethanol dual-fuel combustion mode showed higher HC emission than the biodiesel-gasoline dual-fuel combustion mode, and the CO emission level was similar in both combustion modes. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Alcohols (not only ethanol but also methanol, propanol, butanol and pentanol) are receiving increasing attention as components for blending with conventional fuels (gasoline and diesel or biodiesel fuels) because they can be an efficient means to increase the renewable fraction of fuels and to reduce emissions. Mathematical models for predicting evaporation losses in storage and fuel distribution systems require information about diffusion coefficients, among other characteristic parameters of the alcohols and of the alcohol-air gaseous mixtures. Nine equations in the literature have been described and applied to the binary gaseous mixtures alcohol-air to estimate the diffusion coefficient. Other equations were discarded because they are not applicable to alcohol-air systems. The resulting diffusion coefficients were plotted against temperature for the five mentioned alcohols, and the results were compared with experimental data obtained from measurements with capillary glass tubes immersed in a controlled temperature glycerine bath at 25 °C, 30 °C, 40 °C and 50 °C. The diffusion coefficients were determined from the variation of the height of the liquid column and the vapour pressure. From comparing the standard deviations with respect to the experimental data, although the best fit for all alcohols was reached with the Arnold equation (0.0247 cm2/s), it was concluded that there is not a unique optimal formula for all alcohols. Additionally, all the revised equations underestimate the effect of temperature for methanol, ethanol and propanol. Specific logarithmic equations were proposed in this work for estimating the diffusion coefficient for each alcohol, and finally, a four-parameter equation was also proposed for the five alcohols studied, which provided excellent agreement (standard deviation 0.0045 cm2/s). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper addresses the techno-economic analysis of the propane aromatization process, by adopting a novel kinetics-to-process approach. The recent interest in this technological route derives from the development of new third generation biorefinery concepts, in which, algal oil is subjected to catalytic hydrodeoxygenation processes for the production of (Hydrotreated Renewable Jet) HRJ fuels. Beside biofuels, co-production of large amounts of propane is observed, which can be upgraded by a catalytic conversion to aromatics on zeolites. Kinetic studies of propane aromatization over H-ZSM-5 zeolite in a wide range of conversions are reported in the literature. Based on these results, a general kinetic model of propane aromatization has been developed. The revised kinetic scheme is then embedded in a process simulation, performed with the commercial code SimSci PRO/II by Schneider Electric. Basing on the process simulation and on available price assessments, a techno-economic analysis has been performed to show limits as well as potentialities of the proposed layout. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The plantations of oil-bearing trees and conversion of their vegetable oils to biodiesel have positive impacts on the agricultural, rural and national economies as well as being a partial solution to the energy scarcity. In India, many oil-bearing tree plantations including jatropha, karanja, palm and polong have already been established, mostly at a small farm’ levels with direct and indirect assistance from the private and government sectors. In this study, the private financial sustainability of karanja, palm and soapnut plantations has been studied through private discounted cash flow analysis and an attempt has been made to evaluate the production cost of these pure plant oils (PPOs) and biodiesels from an Indian prospective. The net present value from karanja, palm and soapnut plantations is estimated at INR 226000/ha, INR 261000/ha and INR 173000/ha respectively, for a plantation project life of 15 years under average yield conditions. The estimated payback period on the investment is 6 years for karanja plantation and 7 years for palm and soapnut plantations. The production costs of PPO and biodiesels for karanja, palm and soapnut are estimated to be INR 47.33/kg and INR 51.44/kg, INR 42.80/kg and INR 46.67/kg, and INR 45.66/kg and INR 49.68/kg, respectively. The estimated production costs of these PPO crops indicate that they can compete financially with petrodiesel to meet the mandatory blending requirement in transportation sector of India. © 2014, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.

AB  - Background: Novozym 435, a commercial lipase from Candida antarctica, recombinant, expressed in Aspergillus niger, immobilized on macroporous acrylic resin, has been already described in the obtention of biodiesel. It is here evaluated in the production of a new biofuel that integrates the glycerol as monoglyceride (MG) together with two fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) molecules by the application of 1,3-selective lipases in the ethanolysis reaction of sunflower oil. Results: Response surface methodology (RSM) is employed to estimate the effects of main reaction. Optimum conditions for the viscosity, selectivity, and conversion were determined using a multifactorial design of experiments with three factors run by the software Stat Graphics version XV.I. The selected experimental parameters were reaction temperature, oil/ethanol ratio and alkaline environment. On the basis of RSM analysis, the optimum conditions for synthesis were 1/6 oil/EtOH molar ratio, 30°C, and 12.5 μl of NaOH 10 N aqueous solutions, higher stirring than 300 rpm, for 2 h and 0.5 g of biocatalyst. Conclusions: These obtained results have proven a very good efficiency of the biocatalyst in the studied selective process. Furthermore, it was allowed sixteen times the successive reuse of the biocatalyst with good performance. © 2014 Luna et al.

AB  - Background: Limonene is an important monoterpene used as a chemical commodity and precursor for producing biofuels, flavor and medicinal compounds. Results: In this paper, we engineered Escherichia coli by embedding two exogenous genes encoding a limonene synthase (LS) and a geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS) for production of limonene. Out of 12 E. coli strains transformed with various plasmids, the best one with p15T7-ls-gpps produced limonene with a titer of 4.87 mg/L. In order to enhance the limonene production, two rate-limiting enzymes in the endogenous MEP pathway of E. coli, 1-deoxy-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI), were overexpressed consecutively on vector pET21a+, resulting in a production of 17.4 mglimonene/L at 48 h. Conclusions: After the preliminary optimization of the medium in a two-phase culture system composed of n-hex-adecane (1/50, Vorg/Vaq), the final production of limonene was raised up to 35.8 mg/L, representing approximately a 7-fold improvement compared to the initial titer. © 2014 Du et al.

AB  - Present study provides the effect of Cerium Oxide (CeO2) nano fuel additives on the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of a Grape Seed Oil Methyl Ester (GSOME). Biodiesel blended fuel is prepared by the emulsification technique with the aid of a mechanical agitator. Prepared biodiesel emulsion fuels were mixed with the CeO2 nanoparticles in the mass fractions of 50 and 100 ppm with the help of an ultrasonicator. Fuel properties of B20 (80% Diesel + 20% GSOME), B20CeO250 (80% Diesel + 20% GSOME + 50ppm CeO2), B20CeO2100 (80%Diesel + 20% GSOME + 100ppm CeO2) and neat biodiesel were studied and compared according to ASTM standard test methods for biodiesel. Study is carried out at a constant speed of 1500rpm. Experimental results show a significant improvement in the performance and a reduction in harmful emissions for the CeO2 nano additive biodiesel emulsion fuels compared to those of B20. © 2014, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

AB  - The financial viability of biodiesel production from Jatropha is estimated under real-life African conditions. The assessment is modelled from the data of an oil producer with a social entrepreneurial business model in Tanzania. A first-round cost analysis shows that the total cost of biodiesel production including all company costs and taxes is significantly higher than Tanzanian and typical East-African market prices for diesel; however, when by-products are utilised as additional sources of revenue, biodiesel production is projected to become financially viable. While these findings are far removed from the recently hyped expectations surrounding Jatropha as an energy crop, they also do not lend support to the current widespread discrediting of Jatropha bio-energy. We conclude that Jatropha biodiesel production in SubSaharan Africa can be financially viable and socially benign, but only under certain conditions. Some conditions derive from exogenous external circumstances, while others require hard work and patience to create. © 2014 International Energy Initiative. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) derived from organic waste, were used as a low cost carbon source for high bioreactor productivity and titer. A multi-stage continuous high cell density culture (MSC-HCDC) process was employed for economic assessment of microbial lipids for biodiesel production. In a simulation study we used a lipid yield of 0.3 g/g-VFAs, cell mass yield of 0.5 g/g-glucose or wood hydrolyzates, and employed process variables including lipid contents from 10-90% of cell mass, bioreactor productivity of 0.5-48 g/L/h, and plant capacity of 20000-1000000 metric ton (MT)/year. A production cost of USD 1.048/kg-lipid was predicted with raw material costs of USD 0.2/kg for wood hydrolyzates and USD 0.15/kg for VFAs; 9 g/L/h bioreactor productivity; 100, 000 MT/year production capacity; and 75% lipids content. The variables having the highest impact on microbial lipid production costs were the cost of VFAs and lipid yield, followed by lipid content, fermenter cost, and lipid productivity. The cost of raw materials accounted for 66.25% of total operating costs. This study shows that biodiesel from microbial lipids has the potential to become competitive with diesels from other sources. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - In this work-in view of still decreasing crude oil resources and increasing fuel prices-are presented issues concerning research on development of other, alternative fuel sources including those used in water, land and air transport means. One of them is hydrogen which, while burning, does not produce noxious carbon dioxide but only side effects such as heat and clean water. It is almost true that along with sudden drop of availability and rising price of crude oil many countries face economical paralysis. Any of alternative sources is not capable of supplying even only a basic amount of such energy, not mentioning the whole amount of energy demanded by our civilization. Hydrogen as an independent fuel for internal combustion engines has yet to go a long way to commercialization. to be Co-burning systems (combustion of mixtures)of today used hydrocarbon fuels combined with hydrogen seem closer to this aim. As proved in many investigations the substitution of a part of hydrocarbon fuel by hydrogen enables to make use of beneficial features of both the fuels. One of possible solutions of the problem may be application of an innovative hydrogenic fuel electrolyzer which is presented and evaluated in this paper. © 2015 Bogdan Żółtowski and Mariusz Żółtowski.

AB  - Community views toward the risks and benefits of emerging renewable energy technologies are important factors in facility siting decisions and their eventual success. While the actual socioeconomic and biophysical impacts of proposed industrial developments are fraught with uncertainty, understanding public perceptions is critical in managing costs and benefits to local citizens. Here, we explore the social acceptability of forest-based biorefineries in Maine using random utility modeling to identify how project attributes and citizen characteristics interact to affect level of support. Using a statewide sample (Statewide) and a subsample of mill towns (Mill Towns), we found that: (1) in both samples, individual characteristics had similar coefficients and significance levels except for pro-environment attitudes; (2) the coefficients related to the industry's negative attributes were notably different between the two samples, while positive attributes were not; (3) in both samples, positive industry attributes such as "producing products from a sustainable resource" and "increased economic development" were the most influential variables in determining the level of support for a new biorefinery in an individual's community; and (4) in general, Mill Town respondents were more accepting of potential negative attributes such as increased levels of truck traffic, odor, noise, and air and water pollution. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A comprehensive review of the U.S. federal biofuel-related policies, from 1955 to 2012, was conducted to examine the progression of life cycle thinking within the policies. Over 1300 past and present federal and state biofuel laws and incentives were analyzed to identify the establishment of Life-cycle thinking (LCT) in the biofuel policies. The policies were searched for search terms representing the three themes: life cycle assessment, environmental impact and sustainability. LCT in policies was first seen in the Renewable Fuel Standard under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, where life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction of biofuels was required. Existing U.S. biofuel policies were also characterized to define types of policy as tax incentive, grants, mandate, etc. The results suggested that climate change or energy incentives, air quality or emissions, etc. should be more emphasized in fuel legislation for a continuous improvement of biofuels industry. Only 13% of both the federal and state policies reviewed in this study employed some aspect of LCT. Policies that incorporate LCT often only focused on greenhouse gas emissions; policies should include other environmental impacts to avoid any environmental tradeoffs and unintended consequences from biofuel production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative fuel to diesel and is seeking wider acceptance because of its claimed environmental and socio-economic benefits. The fuel properties of biodiesel are similar to those of fossil fuel. However, one of its main obstacles remains its lower oxidative stability. This problem may be overcome by the addition of suitable antioxidant. In India, biodiesel is produced from non-edible karanja oil, which has considerable potential. Because karanja oil biodiesel contains a higher amount of unsaturated fatty acids, it is necessary to find a suitable method for improving its oxidation stability. We report a study on the effect of antioxidants on the stability of the fuel. The addition of antioxidants improves oxidation stability of karanja oil biodiesel.

AB  - This paper compares supply and demand constraints on the ramp-up of biofuels in the United States. Three recent supply-side developments are assessed: (1) build-out of commercial-scale cellulosic biorefineries, (2) incremental improvements to existing ethanol and biodiesel biorefineries, and (3) use of waste oils for renewable diesel and biodiesel. From a technical perspective, we estimate these developments could increase domestic biofuels production by up to 4.3, 2.3, and 1.3 billion gallons of gasoline equivalent (BGGE) by 2030, respectively. This corresponds to 3.7% of final energy in the U.S. transportation sector in 2013. On the demand side, the main technical constraints to biofuel growth involve the blend rate of ethanol with gasoline. Rapid removal of E85 and E15 vehicle and infrastructure barriers could generate room for an additional 13.0BGGE of ethanol and 2.7BGGE of biodiesel consumption by 2030. There is no demand constraint on drop-in biofuels. Both supply and demand constraints limit the expansion of biofuels, but demand constraints can likely be relaxed at a faster pace than supply constraints. Whether the further expansion of biofuels is socially, economically, or environmentally justifiable is not a research question examined here. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Flash pyrolysis of oleic acid was studied over 10 wt.% nickel catalysts supported on silica and alumina. The catalysts were impregnated with 10 wt.% oleic acid. The dried precursors and the catalysts containing oleic acid were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis. The calcined catalysts were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and temperature programmed reduction (TPR). Samples containing adsorbed oleic acid were submitted to flash pyrolysis up to 650 ° C. Whereas pyrolysis of oleic acid without catalyst converted only about 10%, the pyrolysis of oleic acid adsorbed on catalysts allowed practically a complete conversion. NiO/alumina yielded a higher amount of liquid hydrocarbons than NiO/silica. The main products obtained with NiO/silica were 1-alkenes, whereas the main products obtained with NiO/alumina were alkene isomers and aromatics. Small amounts of oxygenated compounds were also observed, principally alcohols. The flash pyrolysis of oleic acid adsorbed on different catalyst surfaces appears as a useful way to distinguish activity trends of different catalyst samples. ©2014 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.

AB  - Bio-oils, which are multicomponent mixtures, were produced from two different biomass (rice straw (rice oil) and sawdust of oak tree (oak oil)) by using the slow pyrolysis process, and chemical compositional screening with GC-MS detected several hazardous compounds in both bio-oil samples. The two bio-oils vary in their chemical compositional nature and concentrations. To know the actual hazard potentialities of these bio-oils, toxicological assessments were carried out in a comparative approach by using in vitro (Jurkat T and HepG2 cell) as well as in vivo (Caenorhabditis elegans) systems. A dose-dependent increase in cytotoxicity, cell death (apoptosis), and genotoxicity were observed in cultured cell systems. Similarly, the in vivo system, C. elegans also displayed a dose-dependent decrease in survival. It was found that in comparison with rice oil, oak oil displayed higher toxicity to all models systems, and the susceptibility order of the model systems were Jurkat T > HepG2 > C. elegans. Pursuing the study further toward the underlying mechanism by exploiting the C. elegans mutants screening assay, the bio-oils seem to mediate toxicity through oxidative stress and impairment of immunity. Taken together, bio-oils compositions mainly depend on the feedstock used and the pyrolysis conditions which in turn modulate their toxic potentiality. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Innovative lignocellulosic biofuel, obtained through solvolysis of spruce wood in multifunctional alcohols was tested in an experimental turbine engine with different primary air temperatures. Variation of primary air temperature was used to emulate two types of microgas turbine generators - fully recuperated and simple cycle setups resulting in different temperatures of combustion chamber intake air. Results indicate that different temperatures, velocities, and flow conditions in primary zone of combustion chamber strongly influence on droplet penetration depth and rate of mixture formation as well as emissions formation. For the innovative lignocellulosic biofuel emission trends of CO and THC were found to be significantly higher in simple cycle mode, whereas no influence of operation mode was observed for baseline diesel fuel. NOx emissions of innovative biofuel generally increased in regenerative cycle mode and also became sensitive on turbine inlet temperature, with similar trends being observed with diesel fuel. In the case of innovative fuel, deposits of char and polymerized fuel were observed on the combustor walls after operation in simple cycle mode, whereas in regenerative cycle mode, only small amounts of ash deposits were found on hot path surfaces, indicating beneficial influence of high primary air temperatures on combustion efficiency of innovative fuel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents a study on the production of biofuels from algae cultivated in municipal wastewater in Gothenburg, Sweden. A possible biorefinery concept is studied based on two cases; Case A) combined biodiesel and biogas production, and Case B) only biogas production. The cases are compared in terms of product outputs and impact on global CO2 emissions mitigation. The area efficiency of the algae-based biofuels is also compared with other biofuel production routes. The study investigates the collaboration between an algae cultivation, biofuel production processes, a wastewater treatment plant and an industrial cluster for the purpose of utilizing material flows and industrial excess heat between the actors. This collaboration provides the opportunity to reduce the CO2 emissions from the process compared to a stand-alone operation. The results show that Case A is advantageous to Case B with respect to all studied factors. It is found that the algae-based biofuel production routes investigated in this study has higher area efficiency than other biofuel production routes. The amount of algae-based biofuel possible to produce corresponds to 31 MWfuel for Case A and 26 MWfuel in Case B. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.

AB  - Free lipase-catalyzed biodiesel has drawn more and more attentions in recent years because of its advantages of lower cost and faster reaction rate. Utilizing free lipase to convert low quality oils such as crude vegetable oils and microbial oils is beneficial to further reduce the cost of biodiesel production. However, these oils typically contain some amount of phospholipids. Phospholipids were found to affect the lipase-catalyzed process and further influence the enzyme's thermal stability in biodiesel production process. In this work, free lipase NS81006-mediated biodiesel production from oils containing phospholipids at varied temperature was investigated systematically. It was found that the presence of phospholipids at high temperature led to a decreased fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) yield and poor reuse stability of the lipase during NS81006-catalyzed biodiesel production process. The higher the temperature was, the greater negative effect was observed. This inhibitory effect was found to be mainly caused by the coexistence of phospholipids and methanol in the system. Based on this finding, a novel two-step enzyme-mediated process was further developed, with which the above-mentioned inhibitory effect was eliminated, and a FAME yield of 95.1% could be obtained with oils containing 10% phospholipids even at high temperature of 55°C. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass has been considered as promising energy source that should be able to suffice the increasing energy demand in the future. Therefore, new biomass utilization technologies and concepts are highly desirable. This paper contributes to the understanding of liquid phase pyrolysis oil upgrading that differs from the intensively investigated fast pyrolysis oil. Two new approaches, which were never reported in literature before, where investigated in this paper. At first, the liquid phase pyrolysis oil was dehydrated to lower transportation costs and increase energy density and efficiency of further upgrading steps. At second, a catalyst screening for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of dehydrated liquid phase pyrolysis oil was conducted in a batch reactor. Neither the dehydration nor the HDO of dehydrated liquid phase pyrolysis oil were reported in literature by now. The activity of the HDO catalysts Ru/C, Pt/C, and Pd/C as well as a Ni-based catalyst was compared. HDO was investigated at 250°C and 100bar and at 300°C and 150bar. HDO of dehydrated liquid phase pyrolysis oil was observed with all catalysts. The Pt/C catalyst was found to be most promising with respect to the oil yield (56wt.%), the deoxygenation ratio (65%), and hydrogen content (8.6wt.%). © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The process of producing biodiesel from various oil feedstocks is well known but developments of commercial plants are being hampered by the high cost of production. The paper reports an integrated method in which the oil obtained by solvent extraction of Calophyllum inophyllum seed is converted to biodiesel over a biomass derived catalyst. The catalyst derived from the residual cake of C. inophyllum obtained after oil extraction can be incompletely carbonized to obtain an amorphous carbon followed by sulfonation in concentrated sulphuric acid. RESULTS: The activity of the catalyst was tested through esterification of free fatty acid present in C. inophyllum oil and comparison was made with a similar catalyst derived from glucose. Superior activity over glucose-derived catalyst was related to the SO3H acid density and higher surface area. The catalyst also achieved high conversion of the non-edible oil to biodiesel (96.6 wt%) in a single step at the optimized reaction conditions. CONCLUSION: A solid acid catalyst capable of simultaneous esterification and transesterification of free fatty acids and triglycerides present in C. inophyllum oil has been synthesized. An integrated process in which the waste generated during the oil extraction process of biodiesel production is effectively utilized could lead to cost reduction and possibly successful commercialization. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - The poor low-temperature properties of biodiesel, which provokes easy crystallization at low temperature, can cause fuel line plugging and limits its blending amount with petro-diesel. This work aimed to study the production of biodiesel with a new process of improving the low temperature performance of biodiesel. Waste cooking oil was first hydrolyzed into fatty acids (FAs) by 60. g immobilized lipase and 240. g RO water in 15. h. Then, urea complexation was used to divide the FAs into saturated and unsaturated components. The conditions for complexation were: FA-to-urea ratio 1:2 (w/w), methanol to FA ratio 5:1 (v/v), duration 2. h. The saturated and unsaturated FAs were then converted to iso-propyl and methyl esters by lipase, respectively. Finally, the esters were mixed together. The CFPP of this mixture was decreased from 5. °C to -3. °C. Hydrolysis, urea complexation and enzymic catalyzed esterification processes are discussed in this paper. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work was aimed at improving the pyrolysis oil quality of waste rubber by adding larch sawdust. Using a 1. kg/h stainless pyrolysis reactor, the contents of sawdust in rubber were gradually increased from 0%, 50%, 100% and 200% (wt%) during the pyrolysis process. Using a thermo-gravimetric (TG) analyzer coupled with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis of evolving products (TG-FTIR), the weight loss characteristics of the heat under different mixtures of sawdust/rubber were observed. Using the pyrolysis-gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), the vapors from the pyrolysis processes were collected and the compositions of the vapors were examined. During the pyrolysis process, the recovery of the pyrolysis gas and its composition were measured in-situ at a reaction temperature of 450. °C and a retaining time of 1.2. s. The results indicated that the efficiency of pyrolysis was increased and the residual carbon was reduced as the percentage of sawdust increased. The adding of sawdust significantly improved the pyrolysis oil quality by reducing the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitrogen and sulfur compounds contents, resulting in an improvement in the combustion efficiency of the pyrolysis oil. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) derivatives have received considerable attention as potential biofuel additives and as sustainable lubricants. One common strategy for the modification of FAMEs, such as methyl oleate, involves epoxidation of the C9-C10 alkene followed by oxirane ring-opening to introduce branches into the FAME backbone. This strategy has been shown to improve cold-flow properties and oxidative stability relative to the parent oleates, and some derivatives have shown promise as lubricants. However, the effect of this strategy on viscosity has not been well established, if at all. Here we present the viscosity properties of methyl oleate derivatives as controlled by rational functional group manipulation with important implications for the preparation of bio-derived lubricants, where viscosity properties must be tightly controlled. The effect of selected derivatives as cold-flow additives in biodiesel is also reported. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

AB  - This paper presents a new route for biomass derived aviation fuel synthesis by catalytic conversion in aqueous phase. Furfural with the yield of 71% was produced by acid hydrolysis of raw corncob, and hydrogenated to 2-methylfuran with obtaining the yield of 89% over Raney Ni catalyst, both of which were implemented under mild reaction conditions. The hydroxyalkylation/alkylation condensation of 2-methylfuran and furfural to C15 intermediate was conducted by using organic and inorganic acid as the catalyst under the reaction condition of 328K and atmospheric pressure. The maximal 95% of the C15 intermediate was gained when using sulfuric acid as the catalyst. 83% of liquid alkanes (C8C15) yield and more than 90% of C14/C15 selectivity were produced by hydrodeoxygenation of the C15 intermediate over 10wt%Ni/ZrO2-SiO2 catalyst. During the hydrodeoxygenation process, the catalyst showed excellent stability depended on the 110h of time-on-stream test, due to its significantly decreased carbon deposition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Alternative fuels are expected to play a major role in EU in the coming years due European Directives on the promotion of renewable energies and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in transports. However, while in road transports a variety of possible renewable fuels (mainly biofuels, but also electricity) can be considered, in aviation only high quality paraffinic biofuels can be adopted. This means that biomass must be converted through advanced processes into pure hydrocarbon fuels, fully compatible with the existing systems. The aviation sector is responsible for the 2% of the world anthropogenic CO2 emissions and the 10% of the fuel consumption: airlines' costs for fuel reach 30% of operating costs. In addition, the aviation traffic is expected to double within 15years from 2012, while fuel consumption and CO2 emissions should double in 25years. Thus, more than 2 billion people and 40 Mt of good/cargo will have to be moved every year. In this context, the EU Flightpath set a target of 2Mt per year for aviation alternative fuel by 2020 (i.e. 4% of annual fuel consumption). New processes towards bio-hydrocarbons are being developed, demonstrated and soon industrialized.The present work explores the possible routes from biomass feedstock to sustainable paraffinic fuels, either through bio or thermo-chemical processes, as well as discusses those more mature, focusing on industrial demonstration initiatives. In fact, while the number of possible options towards paraffinic biofuel production is very large, and covers both thermochemical and biochemical routes, as well as hybrid one, only two pathways are today ready for testing a significant large scale: these are FT and Hydrotreating. Major industrial activities and testing experiences are thus reported in the present work.In this context, the ITAKA group is developing a full value-chain in Europe to produce sustainable drop-in Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK) - called HEFA - in an economically, socially and environmentally sound manner, at large scale enough to allow testing its use in existing logistic systems and in normal flight operations in Europe. The generated knowledge will aim to identify and address barriers to innovation. Within ITAKA, possible pre-processing of used (waste) cooking oil (UCO) to make it compatible with current downstream hydroprocessing techniques are being investigated: this can includes esterification of waste oils, as well as catalytic thermal processing, which will be carried out in a pilot unit available at RE-CORD/CREAR. First samples of feedstock oils were collected and characterized, for further investigation towards their conversion into biokerosene through hydrotreatment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Alternative diesel fuels for internal combustion engines have grown significantly in interest in the last decade. This is due to the potential benefits in pollutant emissions and particulate matter reduction. Nevertheless at possible increase in nitrogen oxide (NOx), and almost certainly increase of fuel consumption have been observed. In this paper, mineral diesel and RME (rapeseed methyl ester) fuels have been characterized in a non-evaporative spray chamber and in an optically-accessible single-cylinder engine using a Common Rail injector (8 holes, 148° cone opening angle and 480cc/30s@10MPa flow number) to measure the spatial fuel distribution, the temporal evolution and the vaporization-combustion processes. The injection process and mixture formation have been investigated at the Urban Driving Cycle ECE R15: 1500rpm at 0.2MPa of break mean effective pressure. Characteristic parameters of the spray like penetration length and liquid fuel distribution have been analysed and they have been correlated with the exhaust gaseous and particulate matter emissions. In the spray-analysis in non-evaporative conditions, short events (pilot) are mostly affected by asymmetries in the fuel distributions with noticeable standard deviations at low injected quantities. In the engine tests, the jets reached immediately the stabilization. A comparative analysis on the liquid phase of the spray, in non-evaporative and evaporative conditions, has permitted to investigate better the mixture formation. Its effect on pollutant emissions has been analysed for both fuels. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The motivation for the current work emanates from the conceptualization to improve the performance and emission characteristics of diesel engine fueled with biodiesel, by altering the fuel properties of it through the addition of additives. As such, 1,4-Dioxane, a multipurpose additive, has been zeroed in as one of the indispensible additive to be added with the optimum blend of KME (kapok methyl ester), a biodiesel produced from under-utilized kapok oil, with diesel to improve the engine characteristics. In the current work, 1,4-Dioxane was added with the optimum blend, B25 (25% KME and 75% diesel), in various proportions such as B25-5. ml (B25 - 99.5% and 1,4-Dioxane - 0.5%) and B25-10. ml (B25 - 99.0% and 1,4-Dioxane - 1.0%). With the addition of 1,4-Dioxane, the physical and thermal properties of B25 were improved, in particular the cold flow and ignition properties. As an outcome of the experimental investigation, BTE (brake thermal efficiency) was improved by 5.7% for B25-10. ml than B25 at full load condition. Correspondingly, the emissions such as HC (hydrocarbon), CO (carbon monoxide), NO. X (oxides of nitrogen) and smoke were reduced by 25.3%, 22.5%, 15.2% and 24.6%, respectively, for B25-10. ml than B25. Interestingly, all the reported emissions for B25 with additive were much lower than diesel fuel, making it as one of the appropriate fuel blend for diesel engine in the near future. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nannochloropsis sp. wet biomass was directly transesterified under microwave (MW) irradiation in the presence of methanol and various alkali and acid catalyst. Two different types of direct transesterification (DT) were used; one step and two step transesterification. The biodiesel yield obtained from the MWDT was compared with that obtained using conventional method (lipid extraction followed by transesterification) and water bath heating DT method. Findings revealed that MWDT efficiencies were higher compared to water bath heating DT by at least 14.34% and can achieve a maximum of 43.37% with proper selection of catalysts. The use of combined catalyst (NaOH and H2SO4) increased the yield obtained by 2.3-folds (water bath heating DT) and 2.87-folds (MWDT) compared with the one step single alkaline catalyst respectively. The property of biodiesel produced by MWDT has high lubricating property, good cetane number and short carbon chain FAME's compared with water bath heating DT. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Through a comparative energy flow analysis, this paper examines the energy security impacts of growing biofuels on wastelands in South India. India's National Policy on Biofuels claims that wastelands are well suited for biofuel production because they are empty and unused. However, in rural Tamil Nadu, a Prosopis juliflora fuelwood energy economy already exists on these lands and services a mix of rural and urban consumers at household and industrial levels. This Prosopis economy currently provides 2.5-10.3 times more useful energy than would the government's proposed Jatropha curcas biodiesel economy, depending on Jatropha by-product usage. Contrary to the government's claims, growing biofuels on wastelands can weaken, rather than improve, the country's energy security. Further, replacing Prosopis with Jatropha could engender changes in economic and property relations that could further weaken energy security. These findings are not specific to rural Tamil Nadu as Prosopis is widely used as a fuelwood throughout Asia and Africa. Calls to 'develop' degraded lands through biofuel promotion similarly exist in these regions. This study underscores the importance of analyzing wasteland-centered biofuel policies at local levels in order to better understand the changes in human-environment relationships resulting from this policy push. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel fuels (BDFs) was successfully produced from Vietnamese Jatropha curcas oil with high content of free fatty acids (FFAs) in two stages. In the first stage, the esterification process was carried out with the optimal conditions as follows; a methanol-to-FFAs molar ratio of 6:1, 1wt% H2SO4, at a temperature of 65°C, and using 30% (wt/wt) acetonitrile as co-solvent. This step reduced the concentration of FFAs in the reaction mixture from 15.93 to 2wt% in 60min. In the second stage, the transesterification process generated fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) with 99% efficiency was performed in 30min with the optimal conditions as follows; a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 6:1, 1wt% KOH, at a temperature of 40°C, and 20% (wt/wt) acetone as co-solvent. The produced biodiesel quality meets the standards JIS K2390 and EN 14214 regarding FAME yield, FFAs and water contents. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the study, the relationship between the quality and intensity of LED illumination with FAMEs produced were investigated. Nannochloropsis sp. was cultivated for 14days under different intensities of 100, 150 and 200μmol photonsm-2s-1 of red, blue and mixed red blue LED. The findings revealed that suitable combination of LED wavelengths and intensity; (red LED: 150, blue: 100 and mixed red blue: 200μmol photonsm-2s-1) produced maximum biomass growth and lipid content. It was observed that the quality and intensity of LED significantly influenced the composition of FAMEs. FAMEs produced under blue LED has high degree of unsaturation (DU) and low cetane number while those under red LED has low DU but higher CN. The combination of red blue LED has produced FAMEs with high ignition and lubricating property and also good oxidation stability indicated by the DU and CN values which lies midway between the red and blue. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pine sawdust was pretreated with several calcium compounds and then pyrolyzed in a fluidized bed pyrolysis reactor at 500. °C. The catalytic action of the calcium compounds varies depending on the anion. Analysis of pyrolysis gas, liquid and char yields and compositions demonstrates that calcium sulfate is inert during pyrolysis while calcium formate, carbonate, hydroxide and oxide show significant deoxygenation activity. Of the salts which showed deoxygenation activity, calcium formate had the highest relative yield. This effect is likely attributable to the activity of calcium formate as a hydrogen donor at the pyrolysis temperature. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The three modes under comparison were; diesel, electric and bi-mode. As well as comparing these three modes of operation, a comparison between Conventional, Freight and High Speed Rail was made. Alternate fuels were considered for diesel and bi-mode locomotives and compared based on their environmental impact. The emissions of trains were studied using three methods. Specifically, the three chosen methods were used to calculate the emissions of each train and a comparison of these methods was made. In the current UK energy climate, diesel trains emit less emissions than electric trains when factoring in mechanical and air resistances. Bi-mode trains have their place in the UK network but with electrification of the network currently in place, this mode of operation will become redundant in the near future. High Speed Rail, although time efficient, releases high emissions due to energy consumption increasing with the square of speed. Alternative fuels, such as biodiesel, should be a consideration for the future of rail, as emissions fall dramatically with content of biodiesel in fuel blends. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This research investigated the effect of guide vanes installed in front of the intake runner of a compression ignition (CI) engine run with biodiesel. Firstly, the simulation method used SolidWorks and ANSYS-CFX to determine the optimum vane height of the guide vane from among 10 variation models with different vane heights between 0.10 and 1.00 times the radius of the intake runner (. R) (called 0.10. R for 0.10 times R, etc.). The simulation results of in-cylinder turbulence kinetic energy (TKE), velocity, vorticity and swirling strength were presented and discussed. Based on these results, 0.70. R was found to be the optimum guide vane height as it improved TKE, mostly improved velocity and partly improved vorticity, swirling strength within the fuel injection region from crank angles before the start of injection up to the first part of expansion stroke. Five guide vane models (0.10. R, 0.30. R, 0.50. R, 0.70. R, and 0.90. R) were then fabricated and tested on a CI generator diesel engine run with biodiesel coupled with a load bank. Based on the experimental results, 0.70R guide vane model showed the most improvements as it reduced the brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) as well as increased engine efficiency compared to the run without the guide vanes when ran with biodiesel. Hence, this research found that using guide vanes can improve the performance and reduce the emissions of CI engine run with biodiesel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Whole parts of castor plant, as a non-edible energy crop, were used for multiple biofuels production. Extracted castor oil was used for biodiesel production by transesterification, whereas the castor plant residues, i.e., stem, seed cake, and leaves, were employed for ethanol and biogas production. Effects of operating conditions, including methanol to oil ratio, temperature, and reaction time on biodiesel production yield were investigated. The optimum biodiesel yield was 88.2%, obtained at 0.4:1 methanol to oil mass ratio at 40. °C for 90. min. This yield corresponded to 155. g biodiesel per kg castor plant. In addition, pretreatment using 8% w/v NaOH at 0 and 100. °C for 30 and 60. min was applied to improve ethanol and biogas yields. The best results for both enzymatic hydrolysis and ethanol production by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) were obtained after alkali pretreatment at 100. °C for 60. min for all plant residues. The highest ethanol production yield achieved from pretreated castor stem was as high as 82.2%, corresponding to 63. g ethanol per kg castor plant. In the case of biogas production, alkali pretreatment enhanced the methane production yield from castor stem; however, it could not improve the production yield of castor seed cake and leaves. Furthermore, untreated castor seed cake had the highest methane production yield of 252.1. ml/g VS, equal to 68.2. L per kg of castor plant. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this work is to investigate a two-step homogenous catalyzed waste lard transesterification reaction for low cost biodiesel production. For this purpose, two 23 full factorial design of experiments was applied. Six variables, namely esterification time (60-120min), H2SO4 concentration (20-40wt.%), MeOH:FFA (15:1-23:1), transesterification time (30-60min), KOH concentration (1-2wt.%), and MeOH:triglycerides (6:1-9:1), that typically affect the production process were studied. The esterification step is significantly affected mostly by the reaction time and the MeOH:FFA ratio value. Specifically, their increase brings a reduction of the FFA acidity. Likewise, the transesterification step is positively affected primarily by three independent variables, namely reaction time, KOH concentration and MeOH:triglyceride ratio. Furthermore two empirical models describing evolution of the two-step transesterification reaction were developed. They can become useful tools for further scaling-up the process by predicting its reaction yield within a 95% of confidence level. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The changes in the composition of fuels in combination with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) emission control systems bring new insights into the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants. The major goal of our study was to quantify NOx, NO, NO2, NH3 and N2O emissions from a four-cylinder diesel engine operated with diesel and a blend of 20% soybean biodiesel. Exhaust fume samples were collected from bench dynamometer tests using a heavy-duty diesel engine equipped with SCR. The target gases were quantified by means of Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR). The use of biodiesel blend presented lower concentrations in the exhaust fumes than using ultra-low sulfur diesel. NOx and NO concentrations were 68% to 93% lower in all experiments using SCR, when compared to no exhaust aftertreatment. All fuels increased NH3 and N2O emission due to SCR, a precursor secondary aerosol, and major greenhouse gas, respectively. An AERMOD dispersion model analysis was performed on each compound results for the City of Curitiba, assumed to have a bus fleet equipped with diesel engines and SCR system, in winter and summer seasons. The health risks of the target gases were assessed using the Risk Assessment Information System For 1-h exposure of NH3, considering the use of low sulfur diesel in buses equipped with SCR, the results indicated low risk to develop a chronic non-cancer disease. The NOx and NO emissions were the lowest when SCR was used; however, it yielded the highest NH3 concentration. The current results have paramount importance, mainly for countries that have not yet adopted the Euro V emission standards like China, India, Australia, or Russia, as well as those already adopting it. These findings are equally important for government agencies to alert the need of improvements in aftertreatment technologies to reduce pollutants emissions. © 2014 .

AB  - This study reports hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of pinewood at 200-275°C for H2, biocrude and bio-oil production in presence of a nitrate salt catalyst: Ni(NO3)2, Ca(NO3)2, Co(NO3)2 and Fe(NO3)3. Among these catalysts, Ni(NO3)2 showed higher selectivity towards H2 and biocrude generation. To generate H2 and biocrude, a slurry of pinewood was prepared with different biomass to solvent (B:S) ratios of 1:10, 1:30, and 1:75 and loaded in the SS316 PARR reactor and heated to different temperatures. While the reaction was in progress, gas samples were withdrawn and analyzed using GC equipped with Chrompack capillary column and thermal conductivity detector. The analysis of product gas revealed the presence of H2, CO2, CO and CH4. The liquid samples collected during the reaction were centrifuged to separate residue and analyzed using TOC analyzer, HPLC and GC-MS. Among different homogeneous catalysts used, Ni(NO3)2 yielded 12.26mol% H2 at 275°C and a maximum biocrude of 55wt% at 250°C using 200psi N2 partial pressure. The biocrude was found to contain sugars, C1-C3 carboxylic acids such as lactic, propionic, acetic and formic, HMF/furfural and other oxygenated compounds, which were thoroughly analyzed by GC-MS. Among different C1-C3 acids, lactic acid was observed in the major amount of 83.92wt% using B:S of 1:75 at 250°C. The biocrude obtained was further processed to recover light bio-oil (LBO), heavy bio-oil (HBO) and residue which were found to have higher heating value (HHV) as compared with original pinewood. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Esterification of free fatty acids with alcohols catalytic by acid catalysts can synthesize sustainable production of biofuel. In this work, 12-tungstophosphoric acid was modified by picolinic acid to prepare solid acid catalyst (PA-HPW) and applied to the esterification, which was proved to be an efficient catalyst for the esterification of oleic acid and alcohols. For characterization of the catalysts, XRD, FT-IR, SEM and potentiometric titration method were employed. These analyses showed that there was no decomposition of the Keggin structure of 12-tungstophosphoric acid during preparation and esterification. The PA-HPW catalyst presented high acidity and good stability in esterification mixtures. Various reaction parameters, such as methanol/oleic acid molar ratio, catalyst dosage, reaction temperature and time were systematically examined. A quantitative conversion (100%) of oleic acid was achieved, using the most active modified catalyst at 80. °C with a 7. wt % catalyst/oleic acid ratio for 5. h, at a 10:1 of alcohol/acid mole ratio. The catalyst can be easily recovered and reused, which indicated that the PA-HPW catalyst is a promising new type of heterogeneous acid catalyst for conversion of free fatty acid feeds to biodiesel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The operation of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) using a reformed fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) mixture a biodiesel-like fuel, has been successfully demonstrated. This project had two main aspects: 1) determining the fuel reforming activity of a pyrochlore catalyst deposited onto a monolith; and 2) operating a SOFC on reformed fuel gas. Prior to integrated testing, parametric reforming studies of the FAME mixture were conducted using both Rh/γ-Al2O3 and Rh-substituted pyrochlore catalyst powders to determine the operating conditions to maximize syngas selectivity. Using the same pyrochlore catalyst as in the parametric studies, a monolith reformer converted 0.5 cm3 min-1 of the FAME mixture into mostly hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas). The syngas generated in the reformer was sent to an anode supported SOFC (H.C. Starck Ceramics GmbH &amp; Co.) The SOFC operated on 98% H2/2% H2O for baseline testing before and after switching to the reformed FAME mixture for 100 h of operation. The results presented here demonstrate that FAME mixture can be successfully reformed to power a SOFC, making them a viable fuel for a SOFC-based auxiliary power unit that is both greenhouse gas neutral and renewable. © 2012 .

AB  - The optical properties of aerosols at 405 and 781 nm were measured in an urban site in Nagoya, Japan, in August 2011 and in January 2012 using a photoacoustic spectrometer. Comparison of the absorption coefficient at 781 nm of aerosols that did and did not pass through a thermo-denuder showed that an increase in black carbon (BC) light absorption due to the coating of non-refractory materials (i.e., the lensing effect) was small (on average, 10%) in August and negligible in January. The effective density distributions for the particles that did and did not pass through the thermo-denuder, which were measured simultaneously in August, suggested that the majority of BC particles sampled had a minimal coating. The small lensing effect observed can be explained partly by assuming that a large portion of non-refractory materials was mixed externally with BC. The contribution of direct light absorption by organic matter (OM) that vaporized at temperatures below 300°C to the total light absorption at 405 nm was negligible in August, but those by OM that vaporized below 300 and 400°C averaged 11 and 17%, respectively, in January. The larger contribution of light-absorbing OM in January is likely due to the greater contribution of OM originating from the burning of biomass, including biofuel and agricultural residue, in Japan, northern China, or Siberia, during the winter. ©2014.

AB  - Recently, fungal pelletization-assisted microalgal harvesting has emerged as new research area for minimizing the harvesting cost and energy inputs in the algae-to-biofuel approach. The present study attempted to optimize this process in terms of substrate inputs, process time and pH conditions through selection of a robust fungal strain. A total of eight fungal strains were screened for their pelletizing efficiency in fresh/spent BG11 supplemented with selected media nutrient (glucose, nitrogen and phosphorous). Aspergillus lentulus was found most efficient for pelletizing in the nutrient supplemented spent BG11 in spite of its alkaline pH (8.6–9.2). Moreover, the selected fungus was found equally good under neutral (7.0) and acidic pH (5.0). Interestingly, A. lentulus was able to harvest nearly 100 % of the microalgal cells (at 1.58 g l−1 initial working algal concentration) within only 24 h at supplementation of 10, 0.5 and 0.5 g l−1 of glucose, NH4NO3 and K2HPO4, respectively. The process kinetics in term of harvesting index (HI) as well as the variation of residual glucose and pH with time was also studied. Surprisingly, A. lentulus also performed well at lower glucose level (5.0 g l−1) resulting in 92 % harvesting within 24 h and up to 98 % harvesting within 52 h. The mechanism of harvesting process was studied through microscopic examination. A. lentulus strain investigated in this study could emerge as an efficient, sustainable and economically viable tool in microalgae harvesting for biofuel production. Further, the estimated stoichiometric methane potential (SMP) of pelletized microalgal–fungal biomass (0.756 m3 kg−1 volatile solid [VS]) showed substantial enhancement over algal biomass alone (0.709 m3 kg−1 VS). Hence, the investigated process not only overcomes the hurdles associated with microalgal harvesting but also improves its potential and suitability for bioenergy generation by anaerobic digestion. Further scale-up and pilot level testing is warranted for commercializing the investigated technique. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Yield and composition of pyrolysis oil were tested by fixed bed pyrolysis reactor and GC-MS. Algae pyrolysis kinetics was also calculated by Lorentzian fitting multi-heating rate method with R2 &gt; 0.98. Their activation energy was ranged from 94 to 216 kJ/mol and most of fitting peaks could be described by the random nucleation followed by growth mechanism. Higher bio-oil yield of 35.0 % for Chlorella biomass and 40.6 % for Spirulina biomass at 425 °C have been obtained, while it is 49.4 % at 450 °C for Chrysophyceae biomass. The main compounds of pyrolysis oil included aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrogenated compounds (nitriles, amines, amines, and N-heterocyclic compounds), carboxylic acids, ketones, alcohols, furans, phenols, ester, and others. Carbon number distribution of bio-oil is similar to that of gasoline and diesel, and fatty acid has an influence on bio-oil carbon distribution. Components biofuel model based on algal biomass component was established and the difference between simulated value and experiment value is less 3.58 %. Kinetics biofuel model based on fitting peak areas in pyrolysis kinetics was established and the difference between simulated value and experiment value is less 3.45 %. Pyrolysis oil yield can be quickly and efficiently achieved with these two models. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Thermochemical liquefaction processing of biomass to produce bio-derived fuels (e.g., gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, home heating oil, etc.) is of great recent interest as a renewable energy source. Approaches under investigation include direct liquefaction, hydrothermal liquefaction, hydropyrolysis, fast pyrolysis, etc., to produce energy dense liquids that can be utilized as produced or further processed to provide products of higher value. An issue with bio-oils is that they tend to contain significant concentrations of organic oxygenates, including acids, which make the bio-oil a potential source of corrosion issues in transport, storage, and use. Efforts devoted to modified/further processing of bio-oils to make them less corrosive are currently being widely pursued. Another issue that must also be addressed in bio-oil liquefaction is potential corrosion issues in the process equipment. Depending on the specific process, bio-oil liquefaction production temperatures are typically in the 300–600°C range, and the process environment can contain aggressive sulfur and halide species from both the biomass used and/or process additives. Detailed knowledge of the corrosion resistance of candidate process equipment alloys in these bio-oil production environments is currently lacking. This paper summarizes recent, ongoing efforts to assess the extent of corrosion of bio-oil process equipment, with the ultimate goal of providing a basis for the selection of the lowest cost alloy grades capable of providing the long-term corrosion resistance needed for future bio-oil production plants. © 2014, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.

AB  - Growing common duckweed Lemna minor L. in diluted livestock wastewater is an alternative option for pollutants removal and consequently the accumulated duckweed biomass can be used for bioenergy production. However, the biomass accumulation can be inhibited by high level of ammonium (NH4+) in non-diluted livestock wastewater and the mechanism of ammonium inhibition is not fully understood. In this study, the effect of high concentration of NH4+ on L. minor biomass accumulation was investigated using NH4+ as sole source of nitrogen (N). NH4+-induced toxicity symptoms were observed when L. minor was exposed to high concentrations of ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) after a 7-day cultivation. L. minor exposed to the NH4+-N concentration of 840 mg l−1 exhibited reduced relative growth rate, contents of carbon (C) and photosynthetic pigments, and C/N ratio. Ammonium irons were inhibitory to the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments and caused C/N imbalance in L. minor. These symptoms could further cause premature senescence of the fronds, and restrain their reproduction, growth and biomass accumulation. L. minor could grow at NH4+-N concentrations of 7–84 mg l−1 and the optimal NH4+-N concentration was 28 mg l−1. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In order to investigate the generation of greenhouse gases in sugarcane ethanol production chain, a comparative study of N2O emission in artificially fertilized soils and soils free from fertilizers was carried out. Photoacoustic spectroscopy using quantum cascade laser with an emission ranging from 7.71 to 7.88 µm and differential photoacoustic cell were applied to detect nitrous oxide (N2O), an important greenhouse gas emitted from soils cultivated with sugar cane. Owing to calibrate the experimental setup, an initial N2O concentration was diluted with pure nitrogen and detection limit of 50 ppbv was achieved. The proposed methodology was selective and sensitive enough to detect N2O from no fertilized and artificially fertilized soils. The measured N2O concentration ranged from ppmv to ppbv. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Hydrotalcite, MgO, CaO and zeolites transesterify canola oil in the gas phase at temperatures above 300?Cand atmospheric pressure. Syringe pumps metered oil and alcohol through a 1/8″ tube to the bottom of a 7 mm "capillary"-fluidized bed. Argon gas entered the annular region of the bed through a sinteredglass frit as supplemental fluidizing gas. Oil conversion was complete with excess methanol in the feed.Contact times were less than 0.3 s and the weight-hourly space velocity was on the order of 15 h-1 (0.15 ml min-1 oil feed rate with 0.5 g of catalyst). As the catalyst deactivates, the oil condenses and the fluidized bed collapses. The zeolite deactivated within 2 min; the hydrotalcite could operate for severalminutes; the CaO and MgO operated without interruption for well over 20 min. Periodic oxidation of thecatalyst maintained catalyst activity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hydrotreated Renewable Jet (HRJ) fuel has increasingly become important for the aviation sector to address energy security and climate change mitigation. Rapeseed (Brassica Napus) is a favored candidate feedstock for HRJ because of its high quality oil content and agroeconomic benefit to replace the fallow period in wheat/fallow rotations. We conducted research to evaluate regional differences in nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions for rapeseed cultivation in several counties in 10 states in the United States (U.S.). The Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels (RSB) methodology was applied, and results were compared to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. In this study, yield, nitrogen fertilizer rate, and types were held constant for all locations in order to understand the similarities and differences in the RSB and IPCC methods for estimating N2O emissions. From the results, the RSB-calculated N2O emissions varied for different U.S. states, though regional differences were very small, 0.72-0.73 kg N2O Mg-1seed, while N2O emissions from IPCC method were the same for all sites, 0.87 kg N2O Mg-1seed. The difference between the RSB and IPCC methods is caused by the indirect N2O emissions from ammonia emissions and nitrate leaching. However, the influence of indirect effect is relatively small compared to overall N2O emissions. The utilization of the RSB method may not be justified for estimating regional variations in N2O emissions. As a consequence, the preliminary greenhouse gas (GHG) of rapeseed HRJ fuel using the RSB method in several locations had small differences in result, 42.7-43.0 g CO2 eq/MJ compared to 45.9 g CO2 eq/MJ using the IPCC method. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study focuses on evaluating the effect of residual lipid co-hydroprocessing with a heavy petroleum fraction, towards the production of a hybrid diesel fuel of increased sustainability. Firstly, the effect of Waste Cooking Oil (WCO) co-hydroprocessing with Heavy Atmospheric Gas Oil (HAGO) at different relative ratios (100/0, 95/5, 90/10, 85/15, 80/20 and 70/30 v/v) was evaluated in terms of diesel quality. The experimental results showed explicitly that the addition of WCO did not limit any hydroprocessing reactions targeted. Particularly WCO integration led to a significant diesel content increase which reached 13% for the highest WCO content feedstock (30% v/v), while increasing hydrogen consumption. The study showed that co-hydroprocessing of residual lipids within a refinery can provide an effective and no-risk pathway for integrating residual liquid biomass in transportation fuels, without significant capital investments, while the addition of 5-10% v/v WCO in the hydroprocessing feedstock is considered optimal in terms of H2 additional requirements (∼6.5%), product quality and WCO availability. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In Brazil, the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) is a regulatory agency responsible for monitoring the distribution and sale of fuels. After the introduction of biodiesel in Brazil, problems began to emerge as well as questions regarding the quality of diesel fuel in the country. One of the problems is related to the determination of biodiesel content in the diesel available in fuel stations. This work shows that biodiesel prepared from different feedstock during storage suffers oxidative degradation leading to different oxygenated compounds. The presence of these biodiesel oxidation products affects the accuracy of the result provided by the standard method EN 14078 in relation to the content of biodiesel in diesel. The result showed determination errors of almost 100%. Indeed, a B5 blend after accelerated oxidation was determined using EN 14078 as B10. Another problem observed using EN 14078 was that in countries like Brazil, where different oleaginous or alcohol are used to produce biodiesel, it is mandatory to calibrate the method with the same biodiesel present in diesel blends. Indeed, it was observed important changes in the position of the stretching related to the ester carboxyl group according to the raw materials used to prepare the biofuel, leading to significant errors in the biodiesel content determination. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Industrial oilseeds camelina (Camelina sativa L.), carinata (Brassica carinata), and pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) offer great potential as biofuel feedstocks due to their non-food nature and positive agronomic attributes. This research focused on compression ignition (CI) engine performance and emissions of these industrial oilseeds as compared to both traditional feedstocks and petroleum diesel. A John Deere 4.5 L test engine was used to evaluate these oils using three fuel pathways (triglyceride blends, biodiesel, and renewable diesel). This engine research represents the first direct comparison of these new biofuel feedstocks to each other and to conventional sources. For some industrial oilseed feedstock and fuel pathway combinations, this study also represents the first engine performance data available. The results were promising, with camelina, carinata, and pennycress engine performance very similar to the traditional oils for each fuel pathway. Fuel consumption, thermal efficiency, and emissions were all were typical as compared to traditional oilseed feedstocks. Average brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) for the industrial oilseed biofuels was within ±1.3% of the conventional oilseed biofuels for each fuel type. Initial research with triglyceride blends (TGB), formed by blending straight vegetable oil with gasoline, indicate it may be an ideal fuel pathway for farm-scale fuel production, and was compatible with a direct injection CI engine without modification. TGB had lower fuel consumption and a higher thermal efficiency than biodiesel for each feedstock tested. For several categories, TGB performed similar to petroleum diesel. TGB volumetric bsfc was only 1.9% higher than the petroleum runs. TGB combustion characteristics were similar to biodiesel. Biodiesel runs had several emission benefits such as reductions in carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and formaldehyde (CH20) emissions as compared to TGB runs. The renewable diesels had petroleum-like engine performance and combustion characteristics, while still maintaining some of the benefits of biodiesel such as reduced CO emissions. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions were also 6% lower for renewable diesel runs than petroleum. Both crude and refined oil was used as feedstock, and did not significantly affect engine performance or emissions in a modern CI engine. © Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There is an extensive worldwide search for alternate fuels that can displace fossil-based resources, yet still fit within existing infrastructure. At Argonne National Laboratory, strains of fuel have been designed that are generated by photosynthetic bacteria, eventually producing a heavy alcohol called phytol (C20H40O). Phytol's physical and chemical properties (cetane number, heat of combustion, heat of vaporization, density, surface tension, etc.) correspond in magnitude to those of diesel fuel, suggesting that phytol might be a good blending agent in compression ignition (CI) engine applications. The main objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using phytol as a blending agent with diesel. Three phytol-diesel blends were chosen for evaluation: P5, P10, and P20 (5%, 10%, and 20% phytol by volume). The fuel blends were extensively analyzed to determine their chemical and physical properties, with mostly comparable values, excepting viscosity and vapor pressure. In order to understand the effects of higher viscosity phytol in the fuel injector, three-dimensional simulations of transient, turbulent nozzle flow compared the injection and cavitation characteristics of the various blends. Specifically, area and discharge coefficients and mass flow rates of diesel and phytol blends were compared under corresponding engine operating conditions. Experimental research was performed using a single-cylinder engine under conventional operating conditions to gather comparative performance and emissions characteristics of the various blends of phytol and diesel. The influence of the fuel's chemical composition on performance and emission characteristics was captured by executing an injection timing sweep. Combustion characteristics such as the in-cylinder pressure trace were comparable for the diesel and all the blends with phytol at each of the injection timings. The diesel/phytol blends show similar emissions characteristics as the diesel. The combustion event was depicted by performing high-speed, natural luminosity endoscopic imaging. The conclusion is that phytol may be a suitable blending agent with diesel fuel for CI applications. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the present research work, different types of biodiesel were produced by a homogeneous alkali transesterification reaction using soybean oil, pork lard, and castor bean oil as raw materials, to evaluate how their different compositions may affect the biodegradability, namely, in the presence of benzene. Biodiesel was characterized according to the European standard EN 14214. The anaerobic biodegradation of the different types of biodiesel was examined as well as its influence on the biodegradation of benzene. Analyses were performed to determine the volume of methane (directly related to the anaerobic biodegradation of biodiesel), the concentration of benzene over time, and the production of organic acids. The results showed methane production resulting from the anaerobic degradation of all biodiesel types. The differences between the degradation behavior of each fuel were negligible, contrary to what was expected; however, the amount of methane produced was low due to nutrient limitations. This fact was confirmed by the organic acid analysis as well as by the addition of new media. Anaerobic benzene biodegradation was found to be negatively impacted by the presence of all biodiesel types on average; therefore, the results of this study may impact management of sites that contain biodiesel and fuel hydrocarbon contamination. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - The goal of this paper is to show how chemical process synthesis and analysis studies can be coupled with experimental heterogeneous catalysis studies to identify promising research directions for the development of strategies for the production of renewable fuels. We study five catalytic biomass-to-fuels strategies that rely on production of platform chemicals, such as levulinic acid and fermentable sugars. We first integrate catalytic conversion subsystems with separation subsystems to generate complete conversion strategies, and we then develop the corresponding process simulation models based on experimental results. Our analyses suggest that catalytic biomass-to-fuel conversion strategies could become economically competitive alternatives to current biofuel production approaches as a result of iterative experimental and computational efforts. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We have studied the effect of chemical composition of biodiesel fuel on the physical (volatility) and chemical (reactive oxygenated species concentration) properties of nano particles emitted from a modern common-rail diesel engine. Particle emissions from the combustion of four biodiesels with controlled chemical compositions and different varying unsaturation degrees and carbon-chain lengths, together with a commercial diesel, were tested and compared in terms of volatility of particles and the amount of reactive oxygenated species carried by particles. Different blends of biodiesel and petro diesel were tested at several engine loads and speeds. We have observed that more saturated fuels with shorter carbon chain lengths result in lower particle mass but produce particles that are more volatile and also have higher levels of Reactive Oxygen Species. This highlights the importance of taking into account metrics that are relevant from the health effects point of view when assessing emissions from new fuel types. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The present investigation deals with the combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of cardanol based B20M10 (20% cardanol + 70% diesel + 10% methanol) and B30M10 (30% cardanol + 60% diesel + 10% methanol) biofuel blends. The experiments are conducted on a four-stroke single cylinder diesel engine with 27.5 deg. bTDC standard ignition timing and 180 bar injection pressure at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% full load conditions. The experiments have been carried out with B30M10 biofuel blends and the results are compared with B20M10 and baseline diesel fuel. The supply of additional oxygen to the intake air is at a flow rate of 3%, 5%, and 7% by weight. With the increase in concentration of intake air oxygen, CO, HC, and smoke emissions decreases, whereas brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and NOx emission are considerably increased when compared to B20M10 and B30M10 without oxygen enrichment. The BTE of blended fuel B30M10 with 7% oxygen enrichment intake air reaches the efficiency of B20M10. However, compared to diesel, it decreases about 1.5% by value at 75% full load condition. CO emission reduces to 40.6% and 26.83%, and HC emission reduces to 14% and 10.52% for B30M10 with 7% of oxygen enrichment when compared to B30M10 and B20M10 at 100% full load condition, respectively. Smoke emission decreases drastically with the increment in oxygen concentration of intake air. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The US government has mandated production of 79 million liters of biofuel from lignocellulose biomass and advanced fuels by 2022. To meet this requirement, the Department of Energy is encouraging research to develop herbaceous lignocellulose-based bioethanol for use as transport fuel. Miscanthus × giganteus was introduced in the US during 1930s, and is being widely studied for its potential to produce large biomass yield with minimum input in different soils. Miscanthus × giganteus is highly productive, sterile rhizomatous C4 perennial grass adapted to a wide range of climatic and soil conditions. Since the early 1980s, this crop has been studied under various climate and soil conditions in Europe and used to produce heat and electricity by combustion. This paper summarizes its agronomy and the characteristics which make it a potential dedicated bioenergy crop suitable for the reclaimed minesoils of the Appalachian region: Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The area which has been mined in the Appalachian region is estimated at 1.1 million hectares and only about 5% has been fully reclaimed. Using minesoils for miscanthus bioenergy feedstock production minimizes competition for arable land and sequesters soil organic carbon in these degraded lands. Reclaimed minesoils in the Appalachian region has potential to produce 9.22 × 106 Mg yr-1 dry biomass of Miscanthus × giganteus feedstock. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Entrained flow gasification is a promising technique where biomass is converted to a synthesis gas (syngas) under fuel-rich conditions. In contrast to combustion, where the fuel is converted to heat, CO2, and H2O, the syngas from gasification is rich in energetic gases such as CO and H2. These compounds (CO and H2) represent the building blocks for further catalytic synthesis to chemicals or biofuels. Impurities in the syngas, such as particulates, need to be reduced to different levels depending on the syngas application. The objective of this work was to evaluate the amount of particulates; the particle size distribution and the particle composition from entrained flow gasification of pine stem wood at different operating conditions of the gasifier. For this purpose, online time resolved measurements were performed with a soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SP-AMS) and a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). The main advantage of SP-AMS compared to other techniques is that the particle composition (soot, PAH, organics, and ash forming elements) can be obtained with high time resolution and thus studied as a direct effect of the gasifier-operating conditions. The results suggest that syngas particulates were essentially composed of soot at these tested process temperatures in the reactor (1200-1400°C). Furthermore, the AMS analysis showed a clear correlation between the amounts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and soot in the raw syngas. Minimization of soot and PAH yields from entrained flow gasification of wood proved to be possible by further increasing the O2 addition. Copyright © 2014 American Association for Aerosol Research.

AB  - With the rapid economic development and increasing depletion of petroleum-derived diesel, survival environment of the human has been a serious threat. Therefore, it is necessary to seek green, environmentally friendly, and renewable energy candidates, for which biodiesel fuel has been developed as a promising candidate for energy accommodation. Currently, the most applied approach for the production of biodiesel involves the esterification and/or transesterification reaction. Among various catalytic processes, heterogeneous catalysts are promising and receiving increasing attention due to the easy separation of products and catalysts as well as the high-purity glycerine (glycerol) byproduct that avoids significant waste emissions and effectively reduces the environmental pollution. In this Review, an attempt is being made to review different types of catalytic systems mediated by solid mixed metal oxides for biodiesel production. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Biologically derived isobutanol, a four carbon alcohol, has an energy density closer to that of gasoline and has potential to increase biofuel quantities beyond the current ethanol blend wall. When blended at 16 vol% (iB16), it has identical energy and oxygen content of 10 vol% ethanol (E10). Engine dynamometer emissions tests were conducted on two open-loop electronic fuel-injected marine outboard engines of both two-stroke and four-stroke designs using indolene certification fuel (non-oxygenated), iB16 and E10 fuels. Total particulate emissions were quantified using Sohxlet extraction to determine the amount of elemental and organic carbon. Data indicates a reduction in overall total particulate matter relative to indolene certification fuel with similar trends between iB16 and E10. Gaseous and PM emissions suggest that iB16, relative to E10, could be promising for increasing the use of renewable fuels in recreational marine engines and fuel systems.

Biodiesels in the form of fatty acyl ethyl esters (FAEEs) are a promising next generation biofuel due to their chemical properties and compatibility with existing infrastructure. It has recently been shown that expression of a bacterial acyl-transferase in the established industrial workhorse Saccharomyces cerevisiae can lead to production of FAEEs by condensation of fatty acyl-CoAs and ethanol. In contrast to recent strategies to produce FAEEs in S. cerevisiae through manipulation of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis or a series of arduous genetic manipulations, we introduced a novel genetic background, which is comparable in titer to previous reports with a fraction of the genetic disruption by aiming at increasing the fatty acyl-CoA pools. In addition, we combined metabolic engineering with modification of culture conditions to produce a maximum titer of over 25mg/L FAEEs, a 40% improvement over previous reports and a 17-fold improvement over our initial characterizations.

AB  - Butanol is known as a typical second generation biofuel, and it has many advantages as an alternative fuel for engine. At present, the main studies about butanol concentrate on the combustion and emission characteristics. But the research on the spray characteristics is less. The spray atomization of fuel is a key factor that influences the combustion and emission characteristics of diesel engine. So it is important to research the spray characteristics of butanol and diesel blended fuel in depth. First conduct the spray visualization experiment on the spray test bench of high pressure common rail. Then according to the test results, this paper established nozzle flow model and spray model with the aid of AVL Fire software respectively. The nozzle flow and spray are regarded as an unified whole to research the spray characteristics of butanol and diesel fuel mix, and the calculation result of nozzle multiphase flow is used as the initial and boundary conditions for the spray simulation. Then the accuracy of the model is verified by the contrast of spray penetration and spray image. The influence of injection pressure, environment pressure and blending ratio on spray characteristic of n-butanol/diesel blends was studied by the model. And calculate the influence of various factors on the spray form development, spray penetration, SMD, velocity field and concentration field of blended fuel. In this paper, Nn indicates n-butanol and diesel blended fuel with the volume fraction of n-butanol is n. The results show that with the change of injection pressure and environment pressure, the spray form of blended fuel N25 remain unchanged basically. And the differences of spray form mainly displays in the spray penetration and spray cone angle. With the increase of injection pressure, the spray penetration of N25 increases gradually, and sauter mean diameter (SMD) decreases gradually. Then select two points in the velocity field. By comparing the speed of the two points, it can be seen that the speeds of the two points all increase with the increase of injection pressure. This can indicate that the air entrainment enhances with the raise of injection pressure. And the spray center speed and concentration near the axis all increase, with the increase of injection pressure. According to the results of the research on back pressure, with the increase of environment back pressure, the initial velocity of droplet decreases and resistance increases, so the spray penetration of N25 reduces. And SMD is basically unchanged in middle and later of the spray. Because initial velocity of droplet is reduced, which is not beneficial for the droplet broken. Meanwhile with the increase of backpressure, environment density increase, the interaction of environment and fuel enhance, which make the droplet broken quickly. The spray center speed reduces, concentration near the axis increases. According to the results of the research on blending ratio, with the increase of n-butanol blending ratio, the viscosity and surface tension all decrease, then the droplets is easily broken, which leads to the spray penetration and SMD all reduce, and the atomization becomes better. With the increase of environment temperature, the spray penetration of N25 reduces, and SMD significantly decreases after temperature increased by 293.15 K. And then there is a little change with the temperature increasing. In this paper, the spray model is much closer to the actual situation because of coupling the flow inside the nozzle. This paper researches and analyzes the influence of various factors on spray macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of butanol and diesel blended fuel. So this paper could provide a theoretical support for the application of butanol as an alternative fuel for engine. ©, 2014, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. All right reserved.

AB  - 2,5-Dimethylfuran (DMF) is one of the most actively pursued biomass-derived chemicals due to the fact that it can serve both as a biofuel and an intermediate for drop-in terephthalate polymers. DMF can be accessed via catalytic hydrogenation of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF), but the difficult accessibility of HMF from cellulosic biomass is a major impediment to the commercial development of such a process. Alternatively, 5-(chloromethyl)furfural (CMF) is freely accessible in high yield directly from raw biomass and is shown here to be efficiently reduced to DMF under mild conditions via simple derivatives (aldimine, acetal). © 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &Co.

AB  - In this article, a kinetic model for the enzymatic transesterification of rapeseed oil with methanol using Callera™ Trans L (a liquid formulation of a modified Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase) was developed from first principles. We base the model formulation on a Ping-Pong Bi-Bi mechanism. Methanol inhibition, along with the interfacial and bulk concentrations of the enzyme was also modeled. The model was developed to describe the effect of different oil compositions, as well as different water, enzyme, and methanol concentrations, which are relevant conditions needed for process evaluation, with respect to the industrial production of biodiesel. The developed kinetic model, coupled with a mass balance of the system, was fitted to and validated on experimental results for the fed-batch transesterification of rapeseed oil. The confidence intervals of the parameter estimates, along with the identifiability of the model parameters were presented. The predictive capability of the model was tested for a case using 0.5% (wt. Enzyme/wt. Oil), 0.5% (wt. Water /wt. Oil) and feeding 1.5 times the stoichiometric amount of methanol in total over 24 h. For this case, an optimized methanol feeding profile that constrains the amount of methanol in the reactor was computed and the predictions experimentally validated. Monte-Carlo simulations were then used to characterize the effect of the parameter uncertainty on the model outputs, giving a biodiesel yield, based on the mass of oil, of 90.8 ± 0.55 mass %. © 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

AB  - Bioventing is an alternative technique to clean up contaminated soil. The purpose of this study is to assess the bioremediation of clayey soil contaminated with a blend of 80% diesel and 20% biodiesel (B20) using the bioventing and natural attenuation (NA) methods. The tests were carried out in bioreactors using soil contaminated with 4% of B20. Three airflow intensities (2, 4, and 6∈∈L/min) were tested in three different airflow intervals (1 h every 24, 36, and 48 h). The contaminant degradation was determined by the contaminant's residual fraction in the soil after 15, 30, 60, and 120 days. The highest degradation was 85% for bioventing and 64% for natural attenuation. The airflow intensities and airflow intervals showed no significant differences in the results. The use of the lowest airflow intensity (2L/min) and the longest airflow interval (1-h application each 48 h) might be more economically viable for the application of bioventing as a remediation technique for residual clayey soils. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The effective utilization of glycerol, a by-product in the production of biodiesel, into useful chemicals is desirable from the viewpoint of green chemistry. With this in mind, a novel and highly selective route to synthesizing glycerol dimethyl ether (2,3-dimethoxy-1-propanol), a potential fuel additive, from glycerol was proposed. This route uses both glycerol and methanol as starting materials, takes epichlorohydrin as an intermediate product, and utilizes HCl as a recycling agent. Hereinto, the key step of this route is the reaction between epichlorohydrin and methanol to produce 2,3-dimethoxy-1-propanol which is identified by GC-MS, ESI-MS, IR and NMR. The thermodynamics of this reaction was analyzed and the result showed that the thermodynamics of a reaction was favorable and a high product yield was expected. The effect of various parameters such as kind of acid catalyst, molar ratio of epichlorohydrin to methanol, reaction temperature and reaction time was studied. Among various acid catalysts investigated, the acidic ionic liquid [HSO3-b-N(CH3)3]HSO4 exhibited the highest activity and selectivity: conversion of epichlorohydrin of 100% and selectivity of 2,3-dimethoxy-1-propanol of 99% at 393K, 10h, an initial pressure of 0.1MPa and a molar ratio of catalyst:ECH:CH3OH of 0.01:1:5. After the reaction, [HSO3-b-N(CH3)3]HSO4 was separated by vacuum distillation and then reused for the next cycle directly. The results showed that the product selectivity remained at about 94% but the conversion of epichlorohydrin dropped to 75% after being used five times. Subsequently, a reaction mechanism for the synthesis of 2,3-dimethoxy-1-propanol from epichlorohydrin and methanol was proposed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Calophyllum inophyllum oil is non-edible with high potential as biodiesel feedstock. This study addressed the multiple stages involved in producing biodiesel from C. inophyllum oil by synthesizing a solid acid catalyst from freely available biomass. Microcrystalline cellulose used as the starting material was pyrolyzed to obtain a polycyclic aromatic carbon capable of binding SO3H groups upon sulfonation in concentrated sulfuric acid. Esterification activity of the catalyst towards the free fatty acid found in C. inophyllum oil was superior to the catalyst obtained from d-glucose. The catalyst was also capable of one-pot production of biodiesel from the feedstock with acid value of 29.5mg KOH/g. High conversion to fatty acid methyl esters (~99wt.%) was achieved using 1:15M ratio of oil to methanol with a catalyst loading of 5wt.% at 180°C for 4h. The catalyst also displayed high catalytic stability by retaining about 85% of its original activity. This work shows that the catalyst can replace homogeneous catalysts currently employed to produce biodiesel from C. inophyllum oil. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Developing an economical algae harvesting system still remains a challenge today. One of the strategies to decrease harvesting costs prior conversion is employing technologies that can have additional benefits apart of separation. In this work we explore ozoflotation as a technique to recover microalgae grown in treated wastewater and we evaluate the effect of ozone on lipid and FAME recoveries. A high percentage of biomass can be harvested (79.6% as TSS) when using an ozone dose of 0.23mg/mg of dried biomass. Additionally, two interesting effects of ozone were found in this study. The amount of lipid extracted and FAME recovered from the biomass, at least, doubles when using ozoflotation (with ozone doses of 0.12-0.23mg/mg of dried biomass) than when using centrifugation. And, the oxidative stability of biodiesel can be enhanced by the effect that ozone has in the degree of FAME saturation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Temperature's influence on biodiesel oxidation was evaluated by kinetic and thermodynamic data in biofuel from soybean oil and lard with synthetic antioxidants: butylatedhydroxyanisol (BHA), butylatedhydroxytoluene (BHT), tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), and propylgallate (PG) by simplex centroid mixture design. The kinetic parameters ware obtained by Arrhenius equation and showed that addition of antioxidants in all tests increased activation energy (Ea) and that TBHQ and PG were more efficient and presented synergistic effect. BHT and BHA were the least efficient, as well as their mixtures. The thermodynamic activation parameters of the reactions, evaluated by the Eyring equation and based on the theory of the activated complex (ACT), indicated no spontaneous processes (ΔG‡ &gt; 0) with positive ΔH‡ values and positive and negative ΔS‡ values. The application of simplex centroid mixture design, using Ea as response, showed the optimised value of 174.46 kJ mol-1 for a mixture containing 33.33 and 66.67% of TBHQ and PG, respectively.

AB  - Background: Microalgae are one of the most promising biofuel sources that the world has to offer; nevertheless the conversion process is hampered by technical and economic problems that are mainly related to de-watering and extraction. The efficiency of the process can be dramatically improved by means of non-conventional techniques such as ultrasound (US) and microwaves (MW). Scaling-up feasibility is strictly linked to reactor efficiency, energy consumption, environmental impact and overall cost. In the present work, the optimization of lipid extraction from Nannochloropsis gaditana microalga is investigated. Results: A series of selected solvent mixtures and procedures have been tested and compared. Conventional extraction procedures with chloroform/methanol mixtures and fast US- and MW-assisted extractions with methanol gave comparable fatty acid (FA) w/w% from dried microalgae. The highest extraction yield and lowest energy consumption was found to occur under MW irradiation, especially at high temperatures and under pressure. Conclusion: This study highlights the advantages of US- and MW-assisted lipid extraction from microalgae, both in terms of efficiency and operational costs. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Catalytic co-pyrolysis of particle board, a waste wood biomass, and polypropylene (PP), a petroleum-based plastic, was carried out with a mixing ratio of 1:1 over a representative mesoporous material, Al-MCM-41 catalyst. The Si/Al ratios of the Al-MCM-41 catalysts were controlled at 20 and 80 to investigate the effect of the acidity of the catalyst. The characterization of the catalyst was performed by X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption, and NH3 temperature-programmed desorption. The catalytic pyrolysis of the particle board showed a higher yield of gas and lower yield of oil than the non-catalytic pyrolysis. In oil, the concentration of levoglucosan decreased, and those of furans, furanones, cyclopentanones, aromatics, and light phenolics increased. In the case of the co-pyrolysis of the particle board and PP, C10 -C17 products corresponding to the diesel range greatly increased and resulted in an improvement of the bio-oil quality. This suggests that PP is decomposed on the acidic sites of the Al-MCM-41 catalyst, resulting in an increased production of hydrocarbons in the range of diesel. © 2014 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

AB  - A technical evaluation of a plant for biodiesel production from microalgae was investigated in which a novel configuration of a CPR (closed pond photobioreactor) is proposed. The entire process was simulated by Aspen Plus® and optimized energetically in order to obtain the best profits in energy terms.The design and sizing of the process equipment was performed to obtain a realistic estimation of costs, considering both CAPEX (capital costs) and OPEX (operating costs). The economic analysis evaluated the profitability of the complete process at industrial scale referred to a CPR of 1km2 of surface area as the base for calculation. In order to ensure an acceptable economic profitability a sale price of oil of $ 18.35/gal was obtained, corresponding to $ 21.11/gal of biodiesel.These results were compared to those of other recent studies, confirming that at the current state of technology the production of biodiesel from microalgae is not competitive with respect to that of conventional diesel, and a breakthrough in technology is needed to bridge this gap maybe by means of other valuable co-products from the same process. A future outlook is eventually reported. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Liquid bio-oils were produced from miscanthus (. Miscanthus sacchariflorus) by fast pyrolysis at various temperature ranges (350-500°C) with a short residence time and their physicochemical properties were determined to evaluate the potentials for biofuel utilization. Before operating fast pyrolysis, miscanthus was subjected to ICP-ES (inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer) analysis and TGA (thermogravimetric analysis). It was learned that miscanthus was thermally unstable due to large amounts of inorganic constituents including potassium (5643.8ppm), calcium (711.0ppm) and magnesium (1403.1ppm). With fast pyrolysis, the yield of bio-oil gradually decreased with increasing temperature and residence time. The maximum yield of bio-oil was ca. 58.9 wt% at 350°C with a residence time of 1.9s. The HHV (higher heating value) of bio-oil was determined up to 18.0MJ/kg produced at 400°C with a residence time of 1.9s. The water content of bio-oil was ranged from 21.1 to 56.9wt%. GC/MS (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry) analysis showed that bio-oil was mostly composed of carbohydrate derivatives and lignin derivatives. 1-(Acetyloxy)-2-butanone, furfural, dihydro-methy-furanone and levoglucosan were the predominant low molecular weight compounds that originated from carbohydrate and those from lignin were guaiacol 4-vinylphenol and syringol. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper provides a critical review of the palm biodiesel landscape in Malaysia. The palm industry is a key source of revenue for the country, where in 2009 the industry was responsible for generating 8% of the gross national income per capita. The interest in palm-based biodiesel can be traced back to the early 1980s however it was only in 2006 that Malaysia officially formulated its first National Biofuel Policy as a strategic government intervention to drive development and implementation of palm biodiesel as substitute to regular fossil-based diesel. As at January 2013, the implementation of the biodiesel mandate (at 5% concentration) has been limited to the Klang Valley central region only. But there are plans for a much wider roll-out and at higher concentration blends in 2014. The policy in its current form assumes that all biofuels are sustainable and therefore fails to provide assurances that the fossil diesel will be replaced by a more sustainable energy source. Here it has been argued that a market-based policy approach would be better than a technology-forcing mechanism. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microbial fermentation is emerging as an increasingly important resource for the production of fatty acids to serve as precursors for renewable diesel as well as detergents, lubricants and other industrial chemicals, as an alternative to traditional sources of reduced carbon such as petroleum. A major disadvantage of fuels derived from biological sources is their undesirable physical properties such as high cloud and pour points, and high viscosity. Here we report the development of an Escherichia coli strain that efficiently produces anteiso-branched fatty acids, which can be converted into downstream products with lower cloud and pour points than the mixtures of compounds produced via the native metabolism of the cell. This work addresses a serious limitation that must be overcome in order to produce renewable biodiesel and oleochemicals that perform as well as their petroleum-based counterparts. © 2014 .

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. is the subject of many research and breeding programs concerned with its potential as an oil crop for biodiesel production. Despite an increasing amount of information regarding this relatively new crop, pollination requirements of this plant are largely neglected. The aim of the study was to evaluate the relative significance of ants and honeybees as potential pollinators of J. curcas grown under Mediterranean conditions. Jatropha curcas plants bloomed throughout the summer and fall, peaking twice, in early summer and late fall. During this period, the plants were visited by 70 species of insects representing 45 families from seven orders, with most species rarely being observed. Ants and Honeybees were the most common species, accounting for >95% of all flower visits. The foraging behavior of the honeybees followed the pattern of bloom phenology, especially during the summer, and mostly promoted cross-pollination. Ants on the other hand, mostly promoted self pollination showing no such correlative behavior, reacting often too late to nectar availability, and were highly susceptible to climatic changes. Pollinator exclusion treatments revealed that during summer, fruit and seed sets, as well as seed size and oil and protein contents, were relatively similar for ant and bee-pollinated flowers. During fall, however, reproductive success of bee-pollinated flowers was relatively high (66%), while fruit set of ant-pollinated flowers was significantly reduced from 71 to 11%. In conclusion, while both groups are equal in their pollination effectiveness in the summer, during the fall the honeybees are almost the sole pollinators of the plant. Based on bloom phenology and pollination activity data, the honeybees are responsible for the pollination of more than 80% of the annual reproductive potential of J. curcas, under Mediterranean conditions. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Fuel production from plastics is a promising way to reduce landfilling rates while obtaining valuable products. The usage of Ni-supported hierarchical Beta zeolite (h-Beta) for the hydroreforming of the oils coming from LDPE thermal cracking has proved to produce high selectivities to gasoline and diesel fuels (&gt;80%). In the present work, the effect of the Ni loading on Ni/h-Beta is investigated in the hydroreforming of the oils form LDPE thermal cracking. h-Beta samples were impregnated with Ni nitrate, calcined and reduced in H2 up to 550°C to achieve different Ni contents: 1.5%, 4%, 7% and 10%. Larger and more easily reducible metal particles were obtained on Ni 7%/h-Beta and Ni 10%/h-Beta. Hydroreforming tests were carried out in autoclave reactor at 310°C, under 20bar H2, for 45min. Ni content progressively increased the amount of gases at the expenses of diesel fractions, while gasoline remained approximately constant about 52-54%. Maximum selectivity to automotive fuels (~81%) was obtained with Ni 7%/h-Beta. Ni loading also enhanced olefins saturation up to Ni 7%/h-Beta. High cetane indices (71-86) and octane numbers (89-91) were obtained over all the catalysts. Regarding the different studied Ni contents, Ni 7%/h-Beta constitutes a rather promising catalyst for obtaining high quality fuels from LDPE thermal cracking oils. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, corn oil as vegetable oil, chicken fat and fleshing oil as animal fats were used to produce methyl ester in a biodiesel pilot plant. The FFA level of the corn oil was below 1% while those of animal fats were too high to produce biodiesel via base catalyst. Therefore, it was needed to perform pretreatment reaction for the animal fats. For this aim, sulfuric acid was used as catalyst and methanol was used as alcohol in the pretreatment reactions. After reducing the FFA level of the animal fats to less than 1%, the transesterification reaction was completed with alkaline catalyst. Due to low FFA content of corn oil, it was directly subjected to transesterification. Potassium hydroxide was used as catalyst and methanol was used as alcohol for transesterification reactions. The fuel properties of methyl esters produced in the biodiesel pilot plant were characterized and compared to EN 14214 and ASTM D6751 biodiesel standards. According to the results, ester yield values of animal fat methyl esters were slightly lower than that of the corn oil methyl ester (COME). The production cost of COME was higher than those of animal fat methyl esters due to being high cost biodiesel feedstock. The fuel properties of produced methyl esters were close to each other. Especially, the sulfur content and cold flow properties of the COME were lower than those of animal fat methyl esters. The measured fuel properties of all produced methyl esters met ASTM D6751 (S500) biodiesel fuel standards. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Making full use of lipid and carbohydrate in microalgae for joint production of biodiesel and bioethanol may create a potential way to cut the high cost of single biofuel production from microalgae. Compared with conventional unicellular oleaginous microalgae, filamentous microalgae Tribonema sp. is richer in lipid and carbohydrate contents and lower protein content, thus, this study explores the suitability of Tribonema sp. as a substrate for joint production of biodiesel and bioethanol. Acid hydrolysis is the key step to saccharify wall cell into fermentable sugar and release lipid. Microalgae biomass (50g/L) was acid (3% H2SO4) hydrolyzed at 121°C for 45min to reach the maximum hydrolysis efficiency (81.48%). Subsequently, the lipid separated with hexane-ethanol from the hydrolysate was converted into microalgae biodiesel and the conversion rate was 98.47%. With yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the maximum ethanol yield of 56.1% was reached from 14.5g/L glucose in hydrolysate. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In order to address increasing greenhouse gas emissions, the future fossil fuel shortage and increasingly stringent pollutant emission regulations, a variety of biofuels are being progressively incorporated into conventional transportation fuels. Despite the beneficial impact of biofuels on most regulated pollutants, their combustion induces the increase of a variety of aldehydes that are being considered for specific regulations due to their high toxicity. One of the most hazardous aldehyde compounds is acrolein, C 2H3CHO. Despite its high toxicity and increased formation during bioalcohol and biodiesel combustion, no experimental data are available for acrolein combustion. In the present study, we have investigated the ignition of acrolein-oxygen-argon mixtures behind reflected shock wave using three simultaneous emission diagnostics monitoring OH*, CH * and CO2*. Experiments were performed over a range of conditions: Φ = 0.5-2; T5 = 1178-1602 K; and P5 = 173-416 kPa. A tentative detailed reaction model, which includes sub-mechanisms for the three measured excited species, was developed to describe the high-temperature chemical kinetics of acrolein oxidation. Reasonable agreement was found between the model prediction and experimental data. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The process of the catalytic hydroconversion of vegetable oil (CHVO) involves the transformation of vegetable oil triglycerides to linear chain alkanes via hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reactions followed by conventional hydrocracking reaction pathways to generate multiple hydrocarbon compounds similar to heavy vacuum oil. The CHVO process was applied to Jatropha curcas oil using commercial hydrodesulfurization (HDS) Co-Mo/Al2O3 and Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalysts under HDS operating conditions. The reaction products (i.e., intermediates and final compounds) from the hydroconversion of J. curcas seed oil triglycerides were identified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy. The CHVO process was performed using both HDS catalysts. The process occurs through three reaction pathways including decarbonylation, decarboxylation and hydrodeoxygenation in which the carboxyl group is removed from the fatty acids to produce products similar to fossil fuels. The presence of intermediate deoxygenation products, such as aldehydes, suggests a sequential triglyceride hydrodeoxygenation mechanism. Then, the fully deoxygenated intermediates undergo hydrocracking and hydroisomerization reactions via carbenium ion chemistry to generate renewable petroleum products that are equivalent to liquid fuels such as gasoline, jet fuel and diesel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The oleaginous composition and alcohol used in transesterification have substantial impact on biodiesel properties. This study involves palm oil and its crystallization fractions, olein and stearin oils, with methyl, ethyl, isopropyl and benzyl alcohols, as we seek to investigate the influence of the alcohol on the cold properties, thermal stability, density and viscosity of the resulting biofuel. The products were characterized by GC and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Biofuels produced from the olein oil fraction have superior cold properties compared to those synthesized from palm oil and the palm stearin oil fraction; these properties are attributable to the higher unsaturated contents, which cause the isopropyl biodiesel from palm to exhibit a higher cold filter plugging point (0.3 °C). The use of benzyl alcohol yields a biofuel with high thermal stability but also high viscosity and density values that do not adhere to any international specifications for biodiesel.©2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effects on combustion and emissions of a bio-derivable glycerol-based ethers mixture (GEM) usable in a compression ignition engine have been investigated. The tests were performed on a single cylinder research engine derived from a Euro5 compliant four cylinder engine for passenger car application. The experimental methodology has considered the comparison among three fuels: (1) a reference diesel; (2) a mixture consisting of 90. vol.% diesel and 10. vol.% of GEM; (3) a blend consisting of 80. vol.% diesel and 20. vol.% of GEM. The tests were carried out in some characteristic key points of the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) emission homologation cycle. These points allowed an estimation of the blend impact on the performance of a real four-cylinder engine (one cylinder of which is represented by the research engine) over the NEDC. Both regulated and unregulated pollutant emissions have been measured during the test campaign. In particular, apart from the regulated emissions, the concentration of aldehydes and carbonaceous particles at the engine exhaust has been determined in some test points. The results have shown the possibility to burn the diesel/GEM blends without any significant impact on combustion characteristics and efficiencies, while, due to the oxygen content of the GEM, important benefits were obtained in terms of NOx-PM trade-off and emissions of particles at the exhaust. At medium-high load conditions, there was a maximum decrease of about 70% in terms of PM emissions compared to a slight increase of NOx. At low load conditions, a maximum increase of HC and CO of about 50% has been detected. Regarding the emissions of aldehydes, the results showed that the GEM addition favoured the increasing of carbonyl compounds at low engine loads, while at higher loads no significant variation has been detected by burning GEM. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Rhodotorula glutinis CCT 2182, Rhodosporidium toruloides CCT 0783, Rhodotorula minuta CCT 1751 and Lipomyces starkeyi DSM 70296 were evaluated for the conversion of sugars from Brazilian molasses into single-cell oil (SCO) feedstock for biodiesel. Pulsed fed-batch fermentations were performed in 1.65 l working volume bioreactors. The maximum specific growth rate (µmax), lipid productivity (Pr) and cellular lipid content were, respectively, 0.23 h−1, 0.41 g l−1 h−1, and 41 % for Rsp. toruloides; 0.20 h−1, 0.27 g l−1 h−1, and 36 % for Rta. glutinis; 0.115 h−1, 0.135 g l−1 h−1, and 27 % for Rta. minuta; and 0.11 h−1, 0.13 g l−1 h−1, and 32 % for L. starkeyi. Based on their microbial lipid productivity, content, and profile, Rsp. toruloides and Rta. glutinis are promising candidates for biodiesel production from Brazilian molasses. All the oils from the yeasts were similar to the composition of plant oils (rapeseed and soybean) and could be used as raw material for biofuels, as well as in food and nutraceutical products. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The climate impact assessment of vehicle/fuel systems may be incomplete without considering short-lived climate forcers of black carbon (BC) and primary organic carbon (POC). We quantified life-cycle BC and POC emissions of a large variety of vehicle/fuel systems with an expanded Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation model developed at Argonne National Laboratory. Life-cycle BC and POC emissions have small impacts on life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of gasoline, diesel, and other fuel vehicles, but would add 34, 16, and 16 g CO2 equivalent (CO2e)/mile, or 125, 56, and 56 g CO2e/mile with the 100 or 20 year Global Warming Potentials of BC and POC emissions, respectively, for vehicles fueled with corn stover-, willow tree-, and Brazilian sugarcane-derived ethanol, mostly due to BC- and POC-intensive biomass-fired boilers in cellulosic and sugarcane ethanol plants for steam and electricity production, biomass open burning in sugarcane fields, and diesel-powered agricultural equipment for biomass feedstock production/harvest. As a result, life-cycle GHG emission reduction potentials of these ethanol types, though still significant, are reduced from those without considering BC and POC emissions. These findings, together with a newly expanded GREET version, help quantify the previously unknown impacts of BC and POC emissions on life-cycle GHG emissions of U.S. vehicle/fuel systems. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, KOH/bentonite catalysts, prepared by the impregnation method, were studied for transesterification in a continuous reactor. The catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption/ desorption, CO2 temperature programmed desorption, and X-ray fluorescence. The results showed that the addition of 20 wt% K on the bentonite catalyst at 60°C reaction temperature, methanol/oil molar ratio of 15:1, and flow rate of 0.3 ml/min gave a biodiesel content exceeding 75%. With increasing basicity, the presence of K2O was observed, and the biodiesel content was improved. In addition, there was negligible loss in activity when the catalyst was operated at 60°C for 7 days. A minimum level of potassium leaching on the 20 wt% K/bentonite was observed during the run. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this study, safflower seed oil for biodiesel production is examined. The oil extraction process from safflower seeds and transesterification process for biodiesel production are investigated. Although, there are many factors related with the production of the biodiesel, the four factors are only determined such as molar ratio of alcohol to oil, catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, and reaction time. Taguchi experimental design is used for the production of safflower seed oil methyl ester by using process parameter optimization. The orthogonal array, signal/noise (S/N) ratio and analysis of variances are employed to find out the optimal process parameters. The optimal conditions of process parameters are determined as 1:6 molar ratio of alcohol to oil, catalyst concentration 0.3 wt %, 60°C reaction temperature, and 45-min reaction time by using NaOH as catalyst in experimental studies. According to Taguchi method, the most efficient process parameter is molar ratio of alcohol to oil in producing safflower seed oil methyl ester. Finally, the conversion rate of safflower seed oil methyl ester is produced to 98% with the optimal conditions of the process parameters, which are obtained by Taguchi method. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Catalytic upgrading was applied to the liquid product obtained from biomass fast pyrolysis (raw bio-oil) in a continuous reaction system by using dolomite as a low-cost catalyst. The upgrading reactor operates at atmospheric pressure without external H2 supply and consists of a thermal treatment section, where pyrolytic lignin is deposited, and a catalytic upgrading section, where the thermally treated oil is valorized in-line. The reaction products, i.e., solid (pyrolytic lignin), gases, and upgraded oil, are collected separately after each reaction. The effect that temperature (400-700°C) and time on stream (up to 4 h) have on the yield and composition of the products obtained was analyzed for a space-time of 2.4 gdolomite h/gfeed. The dolomite effectively reduced the O/C ratio and removed the carboxylic acids and sugars (mainly levoglucosan) contained in the bio-oil. A gaseous product interesting as a fuel and as raw material for syngas production was obtained below 600°C, provided that dolomite is not saturated (efficient CO2 capture). Thus, for reaction times of ≈2 h the concentration values in the 400-500°C range are H2 (5-12%), CO (48-38%), CO2 (2.2-3.2%), and CH4 (23-31%). A good deoxygenation level (≈70%) was achieved after 0.5 h reaction at 600°C, yielding oil with the O/C ratio ≈ 0.25 and composed of acetone (22%), phenol (51%), and alkyl-substituted phenols (22%). Upgraded oil with low O/C ratio (≈0.21) and high contents of phenol (86.4%) and alkyl-phenols (5.3%) was obtained after 4 h of reaction at 700°C. This oil has a promising potential for use in phenolic resins formulation and diesel fuel blending. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Direct utilization of crude glycerol, a major byproduct in biodiesel industry, becomes imperative, because its production has outpaced the demand recently. We demonstrated that the oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides Y4 had a great capacity to convert glycerol into lipids with high yield using the two-stage production process. Significantly higher cell mass and lipid yield were observed when the media were made with synthetic crude glycerol than pure glycerol. The process achieved a lipid yield of 0.22gg-1 glycerol, which was comparable with the lipid yield using glucose as the substrate. Lipid samples showed similar fatty acid compositional profiles to those of vegetable oils, suggesting that such microbial lipids were potential feedstock for biodiesel production. Our data provided an attractive route to integrate biodiesel production with microbial lipid technology for better resource efficiency and economical viability. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper a techno-economic and environmental analysis for a biorefinery based on Oil palm is presented in non-bioenergy regions of Colombia as a case study. Different scenarios, based on process sequences, were modelled and assessed. This includes a standalone biodiesel plant, a biodiesel plant with mass integration, a multiproduct portfolio to produce biodiesel, ethanol, and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate, and the multiproduct portfolio plus mass integration. The configuration with the best economic and environmental performance was the multiproduct portfolio plus mass integration. For this case, the obtained economic margin was 64.5% (1.33 fold higher than standalone ethanol production), the potential environmental impact (PEI) was 156.42 PEI/t products and 0.51 t CO2eq/m3 of biodiesel. On the other hand, the feedstock transportation was included to measure the influence on economics and carbon footprint indicator. For a travelled distance of 300 km the economic margin is decreased to 1.31%, and the carbon footprint increased up to 0.59 t CO 2eq/m3 of biodiesel for scenario 4. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Using biodiesel/diesel fuel blends and multiple injection strategies in diesel engines have shown promising results in improving the trade-off relationship between nitrous oxides and particulate matters. In order to explain the effect of both technologies on exhaust emissions and to develop adequate control strategies, the behavior of the injection process needs to be thoroughly understood. This paper proposes a simplified model of an indirect-acting piezoelectric diesel injector. The objective was to build a model that can predict the highly transient effect of short injection events and the impact of biodiesel with sufficient precision while being sufficiently fast to be implemented in an engine control unit (ECU) for real-time closed-loop flow-rate monitoring. The model was validated against experimental results for different injection pressures as well as different energizing times (ETs) and dwell times (DTs). When comparing the use of biodiesel against diesel, simulation of the needle lift showed that there was a critical ET for which both fuels yielded the same injection duration. For shorter energizing times, the biodiesel injection duration was shorter than for diesel, while longer energizing times presented the opposite behavior. The injection duration for the different blends falls between the pure-fuel situations. The use of constant properties (density, viscosity) and constant discharge coefficient (Cd) showed no major loss in the precision of the flow-rate estimation, but revealed a great gain in calculus time while the use of pressure dependent bulk modulus proved to be essential in order to have no drastic changes in the final predictions. Finally, the model presented in this study showed that it could estimate with sufficient precision the opening and closing delay of different biodiesel/diesel blends for multiple injection strategies while yielding a calculus time enabling implementation in an ECU. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The use of microalgae as feedstocks for biodiesel is potentially limited by climatic conditions with low light and temperature levels. Monoraphidium sp. Dek19 was identified by 18S rRNA gene sequencing. This is a species indigenous to the upper Midwestern USA which grows to high densities in wastewater with bioremediation resulting in a reduction of nitrate and phosphate levels. Mesocosm pool cultures (171L) were used to characterize growth of this species in larger volumes than typical of previous lab-based studies. The alga was shown to be cold-tolerant and to grow to workable density within 15days at relatively low light intensities in sterilized treated effluent. It was harvested by FeCl3 flocculation and filtration, and lipid content was measured at 26% of dry weight. Pool cultures yielded enough biomass to extract lipids and transesterify them to biodiesel for testing in a stationary engine. GC analysis showed FAMEs produced from Monoraphidium sp. to have a similar fatty acid profile to soybean oil. Engine testing of this algal biodiesel in blends with petrodiesel showed a significant reduction in NOx emissions. The results of this study indicate in general that searching for species of algae adapted to local environments is a good strategy for developing biodiesel feedstocks, and specifically that Monoraphidium sp. Dek19 represents a species isolate that could be used to produce this fuel economically using wastewater in Northern locations with cool climates. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There is a consensus that particulate matter and gases pollutants originating from industry and vehicle emission processes in urban areas are important from the point of view of public health and climate change. Local anthropogenic emissions, especially those resulting from energy generation processes from the industrial and transport sector, are connected with those occurring at the regional and global scales. A major concern in the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP) is the impact of the large scale use of ethanol as a fuel and as an additive for Otto vehicles. In this study, atmospheric concentrations of ozone, nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2), formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were measured in the MASP in Brazil, over four seasons in 2012 and 2013. The results were compared with data collected in previous studies. Our results demonstrate that, although there was a large increase in the number of vehicles in the MASP that use ethanol ("flex-fuel" vehicles), technological advances in vehicle emissions control have prevented any significant increase in the atmospheric concentrations of aldehydes. In addition, an increase in the formaldehyde/acetaldehyde ratio has been observed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of engines is necessary to keep the world moving. Such engines are fed mainly by fossil fuels, among these, the diesel. The operation and the behavior of engines in different thermodynamic cycles, with common fossil fuels, it is still challenging but, in general, it has well known and documented data. On the other hand, for alternative fuels, there is still demand of experimental data, particularly considering that it is desirable, most of the times, the use of a system with dual mode (reversible). Such systems are called Dual-Fuel, it brings a greater degree of freedom, but imply in technological challenges. In this paper we used an engine operating with single cylinder direct injection diesel and port ethanol injection system in Dual-Fuel mode with a 100% electronically controlled calibration. The methodology applied was, once the engine calibration was given to achieve the best specific fuel consumption or the MBT (Maximum Brake Torque) in each load condition, to gradually substitute the diesel oil by ethanol in compliance with the requirements established. Comparisons were made among working conditions considering the rate of diesel substitution and the energy indicated efficiency. Initially, the flow structure in the combustion chamber was tested in both 'quiescent' and high "swirl" modes. Compression ratios were adjusted at 3 different levels: 14:1, 16:1 and 17:1. It was tested two injectors, the first one of 35 g/s and another of 45 g/s. Regarding pressure diesel injection, 4 levels were investigated namely 800, 1000, 1200 and 1400 bar. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present work is a continuation of the earlier published results by authors on the investigation of Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (HVO) on a High Efficiency Diesel Combustion System (SAE Int. J. Fuels Lubr. Paper No. 2013-01-1677 and JSAE Paper No. 283-20145128). In order to further validate and interpret the previously published results of soot microstructure and its consequences on oxidation behavior, the test program was extended to analyze the impact of soot composition, optical properties, and physical properties such as size, concentration etc. on the oxidation behavior. The experiments were performed with pure HVO as well as with petroleum based diesel and today's biofuel (i.e. FAME) as baseline fuels. The soot samples for the different analyses were collected under constant engine operating conditions at indicated raw NOx emissions of Euro 6 level using closed loop combustion control methodology. The oxidation behavior results of optimized Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) correspond well with the previously published (part-1) results of the kinetics of soot oxidation (i.e. activation energy, reaction rate constant and regen. temperature) conducted on a Laboratory Gas Test Bench using a Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO).The results suggest that the soot oxidation temperatures of the HVO decreased by ∼43 °C and 37 °C with O2 and NO2 respectively, as compared to petroleum based diesel. Finally, the relationship of the PM physico-chemical properties (i.e. O2 content, C/O ratio, C/H ratio and microstructure parameters) is compared with the trends of the oxidation behavior. The overall results from the present work suggest that the oxidative behavior of a specific type of soot cannot be estimated based on a singular characteristic but is more dependent on a set of soot properties.

AB  - This paper presents the results of theoretical and experimental studies of the combustion of rapeseed methyl ester droplets in comparison with mineral diesel fuel. Droplets of 0.7–1.2 mm diameter were investigated. The effect of the oxidizer equivalence ratio in the range of 1.7–4.0 on the duration of droplet combustion was analyzed using the model of combustion of droplets in an adiabatic shell taking into account Stefan flow. It is shown that the burning time of rapeseed methyl ester droplets is smaller than that of diesel fuel droplets, all other things being equal. © 2014, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Recent research has proposed integrating wastewater treatment with algae cultivation as a way of producing algal biofuels at a commercial scale more sustainably. This study evaluates the environmental performance of wastewater-based algal biofuels with a well-to-wheel life cycle assessment (LCA). Production pathways examined include different nutrient sources (municipal wastewater influent to the activated sludge process, centrate from the sludge drying process, swine manure, and freshwater with synthetic fertilizers) combined with emerging biomass conversion technologies (microwave pyrolysis, combustion, wet lipid extraction, and hydrothermal liquefaction). Results show that the environmental performance of wastewater-based algal biofuels is generally better than freshwater-based algal biofuels, but depends on the characteristics of the wastewater and the conversion technologies. Of 16 pathways compared, only the centrate cultivation with wet lipid extraction pathway and the centrate cultivation with combustion pathway have lower impacts than petroleum diesel in all environmental categories examined (fossil fuel use, greenhouse gas emissions, eutrophication potential, and consumptive water use). The potential for large-scale implementation of centrate-based algal biofuel, however, is limited by availability of centrate. Thus, it is unlikely that algal biofuels can provide a large-scale and environmentally preferable alternative to petroleum transportation fuels without considerable improvement in current production technologies. Additionally, the cobenefit of wastewater-based algal biofuel production as an alternate means of treating various wastewaters should be further explored. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel is increasingly considered as an alternative for fossil diesel. Biodiesel can be produced from rapeseed, palm, sunflower, soybean and algae. In this study, the consequences of large-scale production of biodiesel from micro-algae for eutrophication in four large European seas are analysed. To this end, scenarios for the year 2050 are analysed, assuming that in the 27 countries of the European Union fossil diesel will be replaced by biodiesel from algae. Estimates are made for the required fertiliser inputs to algae parks, and how this may increase concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in coastal waters, potentially leading to eutrophication. The Global NEWS (Nutrient Export from WaterSheds) model has been used to estimate the transport of nitrogen and phosphorus to the European coastal waters. The results indicate that the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the coastal waters may increase considerably in the future as a result of large-scale production of algae for the production of biodiesel, even in scenarios assuming effective waste water treatment and recycling of waste water in algae production. To ensure sustainable production of biodiesel from micro-algae, it is important to develop cultivation systems with low nutrient losses to the environment. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study shows the results obtained from emission and air dispersion modelling of acetaldehyde in the city of Oslo and associated with the circulation of bioethanol vehicles. Two scenarios of bioethanol implementation, both realistic and hypothetical, have been considered under winter conditions; 1) realistic baseline scenario, which corresponds to the current situation in Oslo where one bus line is running with bioethanol (E95; 95% ethanol-5% petrol) among petrol and diesel vehicles; and 2) a hypothetical scenario characterized by a full implementation of high-blend bioethanol (i.e. E85) as fuel for transportation, and thus an entire bioethanol fleet. The results indicate that a full implementation of bioethanol will have a certain impact on urban air quality due to direct emissions of acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde emissions are estimated to increase by 233% and concentration levels increase up to 650% with regard to the baseline. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Among the most formidable challenges to algal biofuels is the ability to harvest algae and extract intracellular lipids at low cost and with a positive energy balance. In this monograph, we construct two paradigms that contrast energy requirements and costs of conventional and cutting-edge Harvesting and Extraction (H&E) technologies. By application of the parity criterion and the moderate condition reference state, an energy-cost paradigm is created that allows 1st stage harvesting technologies to be compared with easy reference to the National Alliance for Advanced Biofuels and Bioproducts (NAABB) target of $0.013/gallon of gasoline equivalent (GGE) and to the U.S. DOE's Bioenergy Technologies Office 2022 cost metrics. Drawing from the moderate condition reference state, a concentration-dependency paradigm is developed for extraction technologies, making easier comparison to the National Algal Biofuels Technology Roadmap (NABTR) target of less than 10% total energy. This monograph identifies cost-bearing factors for a variety of H&E technologies, describes a design basis for ultrasonic harvesters, and provides a framework to measure future technological advancements toward reducing H&E costs. Lastly, we show that ultrasonic harvesters and extractors are uniquely capable of meeting both NAABB and NABTR targets. Ultrasonic technologies require further development and scale-up before they can achieve low-cost performance at industrially relevant scales. However, the advancement of this technology would greatly reduce H&E costs and accelerate the commercial viability of algae-based biofuels. © 2014.

AB  - It is a comparative study on the effects of cultivation conditions in the simultaneous production of biodiesel and ethanol using microalga Chlorella sp. Intracellular lipid and reducing sugar were extracted from the biomass using the solvent extraction to conduct comparison of the yield, fatty acids profile configuration, and monosaccharide composition. The 27-days cultivation of Chlorella sp. in 20 ℓ photobioreactor under mixo-, hetero-, and autotrophic conditions presented the cell concentration, lipid and reducing sugar yield at 4.13, 2.10, 3.50 g•L-1, 24.1, 18.4, 16.7 (%, w/w), and 30.6, 27.5, 29.1 (%, w/w), respectively. Result shows that Chlorella sp. achieves the highest lipid and reducing sugar yield under the mixotrophic condition with 0.0369 and 0.0468 g•L-1•d-1, respectively. Also, Chlorella sp. when cultivated using the mixotrophic condition, builds better fatty acid and reducing sugar in the cell that can be synthesized for biodiesel and ethanol production. © 2014, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

AB  - This paper investigates the production of Nannochloropsis sp. algae at five different sites located in the southwestern region of the United States. Studies of the economic viability of algae production typically calculate the Capital and Operating Expenses of stylized algal production firms with minimal understanding of the linkages between production and input variables that drive the costs being estimated. These results work towards filling this gap by estimating several production functions using real world data. Our dataset includes 10,316. days of algae growth, from which we generate 495 growth period observations. Particularly, the study analyzes the relationship between variation in input factors over a growth period and the resulting algae production measured by ash free dry weight. We carry out several multivariate econometric regression analyses. The variables photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), length of growth periods, and the growth of Nannochloropsis salina result in increased algae production. Algae production at the Texas AgriLife at Texas A&M University in Pecos, Texas, and Flour Bluff, Texas, resulted in higher algae production than the three sites in New Mexico. Increases in the initial algae inoculation levels and average precipitation consistently indicated a negative relationship with algae production in our model. These results should be useful for further studies aiming to connect real world algae production decisions with measures of costs and profitability. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study aims to investigate the potential of nonedible oilseed Jatropha (Jatropha curcas) and Karanja (Pongamia pinnata) defatted residual biomasses (whole seed, kernel, and hull), as solid biofuel. These biomasses showed good carbon contents (39.8-44.5%), whereas, fewer amounts were observed for sulfur (0.15-0.90%), chlorine (0.64-1.76%), nitrogen (0.9-7.2%) and ash contents (4.0-8.7%). Their volatile matter (60.23-81.6%) and calorific values (17.68-19.98. MJ/kg) were found to be comparable to coal. FT-IR and chemical analyses supported the presence of good amount of cellulose, hemicellulose and lower lignin. The pellets prepared without any additional binder, showed better compaction ratio, bulk density and compressive strength. XRF analysis carried out for determination of slagging-fouling indices, suggested their ash deposition tendencies in boilers, which can be overcome significantly with the optimization of the blower operations and control of ash depositions. Thus, overall various chemical, physical properties, thermal decomposition, surface morphological studies and their high biofuel reactivity indicated that residual biomasses of Jatropha and Karanja seeds have high potential to be utilized as a solid biofuel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The composition of diesel exhaust has changed over the past decade due to the increased use of alternative fuels, like biodiesel, and to new regulations on diesel engine emissions. Given the changing nature of diesel fuels and diesel exhaust emissions, a need exists to understand the human health implications of switching to "cleaner" diesel engines run with particulate filters and engines run on alternative fuels like biodiesel. We exposed well-differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells to fresh, complete exhaust from a diesel engine run (1) with and without a diesel particulate filter and (2) using either traditional petro- or alternative biodiesel. Despite the lowered emissions in filter-treated exhaust (a 91-96% reduction in mass), significant increases in transcripts associated with oxidative stress and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon response were observed in all exposure groups and were not significantly different between exposure groups. Our results suggest that biodiesel and filter-treated diesel exhaust elicits as great, or greater a cellular response as unfiltered, traditional petrodiesel exhaust in a representative model of the bronchial epithelium. © The Author 2014.

AB  - Combustion characteristics of the two-dimensional simplified combustor were simulated numerically for methane, marsh gas and biomass gas, with introduction of standard k-ε turbulence model, eddy-dispassion turbulence combustion model and P-1 radiation heat transfer model. The temperature distribution, NOx mass fraction distribution, flow field structure in the combustor were analyzed to obtain the combustion characteristics of fuels with different calorific values by comparing the combustion situations of different cross sections. Results show that, under the condition of same mass flow of inlet air and fuel, the combustion temperature decreases with the decline of calorific value of fuels, the temperature distribution is more uniform, the NOx emissions are diminished, and the flow velocity is reduced; the proper regulation of excess air coefficient can improve the effect of combustion burning, and the temperature distribution still meets the law that combustion temperature of fuels with high calorific value is higher than that of fuels with low calorific value; the mixing of combustible components with different calorific values in biofuels syngas will change the calorific value of syngas, and the appropriate mixing ratio can play a better role for biofuels.

AB  - Three species of macroalgae were treated with the aim of reducing nitrogen, sulfur and ash within the biomass prior to hydrothermal processing. The treatments were the nutrient starvation of cultures and post-harvest washing of biomass in freshwater. Subsequently, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of macroalgae was carried out in a batch reactor heated for 8. min with a maximum temperature of 345. °C. Nutrient starvation effectively reduced nitrogen and sulfur levels within the biomass, which led to a reduction in nitrogen by 51-59. wt.% and sulfur by 64-88. wt.% within the biocrude. The yield of biocrude was highest for Derbesia at 38.6-41.7. wt.% and Oedogonium at 35.6-38.8. wt.% when not starved, but was reduced by up to 19. wt.% when the biomass was starved. The washing of biomass consistently reduced the ash content for all species by 7-83. wt.%. The removal of ash affected neither the quality nor the quantity of biocrude produced. The two treatments demonstrate that macroalgal biomass can be effectively manipulated in the production process to modify the composition of the feedstock and, consequently, improve the quality of biocrude. Additionally, reducing the ash content of biomass minimizes its potential impact on HTL processing equipment. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Methyl esters produced by transesterification of vegetable oils are the main components of biodiesel, an alternative, biodegradable, non-toxic biofuel produced from renewable resources. The use of solid catalysts allows the development of environmentally friendly processes to produce biodiesel. In this work, Zn,Al-mixed oxides with different Al/(Al+ Zn) molar ratios were studied as catalysts for the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol. TPD-CO2 (temperature programmed desorption of CO2) and model reactions such as retroaldolization of diacetone alcohol and 2-propanol transformation were employed to determine the basic properties of the catalysts. The catalytic activity was influenced by the chemical composition of the catalyst and showed a good correlation with basic site density determined by TPD-CO2. The RSM (response surface methodology) was used to select experimental conditions such as alcohol/oil molar ratio, reaction temperature, and catalyst loading that maximize fatty acid methyl esters yield. The best experimental conditions indicated by RSM were reaction temperature of 182.5°C, catalyst loading of 5.0wt.%, and alcohol/oil molar ratio of 45, that provided a biodiesel yield of 86% without significant leaching of the catalyst. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To enhance butanol tolerance and prevent productive degeneration in Clostridium acetobutylicum during long-term preservation, a novel approach called 1-butanol-glycerol storage was developed in this study. The viability, butanol tolerance and productivity of cells were investigated under each condition of storage within 12 months, respectively. The results suggested that the optimal condition of storage was in the solution containing 16 g L-1 butanol coupled with 200 g L-1 glycerol at 37 °C not -20 °C or 4 °C. Under this condition, C. acetobutylicum D64 primarily obtained the cell survival rate of 80% after 12 months. Unexpectedly, these cells still got an enhanced butanol tolerance of 32 g L-1 which was ~1 fold higher than the wild-type with butanol tolerance of 16 g L-1. Moreover, the butanol production has also got a little of increase but not dropped compared to the control. These results indicated this culture preservation method be available for enhancing butanol tolerance and preventing productive degeneration of C. acetobutylicum. © 2014.

AB  - This project aimed to develop a better understanding of acid catalyzed transesterification using various catalysts and evaluating the biodiesel reaction yield using simulated Jatropha oil made from Sesame seed oil, which has a similar composition. Five zeolites were compared: Y, 13-X, beta, mordenite, and ZSM-5. Non-catalyzed and homogeneously catalyzed reactions, with H2SO4, also were evaluated. Zeolites that were not in the hydrogen form were ion-exchanged, and were then analyzed by Energy-Dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy. Three alcohol-to-oil ratios were tested at atmospheric pressure and T = 115 °C for each catalyst in order to determine the influence of this parameter. All experiments were conducted in an airtight autoclave with butan-1-ol in order to obtain a biofuel whose cetane index was higher than regular petroleum-based diesels. Among the zeolites tested, the Y-type was the most efficient solid acid catalyst, and the final conversion reached after 3 h with a butanol-to-oil molar ratio of 15:1 was around 61%. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pine oil, synthesized from pine oleoresin, is recently being viewed as a potential renewable source of fuel for diesel engine application. Significantly, the estimated physical and thermal properties of pine oil are suited for its use in diesel engine, with the notable advantages of lower viscosity, boiling point and comparable calorific value with diesel. In this study, we decidedly conceived a strategy to blend it with a biodiesel, instead of diesel, so as to look out for double biofuel, a measure aimed at complete replacement of fossil fuels. As such, in the current investigation, KME (kapok methyl ester), a biodiesel derived from kapok oil, was blended with pine oil in various proportions such as B25P75, B50P50 and B75P25. Significantly, up on blending pine oil with KME, the viscosity, boiling point, cetane number and other properties of the resultant blends were found to be appropriate, as the merits and demerits of one biofuel over the other are mutually balanced. Therefore, the reported blends were subsequently tested for its combustion, performance and emission characteristics in a single cylinder diesel engine. From the experimental investigation, B50P50 blend was found to be amenable for its use in diesel engine without any modification, as the performance and combustion characteristics of the engine was found to be comparable with diesel. Further, the major emissions such as HC (hydrocarbon), CO (carbon monoxide) and smoke for B50P50 were observed to be 8.1%, 18.9% and 12.5% lower than diesel at full load condition, while NO. X (oxides of nitrogen) emission was in par with diesel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Palladium nanoparticles with size smaller than 10 nm were loaded on several supports including activated carbon (AC), MIL-101, TiO2, Al 2O3, and TiO2-activated carbon composites (TiO2-AC). These catalysts showed high activity in liquid phase hydrogenation of phenol. Their catalytic performances in transfer hydrogenation of phenol with formic acid under mild conditions (T = 50 °C and P &lt; 5 bar) were also tested for the purpose of in situ upgrading of bio-oil. The activity followed the trend of Pd/AC &gt; Pd/TiO2-AC &gt; Pd/MIL-101 &gt; Pd/TiO2 &gt; Pd/Al2O3. When 400 μL of formic acid was introduced into 10 mL of 0.25 M aqueous phenol solution, phenol can be fully hydrogenated on 200 mg of Pd/AC catalyst at 50 °C within 4 h, with 80% selectivity to cyclohexanone. The high activity of Pd/AC catalyst in hydrogen transfer makes it possible for in situ upgrading of bio-oil under mild conditions by converting unstable components (such as HCOOH and phenol) to stable ones (mainly cyclohexanone) which can then be potentially introduced into current refinery. In addition, the effect of formic acid on the hydrogenation activity of supported Pd catalysts was also reported. Presence of formic acid significantly decreased the hydrogenation activity of Pd supported on MIL-101 and oxides (TiO2 and Al2O3), probably due to the competitive adsorption of molecular formic acid with phenol on a single Pd site. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, effect of varying fuel injection pressures and injection timings on particulate size number distribution and spray characteristics was investigated in a single cylinder, common rail direct injection (CRDI) compression ignition (CI) engine fueled with Karanja biodiesel blends vis-à-vis baseline mineral diesel. The investigation results of spray tip penetration and spray area of biodiesel blends and diesel showed that higher fuel injection pressure result in a longer spray tip penetration and larger spray area than that at lower injection pressures at same elapsed time after the start of injection (SOI). In order to compare the effect of fuel injection parameters, 10, 20 and 50% Karanja biodiesel blends at 1500. rpm engine speed were compared with baseline data from mineral diesel. It was observed that average particulate size increased with retarding the SOI timings. Particulate number concentration was lowest for 10% biodiesel blend, which increased with further increase in biodiesel content in the blended test fuel. Addition of even very small quantity of biodiesel in the test fuel helped in reducing particulate emissions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Conversion of pyrolysis oil to hydrocarbons has been successfully performed under high hydrogen pressure in the presence of hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) catalysts at high heat. The high hydrogen pressures utilized are a more expensive application than for a lower hydrogen pressure. Development of a modified HDO method utilizing lower pressure hydrogen with the potential for reduction of hydrogen consumption would be economically beneficial to the process if equal or higher biofuel yields and quality are maintained. The method tested here is the oxidation pretreatment of raw bio-oil to increase carboxylic acids by conversion of aldehydes and ketones; phenols and other alcohols were also oxidized to some extent. This oxidation pretreatment of raw bio-oil allowed performance of the hydrotreating step with low hydrogen pressure and reduced hydrogen consumption. The hydrotreated oxidized bio-oil had a 30.5% higher organic fraction yield; char and water content were reduced by approximately 92.0% and 46.2%, respectively. The hydrotreated oxidized product was then hydrocracked at higher hydrogen pressure to produce mixed hydrocarbons found suitable for transportation fuels. The hydrocarbons produced had approximately a 181.9% HHV increase at 45.1 MJ/kg compared to raw bio-oil (16.0 MJ/kg). The acid value, water and oxygen contents of the hydrocarbons were reduced to approximately zero. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Diesel auto-thermal reformation (ATR) with solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack anode off-gas recycle (AOGR) has a reliable steam recycling supply to the reformer and improves overall system efficiency. For the lab-scale experiments, it is crucial to develop a cost-effective technique to simulate the AOGR effects on hydrocarbon catalytic reformation due to safety and cost considerations of providing the full recycle composition in the absence of fuel cell stack hardware. The present work combined thermodynamic modeling and experiments to compare diesel ATR performance with AOGR and with direct water/air inputs as recycle simulation (RS). Variations of input water and air flow were employed to simulate the effects of recycle gas on syngas production and to analyze the contribution of recycled CO2 dry reforming. A single-tube reformer with Rh/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst was used for diesel ATR experiments with a photo-acoustic micro-soot meter to monitor carbon formation in the reformate effluent. Experimental results suggest water and air input flows are two key variables to simulate performance of diesel ATR with AOGR, whereas gas hourly space velocity and reforming temperature do not significantly affect the recycle simulation process in syngas production. The optimum AOGR ratio for an SOFC stack with 65% fuel utilization was identified as 45% for diesel ATR to achieve maximum syngas production and reforming efficiency with a given input air flow. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We present long-term measurements of sub-micron particle number size distributions (PNSDs) conducted at an urban location, Kanpur, in India, from September 2007 to July 2011. The mean Aitken mode (NAIT), accumulation mode (NACCU), the total particle (NTOT), and black carbon (BC) mass concentrations were 12.4×103cm-3, 18.9×103cm-3, 31.9×103cm-3, and 7.96μgm-3, respectively, within the observed range at other urban locations worldwide, but much higher than those reported at urban sites in the developed nations. The total particle volume concentration appears to be dominated mainly by the accumulation mode particles, except during the monsoon months, perhaps due to efficient wet deposition of accumulation mode particles by precipitation. At Kanpur, the diurnal variation of particle number concentrations was very distinct, with highest during morning and late evening hours, and lowest during the afternoon hours. This behavior could be attributed to the large primary emissions of aerosol particles and temporal evolution of the planetary boundary layer. A distinct seasonal variation in the total particle number and BC mass concentrations was observed, with the maximum in winter and minimum during the rainy season, however, the Aitken mode particles did not show a clear seasonal fluctuation. The ratio of Aitken to accumulation mode particles, NAIT/NACCU, was varied from 0.1 to 14.2, with maximum during April to September months, probably suggesting the importance of new particle formation processes and subsequent particle growth. This finding suggests that dedicated long-term measurements of PNSDs (from a few nanometer to one micron) are required to systematically characterize new particle formation over the Indian subcontinent that has been largely unstudied so far. Contrarily, the low NAIT/NACCU during post-monsoon and winter indicated the dominance of biomass/biofuel burning aerosol emissions at this site. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pd/C catalyzed deoxygenation of castor oil fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), composed primarily from methyl ricinoleate, has been explored and optimized. Castor oil is a promising low cost feed stock for production of fuels. Under mild hydrogen pressure in the presence of hexane at supercritical conditions the main product was identified as heptadecane (a major diesel fuel component) using GC, GC-MS and FT-IR. Heptadecane formation proceeds not only by deoxygenation via decarbonylation, but also by hydrogenation of the double bond and the hydroxyl group of methyl ricinoleate. Based on intermediates identified in the reaction mixture, a plausible molecular mechanism for the catalytic deoxygenation process was proposed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Large amounts of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), benzene and toluene (BT) might be emitted from incomplete combustion reactions in both coal tar factories and biomass fuels in rural China. The health effects arising from exposure to PAHs and BT are a concern for residents of rural areas close to coal tar plants. To assess the environmental risk and major exposure sources, 100 coke plant workers and 25 farmers in Qujing, China were recruited. The levels of 10 mono-hydroxylated PAHs (OH-PAHs), four BT metabolites and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in the urine collected from the subjects were measured. The 8-OHdG levels in the urine were determined to evaluate the oxidative DNA damage induced by the PAHs and BT. The results showed that the levels of the OH-PAHs, particularly those of 1-hydroxynathalene and 1-hydroxypyrene, in the farmers were 1-7 times higher than those in the workers. The concentrations of the BT metabolites were comparable between the workers and farmers. Although the exact work location within a coke oven plant might affect the levels of the OH-PAHs, one-way ANOVA revealed no significant differences for either the OH-PAHs levels or the BT concentrations among the three groups working at different work sites. The geometric mean concentration (9.17. μg/g creatinine) of 8-OHdG was significantly higher in the farmers than in the plant workers (6.27. μg/g creatinine). The levels of 8-OHdG did not correlate with the total concentrations of OH-PAHs and the total levels of BT metabolites. Incompletely combusted biomass fuels might be the major exposure source, contributing more PAHs and BT to the local residents of Qujing. The estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of naphthalene and fluorene for all of the workers and most of the farmers were below the reference doses (RfDs) recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), except for the pyrene levels in two farmers. However, the EDIs of benzene in the workers and local farmers ranged from 590 to 7239. μg/day, and these levels were 2- to 30-fold higher than the RfDs recommended by the EPA. Biomass fuel combustion and industrial activities related to coal tar were the major sources of the PAH and BT exposure in the local residents. Using biomass fuels for household cooking and heating explains the higher exposure levels observed in the farmers relative to the workers at the nearby coal tar-related industrial facility. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We have performed experiments using a EURO 5 light passenger vehicle, operated over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Fuel blends containing 7% (B7) and 20% (B20) of biodiesel (84% soyabean/16% palm) in petroleum-based diesel were tested and compared with a diesel fuel (B0). The exhaust gases emissions were assessed for NO, NO2, SO2and volatile organic compounds (VOC), including a speciation analysis of VOC. The experiment reveals that biodiesel blends improve the combustion efficiency, NO and SO2emissions, and increasing NO2and total VOC emissions. The VOC speciation analysis suggests that the type and fraction of VOC existent in exhausted gases is fuel dependent, changing their presence and concentrations according to the fuel used. Additionally, the concentration of the three main VOC species in exhaust gases from B0 (benzene, toluene and octane) decrease 60-80% if a B20 blend is used. This experimental study contributes to a better characterization of the emission factors of EURO 5 light passenger vehicles using diesel/biodiesel blends and to a better understanding of the impact of the use of biodiesel blends on pollutant emissions. © 2014 WIT Press.

AB  - The global expansion of cultivation areas of Jatropha has contributed to the emergence of various diseases. Currently in Brazil, the occurrence of a new disease has been reported that not only reduces the productivity but also causes the death of Jatropha. This disease is associated with collar and root rot of plants. From morphological and phylogenetic studies (based on Internal Transcribed Spacers, β-tubulin and Translation Elongation Factor 1-α sequences), nine species of Botryosphaeriaceae were identified. These species include Lasiodiplodia egyptiacae, L. pseudotheobromae, L. theobromae, Macrophomina phaseolina, Neoscytalidium hyalinum and four Lasiodiplodia spp. that are proposed as new species (L. euphorbicola, L. jatrophicola, L.macrospora and L. subglobosa). All the species in this study, except M. phaseolina, are pathogenic. The results show that root rot of physic nut plants is caused by complex pathogens. This study provides new information for future studies of disease management, quarantine programs and, especially, the development of resistant varieties for collar and root rot disease in J. curcas. © 2014, Mushroom Research Foundation.

AB  - The retention characteristics of the major lipid components in biodiesels and edible oils as well as representative polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAHs) have been investigated on five different normal phase HPLC stationary phases, in order to optimize class separation for an automatized online HPLC cleanup of PAHs prior GC-MS analysis. By stepwise comparison of different hexane/MTBE compositions as mobile phases on cyano-, phenyl-, pentabromobenzyl-, nitrophenyl- and amino-modified silica columns, the capacity and selectivity factors for each analyte and column could be calculated. It was concluded that the most suitable column for backflush isolation of PAHs in biodiesel and edible oil matrices was the pentabromobenzyl-modified silica (PBB). A previously described online HPLC-GC-MS system using the PBB column was then evaluated by qualitative and quantitative analysis of a biodiesel exhaust particulate extract and a vegetable oil reference material. The GC-MS full scan analysis of the biodiesel particulate extract showed that the lipids had been removed from the sample and a fraction containing PAHs and oxygenated derivatives thereof had been isolated. Quantified mass fractions of PAHs of the reference material BCR-458 agreed well for most of the certified PAH mass fractions in the spiked coconut oil reference material. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study reports the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of stearic acid (SA) into paraffinic biofuel with synthesized palladium-oxalate zeolite supported catalyst (PdOx/Zeol). The PdOx/Zeol was synthesized via the functionalization of dihydrogen tetrachloropalladate (II) with aqueous oxalic acid (OxA) to form the polynuclear palladium(II) oxalate (PdOx), which was supported on zeolite. The SEM and XRD characterization results showed that the zeolite support is highly crystalline but loss some degree of crystallinity in the PdOx/Zeol sample after PdOx incorporation. The activity of the PdOx/Zeol tested on the HDO of SA showed that temperature, pressure, gas flow rate, and PdOx/Zeol loading have significant effects on the HDO process, and their best observed conditions were 360°C, 20 bar, 100 mL/min, and 25 mg, respectively to achieve 92% biofuel production from 35 g SA. The biofuel product distribution showed 71% n-C18H38, 18% iso-C18H38, and 3% C17H36. The presence of iso-C18H38, which is an excellent biofuel value-added-component due to its low freezing point, was ascribed to the functionalization of Pd with OxA, which increases PdOx/Zeol acidity. The results showed that PdOx/Zeol is a prospective catalyst toward further research and commercialization of HDO process of SA. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Several emulsions consisting of biomass pyrolysis oil (bio-oil) in diesel fuel were produced and analyzed for stability over time. An ultrasonic probe was used to generate microscopic droplets of bio-oil suspended in diesel fuel, and this emulsion was stabilized using surfactant chemicals. The most stable emulsion was produced using a polyethylene glycol dipolyhydroxystearate (PEG-DPHS) surfactant, with a hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) number of 4.75 and a 32:8:1 ratio of diesel to bio-oil to surfactant, i.e., 20% utilization of bio-oil. This emulsion consisted of uniformly sized droplets with an average diameter of 0.48 μm, with no observed coalescence of droplets after 1 week. If left undisturbed, these droplets would slowly settle to the bottom of the mixture at a rate of only 2.4 mm/day, but this settling can be eliminated with slight mechanical agitation. This level of stability facilitates utilization of 20 wt % raw bio-oil in diesel as a renewable liquid fuel for spray combustion without the need for costly and energy-intensive upgrading. Additionally, GC/MS analysis was used to investigate the relative concentrations of various bio-oil components in the emulsions. This analysis identified levoglucosan as a bio-oil component that may be responsible for the instability of the emulsions. Experiments with bio-oil produced by catalytic fast pyrolysis over HZSM-5 (CFP oil) revealed that the major components of this oil are directly miscible with diesel fuel without the need for an emulsion. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - There is interest in finding the flammability limits of ethanol at reduced pressures for the future use of this biofuel in aeronautical applications taking into account typical commercial aviation altitude (<40,000. ft). The lower and upper flammability limits (LFL and UFL, respectively) for hydrated ethanol and anhydrous ethanol (92.6% and 99.5% p/p, respectively) were determined for a pressure of 101.3. kPa at temperatures between 0 and 200. °C. A heating chamber with a spherical 20-l vessel was used. First, LFL and the UFL were determined as functions of temperature and atmospheric pressure to compare results with data published in the scientific literature. Second, after checking the veracity of the data obtained for standard atmospheric pressure, the work proceeded with reduced pressures in the same temperature range. 295 experiments were carried out in total; the first 80 were to calibrate the heating chamber and compare the results with those given in the published scientific literature. 215 experiments were performed both at atmospheric and reduced pressures. The results had a correlation with the values obtained for the LFL, but values for the UFL had some differences. With respect to the water content in ethanol, it was shown that the water vapor contained in the fuel can act as an inert substance, narrowing flammability. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Diminishing fossil fuel reserves and environmental concerns have stimulated research into biofuels as potential renewable and sustainable replacements for fossil diesel. The present research aimed to investigate the feasibility of using mustard biodiesel blends for energy generation in order to reduce air and noise pollution. Mustard biodiesel (MB) was produced from waste mustard oil and the physicochemical properties were investigated. MB showed a superior calorific value (40.40 MJ/kg), oxidation stability (16 h), cloud point (5 °C) and pour point (-18 °C) than any other conventional biodiesel. During engine performance tests, 10% and 20% MB blends showed 8-13% higher brake specific fuel consumption and 7-8% less brake power compared to diesel fuel. Engine emissions and noise tests showed 9-12% higher NO, 24-42% lower HC, 19-40% lower CO and 2-7% lower noise emission for MB blends compared to diesel fuel. Additionally, comparable engine performance and emission characteristics were found for 10% and 20% MB blends compared to same percentages of palm biodiesels, respectively. In conclusion, 10% and 20% MB blends can be used in diesel engines without modifications. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Enzymatic biodiesel production in supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) has recently received an increasing attention, as an alternative to the conventional chemical processes. In this study, enzymatic production of biodiesel from microalgal lipids was investigated in batch and integrated extraction-reaction systems. In the batch system, the effect of enzyme loading (15-50wt%), temperature (35-55°C) and methanol to lipid molar ratios (3-15:1) were studied, and response surface methodology was employed to optimize selected factors effect. The optimum transesterification yield of 80% was obtained at 47°C, 200bar, 35% enzyme loading, and 9:1 molar ratio after 4h reaction in the batch system. The experimental results were also used to determine the kinetics parameters of the Ping-Pong Bi Bi model, with methanol inhibition, suggested to describe the reaction. In the continuous integrated extraction-reaction system, the effect of methanol to lipids molar ratio was investigated, and enzyme operational stability and reusability were tested. Bed regeneration by tert-butanol washing was also assessed. The optimum methanol to lipid ratio was found to be 10:1. At this ratio, the enzyme was able to attain 78% of its original activity when reused for 6 continuous cycles, and the bed was successfully reused by washing with tert-butanol. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of non-conventional methods namely microwaves and ultrasound for extractive-transesterification of algal lipids (Chlorella, sp.) using ethanol as a solvent was investigated. Microwaves and ultrasound possess unique enhancing (thermal and non-thermal) mechanisms that can assist in successful and simultaneous extraction and transesterification of algal lipids in a very short reaction time. This paper presents a comparative study of microwave and ultrasound effects on the algal biodiesel production. The following conditions were determined as optimum through experimental studies: (1) microwaves - 1:12 algae to ethanol (wt./vol.) or 1:500 (molar) ratio; 2. wt.% catalyst; 5-6. min reaction time at 350. W microwave power; and (2) ultrasound - 1:6-9 algae to ethanol (wt./vol.) or 1:250-375 (molar) ratio; 2. wt.% catalyst; 6. min reaction time at 490. W ultrasound power. The highest fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) yields and conversions for microwave and ultrasound methods were 18.8%; 18.5% (yields) and 96.2%; 95.0% (conversions) respectively. In comparison, ultrasound method resulted in higher FAEE yield and conversion at low solvent ratios while microwaves were able to produce better results at lower power levels compared to ultrasound. The two methods performed better than the conventional bench-top Bligh and Dyer method which followed a two-step extraction and transesterification method with FAEE yields and conversions of 13.9% and 78.1% respectively. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass in the form of cashew nut shell represents a new and abundant energy source available in India. Cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) can be used as an alternative fuel for diesel engine. In this work, the CNSL was subjected to thermal cracking process at different temperatures to produce biofuel. The product obtained is called the thermal cracked cashew nut shell liquid (TC-CNSL). Experiments are conducted with blends of this biofuel and diesel to study the performance, emission and combustion characteristics of a direct injection (DI) diesel engine. In this study, the chemical composition of thermal cracked cashew nut shell liquid (TC-CNSL) was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrum (GC-MS) and Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic techniques. The experiments were conducted on a four stroke, single cylinder, water cooled, DI, Kirloskar AV-1, diesel engine at a speed rate of 1500 rpm. The brake thermal efficiency in neat diesel operation is high compared to neat biofuel (B100). The specific fuel consumption increased for neat biofuel compared to neat diesel. The HC and CO emissions decreased for biofuel blends compared to neat diesel. But the NOx emission increased for higher blends of biofuels namely B100 compared to diesel and lower blends. The rates of pressure rise and heat release are higher for B100 as compared to neat diesel. The combustion duration and ignition delay increased with neat biofuel as compared to neat diesel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In compression ignition engines, the quality of the spray atomization significantly affects the performance and emissions of the engine. The differences in thermo-physical properties of biodiesel have significant effect on both the internal nozzle flow and spray characteristics. In this study, the internal nozzle flow and spray characteristics of three major methyl esters found in various biodiesels, namely methyl oleate, methyl stearate, and methyl linoleate were studied as a representative of different biodiesels. A new hybrid spray model developed by coupling cavitation induced spray model with KHRT model in KIVA4 CFD code was used in this study. The model was validated against diesel spray characteristics obtained from the experiments conducted in house using constant volume spray chamber and good agreement was found. The internal flow simulations shows that methyl stearate cavitates the least followed by methyl oleate and linoleate. The spray simulations shows that spray tip penetration of methyl stearate is higher than other methyl esters and diesel because of its high viscosity and large droplet diameter. Methyl linoleate was found to atomize better than other esters and comparable to diesel. However at high ambient temperature, liquid length is highly dominated by both latent heat of vaporization and viscosity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Increased environmental awareness and depletion of resources are driving industry to develop viable fuels from renewable resources. Vegetable oils are one alternative being considered for the production of renewable fuels. Surfactant reverse micelle microemulsions can be used as an alternative method for reducing high viscosities of vegetable oil without chemical wastes generated from the transesterification reaction. The objective of this research is to study the effects of surfactant saturation, unsaturation, and ethylene oxide groups on the phase behavior, kinematic viscosity, and microemulsion-droplet size with the goal of formulating optimized surfactant based biofuel. Four nonionic surfactants, stearyl alcohol (saturated), oleyl alcohol (unsaturated), methyl oleate (unsaturated with ester group), and Brij-010 (EO groups), were investigated in this research. It was found that the presence of methyl oleate unsaturated surfactant can greatly reduce the bulk viscosity and produce uniformly size of microemulsion droplets while use the least amount of surfactant for solubilizing ethanol-in-oil in the system. Thus, these results show that reverse micelle microemulsion can produce biofuels with desirable viscosity and fuel properties as compared to diesel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work, the esterification of free fatty acids (FFA) in Zanthoxylum bungeanum seed oil (ZSO) with ethanol was performed and the effects of ethanol-to-oil molar ratio (8:1-32:1), catalyst amount (0.3-3.5% wt. of oil), reaction temperature (30-65°C), and reaction time (20-180 min) on the esterification of FFA were investigated. The acid value could not be reduced from beyond 40 mg KOH/g to less than 2 mg KOH/g by two-step sulfuric acid-catalyzed esterification with ethanol. Our results revealed that water formation during esterification was not a crucial factor inhibiting the completion of esterification. A novel technique to reduce acid value from above 40 mg KOH/g to less than 2 mg KOH/g was developed by using a second-step esterification with methanol. During the second-step esterification with methanol, some fatty acid ethyl esters were transformed into fatty acid methyl esters, which was confirmed by 1H NMR. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this study, oxidative desulfurization of sulfur compounds using hydrogen peroxide, phosphotungstic acid, and phase-transfer agent using high-intensity probe ultrasonication, and high shear mixer was investigated. The effect of agitation speed (7600-14,000 rpm), reaction temperature (50-70°C), and treatment time (10-30 min) on sulfur conversion was examined and optimized using response surface methodology. A box-behnken design was employed to determine the significance of various process parameters and their interactions using analysis of variance. Analytical results for the model sulfur compounds by ultrasound-assisted oxidative desulfurization and high shear showed comparable results. Both treatment systems provided a 98% conversion of dibenzothiopene and benzothiopene to polar sulfones at 70°C in 30 min. In both systems, the experimental data followed the pseudo-first-order equation with activation energy of 60 kJ°mol. Results indicate that ultrasound energy produce greater reaction rates when compared to mixing with no significant difference in activation energy. In addition, the advantages and drawbacks of ultrasound-assisted extraction with respect to the high shear oxidative desulfurization were discussed. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

A complete characterization of the catalyst including catalytic transesterification reaction was studied using gas chromatogram (GC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR). An optimum conversion of 94.2% was achieved at 95°C; methanol-oil molar ratio 12:1; 8 wt % catalyst in 75 min. It was found that the catalytic activity has the ability to compete with the other conventional heterogeneous catalysts. This study includes optimal conditions for the removal of the leached catalyst in biodiesel to enhance product purity. This reaction follows a first-order reaction kinetics. The rate constant and activation energy were determined. Fuel properties of biodiesel produced were determined and compared with ASTM standards. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Energy, Environment, and Economy are the 3E's which drive GDP growth of any country in the world. Energy security is the need of the hour due to high uncertainty prevailing globally, especially for countries like India which depend heavily on oil import to meet their growing energy needs. Use of edible bio-oil for biodiesel production may not be a viable option due to its high demand for cooking purpose. However, nonedible and discarded oils like rubber seed oil can be harnessed to supplement the increasing need for automobile fuels. High free fatty acid (FFA) content of the raw rubber seed oil increases the viscosity which makes it unsuitable for direct use in IC engines. The viscosity was reduced in two stage esterification process by conducting planned sets of experiment. The process parameters were optimized to maximize the oil yield. Fuel properties were ascertained by standard test procedure before conducting performance test in IC Engine. Better performance of the engine, while using biodiesel was found at the CR of 20. The results were compared with standard diesel for performance and emission standards. The emission analyses were done with standard procedure and found to be satisfactory. Biodiesel being an oxygenated fuel yields higher combustion efficiency, in spite of having slightly higher specific gravity than diesel. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - CelTherm is a biochemical process to produce renewable fuels and chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass. The present study's objective was to determine the level of treatment/purity of the microbial triacylglyceride oil (TAG) necessary to facilitate fuel production. After a unique microbe aerobically synthesizes TAG from biomass-derived sugars, the microbes were harvested and dried then crude TAG was chemically extracted from the residual biomass. Some TAGs were further purified to hydrotreating process requirements. Both grades were then noncatalytically cracked into a petroleum-like intermediate characterized by gas chromatography. Experiments were repeated using refined soybean oil for comparison to previous studies. The products from crude microbial TAG cracking were then further refined into a jet fuel product. Fuel tests indicate that this jet fuel corresponds to specifications for JP-8 military turbine fuel. It was thus concluded that the crude microbial TAG is a suitable feedstock with no further purification required, demonstrating CelTherm's commercial potential. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Flue gases mainly consist of CO2 that can be utilized to facilitate microalgal culture for bioenergy production. In the present study, to evaluate the feasibility of the utilization of flue gas from a coal-burning power plant, an indigenous and high-CO2-tolerant oleaginous microalga, Chlorella sp. KR-1, was cultivated under mixotrophic conditions, and the results were evaluated. When the culture was mediated by flue gas, highest biomass (0.8 g cells/L·d) and FAME (fatty acid methyl esters) productivity (121 mg/L·d) were achieved in the mixotrophic mode with 5 g/L glucose, 5 mM nitrate, and a flow rate of 0.2 vvm. By contrast, the photoautotrophic cultivation resulted in a lower biomass (0.45 g cells/L·d) and a lower FAME productivity (60.2 mg/L·d). In general, the fatty acid profiles of Chlorella sp. KR-1 revealed meaningful contents (>40 % of saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids) under the mixotrophic condition, which enables the obtainment of a better quality of biodiesel than is possible under the autotrophic condition. Conclusively then, it was established that a microalgal culture mediated by flue gas can be improved by adoption of mixotrophic cultivation systems. © Springer-Verlag 2014.

AB  - This research investigates the economic impact of a new biorefinery on an established timberlands system. This paper proposes that a single level model does not adequately represent the interactions in the supply chain. The timberlands system has two major decision makers: harvesters and manufacturers. Bilevel models are two-level turn-based models with each level representing a decision maker. The two levels are interconnected, but neither has control over the decisions of the other. The leader makes an initial decision, and the follower reacts; the leader can anticipate the follower's reaction. To demonstrate the value of this more complex representation, a single period bilevel and a single period single level model were formulated for a representative case study. The separation of objective functions in the bilevel problem yielded decisions different from those of the single level formulation. It was concluded that the bilevel model may more accurately represent the real system. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Accurate bond dissociation energies (BDEs) are important for characterizing combustion chemistry, particularly the initial stages of pyrolysis. Here we contribute to evaluating the thermochemistry of biodiesel methyl ester molecules using ab initio BDEs derived from a multireference averaged coupled-pair functional (MRACPF2)-based scheme. Having previously validated this approach for hydrocarbons and a variety of oxygenates, herein we provide further validation for bonds within carboxylic acids and methyl esters, finding our scheme predicts BDEs within chemical accuracy (i.e., within 1 kcal/mol) for these molecules. Insights into BDE trends with ester size are then analyzed for methyl formate through methyl crotonate. We find that the carbonyl group in the ester moiety has only a local effect on BDEs. C=C double bonds in ester alkyl chains are found to increase the strengths of bonds adjacent to the double bond. An important exception are bonds beta to C=C or C=O bonds, which produce allylic-like radicals upon dissociation. The observed trends arise from different degrees of geometric relaxation and resonance stabilization in the radicals produced. We also compute BDEs in various small alkanes and alkenes as models for the long hydrocarbon chain of actual biodiesel methyl esters. We again show that allylic bonds in the alkenes are much weaker than those in the small methyl esters, indicating that hydrogen abstractions are more likely at the allylic site and even more likely at bis-allylic sites of alkyl chains due to more electrons involved in π-resonance in the latter. Lastly, we use the BDEs in small surrogates to estimate heretofore unknown BDEs in large methyl esters of biodiesel fuels. (Chemical Equation Presented). © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This paper incorporates pathway-specific financial assumptions into techno-economic analyses of cellulosic biofuel pathways under price uncertainty. Five cellulosic biofuel pathway scenarios are developed in a discounted cash flow rate of return spreadsheet to determine pathway-specific costs of debt. The cost of equity for the scenarios is calculated based on the financial characteristics of the US biorenewable industrial sector. A 20-year net present value (NPV) and probability of default for each scenario are stochastically calculated. Mean NPVs vary from a low of -$774 million to a high of -$135 million. Probabilities of default range from a high of 100% to a low of 80.5%. Sensitivity analyses find that the use of pathway-neutral financial assumptions overestimates NPV and underestimates probability of default. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region is a leader in global biofuel production, accounting for 27% of supply. This is driven by a proliferation of mandates and targets calling for increased use of biofuels around the world. Unsustainable biofuel production can alter landscapes and stress social-ecological systems. To mitigate impacts, different types of governance mechanisms have been introduced including national regulations, voluntary certification schemes, sustainability standards, meta-standards, and codes of conduct. Voluntary certification has gained prominence in the region, with over 220 producers and processors in 12 LAC countries obtaining certification. However, given the potential social and environmental impacts evident in the region, voluntary certification may be insufficient and stronger sustainability mechanisms may be justified. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - In this work, we developed a method to quantify ethanol in ethyl soybean biodiesel and ethyl biodiesel from waste frying oil using mid-infrared spectroscopy in association with multivariate calibration by the partial least-squares (PLS) method. The obtained models are efficient in ethanol determination in concentrations ranging from 0.14% to 1.00% (w/w). In both PLS models low values of the root-mean-square error prediction (0.02%, w/w) and excellent correlation between measured and predicted values in the prediction set (R > 0.99) were observed, and there were no systematic errors according to the ASTM E1655 standard. The methods were validated according to international and national guidelines by the estimate of figures of merit, such as accuracy, linearity, sensitivity, selectivity, analytical sensitivity, and limits of detection and quantification. Considering these good results, the proposed method can be used for biofuel quality control in a fast, simple, and nondestructive way. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The exhaust emissions of three cars using different biofuels were explored at a temperature of -7 °C. The biofuels studied contained both low- and high-concentration ethanol blends, isobutanol, and biohydrocarbons. A multipoint fuel injection car (MPFI), direct-injection spark-ignition car (DISI), and flex-fuel car (FFV) represented three different spark-ignition-car technologies. At -7 °C, substantial emissions were observed for the three cars, and differences were found among ethanol, isobutanol, and biohydrocarbons as fuel components. For example, E85 resulted in high acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, ethanol, ethene, and acetylene emissions when compared to E30 or lower ethanol concentrations. Isobutanol-containing fuel showed elevated butyraldehyde, methacrolein, and isobutanol emissions. The highest particulate matter (PM) emissions, associated polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and indirect mutagenicity emissions were detected with the DISI car. Oxygenated fuels reduced PM emissions and associated priority PAH emissions in the DISI car. PM and PAH emissions from the MPFI and FFV cars were generally low. A combination of 10% ethanol and biohydrocarbon components did not change emissions significantly when compared to ethanol-only-containing E10 gasoline. Therefore, a combination of ethanol or isobutanol with biohydrocarbon components offers an option to reach high gasoline bioenergy content for E10-compatible cars. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Promising energy crops such as Jatropha curcas Linnaeus (JCL), which are planted on marginal lands, or microalgae such as Chlorella, which are cultivated in ponds located on mudflats or deserts, have been regarded with high hopes to solve the shortage of food crops and increase the amount of biodiesel (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester, FAME) production. However, the annual yields of biomass and transport fuels (t/ha) of both are still unclear and often exaggerated in the literature. Large portions of JCL biomass, including tree trunks and leaves, can also be used to generate electricity along with FAME, which is produced from seed lipids. Meanwhile, lipid extracted algae (LEA) are composed of proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids other than glycerides which are unable to be esterified to form FAME and much more abundant in the microalgae than oil cake in the oil crops. Therefore, it has been strongly suggested that not only transesterification or esterification but also Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process and bio-electricity generation should be considered as routes to produce biofuels. Otherwise, the yield of biofuel would be extremely low using either JCL or Chlorella as feedstock. The Life-Cycle Inventories (LCI) of the biofuel processes with whole biomass of JCL and Chlorella were compared based on their net energy ratio (NER) and CO2 emission saving (CES). It was shown that the technological improvement of irrigation, cultivation, and processing for either economic-crops or microalgae were all necessary to meet the requirements of commercial biofuel production. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Cork samples from Betula pendula, Quercus suber and Quercus cerris were submitted to Py-GC-MS/FID at temperatures between 550 °C and 900 °C and the pyrolysis-derived compounds (py-products) were identified and quantified. Corks were compared with wood samples. Py-products include suberin, lignin and carbohydrates derivatives. Suberin py-products are dominated by unsaturated aliphatics. Corks pyrolysis yield and composition were dramatically influenced by temperature in contrast to wood that showed stable results across temperatures. At 850-900 °C the peaks area of cork pyrograms were approximately two times higher than at 550 °C, for which yield was about half of the woods, and cork py-products were dominated by suberin-derived short chain aliphatics, namely 1-alkenes, while at 550 °C composition was dominated by lignin derivatives. Lignin and carbohydrate derived products decreased dramatically over 750 °C while the opposite was observed for unsaturated aliphatics. Cork materials show a high potential as feedstock for production of aliphatic-rich pyrolytic biofuels or as a source of olefins. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The method of LCA(Life Cycle Assessment)was applied to evaluate the impact of pollutant emissions in the full life cycles of biomass emulsified diesel(BED20), biomass hydrogenated diesel(BHD), biomass dimethyl ether (DME), and biomass Fischer-Tropsch liquid(FTL). The pollutants(i.e., CO2, NOX, SO2, etc.)in life cycle was ventory were classified into seven categories on the basis of environmental impacts, and the magnitude of each pollutant was monetized. The results showed that the environmental costs of DME, BHD, BED20, fossil diesel and FTL are 11.54 ¥/GJ, 16.79 ¥/GJ, 17.86 ¥/GJ, 18.04 ¥/GJ, 20.30 ¥/GJ, respectively by ascending order. The upstream environmental performance of bio-flues, except for BED20, is significant better than that of fossil diesel; the consumption environmental performance of bio-flues is also better than that of fossil diesel; and the production process make a greater contribution to the life cycle environmental impact of bio-flues. Compared with fossil diesel, the greenhouse effect of biofuel is reduced by 9.4%-121.1%; acidification and photochemical smog of DME are reduced by 27.8%-34.7% and 15.6%-53.8%, respectively; but other three bio-fuels acidification increases by 5%-61.2%.

AB  - This work examines the potential of two species of palm-tree, Syagrus coronata (Mart.) Becc. and Acrocomia aculeate, for biodiesel and thermo cracked bio-oil production. These species can offer the opportunity to obtain alternative fats and oils from perennial sources, which permits their combination with other crops or cattle production, as well as the recovery of degraded areas. The physico-chemical properties of the oils, biodiesel and bio-oil obtained from the two palms were evaluated. For biodiesel production, the high acid value of the Acrocomia aculeate crude vegetable oil required a previous acid esterification step to avoid the formation of soaps and stable emulsions, which was not necessary in the case of Syagrus coronata (Mart.) Becc. Concerning their fatty acid composition, SC exhibits mainly short, saturated chains, while AA exhibits long unsaturated chains. The short saturated chains make Syagrus coronata (Mart.) Becc. biodiesel less viscous and more stable to oxidation than Acrocomia aculeate biodiesel. However, both Syagrus coronata (Mart.) Becc. and Acrocomia aculeate biodiesel are in the acceptable range for use as biodiesel in diesel engines, showing promise for the economic exploitation of these raw materials, requiring only the use of an antioxidant additive in the case of Acrocomia aculeate. The bio-oils obtained from both Syagrus coronata (Mart.) Becc. and Acrocomia aculeate were not completely deoxygenated, but the physico-chemical properties showed good potential for producing renewable fuel acceptable for use in diesel engines. However, further studies are needed to achieve their complete deoxygenation and improve their properties. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sustainably balancing biofuel crop production with food, feed, and fiber on agricultural lands will require developing new cropping strategies. Double- and/or relay-cropping winter camelina (Camelina sativa L.) with soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] may be a means to produce an energy and food crop on the same land in a single year. A study was conducted between 2009 and 2011 in west central Minnesota to evaluate yields, seed quality, economics, and within-field energy balance of winter camelina–soybean double- and relay-cropping systems compared with a conventional monocropped full-season soybean. Systems included methods to hasten camelina harvest (e.g., swathing and desiccating) to promote early soybean growth. Camelina seed yields were unaffected by cropping system and ranged from 1.1 to 1.3 Mg ha–1. Relay-cropped soybean yields were greater than double-cropped soybean and were 58 to 83% of that for the monocropped control. Seed oil and protein content of double- and relay-cropped soybean were comparable to their monocropped counterpart and combined seed oil yield for the dual crop systems was as much as 50% greater. Net economic returns for the relay-crop treatments were competitive with that of the full-season soybean. Moreover, net energy of the relay-crop treatments was generally as high as the sole soybean crop, but energy efficiency (outputs/inputs) was less due to greater inputs. Results indicate that dual cropping of winter camelina with soybean is agronomically viable for the upper Midwest and might be an attractive system to growers seeking a “cash” cover crop. © 2014 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

AB  - New-generation biofuels are mainly produced from nonfood crops or waste. Although second-generation ethanol is one of the main options, valeric esters can also be produced from lignocellulose through levulinic acid. However, only few experimental results are available to characterize their combustion behavior. Using a traditional compression ignition (CI) engine converted to monocylinder operation, the engine performances and emissions of butyl and pentyl valerate (BV and PenV, respectively) were investigated. This paper analyses the experimental results for blends of 20%vol of esters in diesel fuel, taking diesel fuel as the reference fuel. The BV and PenV have a smaller cetane number and consequently the ignition delay of the blends is slightly longer. However, engine performances and emissions are not significantly modified by adding 20%vol of esters to diesel fuel. The BV and PenV then represent very good alternative biofuels for CI engines. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The present work evaluates the effects of using blends of diesel fuel with two (straight) vegetable oils, viz sunflower and cottonseed, and their corresponding methyl ester biodiesels in proportions of 10% and 20% (by volume), on the performance and emissions of a fully instrumented, six-cylinder, turbocharged and after-cooled, heavy-duty direct injection (HDDI), Mercedes-Benz, bus diesel engine. The series of tests are conducted using each of the biofuels blends, with the engine working at (the same) three loads and two speeds, with measurements taken of fuel consumption and exhaust regulated emissions, i.e., smoke, nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and total unburned hydrocarbons (HC). Results of heat release combustion analysis of experimentally obtained cylinder pressure diagrams, together with the differing physical and chemical properties of these biofuels against those for the diesel fuel, which constitutes the baseline fuel, aid the correct interpretation of the observed engine behavior. With increasing percentage of all biofuels in the blends, reduction of smoke opacity (higher for the cottonseed oil or its biodiesel against their sunflower counterparts) is observed, slight increase of NOx, increase of HC emissions, increase of CO with the vegetable oil blends, and decrease with the biodiesel ones, while brake thermal efficiency remains practically the same. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Butanol isomer diffusion flames were studied experimentally in a counterflow burner configuration with an emphasis on establishing a difference in extinction strain rate among three fuels with practically identical thermochemistry. An effect of molecular structure on the extinction strain rates of butanol isomers was observed and analyzed in terms of bond dissociation energies. The results indicate that although all isomers share essentially the same adiabatic flame temperature, n-butanol flames can sustain a consistently higher extinction strain rate than the flames of other isomers (isobutanol and sec-butanol). Extinction strain rates of isobutanol and sec-butanol were equal, within experimental error. Numerical simulation of n-butanol diffusion flames produced results consistent with those measured experimentally and provided insight into the distribution of major species and combustion intermediates. Stable annular flames were observed for all three isomers as a temporary step before extinction. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Hydrotreated vegetable or waste cooking oils (HVOs or HWCOs) are considered second-generation biofuels and are regarded as a promising alternative to current market diesel because they mainly consist of paraffinic hydrocarbons. This paper presents an experimental investigation conducted in order to examine the potential of HWCO as a substitute of diesel fuel. The HWCO used was produced from waste cooking oils through a catalytic hydrotreatment process. The main target of the study was the investigation of the emissions and combustion characteristics of the HWCO in comparison with conventional diesel. To that aim, a light-duty common-rail Euro 5 diesel engine, running on neat HWCO, was tested over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) at the engine test bed. The results showed lower CO2, CO, and hydrocarbon emissions, but increased NOx emissions. Combustion analysis, performed at specific steady-state operating points, revealed the differences in the combustion mechanism between HWCO and market diesel, forming a basis for the interpretation of emissions results. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The gasification of wood allows the production of wood gas, which can be used as an energy source in large spark-ignition (SI) piston engines located in agricultural areas for generating electric power. The composition of wood gas depends on the fuel source and the processing technique. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the main performance and emission characteristics of a multicylinder, four-stroke, turbocharged, spark-ignited engine fueled with three different types of wood gas at various air to fuel excess ratios. This engine is used for electricity production especially in small generator sets. In order to examine the effect of wood-gas composition on performance and exhaust emissions, a theoretical investigation is conducted by using a comprehensive two-zone phenomenological model. The results concern some of the main engine performance characteristics, i.e., brake specific fuel consumption and maximum cylinder pressure, and specific NO and CO emissions. The predictive ability of the model has been tested against experimental measurements. The results of simulation are found to be in good agreement with the variation trends of the experimental data with engine load. The conclusions from this investigation are valuable for the use of wood gas as a full supplement energy source in a heavy-duty, spark-ignited engine used for electric power generation in agriculture areas, where the composition of the produced wood gas is not fixed but depends on the fuel feedstock source and the type of gasification. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - EU directives promoting the measures of biofuels and advanced exhaust aftertreatment systems aim to mitigate global warming and air pollution, respectively; however, in addition to these claimed benefits, what trade-off effects arise from combining these measures? Based on new-vehicle emissions data for EU road-freight transport combining RME biodiesel, selective catalytic reduction (SCR), and diesel particulate filter (DPF), we determine well-to-wheel (WTW), tank-to-wheel (TTW), and well-to-tank (WTT) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as well as the regulated emissions of NOx, PM, CO, and NMHC. In comparing results, we draw three conclusions: First, vehicles fuelled by RME biodiesel have reduced WTW GHG emissions and NMHC emissions, but have slight increases in WTW emissions of NOx, PM, and CO. Second, vehicles fitted with SCR and DPF have reduced WTW emissions of NOx, PM, CO, and NMHC, but have slight increases in WTW GHG emissions. Third, we conclude that although the measures are independently successful at achieving their specific goals, their combination decreases some of these benefits. Only through improved testing, assessment methods, and transparency can we fully understand the interrelation of mitigation measures, and apply this understanding to policy aimed at reducing the overall environmental and social impacts of transport. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Butanol produced from agricultural sources is emerging as a potentially renewable biofuel for use in engine applications. In this work, butanol electrostatic sprays were established within a narrow region of low flow rates. Spray phenomenology was investigated through high-speed visualization for the low flow rate conditions in the vicinity of the lowest voltage for which electrosprays (e-sprays) could be sustained. Spray structure was studied through droplet size and velocity measurements for a combination of conditions, performed by using phase Doppler anemometry. Combined with high-speed spray visualization, these measurements revealed a stable e-spray operation with narrow droplet size and velocity distributions; i.e., spray behavior was close to monodisperse. A similarity analysis was performed to develop an empirical expression correlating appropriately dimensionless average diameter, flow rate, and applied voltage. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - A comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) of biofuel production from corn stover fast pyrolysis and subsequent hydrotreating and hydrocracking was conducted based on the Greenhouse gases Regulated Emissions and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model. Three different cases were investigated as a result of different hydrogen treatment in bio-oil upgrading process. Environmental impacts such as non-renewable energy demand and Global Warming Potential (GWP) were primarily evaluated for 1 MJ biofuel produced. All the results showed obvious environmental benefits compared with conventional gasoline and diesel based on the year of 2010. The results of Case 1 in which hydrogen was provided by external natural gas reforming displayed a reduction of 67.5% in net non-renewable energy demand and a reduction of 69.1% in net GWP in contrast to conventional gasoline and diesel. Net non-renewable energy demand was lowered by 76.6% and net GWP was reduced by 73.0% in Case 2 where 35% of bio-oil aqueous phase was consumed by steam reforming for hydrogen production. Case 3 gained an obvious advantage on both environmental aspects over the others, in which surplus hydrogen from steam reforming of whole aqueous phase of bio-oil was obtained as a coproduct. The results displayed a significant net non-renewable energy reduction of 147.5% and a net GWP reduction of 119.4%. However, the outcomes indicated decreasing biofuel yields from Case 1 to Case 3 compared with increasing environmental benefits. The biofuel yields of three cases were 31.2%, 23.7% and 11.5% respectively in this work. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Exploration of new non-edible feedstocks for biofuel production and the use of economically favorable conversion technologies could significantly contribute to bioenergy research. In this regard the present investigation aims to highlighten hybrid biofuels (HBFs) prepared from crude vegetable oils of five locally available plant species namely, Gmelina arborea Roxb (GAO), Mimusops elengi Linn (MEO), Acer laurinum Hasskarl (ALO), Thevetia peruviana Schum (TPO) and Mesua ferrea Linn (MFO). This new approach does not involve any chemical reactions and can substantially reduce the production cost of vegetable oil based biofuels. Besides, the HBF systems prepared here can be 100% renewable as they only contain vegetable oil, butanol and ethanol, all products derived from biomass. The naturally occurring mono-, di-glycerides and free fatty acid (FFA)s in crude vegetable oils (or esters in pretreated oils) functioned as surfactants in the formulation of stable fuel systems. The fuel properties of the formulations were affected by the concentrations of these compounds in the vegetable oil. The optimum formulations (oil:butanol:ethanol ratio of 60:30:10) exhibited viscosity (4.7-5.4mm2/s), density (0.86-0.88gm/cm3) and gross calorific values (38.91-39.18MJ/kg) comparable with their corresponding fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). Moreover, they show superior cold flow properties than FAMEs. The present investigation suggests that non-edible oil based HBF systems formulated in the study containing 'bio-based' and 'green' surface active agents in the system offers economically attractive candidature for the future biofuel industry. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper it is studied the most polar fractions of bio-oil produced by fast pyrolysis of Lignocel BK40-90 (sawdust from forest timber). The biomass was submitted to the pyrolysis in an existing FCC pilot plant that was adapted for this procedure. The equipment consists of a fluidized bed reactor with nitrogen injection. The unit operates with continuous biomass feeding and continuous solids circulation. The produced bio-oil was submitted to an aqueous alkaline extraction, isolating the acidic compounds that were analyzed by one-dimensional gas chromatography and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with quadrupole mass spectrometry detection (qMS). One hundred and thirty compounds (mainly phenols and ketones) were tentatively identified in the extract, some of them by the use of retention indexes. The main differences between chromatographic techniques were the substantial increasing in the peak capacity of GC. ×. GC and the resolution of some co-elutions that occurred in GC/qMS. It is also possible to conclude that this extract is rich in important raw materials for the chemical industry and can be used for this end. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The properties of biodiesel are determined by its oleaginous composition and the alcohol used in the transesterification. This study was performed using palm and palmist oils and methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, and benzyl alcohols to investigate their influence on the cold flow properties, density, and viscosity of the resulting biofuel. The products were also characterized by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses. Biofuel produced from palmist oil had different properties compared to biofuel synthesized from palm oil because of its lower average chain length and lower content of unsaturation. Biodiesel produced with palmist oil and isopropyl alcohol had the lowest values of cold filter plugging point (CFPP) (-16°C) and density (860 kg/m3). The use of benzyl alcohol yielded a biofuel with high viscosity and density values that do not adhere to any international specifications for biodiesel. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel is a promising alternative biofuel, but the treatment of wastewater containing alkali catalyst and glycerol discharged from the washing unit operation increases the cost significantly. Here a novel continuous biodiesel production process with trace-amount alkali as the catalyst under the methanol subcritical condition was proposed and investigated. The optimal operation conditions of preliminary batch reaction experiment are temperature of 200 °C, catalyst concentration of 513 mg/kg, reaction time of 38 min, molar ratio of methanol to oil of 11.9:1, and system pressure of 1.5 MPa. The one-step conversion of raw oil in a batch reactor can reach up to 85.5%. The alkali residue in the biodiesel product can be further reduced by removing the methanol and washing by glycerol instead of by acid or water. The optimal weight ratio of glycerol to biodiesel is 1.5:1, and the residual alkali in the final ester product is about 4.6 mg/kg. The simulation and bench scale continuous experiment based on the optimal batch operation parameters confirmed that the biodiesel produced by the process is qualified well up to the Chinese standard of biodiesel, and the K+ concentration in biodiesel was less than 3.0 mg/kg. The economic evaluation showed that this new process is more economically feasible than the traditional processes. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Chlorella protothecoides, a lipid-producing microalga, was grown heterotrophically and autotrophically in separate reactors, the off-gases exiting the former being used to aerate the latter.Autotrophic biomass productivity with the two-reactor association, 0.0249gL-1h-1, was 2.2-fold the value obtained in a control autotrophic culture, aerated with ambient air. Fatty acid productivity was 1.7-fold the control value.C. protothecoides heterotrophic biomass productivity was 0.229gL-1h-1. This biomass' fatty acid content was 34.5% (w/w) with a profile suitable for biodiesel production, according to European Standards.The carbon dioxide fixed by the autotrophic biomass was 45mgCO2L-1h-1 in the symbiotic arrangement, 2.1 times the control reactor value.The avoided CO2 atmospheric emission represented 30% of the CO2 produced in the heterotrophic stage, while the released O2 represented 49% of the oxygen demand in that stage.Thus, an increased efficiency in the glucose carbon source use and a higher environmental sustainability were achieved in microalgal biodiesel production using the proposed assembly. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Longer-term storage stability of biodiesel and blends was studied in experiments simulating up to one year for 100% biodiesel (B100) and three years for blends. Aging was simulated by holding samples at 43 °C to accelerate oxidation (ASTM D4625). Biodiesels were treated with antioxidants before and after aging, with continued aging after antioxidant treatment. Treating aged biodiesel was effective at restoring stability; however, antioxidant effectiveness was decreased relative to fresh biodiesel. Blends were prepared at B5 (5 vol.%) and B20 (20 vol.%) with biodiesel having either 3- or 6-hour Rancimat induction time and low or high polyunsaturated ester content with two diesels produced from hydrocracked or hydrotreated feedstocks. All B5s were stable for the entire storage time regardless of B100 induction time. B20s were unstable if prepared from high polyunsaturated ester biodiesel with a 3-hour induction time. Base diesel stability had considerable effect on blend stability. All but the lowest-stability B20s remained within specification, indicating that long-term storage of biodiesel blends is possible if the biodiesel has high oxidative stability and storage conditions are clean. Induction time decreases indicated loss of stability (consumption of antioxidant) prior to blend degradation; therefore, induction time monitoring is recommended for predicting quality changes during storage. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lignin is an energy-dense, heterogeneous polymer comprised of phenylpropanoid monomers used by plants for structure, water transport, and defense, and it is the second most abundant biopolymer on Earth after cellulose. In production of fuels and chemicals from biomass, lignin is typically underused as a feedstock and burned for process heat because its inherent heterogeneity and recalcitrance make it difficult to selectively valorize. In nature, however, some organisms have evolved metabolic pathways that enable the utilization of lignin-derived aromatic molecules as carbon sources. Aromatic catabolism typically occurs via upper pathways that act as a "biological funnel" to convert heterogeneous substrates to central intermediates, such as protocatechuate or catechol. These intermediates undergo ring cleavage and are further converted via the β-ketoadipate pathway to central carbon metabolism. Here, we use a natural aromatic-catabolizing organism, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, to demonstrate that these aromatic metabolic pathways can be used to convert both aromatic model compounds and heterogeneous, lignin-enriched streams derived from pilot-scale biomass pretreatment into medium chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-PHAs). mcl-PHAs were then isolated from the cells and demonstrated to be similar in physicochemical properties to conventional carbohydratederived mcl-PHAs, which have applications as bioplastics. In a further demonstration of their utility, mcl-PHAs were catalytically converted to both chemical precursors and fuel-range hydrocarbons. Overall, this work demonstrates that the use of aromatic catabolic pathways enables an approach to valorize lignin by overcoming its inherent heterogeneity to produce fuels, chemicals, and materials.

AB  - Nickel-based carbide catalysts combined with four different metals (Mo, Nb, W, and Zr) and supported on Al-SBA-15 were investigated for the hydrocracking of distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) corn oil to produce biofuels under mild reaction conditions. The effects of the fractional sums of the electronegativities of the transition metals on the catalyst activities, selectivities, and stabilities were investigated. The closer the fractional sum of the transition metal electronegativities was to the electronegativity range of the noble catalysts (2.0-2.2), the better was the catalyst performance. The highest diesel selectivity was obtained from NiWC/Al-SBA-15, with a fractional sum of electronegativity of 2.06. The effects of doping a promoter (Ce) on the catalyst electronegativity and activity were studied. Adding Ce generally improved the catalyst performance, by adjusting the combined electronegativities nearer to 2.0-2.2. However, other parameters affected by Ce addition, such as textural properties, or the performance of individual metals could also impact catalyst performance. The NiNbC/Al-SBA-15 catalyst promoted with 5% Ce maintained stable activity for 168 h at 400 °C and 4.48 MPa H2. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The properties of aluminosilicate kalsilite have attracted the interest of researchers in chemical synthesis, ceramic industry, biofuels, etc. In this study, kalsilite was hydrothermally synthesized from microcline powder in a KOH solution. The microcline powder, rich in potassium, aluminum, and silicon, was collected from Mountain Changling in Northwestern China. The effects of temperature, time, and KOH concentration on the decomposition of microcline were investigated. The kalsilite and intermediate products were characterized by means of wet chemistry analysis, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), infrared spectrometry (IR), 29Si magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (29Si MAS NMR), 27Al MAS NMR, and scanning electron microscope (SEM). With increasing temperature, the microcline powder transforms into a metastable KAlSiO4 polymorph before transforming further into pure kalsilite. A mixture of both kalsilite and metastable KAlSiO4 polymorph is obtained when the hydrothermal reaction is carried out within 2 h; but after 2 h, kalsilite is the predominant product. The concentration of KOH, which needs to be larger than 4.3 M, is an important parameter influencing the synthesis of kalsilite. © 2014, University of Science and Technology Beijing and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Pistacia terebintus, a member of the family Anacardiaceae, is a perennial plant that widely grows in the southern and western regions of Anatolia. Pistacia terebintus L. seeds contain 66% oil, which allows the possibility of economical exploitation. The main monounsaturated fatty acid is oleic (55-75% w/w), polyunsaturated linoleic (15-38% w/w), while the main saturated fatty acid is palmitic (8-20% w/w). Pistacia terebintus L. seed oil was investigated as an alternative feedstock for the production of a biodiesel fuel. Three commonly used catalysts for alkaline-catalyzed transesterification, i.e., sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and sodium methoxide, were evaluated using conventional heating with Pistacia terebintus L. oil. High biodiesel yield (97.8%) was obtained by using sodium methoxide, because they only contain the hydroxide group, necessary for saponification, as a low proportion impurity. The methyl ester has relatively closer fuel properties to diesel than that of raw seed oil. Plant improvement programs could make Pistacia terebintus L. a viable alternative for biodiesel production. © Copyright Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The world food supply has become dependent on synthetic fertilizer from ammonia, which comes from the Haber–Bosch process. This process consumes large amounts of fossil fuels and releases large amounts of greenhouse gases. The excessive use of synthetic fixed nitrogen fertilizers has led to severe environmental effects, but fixed nitrogen is essential to the sustainability of biofuels. Nitrogen fertilizers are also required for biotic carbon capture schemes like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation, and soil carbon sequestration. Ammonia has been proposed as a non-carbon emitting alternative fuel that has many advantages over hydrogen. Organic agriculture and nitrogen recovery from waste streams may only partially reduce the demand for synthetic fixed nitrogen. Social solutions like population stabilization may be the best solution for the food supply problem, but ammonia is an enabling technology for alternative fuels and carbon sequestration. Alternative processes for nitrogen fixation are very early in development. This paper offers the viewpoint that alternative means of nitrogen fixation and the wise use of fixed nitrogen need to be developed quickly. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

AB  - In this paper we investigate a severe pollution episode that occurred in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region in January 2013. The episode was caused by the combination of anthropogenic emissions and unusual atmospheric circulation, the depression of strong cold air activities and the very unfavorable dispersion. The episode contained three haze events (haze1: Jan. 4-9, haze2: Jan. 10-13, and haze3: Jan. 14-16). In Nanjing, aerosol size distributions from 10nm to 10μm and chemical components of single particles from 0.2 to 2μm were measured with a Wide Range Particle Spectrometer (WPS) and a Single Particle Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (SPAMS), respectively. The results indicate that the mean PM2.5 concentrations in the YRD region were greater than 110μg·m-3. The highest PM2.5 concentration of 175.6μg·m-3 occurred in Nanjing; the other cities had values in the range of 110.8-147.3μg·m-3. The average PM2.5 concentrations were 58.3, 122.7, 145.4 and 154.7μg·m-3 on clean and haze1, haze2 and haze3 days, respectively. The highest PM2.5 values of 416.5, 415.5 and 300.5μg·m-3 in Nanjing occurred during the three haze events. The spectra of the aerosol number concentrations had unimodal distributions on clean and haze days. The maximum surface area peaks were located at 0.5-0.7μm and had values of 419, 1397, 1309 and 1378μm2·cm-3·nm-1 on clean and haze1, haze2 and haze3 days, respectively. The number concentrations of biomass/biofuel burning-containing particles (biomass), organic carbon-containing particles (OC), elemental carbon-containing particles (EC), nitrate-containing particles (nitrate) and sulfate-containing particles (sulfate) increased significantly during the haze events. The chemical components of the aerosols during the haze1 and haze2 events were similar to those on clean days, and variations were caused by local particle accumulations under poor diffusion conditions. The high EC particle concentration of 24.76% during the haze3 event was impacted by the pollutants transported from surrounding cities. In addition, the different chemical components showed distinct size distributions. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microbial lipids offer a promising feedstock for renewable biofuels. However, one of the major concerns with their conversion from lipids into suitable fuels is the high sterol content of the lipid. This is especially problematic for lipids obtained from oleaginous yeasts, as there are some indications that the sterol content could inhibit catalyst performance during hydrotreating. In this investigation a sterol-rich model feedstock (a 50:50 mixture of cholesterol and rapeseed oil, "RC50") and an unrefined microbial lipid derived from the oleaginous yeast Metschkownia pulcherrima were converted to a diesel-like fuel in a single step via catalytic cracking. Far from reducing catalyst performance the cracking of the sterol groups liberated hydrogen, resulting in a reduction in the olefin content as well as an increase in the aromatic content of the fuel. The cracking of RC50 over Pd/C resulted in a fuel with a comparable product distribution to ultra-low sulphur diesel (ULSD), with high levels of linear alkanes and approximately 10 wt% aromatics. Cracking of unrefined yeast lipid over Pd/C was shown to result in an energy dense, hydrocarbon fuel suitable for marine applications (unblended) or a road transport fuel at 50% v/v blends with ULSD. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Thermal diffusivity measurements of different oils and their respective biodiesels are investigated by means of thermal lens spectroscopy. The viscosities of biodiesel decrease by approximately one order of magnitude, while thermal diffusivity showed an inversely proportional dependence with respect to the produced biodiesels from several oils sources. This correlates to unsaturation levels present in the fatty acid chains according to the iodine index value for each one. In addition, a reduction of the Prandtl number of biodiesels by around an order of magnitude relative to their corresponding oils was observed as consequence of the viscosity reduction. The results of this work will facilitate physicochemical and thermophysical property collection for biofuels and will be relevant for mathematical modeling and numerical simulation studies related to combustion of diesel/biodiesel blends and pure biodiesel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The distillation curves of crude bio-oil from glycerol-assisted hydrothermal liquefaction of swine manure were measured. The crude bio-oil had much higher distillation temperature than diesel and gasoline. Ninety percentage of the crude bio-oil was recovered at a distillation temperature of 498.8 °C, compared to 350.4 °C for diesel and 177.8 °C for gasoline. The remaining 10% of the residue was mainly char formed during the distillation of the crude bio-oil. However, the crude bio-oil produced from glycerol-assisted hydrothermal liquefaction of swine manure was more distillable than the bio-oil produced by the traditional liquefaction of swine manure and the pyrolysis of corn stover. The physical and chemical properties of nine distillate fractions were analyzed. Except the first 10% volumetric fraction that was recovered at a temperature up to 359.4 °C contained 46.75% of water by mass, the moisture content of other eight bio-oil distillate fractions, each of which had 10% of the initial volume, was less than 1%. As the first 10% fraction had a large amount of water, its heating value was only 18.75 MJ/kg. The heating value of remaining eight fractions increased from 37.16 MJ/kg to 45.38 MJ/kg with the increase of the distillation temperature from 359.4 °C to 498.8 °C, compared to the 36.41 MJ/kg for the crude bio-oil with 5.38% of water by mass. The pH value of the crude bio-oil produced by the glycerol-assisted liquefaction of swine manure was 5.02. The pH values of the distillate fractions that were collected at relatively low or very high temperatures were close to neutral. The carbon content of the distillate fractions increased from 69.23% to 80.96% and the oxygen content decreased from 16.53% to 4.54% with the increase of the distillation temperature. There was small difference in hydrogen content ranged from 9.39% to 11.70%. The GC-MS analysis showed the distillates from the crude bio-oil produced by the glycerol assisted liquefaction of swine manure contained large amounts of different esters. Longer chain methyl acid esters were found in the distillate fractions collected at higher temperatures. As alkanes and alkenes were detected in the fractions collected at 410.9 °C or above, thermal cracking at a temperature from 410 °C to 500 °C might be used to upgrade the crude bio-oil produced from the glycerol-assisted liquefaction of swine manure. If a catalyst is used, the temperature of thermal cracking can be reduced to make the cracking process more energy efficient. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we optimize a process that integrates the use of glycerol to produce ethanol via fermentation within the simultaneous production of biodiesel and bioethanol from algae. The process consists of growing the algae, determining the optimal fraction of oil vs. starch, followed by oil extraction, starch liquefaction and saccharification, to sugars, oil transesterification, for which we consider two transesterification technologies (enzymes and alkali) and the fermentation of sugars and glycerol. The advantage of this process is that the dehydration technologies are common for the products of the glucose and glycerol fermentation. Simultaneous optimization and heat integration is performed using Duran and Grossmann's model. The fermentation of glycerol to ethanol increases the production of bioethanol by at least 50%. The energy and water consumptions are competitive with other processes that either sell the glycerol or use it to obtain methanol. However, the price for the biofuels is only competitive if glycerol cannot be sold to the market. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Soybean oils are increasingly being used for a range of non-food applications, including production of biofuels and oleochemicals. While most soybean oil is produced by hexane-based extraction methods, concern about environmental and health effects from hexane extraction has led to increased interest in development of aqueous extraction methods. Among aqueous methods, surfactant-based aqueous extraction of vegetable oils has shown particular promise as an alternative to hexane-based extraction methods. The objectives of this work were to explore the use of surfactant-based methods for the extraction of soybean oils, and to test whether the use of mixed anionic-cationic and anionic-cationic-nonionic surfactant mixtures could successfully be used to reduce the salinity requirements for surfactant-based extraction. All three formulations tested were capable of producing ultra-low (&#60;0.01. mN/m) interfacial tensions with soybean oil. One of the formulations, a four-component (three surfactant, one hydrotrope) mixture, was able to reduce the salinity requirement from 5% down to 0.75%. A range of experiments was conducted to better understand the factors influencing extraction yield for surfactant-based extraction of soybean oil. Extraction experiments were conducted with a single extended surfactant system which has been used previously for extraction of other oilseeds. Extraction yields as high as 88.6% were observed for the conditions tested. Extraction yield was strongly dependent on salinity, and was found to increase with increasing shaker agitation rate, decreasing solid to liquid ratio, and decreasing particle size. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of biodiesel fuels in diesel engines is gaining attention as a promising solution to control CO2 emissions. Great research efforts have been carried out to identify the impact of biodiesel physical and chemical properties on engine systems and processes. Most of these investigations were performed in warm conditions, but the suitability of biodiesel for starting the engine at under-zero ambient temperatures has not widely evaluated. The surface tension and the viscosity of biodiesel fuels are higher compared to those of standard diesel and, in cold conditions, these differences become critical since the injection fuel rate is largely affected and consequently the combustion process can be deteriorated. In order to improve its flow characteristics at cold temperatures and make them more suitable for low temperatures operation, additives are used in biodiesel fuels. In this paper the suitability of different biodiesel fuels, with and without additives, for cold starting of DI (direct injection) diesel engines has been evaluated. The results have shown that the engine start-ability with pure biodiesel fuels can be largely deteriorated. However, using diesel/biodiesel blends the start-ability of the engine can be recovered with the additional benefit of reducing the opacity peak of the exhaust gases. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The transesterification reaction of soybean oil with methanol is studied with different γAl2O3 heterogeneous catalysts. The catalysts used are K-γAl2O3, Na-γAl2O3, Li-γAl2O3, Ca-γAl2O3 and Ba-γAl2O3 both 5% and 10% in metal content are prepared by impregnation. The first study concluded that only two of the ten catalysts studied (K-γAl2O3, Na-γAl2O3 with 10% content in metal) gave a FAME (Fatty acid methyl esters) yield result higher than 90%. A mixed-level design of experiments is used to know which the best catalyst is between the K-γAl2O3 and the Na-γAl2O3 with 10% content in metal. Also, a factorial design of experiments and central composite designs have been used with K-γAl2O3 with 10% content in metal, which resulted the most active catalyst. The chosen variables are reaction time, initial catalyst percent and methanol:oil ratio, while the response is the biodiesel yield. Soybean heterogeneous transesterification is strongly affected by the methanol:oil ratio and it is slightly affected by the catalyst percent. Nevertheless, reaction time has no important effects in the biodiesel yield. Finally, the industrial application of the soybean biodiesel as determined through the study of the quality control of the biofuel and the reuse of K-γAl2O3 with 10% content in metal. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - On one hand, n-butanol as a potential alternative bio-fuel is accepted more and more attention presently in the fields of both scientific research and commercial market; on the other hand, some n-butanol's (or its mixtures blended with conventional fossil fuels) combustion properties, especially the flame propagation characteristic, are still unknown widely or profoundly, especially under the ICE (internal combustion engine) operating conditions. Within these conditions, pressure and temperature are two critical factors affecting the flame's propagation characteristic. Driven by these facts, in this study, we investigated the laminar flame characteristics of n-butanol, iso-octane and their blends by simulations. First, the experimental data on n-butanol's laminar burning velocity were collected, and the development of n-butanol's chemical kinetic mechanisms was reviewed. Then, the mechanisms used in this study can be chosen, and the numerical results can be validated by experimental data. Based on this, we extended the condition range, which is limited in experimental measurements, to that of realistic applications by numerical method; besides, correlations including the influences of pressure and temperature are developed and extended to consider the mixture fuel blended between n-butanol and iso-octane (which represents the gasoline in SL, laminar burning velocity), this is useful to use the alcohol fuels for SI (spark-ignition) engines in an even better fashion; furthermore, their correlated parameters were resolved carefully through a wide range of data. From results, our correlations are sufficient in accuracy to describe the effects mentioned above. Within each effect, for better understanding the apparent influence on SL, the effects of thermal, density ratio and chemical kinetic are discussed respectively. In addition, our correlations were compared to those in literature widely; these comparisons suggested that the inherent law of laminar flames of fuels still deserves more attentions and investigations. Our investigation is expected to make a step on the understanding of this field. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Identifying renewable energy alternatives in transport is particularly complicated, since the end-user can vary from a single-person car to a cargo ship. The aim of this paper is to aid this process by comparing 7 different methods for producing transport fuels in terms of the resources required, the conversion processes used, the fuel obtained, and the transport demand met. The results indicate that electricity should be prioritised as a transport fuel in the future since it is the most efficient and cheapest pathway. However, since electricity is not suitable for all modes of transport, some form of energy dense fuel is also necessary. The results in this paper suggest that this fuel will be produced by hydrogenating either biomass or carbon dioxide, depending on the residual biomass available. Biomass gasification, steam electrolysis, and carbon capture are key technologies in the future for these fuels. Based on the assumptions in this study, some of the renewable fuels proposed here would be cheaper than oil in the year 2050. However, this is based on fuel production costs only and does do not consider other key costs, such as the infrastructure costs, which will be considered in the future research. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work evaluates the influence of properties of various common bio-fuels on the combustion, performance and exhaust emissions of an experimental, single-cylinder, four-stroke, high-speed, DI (direct injection) 'Hydra' diesel engine operated at three different loads. Various blends of diesel fuel with either vegetable oil of cottonseed or its derived (methyl ester) bio-diesel, or ethanol, or n-butanol, or diethyl ether were investigated. Fuel consumption, exhaust gas temperature, and exhaust smoke, NOx (nitrogen oxides), CO (carbon monoxide) and total unburned HC (hydrocarbons) were measured. The differences in combustion, performance and exhaust emissions of those bio-fuels blends from the baseline operation of the diesel engine (with neat diesel fuel) and among themselves are compared. Fuel injection, combustion chamber pressure, and HRR (heat release rate) diagrams reveal interesting features of the combustion mechanisms. These results and the different physical and chemical properties of those bio-fuels are used to aid the interpretation of the observed engine behavior. With increasing percentage of all bio-fuels in the blends, significant reduction of smoke opacity is observed with the exception of the vegetable oil case, reduction of NOx, and mixed behavior for the CO and HC emissions against the corresponding neat diesel fuel case. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, we design an integrated process for the production of diesel substitutes, biodiesel and glycerol ethers, from algae with internal production of the intermediates ethanol and isobutene. The starch from the algae is converted into glucose. Part of it is fermented to ethanol so that we produce the alcohol needed to transesterify the algae oil while the rest is fermented to isobutene, which is needed in the production of glycerol ethers to enhance biofuels production capacity. We use CHEMCAD coupled with MATLAB for the rigorous simulation of the integrated biorefinery and evaluate the algae composition for such integrated facility. This is followed by energy integration using SYNHEAT and a detailed economic analysis. The integrated facility has promising production cost for liquid fuels, 0.46 $/gal, and an investment costs of $205M, almost half the production cost and only and investment $40M above the plant that buys the isobutene from the market. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Mobile distributed pyrolysis facilities have been proposed for delivery of a forest residue resource to bio-fuel facilities. This study examines the costs of producing hydrogen or synthetic petrol (gasoline) and diesel from feedstock produced by mobile facilities (bio-oil, bio-slurry, torrefied wood). Results show that using these feedstock can provide fuels at costs competitive to conventional bio-fuel production methods using gasification of a woodchip feedstock. Using a bio-oil feedstock in combination with bio-oil steam reforming or bio-oil upgrading can produce hydrogen or petrol and diesel at costs of 3.25 $ kg-1 or 0.86 $ litre-1, respectively, for optimally sized bio-fuel facilities. When compared on an energy basis ($ GJ-1), hydrogen production costs tend to be lower than those for synthetic petrol or diesel production across a variety of bio-fuel production pathways. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - The present experimental investigation is concerned with the comparative evaluation of karanja and jatropha methyl esters (biodiesel) as an alternative fuel in a diesel engine based on the thermal performance and emission characteristics. The experiments are conducted on a single-cylinder, four-stroke, direct-injection, variable compression ratio (CR), and compression ignition engine and the experimental parameters considered include the engine torque, injection pressure, and CR. Comparative measures of brake thermal efficiency (BTHE), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), exhaust gas temperature, smoke opacity, and HC, CO, and NOX emissions are presented and discussed. It is observed that, at full torque, BTHE is lower by 4.4% and 4.5% and BSFC is higher by about 6% and 15% for karanja and jatropha biodiesel, respectively, compared to that of diesel. At a torque of 20 Nm, CO emission levels for karanja are higher by 9% compared to jatropha but lesser by about 11% in comparison with that of diesel. Results show that thermal performance of the engine fuelled with both the biodiesels is generally comparable to that when the engine is fuelled with pure diesel. At higher compression ratios, the engine fuelled with both the biodiesels gives lesser emissions and better performance compared to that of diesel. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Due to growing concerns such as increasing energy demand and the environmental issues-related fossil energy problems caused by consumption of fossil energy, it is needed to focus on nonedible oils for biodiesel production. In the present research work, the seed oil of Momordica charantia (M. charantia) was for the first time appraised as possible nonedible oil for synthesis of biodiesel. M. charantia has oil content (36.10 ± 4.20%), high acid value (1.82 mg KOH g-1), and its oil enable base-catalyzed transesterified for biodiesel production after acid pretreatment. It was transesterified under standard conditions at 6:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil; sodium methoxide (1.00 wt.% in relation to oil mass) as a catalyst; 60°C reaction temperature and 90 min of reaction time. At optimum conditions biodiesel yield of 93.2% was acquired. The reaction followed first order kinetics. The activation energy (E A) was 254.5 kcal mol-1 and the rate constant value was 1.30 × 10-4 min-1 at 60°C. Gas chromatography investigation of M. charantia seed oil methyl esters (MSOMEs) depicted that the fatty acid composition comprises a high proportion of mono-unsaturated fatty acids (64.11 ± 5.02%). MSOMEs were also characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared and 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. The tested fuel properties of the MSOMEs, except oxidative stability, were conformed to EN 14214 and ASTM D6751 standards. The low-value oxidative stability of MSOMEs can be solved by adding antioxidants additives. In summary, M. charantia oil has potential as nonedible raw material for biodiesel production. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The contribution of heavy-duty haulage trucks to the concentrations of aerosols and criteria gases in underground mine air and the physical properties of those aerosols were assessed for three fuel blends made with fatty acid methyl esters biodiesel and petroleum-based ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD). The contributions of blends with 20, 50, and 57% of biodiesel as well as neat ULSD were assessed using a 30-ton truck operated over a simulated production cycle in an isolated zone of an operating underground metal mine. When fueled with the B20 (blend of biodiesel with ULSD with 20% of biodiesel content), B50 (blend of biodiesel with ULSD with 50% of biodiesel content), and B57 (blend of biodiesel with ULSD with 57% of biodiesel content) blends in place of ULSD, the truck's contribution to mass concentrations of elemental and total carbon was reduced by 20, 50, and 61%, respectively. Size distribution measurements showed that the aerosols produced by the engine fueled with these blends were characterized by smaller median electrical mobility diameter and lower peak concentrations than the aerosols produced by the same engine fueled with ULSD. The use of the blends resulted in number concentrations of aerosols that were 13-29% lower than those when ULSD was used. Depending on the content of biodiesel in the blends, the average reductions in the surface area concentrations of aerosol which could be deposited in the alveolar region of the lung (as measured by a nanoparticle surface area monitor) ranged between 6 and 37%. The use of blends also resulted in slight but measurable reductions in CO emissions, as well as an increase in NOX emissions. All of the above changes in concentrations and physical properties were found to be correlated with the proportion of biodiesel in the blends. © 2014 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Occupational Hygiene Society 2014.

AB  - Microbial biofilms are formed at oil/water interfaces in storage tanks containing diesel-biodiesel blends, decreasing fuel quality and increasing economic and environmental losses. Biocides may suppress the microorganisms responsible for the damage, but they are not used in all parts of the world. A B10 diesel-biodiesel blend (oil as received with or without an inoculum derived from diesel sludge) was incubated with or without 3,3'-methylene bis(5-methyloxazolidine, MBO) - 100% and 50% formulations at 1000, 500, and 0ppm - over 60 days. The biofilms formed at the oil-water interface were collected for extraction of genomic DNA followed by amplification, purification, and Illumina HiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The prevalent genera in the control fuel (as-received and inoculated) were similar at 28 days (Pseudomonas, Comamonas, and Burkholderia); by the 60th day, the microbial community had changed only in the as-received fuel, where the prevalent genera were Comamonas, Klebsiella, and Tolumonas. Archea were detected in samples at 28 and 60 days. 500ppm (as supplied) MBO 50% did not control the microbial growth and an interfacial biofilm was formed. After 28 days of incubation, taxonomic diversity in the as-received fuel and inoculated fuel decreased by 99.7% and 80.9%, respectively. The analysis also revealed that Firmicutes dominated the communities in the treatments with 500ppm (as supplied) MBO 50%, followed by Proteobacteria, except in the 60 days sample from the as-received fuel, where Proteobacteria dominated, followed by Firmicutes. Inoculation increased degradation of the fuel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel consists of a mixture of fatty acid alkyl esters whose configuration can vary according to their composition in the raw material. We evaluated the growth over 60 days of the fungus Pseudallescheria boydii in an aqueous medium containing biodiesel obtained from olive, soybean, and linseed oil; determined the migration of biodiesel components to the aqueous phase; and analyzed fungal susceptibility to four antimicrobial formulations. After 60 days of incubation, the largest biomass was observed in linseed biodiesel, followed by soybean and olive. Acid metabolites were detected and phosphate concentration was reduced in the mineral medium. Biosurfactant production was not observed. Lipase production was highest after 7 days. Palmitate, stearate, oleate, linoleate, and linolenate methyl esters were detected in the aqueous phase after 7 days of contact with biodiesels. Nuclear magnetic resonance showed degradation of 10, 11, and 5% of the total esters in olive, soybean, and linseed biodiesel samples, respectively. After 15 days, 0.25gl-1 of the morpholine biocide NBM 100% was the most effective for controlling fungal growth. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To study the fuel atomization problem when raw vegetable oil is used as an alternative fuel of compression-ignition internal combustion engine, this paper investigated the differences in spray characteristics between raw sunflower oil and regular diesel under different experimental conditions using the Schlieren method. The focus of this study is the effects of fuel temperature and injection pressure on the spray penetration distance, the spray cone angle, and the air entrainment of fuels injected into the constant volume vessel. The results show that both the spray penetration distance and the spray cone angle of the sunflower oil increase with increasing the fuel injection pressure and fuel temperature, which are similar to those of regular diesel. When the fuel temperature is increased from 60℃ to 90℃, the average increases in the spray penetration distance and cone angle of the sunflower oil are 12.4% and 9.6%, respectively, at 60 MPa injection pressure. Such increases are 5% and 4.14% respectively at 120 MPa injection pressure. When the injection pressure is increased from 60 MPa to 120 MPa, the percentage increases in the mean spray penetration distance and cone angle are 39.7% and 16.7% respectively at the fuel temperature of 60℃ and 30.6% and 10.9% respectively at 90℃. When the injection pressure, background pressure, and fuel temperature are the same, the sunflower oil spray has a greater penetration distance but a smaller spray angle than that of diesel. The average increase of the spray penetration of the sunflower oil is 22.5% and the average decrease of spay cone angle is 60.3%. Elevating the fuel temperature or increasing the fuel injecting pressure can enhance the entrainment of air into the spray; However, the air entrainment of the sunflower oil spray is significantly weaker than that in the ordinary diesel spray. The results provide a valuable reference on the spray characteristics to help evaluate the feasibility of using raw vegetable oil as an alternative fuel for internal combustion engines.

AB  - The presented reform proposal aims at creating a level playing field for biobased chemicals and materials with bioenergy and biofuels in Europe. It is fundamentally different from other reforms of the Directive being currently discussed because it opens the perspective to not only look at energy, but also at biobased materials. The proposal is based on the insights that the support system for bioenergy and biofuels created by the Renewable Energy Directive1 (RED) and the corresponding national legislations is one of the main reasons hindering the biobased material sector from developing-and therefore the whole biobased economy. It is time to understand that the RED stems from a time when biomass was available in abundance and it made sense to create the framework, but that today biomass is a highly valuable raw material that should be allocated in the most efficient way possible. At the moment, the legislation causes serious market distortions for biobased feedstocks that have been reported by a multitud of companies. Unfavorable framework conditions combined with high biomass prices and uncertain biomass supplies deter investors from putting money into biobased chemistry and materials. ''Whereas world capacity for biobased chemicals and materials is rapidly growing, Europe clearly lags behind. Lux Research, a Boston based company, expects a doubling of global biobased capacity in 2017 to 13.2 Mton. But Europe's share will drop from 37% in 2005 to 14% in 2017.''2 Furthermore, several problems with the current framework have become apparent over the last few years, as for example the fact that some Member States are not on track with meeting their quotas or that feedstock bottlenecks have appeared due to the increased and unbalanced demand for biomass. This reform proposal aims to offer solutions to all these issues, while improving the generation of value added, employment, innovation, and investment in Europe. All of these criteria can be better fulfilled by industrial material use than by energy use (of th e same amount) of biomass. The strengthening of the biobased material sector will contribute to the desired industrial renaissance recently communicated by the European Commission, while still reducing greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to a strong climate policy of the European Union (EU). Furthermore, it aims at lessening the dependence on public subsidies while still using, preserving and expanding the existing structures in place for bioenergy and biofuels. The revolutionary proposal calls for an opening of the support system to also make biobased chemicals and materials accountable for the renewables quota of each Member State. The basic idea is to transform the RED into a REMD-a ''Renewable Energy and Materials Directive.'' It does not intend to establish a new quota for the chemical industry. Instead, it proposes that the material use of a biobased building block such as bioethanol or biomethane should be accounted for in the renewables quota the same way as it counts for the energy use of the same building block, e.g., fuel. Other building blocks, such as succinic acid, lactic acid, etc., could be accounted for based on a conversion into bioethanol equivalents according to their calorific value. Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions could also be the basis for such a conversion. Six more evolutionary proposals complement this comprehensive idea of a REMD. They focus especially on resource efficiency by restricting bioenergy's share of the RED quotas, strengthening solar and wind power within the European renewables framework, and by including more CO2-based fuels in the quota. It is proposed to abolish multiple counting within the quota, except for raw materials stemming from cascading or recycling processes. Furthermore, in the future, representatives of the material sector should also be heard for any reform concerning energy won from biomass. Finally, the reform paper addresses the current debate about sustainability certifications for biomass used for any purpose. It points out that sustainabil ity certifications for the energy sector were only implemented hand in hand with considerable incentives. This aspect is often forgotten in the discussion. The paper proposes installing the same sustainability criteria for biomass used for materials that are required for the use of energy, if the same incentives are applied.

AB  - The acidity of a prereduced Cu/SiO2 catalyst was extensively investigated by means of FT-IR of adsorbed pyridine and by titration with 2-phenylethylamine in cyclohexane. Comparison with the parent CuO/SiO 2 material, which was already shown to exhibit Lewis acid sites due to the high dispersion of the CuO phase, provided evidence that reduction of this phase to the metallic state increases the acidity of the material. This allowed us to set up a bifunctional catalyst showing acidic and hydrogenation activity, both ascribable to the presence of the metal particle, without the need of an acidic support. This catalyst was tested in the one-pot transformation of γ-valerolactone into pentyl valerate and showed comparable activity (91% vs 92% conversion) and improved selectivity (92% vs 72%) with respect to the previously reported copper catalyst supported on acidic material. The role of Cu in activating the substrate was also evidenced through FTIR of adsorbed γ-valerolactone. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The substitution of petroleum based synthetic lubricant with rapeseed oil based bio-lubricant in a variable compression ratio diesel engine is explored in this study. Rapeseed oil based bio-lubricant was formulated through chemical modifications like epoxidation, hydroxylation and esterification process for improving its thermo-oxidative stability and cold flow properties. The nano CuO (copper oxide) an anti-wear nano additive was added to chemically modified rapeseed oil to improve anti-wear behavior. To study the compatibility of formulated bio-lubricant, two endurance tests of 150heach were conducted on a four-stroke variable compression ratio engine fueled with B20 rapeseed oil bio diesel at a standard CR (compression ratio) of 17.5:1 using synthetic lubricant (SAE20W40) and formulated bio-lubricant. The various challenges related to performance and emission analysis are discussed and compared with SAE20W40 from no load to full load conditions and at different CR varies from 12:1, 15:1 and 17.5:1 with B20 rapeseed oil based biofuel/bio-lubricant combination. The main findings show that the combined use of biofuel/bio-lubricant of rapeseed oil reduced Fe, Al, Cu wear, soot and ash content, when compared to bio fuel/SAE20W40 combination. The brake thermal, mechanical efficiencies and brake power with rapeseed oil based bio-lubricant is comparable with SAE20W40 and also the similar emission spectra was observed in the bio-lubricant. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Continued legislative pressure to reduce exhaust emissions from CI (compression ignition) has resulted in the development of advanced fuel injection equipment. This advanced injection system produces higher temperatures and pressures at the injector tip, where deposit formation is initiated. In this research, an endurance test was carried out for 250h on 2 fuel samples; DF (diesel fuel) as baseline fuel and JB20 (20% jatropha biodiesel and 80% DF) in a single-cylinder CI engine. The effects of JB20 on injector nozzle deposits, engine lubricating oil, and fuel economy and exhaust emissions were investigated during the endurance test. According to the results of the investigation, visual inspection showed some deposit accumulation on injectors for both fuel samples. SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and EDX (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) analysis showed greater carbon deposits on and around the injector tip for JB20 compared to the engine running with DF. Similarly, lubricating oil analysis presented excessive wear metal concentrations and decreased viscosity values when the engine was fueled with JB20. Finally, fuel economy and emission results during the endurance test showed higher BSFC (brake specific fuel consumption) and NOx emissions, and lower HC (hydrocarbons) and CO (carbon monoxide) emissions, for the JB20 blend compared to DF. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The properties of biodiesel as fuel are strongly defined by the molecular structure of its constituent species (saturated, unsaturated and hydroxylated fatty acid alkyl esters). Improving fuel properties and energetic patterns in biodiesel implies optimising its fatty ester structures and compositions. Biodiesel fuels derived from different sources can have significantly varying fatty acid profiles and properties, which claims for the theoretical prediction of the thermophysical and phase equilibria properties of biodiesel compounds and its mixtures. In this work the SAFT-γ (Statistical Associating Fluid Theory by group contribution) is applied for predicting these properties in biodiesel fuels by adequately representing the physical behaviour and stereochemistry of biodiesel molecules. A realistic representation of the molecular structure of long chain methyl esters and esters that contains hydroxyl groups, which are the typical biodiesel fuel constituents, is obtained. We implemented a simplex simulated annealing algorithm as global optimisation method to determine the SAFT-γ parameters for the groups that fully represent the biodiesel compounds, which were fitting to experimental data available for analogous chemical families like secondary alkanols and short chain esters. These parameters are theoretically justifiable following physically meaningful trends and can be generalised to others fatty acid methyl esters in the same homologous series. The group of like and unlike parameters obtained were used to represent the thermophysical properties of several commercial biodiesel fuels. The theory provides a very good description of the liquid vapour equilibria behaviour of the chemical families used to estimate the set of parameters. With the proposed model, any potential biodiesel fuel from any feedstock can be represented and modelled. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Effects of variation in biodiesel fuel properties on engine performance are not completely understood and there is a need for further research. A review of literature studies on biodiesel engine performance and emissions is presented here, summarising known effects and highlighting aspects in need of further study. In particular, it is evident few studies have reported on the effects of biodiesel oxidation, and antioxidant additives. It is well known that physical properties of biodiesel such as the bulk modulus and viscosity alter the injected fuel-spray characteristics. Biodiesel's greater density and oxygenated structure results in proportionally lower energy content. Unsaturation level affects Cetane number and combustion characteristics. Maximum engine power usually decreases according to the lower volumetric energy content of biodiesel, and fuel consumption is expected to increase around 14%. Impacts on emissions are difficult to conclude generally due to contrasting reports. However, dominant emissions trends are usually an increase in oxides of nitrogen, and decreases in carbon monoxide, particulate matter, unburned hydrocarbons and aromatics. Changes in emissions of carbonyl compounds are less certain. The effect of alcohol type used in biodiesel production is not clear, neither is the effect of biodiesel oxidation and antioxidant additives. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Effects of variation in biodiesel fuel properties on engine performance are not completely understood and there is a need for further research. The effects of altering the feedstock oil and alcohol type used in biodiesel production on engine performance (power, economy) and exhaust emissions (O2, CO (carbon monoxide), CO2, NO) were investigated. Nine fatty acid methyl esters (Rapeseed, Sunflower, Palm, Corn, Soybean, Olive, Used Cooking Oil, Lard, Beef Tallow) and five fatty acid ethyl esters (Rapeseed, Soybean, Palm, Lard, Tallow) were studied. Compared to petro-diesel, biodiesel showed increased O2 emissions and 43% lower CO emissions. No differences in CO2 levels between any of the fuels observed. NO emissions for different biodiesel types were higher, similar, or lower than petro-diesel. Increased biodiesel unsaturation level correlated with higher NO levels. Oxidation of biodiesel resulted in relatively higher exhaust O2 and lower NO and CO emissions. Contaminants (vegetable oil, antioxidant, water) had little effects on engine performance. Methyl esters performed no differently to ethyl esters, though ethyl esters showed improved cold flow properties. No differences in performance (power, economy) were observed between any of the biodiesels tested. Fuel consumption increased ~10% when running on biodiesel and maximum engine power was slightly reduced, compared to petro-diesel. © 2014.

AB  - Here, we analyze greenhouse gas emissions and fossil energy demand for roundwood supply chain activities (harvesting and transport) within the state of Michigan. A life-cycle assessment was completed, relying on a combination of peer-reviewed literature, national databases, and primary data collected from Michigan loggers and truckers. Several equipment configurations and operating scenarios for roundwood harvesting have been considered. Results indicated that a full processor/forwarder is the best combination of harvesting equipment, with greenhouse gas emissions of 9.9-14.7 kg CO2eq/green tonne, due to relatively low inputs and high reported productivity, although environmental impacts of harvesting depend strongly on the intensity of harvest being conducted. Bimodal truck + rail transport has environmental burdens roughly one third to half that of typical log truck transport at longer transport distances, directly related to the increased fuel efficiency of rail transport. Aggregated results for roundwood supply within Michigan are comparable to similar studies in other regions, although the mechanization of the harvesting industry and large size of Michigan log trucks are factors in the smaller environmental burden. A sensitivity analysis indicated that a variety of factors related to truck transport (distance, fuel economy, load factor, truck capacity) are the most influential for overall environmental impacts of the forest biomass supply chain. Environmental impacts associated with roundwood supply are quite low in comparison to the carbon content and embodied energy of delivered wood, implying that roundwood supply activities do not preclude beneficial use of this feedstock in biofuels or bioenergy applications. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - While biodiesel production and consumption for use in transportation has risen considerably over the last decade, its competitiveness in the marketplace is largely due to regulatory and fiscal support from governmental bodies, exceeding $25 billion in 2010 in the EU and US alone. The price of feedstocks represent 80-85% of the total biodiesel cost, and with over 350 different oil feedstocks available for blending, there is potential to optimize feedstock blends to reduce costs. This paper presents a chance-constrained optimization model that considers the technical constraints of conventional, first generation feedstocks, pricing trends, as well as the uncertainty and variation latent within these numbers. Further, the frequency with which a feedstock blend portfolio should be re-evaluated is considered through a case study. The model is then applied to a second case study for actual fuel constraint scenarios used in the EU and US. The results demonstrate the potential for substantial cost savings through targeted feedstock diversification, minimizing risks to producers from price fluctuations while still meeting technical fuel standards. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper we present a life cycle assessment (LCA) based biofuel supply chain model with multi-conversion pathways. This model was formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem which took economic, energy, and environmental criteria (3E) into consideration. The economic objective was measured by the total annual profit. The energy objective was measured by using the average fossil energy input per megajoule (MJ) of biofuel. The environmental objective was measured by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per MJ of biofuel. After carefully consideration of the current situation in China, we chose to examine three conversion pathways: bio-ethanol (BE), bio-methanol (BM) and bio-diesel (BD). LCA was integrated to a multi-objective supply chain model by dividing each pathway into several individual parts and analyzing each part. The multi-objective MILP problem was solved using a ε-constraint method by defining the total annual profit as the optimization objective and assigning the average fossil energy input per MJ biofuel and GHG emissions per MJ biofuel as constraints. This model was then used to design an experimental biofuel supply chain for China. A surface of the Pareto optimal solutions was obtained by linear interpolation of the non-inferior solutions. The optimal results included the choice of optimal conversion pathway, biomass type, biomass locations, facility locations, and network topology structure in the biofuel supply chain. Distributed and centralized systems were also factored into our experimental system design. In addition, the influence of price change on the optimal solutions was investigated. The optimal solutions obtained in this study reveal a tradeoff between the impact of the 3E criteria. These results indicate that our model will be extremely useful for the design and planning of biofuel supply chains in China. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lean gasoline engines running on ethanol/gasoline blends and equipped with a silver/alumina catalyst for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ethanol provide a pathway to reduced petroleum consumption through both increased biofuel utilization and improved engine efficiency relative to the current stoichiometric gasoline engines that dominate the U.S. light duty vehicle fleet. A pre-commercial silver/alumina catalyst demonstrated high NOx conversions over a moderate temperature window with both neat ethanol and ethanol/gasoline blends containing at least 50% ethanol. Selectivity to NH3 increases with HC dosing and ethanol content in gasoline blends, but appears to "saturate" at around 45%. NO2 and acetaldehyde behave like intermediates in the ethanol SCR of NO. NH3 SCR of NOx does not appear to play a major role in the ethanol SCR reaction mechanism. Ethanol is responsible for the low temperature SCR activity observed with the ethanol/gasoline blends. The gasoline HCs do not deactivate the ethanol SCR activity, but they also do not appear to be significantly activated by the presence of ethanol. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work compared the production of biodiesel from two different non-edible oils with relatively high acid values (Jatropha oil and Krating oil). Using non-catalytic supercritical methanol transesterification, high methyl ester yield (85-90%) can be obtained in a very short time (5-10. min). However, the dependence of fatty acid methyl ester yield on reaction conditions (i.e., temperature and pressure) and the optimum conditions were different by the source of oils and were correlated to the amount of free fatty acids (FFAs) and unsaturated fatty acid content in oils. Krating oil, which has higher FFAs and unsaturated fatty acid content, gave higher fatty acid methyl ester yield of 90.4% at 260. °C, 16. MPa, and 10. min whereas biodiesel from Jatropha oil gave fatty acid methyl ester yield of 84.6% at 320. °C, 15. MPa and 5. min using the same molar ratio of methanol to oil 40:1. The product quality from crude Krating oil met the biodiesel standard. Pre-processing steps such as degumming or oil purification are not necessary. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this experimental work, the density, dynamic viscosity and higher heating value of methyl ester based waste cooking palm-biodiesel oil (WMEPB) was investigated under varying temperature and blend ratio condition with No. 2 diesel fuel. The transesterified fatty acid methyl ester of palm vegetable oil collected from local food and beverage shops was used as neat biodiesel. Four different fuel blends (20%, 40%, 60% and 80% by volume mixing with base diesel) were studied along with base No. 2 diesel fuel and pure biodiesel. Tests for dynamic viscosity and density were performed in the temperature range 0-130°C for each fuel sample whereas the higher heating values were determined at 25°C room temperature condition. It is found that pure biodiesel has the highest density and dynamic viscosity at a given temperature whereas it exhibits lowest combustion heating value among the six fuels. Moreover, the density for each fuel sample decreases linearly with the increase in temperature. On the other hand, the dynamic viscosity decreases exponentially with the temperature for each fuel sample. In addition, based on the experimental results, regression correlations have been proposed for the density, dynamic viscosity, and higher heating value of the fuels. Subsequently, comprehensive error analyses of these proposed correlations were performed. In particular, the correlation for density and dynamic viscosity were respectively compared with Kay's mixing rule and Grunberg-Nissan mixing rule theory in order to validate their applicability. It is found that density correlations predicted within ±0.3% average error band. And, as high as 72.2% of the dynamic viscosity data were in the range of ±5% average error while the remaining data fell within ±10% error range. And finally, through a comparative study with the available fuel property results of fresh methyl ester palm biodiesel, it is found that available existing correlations derived from fresh palm biodiesel studies can not accurately predict the fuel properties of same waste biodiesel and its blends with diesel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the emission reduction potential of pine oil, a plant based bio-fuel, when fumigated in a single cylinder diesel engine. Despite the feasibility of using pine oil as a potential candidate for diesel engine application, big revelation has not been made on its utility in a diesel engine. Therefore, we embarked on a research work to capitalize the renewable source of energy from bio-derived fuel, pine oil, which is much greener to the environment. Pine oil, an oxygenated fuel, possesses lower viscosity, boiling point and flash point, similar to other plant based fuels like ethanol and eucalyptus oil. However, due to its lower cetane number, the operation of it in a diesel engine demands ignition support and the lower viscosity of it necessitates modification with the fuel injection system to avert long term durability issues. Therefore, contrary to the regular method of using biofuels in blends with diesel, this study has attempted to fumigate pine oil in the inlet manifold while diesel was injected through the main injection system. By this measure, homogenized pine oil/air mixture was inducted into the cylinder and ignited by the auto-ignition of diesel. From the experimental investigation, it has been observed that pine oil can replace diesel up to 60% and 36%, at low and full load conditions, respectively. Significantly, smoke emission has been drastically reduced by 64.2% than normal diesel operation at full load condition, with a slight increase in NOX (oxides of nitrogen) emission. Moreover, CO (carbon monoxide) and HC (hydrocarbon) emissions have been found to be 67.5% and 47.8% lower than that of diesel at full load condition. On the other hand, CO and HC emissions were noted to be increased at low load condition; however, the RAE (relative average emission) of HC, CO and smoke was found to be reduced. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Single-particle mass-spectrometric measurements were carried out in the high Arctic north of 80° during summer 2008. The campaign took place onboard the icebreaker Oden and was part of the Arctic Summer Cloud Ocean Study (ASCOS). The instrument deployed was an aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ATOFMS) that provides information on the chemical composition of individual particles and their mixing state in real time. Aerosols were sampled in the marine boundary layer at stations in the open ocean, in the marginal ice zone, and in the pack ice region. The largest fraction of particles detected for subsequent analysis in the size range of the ATOFMS between approximately 200 and 3000 nm in diameter showed mass-spectrometric patterns, indicating an internal mixing state and a biomass burning and/or biofuel source. The majority of these particles were connected to an air mass layer of elevated particle concentration mixed into the surface mixed layer from the upper part of the marine boundary layer. The second largest fraction was represented by sea salt particles. The chemical analysis of the over-ice sea salt aerosol revealed tracer compounds that reflect chemical aging of the particles during their long-range advection from the marginal ice zone, or open waters south thereof prior to detection at the ship. From our findings we conclude that long-range transport of particles is one source of aerosols in the high Arctic. To assess the importance of long-range particle sources for aerosol-cloud interactions over the inner Arctic in comparison to local and regional biogenic primary aerosol sources, the chemical composition of the detected particles was analyzed for indicators of marine biological origin. Only a minor fraction showed chemical signatures of potentially ocean-derived primary particles of that kind. However, a chemical bias in the ATOFMS's detection capabilities observed during ASCOS might suggest the presence of a particle type of unknown composition and source. In general, the study suffered from low counting statistics due to the overall small number of particles found in this pristine environment, the small sizes of the prevailing aerosol below the detection limit of the ATOFMS, and its low hit rate. To our knowledge, this study reports on the first in situ single-particle mass-spectrometric measurements in the marine boundary layer of the high-Arctic pack ice region. © 2014 Author(s).

AB  - This study demonstrates a new route for converting bio-oil, prepared from the hydrothermal liquefaction of cornstalks, to diesel- and jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons over Ni/ZrO2 in supercritical cyclohexane. Under relatively mild conditions (573 K, 5 MPa H2), we obtained a high yield (81.6 C%) of hydrocarbons with an excellent quality (90% of diesel- and jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons and 7% of gasoline-range hydrocarbons). Ni/ZrO 2 efficiently and stably catalyzed all types of compounds in the bio-oil to the corresponding alkanes via hydrogenation, dehydration, hydrogenolysis, decarbonylation, and isomerization, without polymerizations among the different reactive compounds in bio-oil. The activity and selectivity for diesel- and jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons of Ni/ZrO2 showed no obvious changes after three cycles. Ni/ZrO2 was fairly stable in supercritical cyclohexane after 72 h of reaction time. This strategy provides a novel high-efficiency pathway for the preparation of high-quality hydrocarbons from bio-oil. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this paper, an optimal process for the simultaneous production of biodiesel (using methanol or bioethanol) and ethers of glycerol is proposed to increase the yield to diesel substitutes in current biodiesel production facilities. The problem is formulated as an optimization model including algae oil production, production of ethanol from starch, transesterification of the oil with bioethanol or methanol, etherification of glycerol with i-butene, which depends on a dynamic model to compute the complex chemical kinetics, and the purification of the ethers. Simultaneous optimization and heat integration are carried out and finally the water consumption of the integrated processes is optimized. Several comparisons are presented. First, the use of glycerol to produce ethers or as a byproduct. Second, the use of different alcohols for biodiesel synthesis in an integrated process. The production of glycerol ethers increases the yield of diesel substitutes by 20%. Furthermore, the energy and water consumptions are competitive with those processes when glycerol is the byproduct. For the integration of glycerol ethers with current biodiesel plants, the use of methanol instead of ethanol is cheaper. However, the current price of i-butene results in high production costs. Simultaneous production of ethanol, biodiesel and glyerol ethers reaches the target of 1/gal for biofuels production cost. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Auto-induced temperature-rise effects of ultrasonic irradiation (UI) on the esterification performance of jatropha oil (JO) were studied. Comparisons with other methods of mechanical mixing (MM) and hand shaking mixing were made. Major system parameters examined include: esterification time (tE), settling time (tS) after esterification and temperature. Properties of acid value (AV), iodine value (IV), kinematic viscosity (KV) and density of JO and ester product were measured. The esterification conversion efficiencies (η) were determined and assessed. Sulfuric acid was used to catalyze the esterification using methyl alcohol. For esterification without temperature control, η at tE=10 and 30min for UI of 56.73 and 83.23% are much higher than those for MM of 36.76 and 42.48%, respectively. At tE=10min, the jatropha oil esters produced via UI and MM respectively possess AV of 15.82 and 23.12mg KOH/g, IV of 111.49 and 113.22g I2/100g, KV of 22.41 and 22.51mm2/s and density of 913.8 and 913.58kg/m3, showing that UI is much better than MM in enhancing the reduction of AV. The tE exhibits more vigorous effect on AV for UI than MM. The UI offers auto-induced temperature-rise, improving the mixing and esterification extents. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Several plant species have been proposed as source of oil for the transesterification reaction that generates the mixture of esters known as biodiesel; this biofuel has been considered as an energetic solution to the political, economic and environmental problems related to the use of petroleum-based fuels. The biodiesel process produces, stoichiometrically, 10% by volume of glycerol. Therefore, purification of the products after the reaction is mandatory. One of the most commonly used methods for biodiesel purification is washing with water. Nevertheless, the limited knowledge of the liquid-liquid equilibria of systems containing biodiesel + alcohol + different solvents have limited the understanding of phase separation and operating conditions of the biodiesel production and purification units, specially by the ethylic route. This work aims at the experimental determination and thermodynamic modeling of liquid-liquid equilibrium data in ternary systems containing ethylic palm oil biodiesel, ethanol and (glycerol or water) at temperatures of 298.15 and 323.15 K and atmospheric pressure. Densimetry and refractive index were the analytical techniques used for the determination of the phase compositions. The results confirmed the efficiency of washing as a method for recovering ethanol from the ester-rich phase generated at the end of the transesterification reaction. The thermodynamic modeling with the NRTL model showed good correlation with the experimental equilibrium data, especially at low and medium concentrations of ethanol. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae have been proposed as potentially promising feedstock for the production of renewable transportation fuels. The plants are intriguing for their capacity to serve both as a source of renewable carbon fuels and as a powerful tool for carbon sequestration. Microalgae remnant, a low-cost by-product of microalgae lipid extraction, is a particularly appealing candidate for these processes. Through catalytic pyrolysis, microalgae remnant is capable of producing aromatic hydrocarbons that could be used for the production of drop-in biofuels. One of the most challenging barriers to this promising pathway is the high moisture content of harvested microalgae. The goal of this study is to compare the economics of two catalytic pyrolysis pathways for the production of drop-in biofuels, each pathway employing its own distinct method of feedstock dewatering: thermal drying or partial mechanical dewatering. The study presents chemical process models, capital expense and operating cost estimates, and sensitivity analyses of both scenarios. Results indicate that thermal drying prior to catalytic pyrolysis (TDCP) incurs capital costs similar to those incurred in partial mechanical dewatering prior to catalytic pyrolysis (MDCP) ($346 million vs. $409 million). TDCP and MDCP yield minimum fuel-selling prices (MFSPs) of $1.80/l and $1.49/l, respectively. Energy analysis shows that TDCP achieves 16.8% energy efficiency and MDCP achieves 26.7% efficiency. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Three waste oils from traditional manufacturing industries in Turkey, such as leather fat, obtained as a by-product in the leather industry, waste anchovy fish oil, derived from the fish-processing industry, and waste frying cottonseed oil from food industry, have been evaluated as alternative raw materials for biodiesel production, with potentially low life-cycle greenhouse emissions. Measured properties such as heating value, density, viscosity, flash point, acidity and cold flow properties, showed that the obtained biodiesel fuels fulfilled both the European and American quality standards and could be used to partially replace petroleum diesel in automotive engines. From gas chromatography analysis, detailed fatty acid profile was obtained, which permitted the application of group contribution methods for the estimation of thermodynamic properties (critical parameters, acentric factor) and thermochemical properties (enthalpies of vaporization and formation). This information was useful to calculate some indicators related to the most important diesel engine emissions, such as soot (main component of particulate matter) and nitric oxide emissions. Soot indicators reveal significant reduction potential with respect to fossil diesel fuels, and, among the studied biodiesel fuels, soot emissions would be lowest for the most saturated and shortest carbon-chain length biodiesel fuel. Adiabatic flame temperature, selected as the main nitric oxide emission indicator, shows small differences among the studied biofuels. Both the properties and emission indicators of the biodiesel fuels studied are within the typical ranges of other conventional biodiesel fuels. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of biofuels as automotive fuels is gradually increasing in order to meet the legislation targets for the use of renewable products in road fuels. Many types of bio-blending components are already used for this purpose throughout Europe with Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAMEs) being the most common. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the impact of Rapeseed Methyl Ester (RME) application on unregulated particulate emissions of modern diesel passenger vehicles, and specifically on exhaust particles' most important chemical constituents. Particle emissions were analyzed for their soluble organic fraction (SOF) and its constituents (fuel-derived SOF and lube oil-derived SOF), as well as for major inorganic ions (nitrate, sulfate, ammonium). Furthermore, the impact of RME on SOF's redox activity was investigated. A hydrocarbon-only diesel fuel (B0) and three blends of RME at 10%, 30% and 50% v/v were tested with three Euro 4 + compliant vehicles, one equipped with an oxidation catalyst and two others with different type of Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF), over the NEDC and Artemis Urban driving cycles. The use of higher biodiesel blends seem to result in increased SOF percentage to the total PM emitted. The same trend was also observed for fuel-derived SOF, while lube oil-derived SOF and major ion percentages to total PM were not significantly affected by the fuel change. Fuel-derived SOF was the major constituent comprising from 70% to 90% of the total SOF emitted. Additionally, in the non-DPF equipped vehicle the increase of biodiesel blend resulted in increased n-alkanes emissions (μg/km) without, however, the differences being statistically significant. Although the non-DPF equipped vehicle exhibited slightly higher sulfate than nitrate emissions, in DPF equipped vehicles sulfate were not detected at all. Higher RME contents resulted in elevated DTT-redox activity per mass in all tested vehicles, while on the other hand, the DTT-redox activity per unit of distance driven was not affected by the fuel change. Both DPF equipped vehicles exhibited 2-3 times higher DTT-redox activity per mass of emitted SOF when compared to the non-DPF equipped vehicle, however they exhibited 3-6 times lower oxidation activity per km, regardless the fuel. This is an indication that a significant amount of potentially more toxic organic compounds are trapped and oxidized in the DPF resulting thus in potentially less toxic organic emissions compared to the non-DPF equipped vehicle. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Cl initiated oxidation reactions of diethyl ketone (DEK; 3-pentanone; (CH3CH2)2CO), 2,2,4,4-d4-diethyl ketone (d4-DEK; (CH3CD2)2CO) and 1,1,1,5,5,5-d6-diethyl ketone (d6-DEK; (CD 3CH2)2CO) are studied at 8 Torr and 550-650 K using Cl2 as a source for the pulsed-photolytic generation of Cl. Products are monitored as a function of reaction time, mass, and photoionization energy using multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometry with tunable synchrotron radiation. Adding a large excess of O2 to the reacting flow allows determination of products resulting from oxidation of the initial primary (Rp) and secondary (Rs) radicals formed via the Cl + DEK reaction. Because of resonance stabilization, the secondary DEK radical (3-oxopentan-2-yl) reaction with O2 has a shallow alkyl peroxy radical (RsO2) well and no energetically low-lying product channels. This leads to preferential back dissociation of RsO 2 and a greater likelihood of consumption of Rs by competing radical-radical reactions. On the other hand, reaction of the primary DEK radical (3-oxopentan-1-yl) with O2 has several accessible bimolecular product channels. Vinyl ethyl ketone is observed from HO 2-elimination from the DEK alkylperoxy radicals, and small-molecule products are identified from β-scission reactions and decomposition reactions of oxy radical secondary products. Although channels yielding OH + 3-, 4-, 5-and 6-membered ring cyclic ether products are possible in the oxidation of DEK, at the conditions of this study (8 Torr, 550-650 K) only the 5-membered ring, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran-3-one, is observed in significant quantities. Computation of relevant stationary points on the potential energy surfaces for the reactions of Rp and Rs with O2 indicates this cyclic ether is formed via a resonance-stabilized hydroperoxyalkyl radical (QOOH) intermediate, formed from isomerization of the RpO2 radical. © 2014 The Owner Societies.

AB  - Background: Microalgae-derived biodiesel is a promising substitute for conventional fossil fuels. In particular, the green alga Chlorella protothecoides sp. 0710 is regarded as one of the best candidates for commercial manufacture of microalgae-derived biofuel. This is due not only to its ability to live autotrophically through photosynthesis, but also to its capacity to produce a large amount of biomass and lipid through fermentation of glucose. However, until the present study, neither its genome sequence nor the platform required for molecular manipulations were available.Results: We generated a draft genome for C. protothecoides, and compared its genome size and gene content with that of Chlorella variabilis NC64A and Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169. This comparison revealed that C. protothecoides has a reduced genome size of 22.9 Mbp, about half that of its close relatives. The C. protothecoides genome encodes a smaller number of genes, fewer multi-copy genes, fewer unique genes, and fewer genome rearrangements compared with its close relatives. In addition, three Chlorella-specific hexose-proton symporter (HUP)-like genes were identified that enable the consumption of glucose and, consequently, heterotrophic growth. Furthermore, through comparative transcriptomic and proteomic studies, we generated a global perspective regarding the changes in metabolic pathways under autotrophic and heterotrophic growth conditions. Under heterotrophic conditions, enzymes involved in photosynthesis and CO2 fixation were almost completely degraded, either as mRNAs or as proteins. Meanwhile, the cells were not only capable of quickly assimilating glucose but also showed accelerated glucose catabolism through the upregulation of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Moreover, the rapid synthesis of pyruvate, upregulation of most enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis, and downregulation of enzymes involved in fatty acid degradation favor the synthesis of fatty acids within the cell.Conclusions: Despite similarities to other Chlorella, C. protothecoides has a smaller genome than its close relatives. Genes involved in glucose utilization were identified, and these genes explained its ability to grow heterotrophically. Transcriptomic and proteomic results provided insight into its extraordinary ability to accumulate large amounts of lipid. The C. protothecoides draft genome will promote the use of this species as a research model. © 2014 Gao et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The Siberian apricot, an economically and ecologically important plant in China, contains seeds high in oil and can grow on marginal land. Although this species has multiple purposes and may be a feedstock of biofuel in China, transcriptome information and molecular research on this species remain limited. RNA-Seq technology has been widely applied to transcriptomics, genomics and the development of molecular markers, and functional gene studies. In this study, we obtained 1,243,067 high-quality reads with a mean size of 425. bp in a single run, totaling 528.4. Mb of sequence data using 454 GS FLX Titanium sequencing. All reads were assembled de novo into 46,940 unigenes with a mean size of 651. bp (range: 45-5566. bp). Assembled unigenes were annotated in multiple public databases based on similarity alignments to genes and proteins. 191 unigenes involving in lipid biosynthesis and metabolism were found, among them, expression patterns of two desaturase enzymes were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), based on six tissues from Siberian apricot, the seeds had the highest expression. 7304 simple sequence repeats (SSR) were identified from 6509 unigenes, a total of 9930 primer pairs were designed, 50 primer pairs were randomly selected to validate of the usefulness, and 24 (48%) primer pairs produced bands of the expected size. These data provide a base of sequence information to improve agronomic characters and molecular marker-assisted breeding to alter the composition of fatty acids in seeds from this plant, and hence, facilitate its utilization as a future biodiesel feedstock. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A novel and very promising area in the search for renewable biofuels and green chemicals is the discovery of microorganisms that produce fuel-related hydrocarbons (Mycodiesel) and other useful products. This is in contrast to yeast fermentation that utilizes expensive sugars or starch to produce ethanol, which is a proven and useful source of fuel but which for many reasons it is not ideal. Recently, a number of endophytic fungi have been isolated and described that make compounds such as mono-terpenoids, alkanes, cyclohexanes, cyclopentanes, and alkyl alcohols/ketones, benzenes and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Many of these compounds are either identical to or are closely related to those specific classes of molecules that are found in diesel. Most importantly, these organisms make hydrocarbons while utilizing cellulosic and hemicellulosic polymers found in all plant-based agricultural wastes. Also discussed are the shortcomings, strategies and methods being used to further develop this technology. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This contribution addresses the multi-period synthesis of an optimally integrated regional biomass and bioenergy supply network through a mixed-integer linear programing (MILP) approach. The production processes from different sources of biomass include first, second, and third generations of biofuels like bioethanol, biodiesel, hydrogen, Fischer Tropsch diesel, and green gasoline. The aim is to maximize the sustainably viable utilization of resources by accounting for the competition between fuels and food production. An MILP model for efficient bioenergy network optimization based on four layers is extended to include several features, such as seasonality and availability of resources, enabling recycles of products and total site heat integration in order to address real-world applications with a systematic decision-making approach. The multi-period optimization of a heat-integrated biorefinery's supply network is performed through maximization of the economic performance. Economically efficient solutions are obtained with optimal selection of raw materials, technologies, intermediate and final product flows, and reduced greenhouse-gas emissions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article describes the key challenges and opportunities in modeling and optimization of biomass-to-bioenergy supply chains. It reviews the major energy pathways from terrestrial and aquatic biomass to bioenergy/biofuel products as well as power and heat with an emphasis on "drop-in" liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Key components of the bioenergy supply chains are then presented, along with a comprehensive overview and classification of the existing contributions on biofuel/bioenergy supply chain optimization. This paper identifies fertile avenues for future research that focuses on multi-scale modeling and optimization, which allows the integration across spatial scales from unit operations to biorefinery processes and to biofuel value chains, as well as across temporal scales from operational level to strategic level. Perspectives on future biofuel supply chains that integrate with petroleum refinery supply chains and/or carbon capture and sequestration systems are presented. Issues on modeling of sustainability and the treatment of uncertainties in bioenergy supply chain optimization are also discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study is confined to optimization of biodiesel production from a non-edible oil yielding plant milk thistle (Silybum marianum) of Mediterranean origin is reported as a new source used as raw material for biodiesel production. This study explains optimization analysis of biodiesel production through base catalyzed transesterification. Effects of four different variables includes the reactant ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction temperature and time were studied. It is found that 80% fatty acids were converted into fatty acid methyl esters within 75 min at 60°C by using 5:1 molar ratio (methanol to oil). The study stated that the order of significant factors effecting biodiesel yield was catalyst concentration > reaction time > reaction temperature > methanol to oil ratio. The fuel properties of milk thistle FAMEs including color, density, kinematic viscosity, sulfur content, total acid number, flash point, pour point, distillation, cloud point, calorific value, and cetane index were determined and compared with ASTM standards. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The combustion characteristics of pool fires of biofuels, canola methyl ester (CME), soy methyl ester (SME), and their blends with a petroleum fuel (No. 2 diesel) were studied. The fuels were burned in cups of two sizes (0.042 m and 0.057 m in diameter and 0.038 m height) that simulated convection-dominated small pool fires of liquids. Blends of CME and SME with diesel fuel were tested with biofuel concentrations of 25, 50, and 75% by volume. The mass burn rate, the fuel surface regression rate, the radiation emission from the flames, the flame temperature field, and the emission indices of CO and NOx were recorded. The fuel surface regression rate in both containers was comparable. Both the fuel mass burning rate and surface regression rate varied non-monotonically with the volume concentration of biofuel in the blend. The radiation fraction of heat release and the temperature profiles were similar for all the flames. The CO emission index decreased with the biofuel content in the fuel. The NOx emission index did not show a systematic and significant dependence on the fuel blend; however, it was smaller than that measured in the turbulent gas jet and liquid spray flames of the corresponding fuels. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - An experimental investigation on a diesel engine was conducted to evaluate the performance and exhaust emissions of sunflower oil and three blends with diesel fuel (20, 40, and 70% oil content volumetrically) in comparison to diesel fuel. Three injection timing and three injector protrusion settings were tested to study engine performance and exhaust emissions. The work was conducted in a direct injection agricultural tractor engine. Engine operation with sunflower oil-based fuels was unproblematic during the short-term experiments. Torque, brake-specific fuel consumption and NOx were enhanced as oil content was increased in the tested fuel. Early injection timing improved torque output, reduced BSFC, increased thermal efficiency, and NOx emissions. Deep injector protrusion increased torque release in low oil content fuels and shallow injector protrusion and increased torque in high oil content fuels. The experimental results were evaluated using two multi-criteria decision-making techniques (Analytical Hierarchy Process-AHP and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution-TOPSIS) and the optimal fuel type-injection timing-injector protrusion configuration was selected. AHP and TOPSIS were run for three groups of criteria that were focusing on higher engine performance, lower environmental impact, and a balance between the first two, respectively. The results of the two techniques were compared. AHP and TOPSIS gave the same attribute ranking in all three groups of criteria, but did not give the same classification of Fuel/Injection Timing/Injector Protrusion configuration. The 70% oil content blend was selected from both techniques as optimal in the examined groups of criteria. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The prospect of depletion of natural energy resources on the Earth forces researchers to seek and explore new and alternative energy sources. Biomass is a composite resource that can be used in many ways leading to diversity of products. Therefore, microalgal biomass offers great potential. The main aim of this study is to find the best physical method of microalgal biomass pretreatment that guarantees efficient lipid extraction. These studies identifies biochemical composition of microalgal biomass as source for biodisel production. The influence of drying at different temperatures and lyophilization was investigated. In addition, wet and untreated biomass was examined. Cell disruption (sonication and microwave) techniques were used to improve lipid extraction from wet biomass. Additionally, two different extraction methods were carried out to select the best method of crude oil extraction. The results of this study show that wet biomass after sonication is the most suitable for extraction. The fatty acid composition of microalgal biomass includes linoleic acid (C18:2), palmitic acid (C16:0), oleic acid (C18:1), linolenic acid (C18:3), and stearic acid (C18:0), which play a key role in biodiesel production. © 2014 Institute of Agrophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - A life cycle analysis (LCA) for pyrolysis biochar systems was carried out to determine greenhouse gas balance, carbon cycling, and the economics of biochar production from different agricultural residues and wastes. Investigating a range of feedstocks (forest residues, corn stover, etc.) provided insight into the use of biomass residues rather than bioenergy crops as biochar production substrates and the resulting energy and climate change impacts. The analyses were conducted based on various optimized pyrolysis parameters for corn fodder and forest residue. The observed reductions of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CO2 equivalent per Mg dry feedstock) for both corn fodder and forest residue were mainly contributed by the stable carbon in the biochar. Corn fodder showed a greater reduction in emissions than forest residue, indicating the corn fodder's greater economic potential for soil sequestration of stable carbon. The relative GHG emission analysis found that the optimization of a biomass pyrolysis system for biochar production is better suited for soil sequestration of stable carbon than as a fuel source. The economic viability of the pyrolysis-biochar system is largely dependent on the costs of feedstock production, pyrolysis, and the value of C offsets. The LCA reported in this study can be instrumental in assessing the environmental potential of biochar production and its application in the region. © 2014 The Author(s).

Two rows of maize at one plant/stand were planted in each plot assigned for T. peruviana/maize while four rows of maize were planted in each plot assigned for sole maize. Soybean at two plants/stand was planted in each plot assigned for T. peruvtana/soybean and sole soybean. Results obtained indicated that T. peruvtana/soybean cropping system improved the vegetative growth parameters of the two component crops while T. peruviana/maize cropping system reduced both the vegetative and the yield parameters of the test crop. However the widest stem width was observed under the control T. peruviana. The kernel size of T. peruviana was not significantly affected irrespective of the cropping systems. The kernel yield of T. peruviana under T. peruvtana/soybean cropping system increased although statistically similar with sole T. peruviana while the seed yield of soybean under T. peruvtana/soybean cropping system significantly increased when compared with the sole soybean. The complimentary use of growth resources such as nutrients, water and light in T. peruviana/soybean cropping system resulted into increase plant height, number of branches and the overall yield of the two component crops. Thus, it can be recommended that for higher yield and sustainability T. peruvtana/soybean cropping system is better adopted among the cropping systems. © 2014 Trop. Agric. (Trinidad).

AB  - Bio-fuel soot (BS) was collected with a homemade soot trapping equipment. A four-ball friction and wear tester was used to investigate the effect of BS on the tribological performance of liquid paraffin (LP). The composition, structure and tribological mechanism of BS were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Results show that chain-like agglomeration of BS was composed of spherical nanoparticles with an average size of about 40 nm. The main ingredients of BS included amorphous carbon and oxygen, as well as a small amount of graphene microcrystal, and the oxygen content of BS was higher than that of diesel soot. With increasing content of BS in LP, the maximum non-seizure load firstly increased and then decreased. In addtion, the average wear scar diameters rose linearly, and the average friction coefficient firstly decreased slightly and then increased. In terms of the tribological mechanism, on the one hand, owing to the action of O-containing functional groups, BS can be easily adsorbed on rubbing surface thereby influencing the effect of boundary lubrication film. On the other hand, BS caused abrasive wear and corrosive wear and promoted detachment of metal oxide film on rubbing surface as abrasive particles, and thereby enhanced wear of the steel-steel sliding pair.

AB  - In order to study the influence of different categories of oxygenated biofuels on the performance and emissions of a diesel engine in a high-altitude anoxic condition, comparative experiments on a horizontal two cylinder diesel engine by use of three fuels: pure diesel, ethanol-diesel E10 (containing 10% ethanol in volume percentage and 90% petroleum diesel in the blend fuel), and biodiesel-ethanol-diesel B10E10 (containing 10% biodiesel, 10% ethanol, and 80% petroleum diesel) blends were carried out. In the process of the test, the engine was not adjusted or modified. The test results showed that when fueled with the E10 and B10E10 oxygenated blended biofuels respectively, the power performance of the diesel engine decreased, and the average drop of the engine brake torque at full-load are 4.24% and 5.49%. And the brake specific energy consumptions (BSEC) of the blended fuels were basically lower than those of the diesel fuel, and the fuel economy improved. The properties of the blended fuels had effects on the changes of the engine fuel economy, and the changes were also related to the engine speed and load. When fueled with the E10 blended fuel, the carbon monoxide (CO) emissions of the engine increased at low loads and decreased at high loads. The hydrocarbon (HC) emissions of the engine were higher than those of the diesel fuel and the percentage range of increment was 4.9%~27.4%. And the nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions were lower than those of the diesel fuel at low loads, which tended to be the same level of the diesel fuel at high loads. When fueled with the B10E10 blends, the carbon monoxide (CO) emissions and the hydrocarbon (HC) emissions of the engine tended to be the pure diesel fuel level at low loads and decreased at high loads. And the nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions decreased at low loads, and increased at high loads. The soot emissions of the engine with the E10 and B10E10 fuels both decreased. The hydrocarbon (HC) emissions, the soot emissions, and the carbon monoxide (CO) emissions at low loads of the diesel engine fueled with the B10E10 fuel were all lower than those of the E10 fuel, while the nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions were basically higher than the E10 fuel level. Compared with the E10 fuel, the B10E10 blended fuel had a better effect on the improvement of the carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, the hydrocarbon (HC) emissions, and the soot emissions of the diesel engine. But the decline in the engine power performance was larger, and the nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions increased. The study can provide a reference for the application of oxygenated biofuels in high-altitude anoxic regions.

AB  - As an alternative transportation fuel to petrodiesel, biodiesel has been promoted within national energy portfolio targets across the world. Early estimations of low lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of biodiesel were a driver behind extensive government support in the form of financial incentives for the industry. However, studies consistently report a high degree of uncertainty in these emissions estimates, raising questions concerning the carbon benefits of biodiesel. Furthermore, the implications of feedstock blending on GHG emissions uncertainty have not been explicitly addressed despite broad practice by the industry to meet fuel quality standards and to control costs. This work investigated the impact of feedstock blending on the characteristics of biodiesel by using a chance-constrained (CC) blend optimization method. The objective of the optimization is minimization of feedstock costs subject to fuel standards and emissions constraints. Results indicate that blending can be used to manage GHG emissions uncertainty characteristics of biodiesel, and to achieve cost reductions through feedstock diversification. Simulations suggest that emissions control policies that restrict the use of certain feedstocks based on their GHG estimates overlook blending practices and benefits, increasing the cost of biodiesel. In contrast, emissions control policies which recognize the multifeedstock nature of biodiesel provide producers with feedstock selection flexibility, enabling them to manage their blend portfolios cost effectively, potentially without compromising fuel quality or emissions reductions. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In the next two decades, the U.S. refining industry will face significant changes resulting from a rapidly evolving domestic petroleum energy landscape. The rapid influx of domestically sourced tight light oil and relative demand shifts for gasoline and diesel will impose challenges on the ability of the U.S. refining industry to satisfy both demand and quality requirements. This study uses results from Linear Programming (LP) modeling data to examine the potential impacts of these changes on refinery, process unit, and product-specific efficiencies, focusing on current baseline efficiency values across 43 existing large U.S. refineries that are operating today. These results suggest that refinery and product-specific efficiency values are sensitive to crude quality, seasonal and regional factors, and refinery configuration and complexity, which are determined by final fuel specification requirements. Additional processing of domestically sourced tight light oil could marginally increase refinery efficiency, but these benefits could be offset by crude rebalancing. The dynamic relationship between efficiency and key parameters such as crude API gravity, sulfur content, heavy products, residual upgrading, and complexity are key to understanding possible future changes in refinery efficiency. Relative to gasoline, the efficiency of diesel production is highly variable, and is influenced by the number and severity of units required to produce diesel. To respond to future demand requirements, refiners will need to reduce the gasoline/diesel (G/D) production ratio, which will likely result in greater volumes of diesel being produced through less efficient pathways resulting in reduced efficiency, particularly on the marginal barrel of diesel. This decline in diesel efficiency could be offset by blending of Gas to Liquids (GTL) diesel, which could allow refiners to uplift intermediate fuel streams into more efficient diesel production pathways, thereby allowing for the efficient production of incremental barrels of diesel without added capital investment for the refiner. Given the current wide range of refinery carbon intensity values of baseline transportation fuels in LCA models, this study has shown that the determination of refinery, unit, and product efficiency values requires careful consideration in the context of specific transportation fuel GHG policy objectives. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study describes two applications of a variant of the multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) method with a correlation constraint. The first application describes the use of MCR-ALS for the determination of biodiesel concentrations in biodiesel blends using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic data. In the second application, the proposed method allowed the determination of the synthetic antioxidant N,N′-Di-sec-butyl-p-phenylenediamine (PDA) present in biodiesel mixtures from different vegetable sources using UV-visible spectroscopy. Well established multivariate regression algorithm, partial least squares (PLS), were calculated for comparison of the quantification performance in the models developed in both applications. The correlation constraint has been adapted to handle the presence of batch-to-batch matrix effects due to ageing effects, which might occur when different groups of samples were used to build a calibration model in the first application. Different data set configurations and diverse modes of application of the correlation constraint are explored and guidelines are given to cope with different type of analytical problems, such as the correction of matrix effects among biodiesel samples, where MCR-ALS outperformed PLS reducing the relative error of prediction RE (%) from 9.82% to 4.85% in the first application, or the determination of minor compound with overlapped weak spectroscopic signals, where MCR-ALS gave higher (RE (%)=3.16%) for prediction of PDA compared to PLS (RE (%)=1.99%), but with the advantage of recovering the related pure spectral profile of analytes and interferences. The obtained results show the potential of the MCR-ALS method with correlation constraint to be adapted to diverse data set configurations and analytical problems related to the determination of biodiesel mixtures and added compounds therein. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In recent years biodiesel has become an alternative to the growing demand for biofuels. The main challenge is to produce high quality biodiesel which is economically competitive with fossil-based diesel fuels. Most biodiesel studies are based on bench scale alkali-catalyzed technology and no detailed technological information is available to compare industrial data with process simulation. This work presents simulation of a batch industrial plant for biodiesel production and makes a comparative study of preliminary economic feasibility with a reactive continuous distillation process. Simulated results were compared with those obtained in an industrial plant. Economic assessment of the process was carried out using total annualized unit cost. Simulated results presented agreement with experimental industrial data. Economic assessment showed that the reactive distillation process was more cost-effective than the batch process for the production of biodiesel. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, we sought to elucidate the relationships between biomass feedstock type and the suitability of their fast-pyrolysis bio-oils for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) upgrading. Switchgrass, Eucalyptus benthamii, and equine manure feedstocks were pyrolyzed into bio-oil using a continuous fast-pyrolysis system. We also synthesized variations of switchgrass bio-oil using catalytic pyrolysis methods (HZSM-5 catalyst or tail-gas recycle method). Bio-oil samples underwent batch HDO reactions at 320 C under ~ 2100 psi H 2 atmosphere for 4 h, using Pt, Ru, or Pd on carbon supports. Hydrogen consumption was measured and correlated with compositional trends. The resulting organic, aqueous, and gas phases were analyzed for their chemical compositions. Mass balances indicate little coke formation. Switchgrass bio-oil over Pt/C performed the best in terms of hydrogen consumption efficiency, deoxygenation efficiency, and types of upgraded bio-oil compounds. Eucalyptus feedstocks consistently consumed more than twice the normal amount of hydrogen gas per run, primarily due to the elevated syringol content. Catalytically pyrolyzed bio-oils deoxygenated poorly over Pt/C but hydrogenated more extensively than other oils. Although the relative deoxygenation (%DO rel) varied based on feedstock and catalyst, the absolute deoxygenation (%DOabs) depended only on the overall yield. The total extent of upgrading (hydrogenation + deoxygenation) remained independent of feedstock and catalyst. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz, known by such popular names as "gold-of-pleasure" and "false flax," is an alternative oilseed crop for biofuel production and can be grown in harsh environments. Considerable interest is now being given to the new concept of the development of a fusion plant which can be used as a soil remediation plant for ground contaminated by heavy metals as well as a bioenergy crop. However, knowledge of the transport processes for heavy metals across Camelina plant membranes is still rudimentary. Results: Firstly, to investigate whether Camelina HMA (heavy metal P1B-ATPase) genes could be used in such a plant, we analyzed the expression patterns of eight HMA genes in Camelina (taken from the root, leaf, stem, flower, and silique). CsHMA3 genes were expressed in all organs. In addition, CsHMA3 was induced in roots and leaves especially after Pb treatment. Heterogeneous expression of CsHMA3 complemented the Pb- or Zn-sensitive phenotype of Δycf1 or Δzrc1 yeast mutant strains. Subsequently, we cloned and overexpressed CsHMA3 in Camelina. The root growth of transgenic lines was better than that in the wild-type plant under heavy metal stress (for Cd, Pb, and Zn). In particular, the transgenic lines showed enhanced Pb tolerance in a wide range of Pb concentrations. Furthermore, the Pb and Zn content in the shoots of the transgenic lines were higher than those in the wild-type plant. These results suggest that overexpression of CsHMA3 might enhance Pb and Zn tolerance and translocation. Also, the transgenic lines displayed a wider leaf shape compared with the wild-type plant due to an induction of genes related to leaf width growth and showed a greater total seed yield compared to the wild type under heavy metal stress. Conclusions: Our data obtained from physiological and functional analyses using CsHMA3 overexpression plants will be useful to develop a multifunctional plant that can improve the productivity of a bioenergy crop and simultaneously be used to purify an area contaminated by various heavy metals. © 2014 Park et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - High value-added aromatic aldehydes (e.g. vanillin and syringaldehyde) were produced from heavy fraction of bio-oil (HFBO) via catalytic oxidation. The concept is based on the use of metalloporphyin as catalyst and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as oxidant under alkaline condition. The biomimetic catalyst cobalt(II)-sulfonated tetraphenylporphyrin (Co(TPPS 4)) was prepared and characterized. It exhibited relative high activity in the catalytic oxidation of HFBO. 4.57 wt % vanillin and 1.58 wt % syringaldehyde were obtained from catalytic oxidation of HFBO, compared to 2.6 wt % vanillin and 0.86 wt % syringaldehyde without Co(TPPS4). Moreover, a possible mechanism of HFBO oxidation using Co(TPPS 4)/H2O2 was proposed by the research of model compounds. The results showed that this is a promising and environmentally friendly method for production of aromatic aldehydes from HFBO under Co(TPPS4)/H2O2 system.

AB  - The catalyst systems Mo/Co/K/ZSM-5 and Mo/Ni/K/ZSM-5, alone and with the added copper-based water gas shift catalyst, were used for the conversion of two CO/H2 ratios in a batch reactor. GC analysis of the gas phase was used to determine CO conversion while GCMS and NMR studies were used to characterize the liquid products formed and liquid product selectivities. The liquids were hydrocarbons consisting mainly of alkyl substituted benzenes. Methyl substitution in the alkyl benzenes in the product liquid ranged from an average of 1.3 to 4.5 methyls per ring depending on reaction conditions and reactant gas mole ratios. The additional presence of the WGS catalyst significantly increased CO conversion in the reactions taking place at 280 °C from ∼25% to ∼90% while increasing selectivity toward higher average methyl substitution. Similar conversions and selectivities were observed with both a bio-syngas and a 50/50 mixture of H2 and CO. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This investigation examines the particulate matter (PM), particulate carbon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted from a generator fueled by petroleum diesel blended with waste-edible-oil-biodiesel and water-containing acetone. Experimental results show that using biodieselhols with water-containing (or pure) acetone as the fuel of generator, in comparison to using petroleum diesel, significantly reduces PM emission; roughly, this reduction increased as percentage of water-containing acetone increased. When the percentages of waste-edible-oil-biodiesel were ≤5vol%, adding pure or water-containing acetone (1-3vol%) to biodieselhols generated emission reductions of NOx, PM, particle-bound organic carbon (OC), total-PAHs, and total-BaPeq. Consequently, using water-containing acetone biodieselhols as an alternative generator fuel is feasible and helps recycle and reuse waste solvents containing water-containing acetone. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Since ethanol is considered an essential additive for biofuel production, there may be the opportunity to employ it as such in Mexico. However, an analysis of the ethanol supply chain should be performed first. Therefore, in order to analyze the main variables of the ethanol supply chain, as well as the feasibility for its use, the present research developed a System Dynamics model based on an idea suggested by SENER (Secretariat of Energy in Mexico). The model explores five possible scenarios (between 2014 and 2030), and evaluates the availability of area for the sowing of sugarcane and grain sorghum crops, the production capacity for ethanol and fuel, as well as the possible reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. The model considers the trends and parameters of the agricultural and energy industries, and produces valuable information about future conditions of the Mexican biofuel and fossil fuel production and supply. The obtained results predicted two situations. First, Mexico would face a fuel shortage in the future. Second, from the amount of fuel available by that time, the biofuel produced and accumulated would collaborate little to meet the domestic fuel demand. Also, as System Dynamics is concerned, it is demonstrated that it is a powerful methodology to simulate and understand the biofuel supply chains in emerging markets as Mexico. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The use of biofuels for road transport in Sweden has increased during the past 10. years as policymakers stimulate demand in response to concerns about climate change. Using a supply chain approach, this paper analyses: (i) existing biofuel supply chains in Sweden (biogas, biodiesel and bioethanol) in terms of security of supply, and (ii) possibilities to achieve synergies between implementation of climate change mitigation practices and security of supply objectives, through increased production and use of biofuels. We argue that synergies can arise when exposure to upstream market risk decreases, the risk of the feedstock does not correlate with the fuel that it replaces, producers can switch between feedstocks and end user vulnerability to disruptions decreases. In the current Swedish context, the features of the biogas supply chain make it the most beneficial option, followed by biodiesel. In the way it has been implemented, bioethanol is the least favourable option. The paper concludes by outlining how biofuels could contribute to security of supply in the future. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To investigate the combustion characteristics of Jatropha pure oil (JPO) and Jatropha methyl ester (JME) as an alternative fuels for gas turbines, combustion experiments were conducted at atmospheric pressure employing an air-assist pressure swirl atomizer. As well as the NOx and CO concentrations and smoke number in the exhaust gas, the flame radiation intensity was measured using the two-color method. The results show that the flame radiation intensity and the soot emission decrease with increasing mixing ratio of JPO or JME to diesel fuel. It was also found that the flame radiation intensity has a strong correlation with the mean diameter of the fuel spray for all fuels. The CO emission for JPO is higher than those for JME and diesel fuel in the case of low flame temperature. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A new continuous-flow reactor was designed for the conversion of glycerol to solketal, an oxygenated fuel additive, through ketalization with acetone. Six heterogeneous catalysts were investigated with respect to their catalytic activity and stability in a flow reactor. The acidity of the catalysts positively influences the catalyst's activity. Among all the solid acid catalysts tested, the maximum solketal yield from experiments at 40°C, 600 psi and WHSV of 4h-1 attained 73% and 88% at the acetone/glycerol molar ratio of 2.0 and 6.0, respectively, with Amberlyst Wet. Based on the solketal yield and glycerol conversion results, the activity of all catalysts tested follows the following order of sequence: Amberlyst Wet≈Zeolite≈Amberlyst Dry&gt;Zirconium Sulfate&gt;Montmorillonite&gt;Polymax. An increase in acetone/glycerol molar ratio or a decrease in WHSV enhanced the glycerol conversion as expected. This process offers an attractive route for converting glycerol, the main by-product of biodiesel, to solketal - a value-added green product with potential industrial applications as a valuable fuel additive or combustion promoter for gasoline engines. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the current literature, the life cycle, technoeconomic, and resource assessments of microalgae-based biofuel production systems have relied on growth models extrapolated from laboratory-scale data, leading to a large uncertainty in results. This type of simplistic growth modeling overestimates productivity potential and fails to incorporate biological effects, geographical location, or cultivation architecture. This study uses a large-scale, validated, outdoor photobioreactor microalgae growth model based on 21 reactor- and species-specific inputs to model the growth of Nannochloropsis. This model accurately accounts for biological effects such as nutrient uptake, respiration, and temperature and uses hourly historical meteorological data to determine the current global productivity potential. Global maps of the current near-term microalgae lipid and biomass productivity were generated based on the results of annual simulations at 4,388 global locations. Maximum annual average lipid yields between 24 and 27 m3·ha-1·y -1, corresponding to biomass yields of 13 to 15 g·m -2·d-1, are possible in Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, and Saudi Arabia. The microalgae lipid productivity results of this study were integrated with geography-specific fuel consumption and land availability data to perform a scalability assessment. Results highlight the promising potential of microalgae-based biofuels compared with traditional terrestrial feedstocks. When water, nutrients, and CO 2 are not limiting, many regions can potentially meet significant fractions of their transportation fuel requirements through microalgae production, without land resource restriction. Discussion focuses on sensitivity of monthly variability in lipid production compared with annual average yields, effects of temperature on productivity, and a comparison of results with previous published modeling assumptions.

AB  - A life cycle assessment (LCA) focused on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the production of microalgal biodiesel was carried out based on a detailed engineering and economic analysis. This LCA applies the methodology of the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (CA LCFS) and uses life cycle inventory (LCI) data for process inputs, based on the California-Modified Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (CA GREET) model. Based on detailed mass and energy balances, calculated GHG emissions from this algal biodiesel system are 70% lower than those of conventional diesel fuel, meeting the minimum 50% GHG reduction requirements under the EPA RFS2 and 60% for the European Union Renewable Energy Directive. This LCA study provides a guide to the research and development objectives that must be achieved to meet both economic and environmental goals for microalgae biodiesel production. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - We present a global analysis of CO2 emission reductions from the light-duty vehicle (LDV) fleet consistent with stabilization of atmospheric CO2 concentration at 450 ppm. The CO2 emission reductions are described by g CO2/km emission targets for average new light-duty vehicles on a tank-to-wheel basis between 2010 and 2050 that we call CO 2 glide paths. The analysis accounts for growth of the vehicle fleet, changing patterns in driving distance, regional availability of biofuels, and the changing composition of fossil fuels. New light-duty vehicle fuel economy and CO2 regulations in the U.S. through 2025 and in the EU through 2020 are broadly consistent with the CO2 glide paths. The glide path is at the upper end of the discussed 2025 EU range of 68-78 g CO2/km. The proposed China regulation for 2020 is more stringent than the glide path, while the 2017 Brazil regulation is less stringent. Existing regulations through 2025 are broadly consistent with the light-duty vehicle sector contributing to stabilizing CO2 at approximately 450 ppm. The glide paths provide long-term guidance for LDV powertrain/fuel development. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Alkyl levulinates are biobased chemicals having a strong potential to be used in various applications, substituting current chemicals produced from petro-chemical routes. Dedicated literature has considerably increased in the past five years. This review describes state-of-the-art preparation routes and their main application fields. Alkyl levulinates are obtained in high yields and selectivities from simple biomass-derived products like levulinic acid or furfuryl alcohol. They are also obtained directly from lignocellulosic resources with generally limited yields. In all cases, the transformation needs a catalyst. Current efforts are now performed with developing efficient and recyclable catalysts. Alkyl levulinates found applications as solvents and additives as well as in the area of chemical synthesis. The development of new preparation routes and applications of alkyl levulinates are contributing to future greener and sustainable processes. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A cost effective and efficient method for the preparation of fuel grade biodiesel by the transesterification of jatropha oil at room temperature over a coconut husk derived catalyst under mild reaction conditions without the use of any cosolvent is reported here. Catalyst is prepared by means of controlled heating of coconut husk, without any chemical treatment. The main active component over the catalyst was found to be potassium. When the reaction temperature was increased to 45°C, the catalyst showed excellent performance on the transesterification of Jatropha oil in a range of methanol/oil molar ratios. The important speciality for the present catalytic systems is the comparatively low reaction temperature requirement for effective reaction. For the optimization of different reaction variables including molar ratio of the reactants, reaction time, the catalyst calcination temperatures and the catalyst/oil weight percentage, a series of transesterification reactions were conducted and the results obtained are presented here. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, experiments were conducted to examine the effect of using a mixture of diesel and n-pentanol, which is one of the second-generation biofuels with comparable properties to diesel fuel, as fuel on the combustion, performance, and gaseous and particulate emissions of a naturally-aspirated, four-cylinder, direct-injection diesel engine. Three n-pentanol fractions in the fuel mixture were selected: 10, 20 and 30% by volume. Results show that, the addition of n-pentanol leads to longer ignition delay and increases the peak heat release rate in the premixed combustion phase. The brake specific fuel consumption increases with increase of n-pentanol, while the brake thermal efficiency is not affected. Regarding the gaseous emissions, n-pentanol addition results in the following consequence: (a) HC (hydrocarbon) and CO (carbon monoxide) emissions increase for 30% n-pentanol in the blended fuel at low engine load but decrease at high engine load; (b) a slight increase (maximum 8%) in NOx emissions but noticeable increase in NO2 emissions. Regarding the particulate emissions, n-pentanol is found to be very promising in terms of reducing both the mass concentration and the particulate number concentration simultaneously. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study provides an alternative way to produce biodiesel from low quality feedstock oil. Feedstock oil with high water and free fatty acid contents can be hydrolyzed into fatty acids using conventional methods or subcritical water processes. Fatty acids produced can be reacted with methanol to produce fatty acid methyl esters under conditions developed in this work, which is much milder than the supercritical methanol condition and without the use of catalyst. Using palmitic acid and oleic acid as the model free fatty acid, at 175-205°C, 2.0-2.8MPa and with a fatty acid:methanol:water ratio of 1:2:0.05 (w/w/w), a conversion of 96.5% can be achieved in 3-4h. The method can be applied to feedstock with water content up to 15%. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Marine fish such as mackerel are important for coastal fisheries in Taiwan. Nearly 60,000 tons of mackerel are produced in Suao, I-lan, Taiwan every year. In this study, oil from the discarded parts of mackerel fish contained in wastewater stream were used as the raw material to produce biodiesel through transesterification reaction. The major fuel properties of MB (mackerel biodiesel), including the iodine value, dynamic viscosity, flash point, and heat value, were determined and compared with sunflower seed oil methyl ester (SFM), JCB (Jatropha curcas biodiesel), and premium diesel (D). MB had a higher iodine value, dynamic viscosity, density, and flash point, but a lower heat value, than did D. MB was also used as fuel in a regular diesel engine to verify its emission characteristics. The MB fuel used for exhaust emission test included pure MB (MB100) and a 20% MB blend with premium diesel (MB20). The exhaust emission of MB was also compared with the exhaust emissions of D and JCB. The results showed that MB20 provided a significant reduction in NO, NOx, and SO2 emissions under varied engine loads, and required no engine modification. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Co-hydroprocessing of fossil fractions with lipids is an alternative pathway for integrating biomass in the transportation sector. This work involves the evaluation of two commercial hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysts in terms of their effectiveness and suitability for hydroconversion of heavy atmospheric gas oil (HAGO) and waste cooking oil (WCO) mixtures. As the most common catalysts for conventional gas oil hydroprocessing are CoMo and NiMo over Al2O3, this work focused on comparing a CoMo/Al 2O3 and a NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst with respect to the resulting diesel selectivity and quality. Both catalysts were investigated for three feedstocks including pure HAGO, a low WCO content (10% v/v) HAGO/WCO and a higher WCO content (30% v/v) HAGO/WCO mixture under three different reactor temperatures (330 C, 350 C and 370 C). All the experiments were performed at constant pressure 812 psig, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) 1 h-1 and H2/Oil ratio 505.9 nl/l. The results have shown that the catalyst HDS efficiency depends primarily upon the reaction temperature and HAGO to WCO ratio, but is quite different for both catalyst types. The HDS effectiveness of the NiMo catalyst is not affected by the addition of WCO, even in the lowest temperature (330 C), while the one of the CoMo catalyst is strongly affected by WCO. The presence of WCO in the feedstock was proven favorable for both diesel yield and saturation, for both catalysts, but affected strongly the deactivation rate of the CoMo catalyst. Based on the experimental results obtained via this study, it was evident that NiMo type catalysts are more suitable for co-hydroprocessing of petroleum fractions with lipid containing feedstocks. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel, of which typical material is known as FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester), has some demerits such as high density and low caloric value despite better reduction on emission and lubricity when compared to petro-diesel (petroleum-derived diesel). Iso-HVO (isomerized-hydrotreated biodiesel), on the other hand, has strong competitive advantages that overcome such weak points of conventional biodiesel. The study of engine performance was carried out to compare iso-HVO with BD (Biodiesel). The test samples were prepared 16 kinds of fuels, which are petro-diesel and 2%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50% of BD, HVO, and iso-HVO blended diesel, respectively. The engine performances and emission were tested on engine dynamometer and chassis dynamometer with 1.5 l diesel engine and passenger car, for evaluating maximum power, fuel consumption, and emission, especially PM (Particulate Matter) and NOx. Iso-HVO has much better engine performance than BD and slightly better than HVO, but slightly worse than petro-diesel. On the emission, iso-HVO and HVO blended diesel emit less THC and CO than BD, even though iso-HVO blended diesel emits similar level of NOx and PM to BD blended. All three kinds of 50% blended biofuels showed that the decrease of particle concentrations at all size range than petro-diesel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, production cost of hydrogenation-derived renewable diesel (HDRD) was estimated using canola oil and camelina oil as feedstocks. Process simulation models were built based on experimental data to simulate the conversion of vegetable oil to n-alkanes primarily in the range of C9-C22. These models were used to estimate capital and operating costs to conduct a techno-economic assessment for a range of HDRD plant sizes (15-1161. million. L/year, or 250-20,000. bbl/day) operating in Western Canada. The minimum costs of production for HDRD occurred at a plant optimum size of 812. million. L/year (14,000. bbl/day). These minimum costs were $1.09/L for HDRD from canola oil, $0.85/L for HDRD from camelina oil if camelina meal can be sold, and $1.37/L for HDRD from camelina oil if camelina cannot be sold. The HDRD production cost varies significantly for small production plants but only varies by a few cents per liter for plants in the size range of 290-1161. million. L/year (5000-20,000. bbl/day). Sensitivity analyses conducted indicate that HDRD production cost is not very sensitive to capital and operating costs, but is highly sensitive to feedstock cost, solvent price, and solvent recovery. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The burnt fraction f of Wiebe equation has been shown to be dependent only on the newly defined parameter 'combustion burn factor (Ci)'; and the benefits of expressing heat release rate with respect to Ci have been presented. The errors associated with the determination of apparent heat release rate (Ahrr) and the cumulative heat release (Cum.Hrr) from the measured cylinder pressure data and the assumed specific heat ratio (γ) was determined and compared. The γ affected the calculated Ahrr more than the cylinder pressure. Overestimation of γ resulted in an underestimation of the peak value of the Ahrr and vice versa, this occurred without any shift in the combustion phasing. A new methodology has been proposed to determine the instantaneously and mean value of γ for a given combustion. This new methodology has been applied to determine γ for a wide range of engine operating conditions and for different fuels. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The paper presents a new thermochemical process for the production of isobutanol, which is an excellent biobased gasoline blendstock. The main feedstock for the process is glycerine, obtained as a byproduct in biodiesel production, being used together with methanol. The process was modeled in Aspen Plus. The process design is characterized by a high level of process integration, pinch analysis being used to optimize the process from the start. A techno-economic evaluation of the process, both in a stand-alone plant and in a plant integrated with an existing petro-refinery was conducted, the estimates for the production cost of isobutanol obtained being 892$/m3 for a refinery-integrated case and 1017$/m3 for a stand-alone case. A sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo methodology showed the production cost estimates to be highly robust. Use of isobutanol rather than fossil gasoline was found to result in 53% reduction in GHG emissions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The quality of ignition and combustion of blends of soy biodiesel and marine fuels was evaluated. Faced with the increasing implementation of processes for converting heavier oil fractions, the availability of streams to formulate marine fuels has been reduced. In this context, the use of biodiesel is important to minimize problems caused by the retraction in production of these streams and improve marine fuel quality. Since composition and stability properties are of great importance and influence directly the combustion quality, the composition was determined using the SARA analysis by thin layer chromatography and a flame ionization detector and the mixtures' stability evaluation was made by optical scanning. Using the equipment Fuel Combustion Analyzer, mixtures of marine fuels and soy biodiesel were tested, varying the biodiesel content by volume in the mixture at levels up to 10% v/v. The results show that the addition of biofuel to marine fuels, in the evaluated conditions, does not compromise the combustion quality of the bunker oil and, in some cases, had even increased the estimated cetane number, indicating increased quality of ignition and combustion. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bioethanol is a promising biofuel and has a lot of great prospective and could become an alternative to fossil fuels. Ethanol fermentation using glycerol as carbon source was carried out by local isolate, ethanologenic bacterium Escheric h ia coli SS1 in a close system. Factors affecting bioethanol production from pure glycerol were optimized via response surface methodology (RSM) with central composite design (CCD). Four significant variables were found to influence bioethanol yield; initial pH of fermentation medium, substrate concentration, salt content and organic nitrogen concentration with statistically significant effect (p≤0.05) on bioethanol production. The significant factor was then analyzed using central composite design (CCD). The optimum conditions for bioethanol production were substrate concentration at 34.5g/L, pH 7.61, and organic nitrogen concentration at 6.42g/L in which giving ethanol yield approximately 1.00mol/mol. In addition, batch ethanol fermentation in a 2L bioreactor was performed at the glycerol concentration of 20g/L, 35g/L and 45g/L, respectively. The ethanol yields obtained from all tested glycerol concentrations were approaching theoretical yield when the batch fermentation was performed at optimized conditions. © 2014.

AB  - A significant problem encountered in the gas turbine industry with fuel products is the degradation of fuel and fuel systems by micro-organisms, which are largely bacteria, embedded in biofilms. These micro-organisms cause system fouling and other degradatory effects, extending often to sudden failure of components with cost implications. Current methods of assessment are only postimpact evaluation and do not necessarily quantify the effects of fuel degradation on engine performance and emission. Therefore, effective models that allow predictive condition monitoring are required for engine's fuel system reliability, especially with readily biodegradable biofuels. The aim of this paper is to introduce the concept of biofouling in gas turbines and the development of a biomathematical model with potentials to predict the extent and assess the effects of microbial growth in fuel systems. The tool takes into account mass balance stoichiometry equations of major biological processes in fuel biofouling. Further development, optimization, and integration with existing Cranfield in-house simulation tools will be carried out to assess the overall engine performance and emission characteristics. This new tool is important for engineering design decision, optimization processes, and analysis of microbial fuel degradation in gas turbine fuels and fuel systems. Copyright © 2014 by ASME.

AB  - Although biodiesel is a sustainable and renewable diesel fuel, the current feedstock predominantly from edible oils limits the economic feasibility of biodiesel production and thus the development of a cost-effective non-food feedstock is really essential. In this study, approximately 21.6% of crude grease was extracted from housefly (Musca domestica L.) larvae reared on swine manure, and the extracted grease was evaluated for biodiesel production concerning the variables affecting the yield of acid-catalyzed production of methyl esters and the properties of the housefly larvae-based biodiesel. The optimized process of 8:1 methanol/grease (mol/mol) with 2vol% H2SO4 reacted at 70°C for 2h resulted in a 95.7% conversion rate from free fatty acid (FFA) into methyl esters. A 90.3% conversion rate of triglycerides (crude grease) to its esters was obtained from alkaline trans-esterification using sodium hydroxide as catalyst. The major fatty acid components of this larvae grease were palmitic (29.1%), oleic (23.3%), palmitoletic (17.4%) and linoleic (17.2%). The housefly larvae-based biodiesel has reached the ASTM D6751-10 standard in density (881kg/m3), viscosity (5.64mm2/s), ester content (96.8%), flash point (145°C), and cetane number (52). These findings suggest that the grease derived from swine manure-grown housefly larvae can be a feasible non-food feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biogas is a biofuel which can be used as an energy source for gas-operated vehicles or for electricity and heat production. This paper studies the greenhouse gas emissions from biowaste, waste water treatment plant sludge and agricultural biomass based biogas use as a transportation fuel and compares the transportation use with the electricity and heat production and composting of feedstock. The research is conducted using Life cycle assessment methods and the calculation follow the directive 2009/28/EC, ISO 14040 standard and Greenhouse Gas Protocol. The use of biogas in transportation sector led in all studied cases to reductions of GHG emissions compared to fossil transportation fuels. The GHG reductions varied from 49% to 84%. Biogas production and use in electricity and heat production also led to GHG reductions compared to composting of feedstock but the reductions are not as high as in transportation use in most of cases. In addition if biogas is already used in energy production, it should be considered carefully whether the advantages of directing biogas to transportation purposes are profitable from a GHG emission point of view. However the GHG reductions are heavily depended on local energy systems. This creates challenges for the policy makers and leads to need for system scale comparisons. The wider use of biogas as a transportation fuel has a potential for high GHG emission reductions in the transportation sector. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A simple correlation, which enables prediction of ignition delay of petroleum fuel and biofuel when they are employed in compression ignition engine, is proposed in this study. An equation was developed by including both engine and fuel factors, which enables to use for wider range of fuels in all ranges of stationary and automotive engines. With this equation, ignition delay of any fuel can be determined before it was tested in the engines. Since the equation was developed by including design factors of the engine, the effect of change in the design parameters on the ignition delay of the fuel can be determined. Developed correlation was validated by comparing the calculated values with the experimental values obtained by conducting test with the fuels. It was found that the ignition delay was predicted with less than 5% error at standard injection timing, and at retarded injection timings the percentage error is comparatively higher than that of the standard injection timing.

AB  - In this article, the transesterification of three types of waste cooking oil (WCO) with methanol and ethanol was studied using alkali catalyzed process. The catalyst used in this study was sodium hydroxide. The effects of temperature, catalyst amount, alcohol to oil ratio, and the time of reaction on the yield were studied. The temperature and the catalyst amount were the most important factors affecting the yield of biodiesel. Also the process exhibited some sensitivity to the level of free fatty acids (FFA) in the WCO and to the type of alcohol. The yields of methyl esters varied from 97% with the lowest acidity (0.4% FFA WCO) to 76% with the highest acidity (3.25% FFA WCO). The ethyl esters yields were lower and the difference increased with the level of FFA in the oil, the maximum yield was 95% and 73% with the lowest and the medium acidities respectively and no reaction was registered with the highest one. The chromatographic analysis of the produced biodiesel showed high contents of fatty acid methyl esters varying from 96.5% to 98%. The physical-chemical characteristics of produced biodiesel were studied and compared to the European norm, EN 14214. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biodiesel fuel (BDF) waste contains large amounts of crude glycerol as a by-product, and has a high alkaline pH. With regard to microbial conversion of ethanol from BDF-derived glycerol, bacteria that can produce ethanol at alkaline pH have not been reported to date. Isolation of bacteria that shows maximum productivity under alkaline conditions is essential to effective production of ethanol from BDF-derived glycerol. In this study, we isolated the Klebsiella variicola TB-83 strain, which demonstrated maximum ethanol productivity at alkaline pH. Strain TB-83 showed effective usage of crude glycerol with maximum ethanol production at pH 8.0-9.0, and the culture pH was finally neutralized by formate, a by-product. In addition, the ethanol productivity of strain TB-83 under various culture conditions was investigated. Ethanol production was more efficient with the addition of yeast extract. Strain TB-83 produced 9.8. g/L ethanol (0.86. mol/mol glycerol) from cooking oil-derived BDF waste. Ethanol production from cooking oil-derived BDF waste was higher than that of new frying oil-derived BDF and pure-glycerol. This is the first report to demonstrate that the K. variicola strain TB-83 has the ability to produce ethanol from glycerol at alkaline pH. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cheap fossil oil resources are becoming depleted and crude oil prices are rising. In this context, alternatives to fossil fuel-derived carbon are examined in an effort to improve the security of carbon resources through the development of novel technologies for the production of chemicals, fuels, and materials from renewable feedstocks such as biomass. The general concept unifying the conversion processes for raw biomass is that of the biorefinery, which integrates biofuels with a selection of pivot points towards value-added chemical end products via so-called “platform chemicals”. While the concept of biorefining is not new, now more than ever there is the motivation to investigate its true potential for the production of carbon-based products. A variety of renewable chemicals have been proposed by many research groups,many of thembeing categorized as drop-ins, while others are novel chemicals with the potential to displace petrochemicals across several markets. To be competitive with petrochemicals, carbohydrate-derived products should have advantageous chemical properties that can be profitably exploited, and/or their production should offer cost-effective benefits. The production of drop-ins will likely proceed in short term since the markets are familiar, while the commercial introduction of novel chemicals takes longer and demands more technological and marketing effort. Rather than describing elaborate catalytic routes and giving exhaustive lists of reactions, a large part of this review is devoted to creating a guideline for the selection of the most promising (platform) chemicals derived via chemical-catalytic reaction routes from lignocellulosic biomass. The major rationale behind our recommendations is a maximum conservation of functionality, alongside a high atom economy. Nature provides us with complex molecules like cellulose and hemicellulose, and it should be possible to transform them into chemical products while maintaining aspects of their original structure, rather than taking them completely apart only to put them back together again in a different order, or turning them into metabolites and CO2. Thus, rather than merely pursuing energy content as in the case of biofuels, the chemist sees atom efficiency, functional versatility, and reactivity as the key criteria for the successful valorization of biomass into chemicals. To guide the choice of renewable chemicals and their production, this review adopts the original van Krevelen plots and develops alternative diagrams by introducing a functionality parameter F and a functionality index F:C (rather than O:C). This index is more powerful than the O index to describe the importance of functional groups. Such plots are ideal to assess the effect of several reaction types on the overall functionality in biomass conversion. The atom economy is an additional arbitrator in the evaluation of the reaction types. The assessment is illustrated in detail for the case of carbohydrate resources, and about 25 chemicals, including drop-ins as well as novel chemicals, are selected. Most of these chemicals would be difficult to synthesize from petrochemicals feeds, and this highlights the unique potential of carbohydrates as feedstocks, but, importantly, the products should have a strong applied dimension in existing or rising markets. Ultimately, the production scales of those markets must be harmonized to the biomass availability and its collection and storage logistics. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

AB  - Costs, emissions, and resource availability were modeled for the production of 5 billion gallons yr-1 (5 BGY) of renewable diesel in the United States from Chlorella biomass by hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The HTL model utilized data from a continuous 1-L reactor including catalytic hydrothermal gasification of the aqueous phase, and catalytic hydrotreatment of the HTL oil. A biophysical algae growth model coupled with weather and pond simulations predicted biomass productivity from experimental growth parameters, allowing site-by-site and temporal prediction of biomass production. The 5 BGY scale required geographically and climatically distributed sites. Even though screening down to 5 BGY significantly reduced spatial and temporal variability, site-to-site, season-to-season, and interannual variations in productivity affected economic and environmental performance. Performance metrics based on annual average or peak productivity were inadequate; temporally and spatially explicit computations allowed more rigorous analysis of these dynamic systems. For example, 3-season operation with a winter shutdown was favored to avoid high greenhouse gas emissions, but economic performance was harmed by underutilized equipment during slow-growth periods. Thus, analysis of algal biofuel pathways must combine spatiotemporal resource assessment, economic analysis, and environmental analysis integrated over many sites when assessing national scale performance. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Considering the vast number of scientific reports on various potential uses of fungi, there was an attempt to select the best lipid producer of some fungi at optimized conditions (Aspergillus versicolor, Rhizopus oryzae, Rhizopus arrhizus, Tramates versicolor). The aim was to offer new fields of use to the industries already culturing and using such materials. Aspergillus versicolor mycelia were found to be accumulating the highest amount of lipids. Experiments to improve lipid accumulation and transesterification properties were performed in molasses medium; the first steps were testing the effects of different pH values and different nitrogen sources on lipid accumulation. Various concentrations of KNO3 (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 gL-1) and molasses (6%, 8%, 10%) were tried in order to find the optimum carbon and nitrogen requirements. Maximum lipid content was 22.8% in the samples containing 6% molasses solution and 1.0 gL-1 KNO3 at pH 4 after 10 days of incubation. The highest fatty acid ethyl ester yield of these samples was 77% (5.0 ethanol:oil, 0.4 sulfuric acid:oil at 30°C for 6 hr). Since the crude lipids were rich in C16 and C18 fatty acids, this was considered as suitable feedstock for biodiesel production. Copyright © 2014 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Bio-oil derived by fast pyrolysis of biomass represents a potentially attractive source of hydrocarbon transportation fuels. Raw bio-oil, however, is unsuitable for application as a fuel due primarily to high organic oxygen content, which imparts a number of undesirable properties including high acidity and low stability. These problems can be overcome by catalytic hydrodeoxygenation; however, removing oxygen to very low levels by hydrotreating carries a strong economic penalty. Mild hydrotreating (where moderate levels of deoxygenation take place) coupled with coprocessing in a petroleum refinery represents an alternative to deep hydrotreating which may improve the economics of manufacture of hydrocarbon transportation fuels from biomass. This study reports on the effect of catalyst type on the quality of bio-oil produced via mild hydrotreating in a semibatch reactor at three severities. Sulfided Ni-Mo/Al2O3, Pd/C(activated), Pd/char, Pt/char, and Ru/char were compared. Speciation of oxygen functional groups in distillate and bottom products was carried out, and the form of much of the organic oxygen was determined. These results show that a 55% conversion of the carbon in the biomass pyrolysis oil to a low-oxygen (5%), low-acid, volatile, hydrocarbon-miscible liquid product can be achieved. This was, however, possible only with the NiMo-S catalyst. The precious-metal catalysts while producing oil with acceptable carbon conversion, miscibility, and oxygen content did not convert enough acid to produce oil with acid numbers below 15. Water washing was successfully tested for removing residual acids. The various catalysts have different advantages, and using a different catalyst for the two stages of the process may provide the best process-for example ruthenium for minimizing coke during stabilization and nickel or platinum for deoxygenation. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Bio-oil is chemically and thermally unstable during storage and transportation. For that reason, it is necessary to evaluate the changes in the properties (chemical and physical) of bio-oil during storage to understand its chemical instability, which will further assist researchers in stabilization strategies. This paper describes the evaluation of an accelerated aging process on the physical and chemical properties of bio-oil from fast pyrolysis of ash and birch woods using two different pyrolyzers, a pilot scale (auger) and lab scale (tube furnace), respectively. The produced oils (freshly made) were aged at 80 °C over different periods (1, 3, and 7 days) in sealed nitrogen-purged Nalgene vessels. Fresh oil was analyzed alongside aged oils. Bio-oils were characterized by viscometer, Karl Fischer titration (H2O), pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), photo-microscopy, 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The water content, viscosity, decomposition temperature (TGA) and ash content levels in bio-oil samples all increased as the aging period lengthened. GC/MS analysis showed a major reduction in GC-analyzable components. The mass of residue remaining after pyrolysis-GC/MS increased, and the structures of pyrolysis products of this non-volatile residue along with NMR and FTIR data suggest the following aging processes; some of the reactive compounds undergo polymerization or reaction with other compounds, including olefins, alcohols, and aldehydes. Some possible reaction mechanisms are given. The oils remained as a single phase throughout the initial study period; however, on day 7, a clear phase separation was observed by photo-microscopy. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Duckweed (Lemnaceae) is a family of aquatic plants with potential for use as the next generation of alternative energy feedstocks, yet little related information about producing higher alcohols from duckweed has been published. We investigated the process of producing higher alcohols from duckweed via fermentation. Results showed that these plants have a promising future as the basis for developing biofuels. This could be achieved through fermentation by yeasts, producing not only traditional forms of energy such as ethanol but also higher alcohols with high energy yields through bioconversion by Clostridium acetobutylicum, mutant yeast strains, and bioengineered strains of Escherichia coli. The concentrations of butanol and total solvent produced via fermentation by C. acetobutylicum CICC 8012 were 12.03 and 20.03 g/L using acid hydrolysate of duckweed versus 12.33 and 20.05 g/L using enzymatic hydrolysate. The yields obtained of 24.06 g/L ethanol and 680.36 mg/L of isopentanol from duckweed using acid hydrolysate are 15 times higher than what could be obtained through the fermentation of the mutation of yeast. In addition, we were able to obtain yields of 16.27 mg/L butanol, 24.68 mg/L isopentanol, and 195.85 mg/L pentanol from the acid hydrolysate of duckweed via fermentation by the bioengineered strains of E. coli. Our results illustrated that duckweed represent an ideal fermentation substrate: they require only simple pretreatment, without the need for supplementary nitrogen or strengthening with redox agents. This provides a foundation for further development of industrialized biofuel production using duckweed. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study evaluated the environmental impact of biodiesel and hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel derived from camelina oil in terms of global warming potential, human health, ecosystem quality, and energy resource consumption. The life cycle inventory is based on production activities in the Canadian Prairies and encompasses activities ranging from agricultural production to oil extraction and fuel conversion. The system expansion method is used in this study to avoid allocation and to credit input energy to co-products associated with the products displaced in the market during camelina oil extraction and fuel processing. This is the preferred allocation method for LCA analysis in the context of most renewable and sustainable energy programs. The results show that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 1MJ of camelina derived biodiesel ranged from 7.61 to 24.72g CO2 equivalent and 3.06 to 31.01kgCO2/MJ equivalent for camelina HRJ fuel. Non-renewable energy consumption for camelina biodiesel ranged from 0.40 to 0.67MJ/MJ; HRJ fuel ranged from -0.13 to 0.52MJ/MJ. Camelina oil as a feedstock for fuel production accounted for the highest contribution to overall environmental performance, demonstrating the importance of reducing environmental burdens during the agricultural production process. Attaining higher seed yield would dramatically lower environmental impacts associated with camelina seed, oil, and fuel production. The lower GHG emissions and energy consumption associated with camelina in comparison with other oilseed derived fuel and petroleum fuel make camelina derived fuel from Canadian Prairies environmentally attractive. © 2014.

AB  - Biosludge can be pyrolyzed to produce liquid oil as an alternative fuel. The content of five major elements, 22 trace elements and 16 PAHs was investigated in oven-dried raw material, pyrolysis residues and pyrolysis liquid products. Results indicated 39% carbon, 4.5% hydrogen, 4.2% nitrogen and 1.8% sulfur were in oven dried biosludge. Biosludge pyrolysis, carried out at temperatures from 400 to 800. °C, corresponded to 34-14% weight in pyrolytic residues, 32-50% weight in liquid products and 31-40% weight in the gas phase. The carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen decreased and the sulfur content increased with an increase in the pyrolysis temperature at 400-800. °C. NaP (2 rings) and AcPy (3 rings) were the major PAHs, contributing 86% of PAHs in oven-dried biosludge. After pyrolysis, the PAH content increased with the increase of pyrolysis temperature, which also results in a change in the PAH species profile. In pyrolysis liquid oil, NaP, AcPy, Flu and PA were the major species, and the content of the 16 PAHs ranged from 1.6 to 19. μg/ml at pyrolysis temperatures ranging from 400 to 800. °C. Ca, Mg, Al, Fe and Zn were the dominant trace elements in the raw material and the pyrolysis residues. In addition, low toxic metal (Cd, V, Co, and Pb) content was found in the liquid oil, and its heat value was 7800-9500. kcal/kg, which means it can be considered as an alternative fuel. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This research aims to study the possibility of using jojoba ethyl ester (JEE), and its blends with ethanol in diesel engines. The physical and chemical properties of the jojoba ethyl ester and its blends with ethanol in different ratios (5%, 10%, 15% and 20% ethanol by volume) have been measured. The following properties have been measured for the tested fuels: viscosity, density, low calorific value, flash point, pour point, cetane index, total acid number, total base number, sulfur content, and ash content. The method of preparation of JEE by transesterification process is optimized to find the lowest proportion of ethanol that gives the best properties of ester. It has been shown that using 7% ethanol gives the highest yield of ester, taking into account the cost. Blending more ethanol with JEE resulted in the decrease of density, pour point, and low calorific value. There is a need for future researches to reduce the pour point of (JEE) and its blends with ethanol. JEE and its blends with ethanol is a promising biofuel, which can be used in diesel engines. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Microalgae are a promising platform for producing neutral lipids, to be used in the application for biofuels or commodities in the feed and food industry. A very promising candidate is the oleaginous green microalga Scenedesmus obliquus, because it accumulates up to 45% w/w triacylglycerol (TAG) under nitrogen starvation. Under these conditions, starch is accumulated as well. Starch can amount up to 38% w/w under nitrogen starvation, which is a substantial part of the total carbon captured. When aiming for optimized TAG production, blocking the formation of starch could potentially increase carbon allocation towards TAG. In an attempt to increase TAG content, productivity and yield, starchless mutants of this high potential strain were generated using UV mutagenesis. Previous studies in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have shown that blocking the starch synthesis yields higher TAG contents, although these TAG contents do not surpass those of oleaginous microalgae yet. So far no starchless mutants in oleaginous green microalgae have been isolated that result in higher TAG productivities. Results: Five starchless mutants have been isolated successfully from over 3,500 mutants. The effect of the mutation on biomass and total fatty acid (TFA) and TAG productivity under nitrogen-replete and nitrogen-depleted conditions was studied. All five starchless mutants showed a decreased or completely absent starch content. In parallel, an increased TAG accumulation rate was observed for the starchless mutants and no substantial decrease in biomass productivity was perceived. The most promising mutant showed an increase in TFA productivity of 41% at 4 days after nitrogen depletion, reached a TAG content of 49.4% (% of dry weight) and had no substantial change in biomass productivity compared to the wild type. Conclusions: The improved S. obliquus TAG production strains are the first starchless mutants in an oleaginous green microalga that show enhanced TAG content under photoautotrophic conditions. These results can pave the way towards a more feasible microalgae-driven TAG production platform. © 2014 de Jaeger et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.) is a potential feedstock for biofuel production because Jatropha oil is highly suitable for the production of the biodiesel and bio-jet fuels. However, Jatropha exhibits low seed yield as a result of unreliable and poor flowering. FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) -like genes are important flowering regulators in higher plants. To date, the flowering genes in Jatropha have not yet been identified or characterized.Results: To better understand the genetic control of flowering in Jatropha, an FT homolog was isolated from Jatropha and designated as JcFT. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic relationship of JcFT revealed a high sequence similarity with the FT genes of Litchi chinensis, Populus nigra and other perennial plants. JcFT was expressed in all tissues of adult plants except young leaves, with the highest expression level in female flowers. Overexpression of JcFT in Arabidopsis and Jatropha using the constitutive promoter cauliflower mosaic virus 35S or the phloem-specific promoter Arabidopsis SUCROSE TRANSPORTER 2 promoter resulted in an extremely early flowering phenotype. Furthermore, several flowering genes downstream of JcFT were up-regulated in the JcFT-overexpression transgenic plant lines.Conclusions: JcFT may encode a florigen that acts as a key regulator in flowering pathway. This study is the first to functionally characterize a flowering gene, namely, JcFT, in the biofuel plant Jatropha. © 2014 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Transesterification of oil to biodiesel was carried out using alkaline catalysis supported by sepiolite - a naturally-porous hydrated magnesium silicate with the highest surface area among all clay minerals. The catalyst particles, prepared by loading 10-50wt.% of K2CO3 into sepiolite, followed by calcination at 773K, were found to be very active in the catalysis of the transesterification reaction of canola oil with methanol. The purities of the biodiesel products were assessed via ATR-FTIR and 1H NMR and found to readily surpass the 96.5% purity requirement of the European EN standard 14103. The biodiesel yield was characterized as a function of the transesterification reaction time, the methanol to oil molar ratio, reaction temperature and catalyst concentration. Methyl ester yields of around 98.5±0.6% could be obtained using sepiolite supports loaded with 40 and 50wt.% K2CO3. The testing of the recovered K2CO3(50%)/sepiolite catalyst particles for their reusability and stability indicated that the initial catalytic activity of the catalyst could be maintained for at least five reaction cycles. This unusual maintenance of the activity of sepiolite supported catalysts is possibly associated with the minimization of the leaching of K2O, occurring as a result of the special structure of sepiolite, that is unlike any other clay. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Report herein is an integrated catalytic process for conversion and upgrading of biomass feedstocks into 5,5′-dihydroxymethyl furoin (DHMF), through self-coupling of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) via organocatalysis, and subsequently into n-C12H26 alkane fuel via metal-acid tandem catalysis. The first step of the process involves semicontinuous organocatalytic conversion of biomass (fructose, in particular) to the high-purity HMF. N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are found to catalyze glucose-to-fructose isomerization, and the relatively inexpensive thiazolium chloride [TM]Cl, a Vitamin B1 analog, catalyzes fructose dehydration to HMF of good purity (&gt;99% by HPLC), achieving a constant HMF yield of 72% over 10 semicontinuous extraction batch runs. Crystallization of the crude HMF from toluene yields the spectroscopically and analytically pure HMF as needle crystals. The second step of the process is the NHC-catalyzed coupling of C 6 HMF produced by the semicontinuous process to C12 DHMF; the most effective organic NHC catalyst produces DHMF in 93% or 91% isolated yield with an NHC loading of 0.70 mol % or 0.10 mol % at 60°C for 3 h under solvent-free conditions. The third step of the process converts C12 DHMF to linear alkanes via hydrodeoxygenation. With a bifunctional catalyst system consisting of Pd/C + acetic acid + La(OTf)3 at 250°C and 300 psi H2 for 16 h, DHMF has been transformed to liquid hydrocarbon fuel (78% alkanes), with a 64% selectivity to n-C12H26 and an overall C/H/O % ratio of 84/11/5.0. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The catalytic etherification of glycerol has been systematically studied in batch process by using n-butanol to produce oxygenated additives for biodiesel fuels over various solid-acid catalysts, such as H-beta zeolite, ZSM-5, K10, etc. The present work includes a detailed study of the optimization of the etherification process parameters, such as catalyst loading (7-20 wt % of glycerol), molar ratio of glycerol/n-butanol (1:6 to 1:15), speed of agitation (100-400rpm), reaction temperature (413-453K), and reaction time (0.5-4 h) in view of maximizing the glycerol conversion and selectivity towards mono-butyl-glycerol ether (ME). The catalyst reusability was studied using the optimized process parameters. Amongst the studied catalysts, the H-beta zeolite was found to be the most promising for the etherification of glycerol with glycerol conversion of 55% and a 98% selectivity towards ME formation. The H-beta zeolite was found to be an active and stable catalyst for up to 4cycles. The use of n-butanol as alkylating agent is presented for first time, to the authors knowledge. The reaction was performed at milder operating conditions (0.5 MPa) than previously reported (2 MPa). A kinetic model was developed for the etherification reaction and the data obtained at optimized process parameters was used to calculate the kinetic parameters. The reaction rate constants at different reaction temperatures, activation energies, and pre-exponential factors were obtained for the etherification reaction with an accuracy of R2&gt;0.989. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Fat trap grease is a cheap source for biodiesel production, but until now its transformation into biofuel is not well studied. The effects of the use of biodiesel from degraded raw material on combustion in engines are not discussed by researchers. In this paper, engine tests were performed on biodiesel produced from AFR (animal fat residues) collected from fat traps. This fuel presents differences in chemical composition and on physical properties as compared to standard biodiesel produced from vegetable oils. Tests were performed on a single cylinder, air cooled, direct injection diesel engine at 1500rpm, performance and pollutant emissions were measured and the combustion parameters were analyzed. The use of AFRBD in the engine resulted in similar performance with slight brake thermal efficiency decrease at low loads and a slight increase at high loads. A decrease of 9% of power output at 1500rpm was also detected. As per pollutant emissions, a drastic reduction of unburned hydrocarbons between 32% and 45% was obtained with AFRBD (animal fat residue biodiesel). Particulate matter emissions were also reduced at low and medium load ranges, but no differences were detected at high loads. Nitric oxides emissions were also measured and slight increase was detected at low loads and a slight reduction was noticed at full engine load. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microbial lipids have the potential to substantially reduce the use of liquid fossil fuels, though one obstacle is the energy costs associated with the extraction and subsequent conversion into a biofuel. Here we report a one-step method to produce FAME (fatty acid methyl esters) from Rhodotorula glutinis by combining lipid extraction in a microwave reactor with acid-catalysed transesterification. The microwave did not alter the FAME profile and over 99% of the lipid was esterified when using 25 wt% H2SO4 over 20min at 120°C. On using higher loadings of catalyst, similar yields were achieved over 30s. Equivalent amounts of FAME were recovered in 30s using this method as with a 4h Soxhlet extraction, run with the same solvent system. When water was present at less than a 1:1 ratio with methanol, the main product was FAME, above this the major products were FFA (free fatty acids). Under the best conditions, the energy required for the microwave was less than 20% of the energy content of the biodiesel produced. Increasing the temperature did not change the EROI (energy return on investment) substantially; however, longer reaction times used an equivalent amount of energy to the total energy content of the biodiesel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The adequacy of Stribeck curves for the characterization of the lubricity of biodiesels, B20 blends and diesel fuel is demonstrated. Ball-on-disk tests in the speed range 2-1570mm/s were performed to obtain the Stribeck plots and the results are compared to those from the conventional HFRR (high frequency reciprocating rig) ball-on-disk method (ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) D6079). Contrarily to the HFRR method, in the Stribeck tests very clear ball wear marks are seen without significant wear of the flat counterbody. These characteristics provide more confidence in the lubricity assessment of fuels. Moreover, in the Stribeck method higher lubricity at 60°C is revealed for all biodiesels and the respective blends, related to the formation of protective oxide tribolayers. When evaluated by the HFRR test method, such temperature effect on the lubricity performance is not identified. From the point of view of the energy loss of the system, or friction response, lubricity is also better depicted by the Stribeck test method. The friction coefficient plots reveal that the major difference among the fuels occurs in the low velocity range, or in the start-stop stage of moving components, where the poorest lubricity is attained with the neat diesel fuel and the best lubricity with the animal fat biodiesel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Rubber seed oil, derived from the seeds of the rubber tree - Hevea brasiliensis, has been shown as a viable option for biodiesel production. However, few studies have investigated the factors influencing rubber seed yield. This study evaluates rubber seed yield through in situ counting of rubber seeds from the dominant rubber tree clones (RRIM600# and GT1#) in Xishuangbanna, China. Comparisons of seed yield across tree age classes and along an elevation gradient were carried out. The rubber seed yield survey was then used as a predictor for potential rubber seed oil production, both locally and regionally, and calculates the potential biodiesel production from the rubber seed oil. The results indicate that rubber seed yield is directly linked with tree age and size, and that elevation does not affect rubber seed yield within this region. Seed yield varied greatly (3-fold) between the two cultivars studied. Furthermore, it was calculated that there is a potential production of 1.94 Mt of rubber seed oil and 1.80 Mt of biodiesel from this oil, within SE Asia (Southeast Asia). © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Biodiesel is a recognized replacement for diesel fuel in compressed ignition engines due to its significant environmental benefits. The purpose of this study is to investigate the engine performance and emissions produced from Jatropha curcas, Ceiba pentandra and Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel in compressed ignition engine. The biodiesel production process and properties are discussed and a comparison of the three biodiesels as well as diesel fuel is undertaken. After that, engine performance and emissions testing was conducted using biodiesel blends 10%, 20%, 30% and 50% in a diesel engine at full throttle load. The engine performance shows that those biodiesel blends are suitable for use in diesel engines. A 10% biodiesel blend shows the best engine performance in terms of engine torque, engine power, fuel consumption and brake thermal efficiency among the all blending ratios for the three biodiesel blends. Biodiesel blends have also shown a significant reduction in CO2, CO and smoke opacity with a slight increase in NOx emissions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The test fuels included a conventional diesel fuel and four different fuel blends of coconut biodiesel (B10, B20, B30 and B50). The results showed that biodiesel blended fuels have significant influences on the BSFC (brake specific fuel consumption) and BSEC (brake specific energy consumption) at all engine loads. In general, the use of coconut biodiesel blends resulted in a reduction of BSCO (brake specific carbon monoxide) and smoke emissions regardless of the load conditions. A large reduction of 52.4% in smoke opacity was found at engine load of 0.86MPa engine load with B50. For combustion characteristics, a slightly shorter ignition delay and longer combustion duration were found with the use of biodiesel blends under all loading operations. It was found that generally the biodiesel blends produced lower peak heat release rate than baseline diesel. The vibration results showed that the largest reduction of 13.7% in RMS (root mean square) of acceleration was obtained with B50 at engine load of 0.86MPa with respect to the baseline diesel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper reviews catalytic the hydrotreatment upgrading technology of biomass-derived oil. It provides an overview of the reaction mechanism and the condition of the operation, then summarizes the process of bio-oil hydrogenation at home and abroad. Detailed comparison of various technological processes such as multi-stage hydrogenation, hydrogenation-esterification, in-situ hydrogenation, etc. are made. Multi-stage hydrogenation, which separates the hydroprocessing into two stages (mild hydrotreating and deep hydrotreating), can improve the selectivity of products, moreover avoiding an economic penalty by using less hydrogen. Hydrogenation-esterification combines hydrogenation and esterfication to establish a new upgrading method. Through the method, unstable compounds of biomass-derived oil can be converted more effectively. In-situ hydrogenation, which leads to reducing the cost and enhancing the safety, uses other reagents as resources of hydrogen, simultaneously generating hydrogen and hydrotreating in one reaction system to replace transporting hydrogen from outside. The reasonable optimization of the process routes benefits improving product quality. Research in this area is expected to become a main research direction for bio-oil hydrotreatment. Experimental data were collected about various model compounds including cresol, phenol, guaiacol, acetone, aldehyde, etc. and bio-oil from the literature in the field of this study. Also, a test is reviewed about a range of catalysts including the conventional and novel types of supported noble metal and transition metal catalytic materials and their performance in bio-oil hydroprocessing. Conventional catalysts, such as NiMo and CoMo, have economic advantages; the reaction using noble metal catalysts have better reactivity; amorphous catalysts have both advantages of these two types of catalysts, but amorphous catalysts have terrible thermal stability, and can only be used below 473 K; then, zeolite catalysts and mesoporous catalysts exhibit magnificent effects on reducing oxygen content and moisture content in bio-oil, but still can't avoid coking in the reaction. Unfortunately, researchers have not found any catalyst's hydrothermal stability good enough to improve the effect of reaction continuously (more than seven days), Deactivation and coking of catalysts are still main problems. Obviously, further study is required to prepare these catalysts which have better durability. Finally, this article gives information about the problems which researchers may meet, including equipment plugging, catalyst deactivation, and high operation costs etc., and predicts that the future research directions of this technology is to optimize the hydrogenation process, and to develop new types of composite catalysts which exhibit excellent activity at low temperature and anti-coking performance. The technology development is still on the way but can play a significant role in supplying increasingly expensive petroleum.

AB  - Accurate compositional analysis in biofuel feedstocks is imperative; the yields of individual components can define the economics of an entire process. In the nascent industry of algal biofuels and bioproducts, analytical methods that have been deemed acceptable for decades are suddenly critical for commercialization. We tackled the question of how the strain and biochemical makeup of algal cells affect chemical measurements. We selected a set of six procedures (two each for lipids, protein, and carbohydrates): three rapid fingerprinting methods and three advanced chromatography-based methods. All methods were used to measure the composition of 100 samples from three strains: Scenedesmus sp., Chlorella sp., and Nannochloropsis sp. The data presented point not only to species-specific discrepancies but also to cell biochemistry-related discrepancies. There are cases where two respective methods agree but the differences are often significant with over- or underestimation of up to 90%, likely due to chemical interferences with the rapid spectrophotometric measurements. We provide background on the chemistry of interfering reactions for the fingerprinting methods and conclude that for accurate compositional analysis of algae and process and mass balance closure, emphasis should be placed on unambiguous characterization using methods where individual components are measured independently. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The need for new value-added applications for ethanol coproducts grows as the U.S. ethanol industry continues to expand. Distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), corn gluten meal (CGM), and corn gluten feed (CGF) are the primary coproducts of ethanol manufacturing and are mainly utilized as animal feed. This study examined the use of pyrolysis to extract value from these grains. Characterization of the resulting bio-oil and bio-char included mass density, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, apparent viscosity, kinematic viscosity, and energy content. The bio-oils produced from these ethanol coproducts require some changes to be used commercially. The tar present in the crude bio-oils caused them to have densities greater than one, and caused the oil viscosity to be shear thinning. The pH of these bio-oils is less acidic and thus more favorable than other bio-oils which could be due to the differences in the feedstock composition. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biomass is an important renewable energy source that holds large potential as feedstock for the production of different energy carriers in a context of sustainable development, peak oil and climate change. In developing countries, biomass already supplies the bulk of energy services and future use is expected to increase with more efficient applications, such as the production of biogas and liquid biofuels for cooking, transportation and the generation of power. The aim of this study is to establish the amount of Ghana's energy demand that can be satisfied by using the country's crop residues, animal manure, logging residues and municipal waste. The study finds that the technical potential of bioenergy from these sources is 96 PJ in 2700 Mm3 of biogas or 52 PJ in 2300 ML of cellulosic ethanol. The biogas potential is sufficient to replace more than a quarter of Ghana's present woodfuel use. If instead converted to cellulosic ethanol, the estimated potential is seven times the estimated 336 ML of biofuels needed to achieve the projected 10% biofuels blends at the national level in 2020. Utilizing the calculated potentials involves a large challenge in terms of infrastructure requirements, quantified to hundreds of thousands of small-scale plants. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Using energy data over the period 1981-2011 we find that US biofuels subsidies and production have provided a perverse incentive for US fossil fuel producers to increase their rate of extraction that has generated a weak green paradox. Further, in the short-run if the reduction in the CO2 emissions from a one-to-one substitution between biofuels and fossil fuels is less than 26 percent, or less than 57 percent if long run effect is taken into account, then US biofuels production is likely to have resulted in a strong green paradox. These results indicate that subsidies for first generation biofuels, which yield a low level of per unit CO2 emission reduction compared to fossil fuels, might have contributed to additional net CO2 emissions over the study period. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nepal is heavily dependent on the traditional energy sources and imported fossil fuel, which has an adverse impact on the environment and economy. Renewable energy technologies promoted in the country are regarded as a means of satisfying rural energy needs of the country for operating different rural end-uses. In this context, this article is prepared to investigate energy alternatives to pump drinking water in one of the remote rural village of Nepal, which has no means of running water source. Analyses in this article are based on the formulation of three technical scenarios of water pumping using petro-diesel, jatropha-based biodiesel and solar photovoltaic pumps. The technical system design consists of system sizing of prime mover (engine, solar panel and pumps) and estimation of reservoir capacity, which are based on the annual aggregate water demand modelling. With these investigations, detailed financial modelling is carried out in a spreadsheet to compare the alternatives on the basis of the economic parameters; net present value, equivalent annualised cost and levelised cost of water pumping. Analysis is carried out considering different influential parameters; water head, discharge, incentives on the investments, which have effects on the cost of pumped water. Likewise, in case of biodiesel-based system, different yield rate of jatropha plants is also considered in estimating the cost of producing biodiesel. It is found that for operating a biodiesel-based pumping system for the study area, the levelised cost of pumping 1 L of water is higher than that of a solar pump and even higher when compared with diesel, if the seed yield per plant is less than 2 kg and without subsidy on the investment cost of cultivation and processing. With the productivity of 2.5 kg/plant, a biodiesel-based system is more attractive than that of the diesel-based pump, but still remains more expensive than that of solar pump. From the technical perspective (reliability and easiness in operation) and economic evaluation of the technical alternatives, solar pumping system is found to be the most viable solution to pump drinking water in the project area. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Biodiesel is a diesel replacement and renewable fuel that is manufactured from vegetable oils, animal fats or waste cooking oils. The production of biodiesel from edible oil is currently much more expensive than hydrocarbon-based fuel, due to the relatively high cost of edible oils. The cost of biodiesel can be reduced by using non-edible oils instead of edible oils. The purpose of the present study was to develop a method of esterification of non-edible oil like rubber seed oil (Hevea brasiliensis). The high free fatty acid content oil reacts quickly with alkaline catalysts to form soap, which prevents the separation of biodiesel and glycerol. A two-step process was used instead of the simple alkaline catalysed transesterification process. It consisted of an acid catalysed pre-processing followed by the usual alkaline catalysed process. The physical and chemical properties of biodiesel were analysed. The quantification of methyl esters were done by high-performance liquid chromatography. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - In the last few years, there has been a significant increase in finding alternative energy sources to fossil fuel. Bio-diesel derived from vegetable oils has been shown to be a potential alternative. Presently, most of the available bio-diesel is made from edible oils, but it is believed that with a large-scale production of bio-diesel these stocks may cause an imbalance to the food supply. Algae and aquatic bio-mass have the potential to provide a new range of third generation bio-fuels. Recently, there has been substantial increase in attention to the possibility of using aquatic bio-mass. The aim of this study was to evaluate the macro-algae oil yield and lipid composition in order to produce bio-diesel from waste bio-mass. The algal bio-mass comes from the Orbetello lagoon (Southern Tuscany, Italy), where macro-algae grow naturally due to eutrophication and are harvested and stored in a landfill as a special waste product. Lipid extraction was carried out according to the Bligh and Dyer method and also by using a Dionex ASE200 (accelerated solvent extractor). The total lipid content was determined by micro-gravimetry and the fatty acids (FAs) by GC-FID and GC-MS after acid transesterification. Chaetomorpha linum was the most abundant species and had the highest lipid content. Lipid concentrations and profiles of the Orbetello lagoon's macro-algae were comparable with those reported in the literature for the same species or genus. Algal FAs corresponded to those that normally constitute bio-diesel. Thus, the results indicate that bio-diesel could be produced from the harvested algal bio-mass. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - HZSM-5 with high surface area of 625m2/g was successfully synthesized by hydrothermal method at 160°C for 72h. The metal promoted on HZSM-5 catalyst was prepared by liquid ion exchange method. From XRD results, the addition of metals such as Co and Ni did not change the HZSM-5 structure. The metal/HZSM-5 showed lower crystallinity and surface area than the parent HZSM-5 because of the metal dispersion on the HZSM-5 surface. The metal contents of Co/HZSM-5 and Ni/HZSM-5 detected by EDX were less than 1wt%. Catalytic fast pyrolysis of Jatropha waste using HZSM-5 and metals/HZSM-5 was investigated in terms of biomass to catalyst ratios (1:0, 1:1, 1:5 and 1:10) and types of metals (Co and Ni). From the results, it can be concluded that both biomass to catalyst ratios and the presence of metals had an effect on the increase in aromatic hydrocarbons yields as well as the decrease in the oxygenated and N-containing compounds. Both Co/HZSM-5 and Ni/HZSM-5 promoted the production of aliphatic compounds. Additionally, the PAHs compounds such as napthalenes and indenes, which caused the formation of coke, could be inhibited by metal/HZSM-5, particularly, Ni/HZSM-5. Among catalysts, Ni/HZSM-5 showed the highest hydrocarbon yield of 97.55% with N-containing compounds remained only 1.78%. The formation of hydrocarbon compounds increased the heating values of bio-oils while the elimination of the undesirable oxygenated compounds such as acids and ketones could alleviate problem regarding acidity and instability in bio oils. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the present work, an attempt was made to reduce NOx and PM using partially premixed charge compression ignition (PPCCI) combustion of diesel fuel with external mixture formation technique and fish oil methyl ester (FOME) blend in the main injection. Not much work has been done related to the usage of bio-diesel (Methyl esters of edible, non-edible oils, and animal fats) in the PPCCI combustion mode. Diesel fuel was injected into the intake manifold to form homogeneous pre-mixture beforehand and the pre-mixture is burnt in the cylinder with the balance quantity of fuel directly injected into the cylinder by a conventional injection system. To obtain homogeneous mixture, diesel fuel was injected in the intake manifold using a solenoid-operated injector controlled by Electronic Control Unit (ECU). Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) technique was adopted to control the start of combustion (SOC). Experiments were conducted with 10%, 20%, and 30% EGR for premixed ratio (Rp) 25% and results are compared with conventional diesel fuel operation. It is observed that diesel manifold injection and FOME blend in main injection results in better mixture preparation and lower emissions. Due to homogenous lean operation, significant reduction in NOx and PM are achieved with the PPCCI combustion mode at Rp 25% and EGR 20% in the FOME-Diesel mode of operation.

AB  - A total of nine oilseeds with more than 15 wt% oil have been investigated for evaluating them as feedstock for biodiesel industries. Fatty acid profiles of all the nine oil samples have been determined by GC-MS analysis. The saponification numbers, gross heats of combustion of the oils and those of corresponding fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) as well as cetane indices of the FAMEs have been calculated empirically. Iodine values have been determined experimentally. These values have been used for predicting the quality of the corresponding biodiesels. If prepared from these oils, biodiesels are likely to meet the major specification of biodiesel standards of the USA, Germany and European Standard Organisation. Seed oil from Cucumis sativus is found rich in linoleic acid which is considered an essential fatty acid of biological significance. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - A reliable method with ensured traceability of the measurement results for free and bound glycerol (as monoacylglycerides, diacylglycerides and triacylglyerides) in biodiesel was developed, giving results beyond the state of the art of the current standard methodologies. The proposed method is based on an on-line hydrogenation using gas chromatography coupled to flame ionization detection and hydrogen as carrier gas. After sample introduction the hydrogenation takes place on a fused silica pre-column coated with a palladium catalyst. This approach allows an immediate and reliable hydrogenation of vegetable oils and biodiesels from different feedstocks. All glycerides are converted into their saturated analogues, resulting in simplified chromatograms with structurally clearly defined analytes, and increased sensitivity for trace amounts of compounds. The method has been successfully in-house validated and combined uncertainty values have been assigned to the final results, which were less than 8% for free glycerol, the sum of monoacylglycerides, the sum of diacylglycerides and the sum of triacylglycerides. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cell disruption is essential for lipid collection from cultivated microalgae. This study examines the performance of ultrasonication (US), conventional bubbling ozonation (CBO), and pressure-assisted ozonation (PAO) as a cell rupturing technique to obtain algal lipid from a freshwater unicellular microalgae Chlorella vulgaris, which was grown in BG11 medium at a temperature of 25°C and illuminated by artificial lighting with light/dark cycle of 12 h/12 h. Changes in total organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorous, and chlorophyll contents in the algae suspension after ozonation and US treatments were measured to evaluate the effectiveness of cell rupture by these techniques. Lipid yields of 21 and 27 g/100 g biomass were obtained using US and PAO, respectively. Lipid yields of about 5 g/100 g biomass were obtained using CBO. In all rupturing treatments, C16 and C18 compounds were found to be predominant accounting for 90% of the fatty acids. Using US for rupturing, fatty acids of C16:0, C18:1, and C18:2 were predominant, accounting for 76±4.2% of all the fatty acids. Using CBO and PAO involving ozone, fatty acids of C16:0 and C18:0 were predominant, accounting for 63-94% of the products. The results suggest that saturated fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) products are predominant with oxidative ozonation rupturing while unsaturated FAME products of lower-melting points predominant with physical ultrasonic rupturing means. PAO was an effective cell rupture method for biodiesel production with high lipid yield and more saturated hydrocarbon products. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Ni-Based catalysts using mixed oxides of Al2O 3-SiO2, Al2O3-TiO2, TiO2-SiO2, and TiO2-ZrO2 as supports were evaluated for hydrotreatments using guaiacol as the model compound and characterized by N2 physical adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD), and temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen (H2-TPR) techniques. The influence of the support, solvent, reaction temperature, and pressure on guaiacol conversion and product distributions were determined. Guaiacol conversion of 100% with cyclohexane selectivity of 86.4% was obtained over the Ni/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst at the conditions of 300 °C, 4.0 MPa H2 pressure, and decalin solvent. Furthermore, this system is also efficient for real bio-oil, where nearly 19.3% of the upgraded bio-oil yield was achieved under the optimal conditions determined for guaiacol. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis showed that the principal components were phenolic compounds, while the content of acids and aldehydes was negligible. The pH of bio-oil increased from 2.38 to 4.21, and the high heating value drastically increased from 13.1 to 25.8 MJ/kg. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study focused on devising a method for accurately analyzing the reaction products derived from the upgrading of fats and oils to hydrocarbons. A single method capable of identifying and quantifying all the major constituents commonly found in samples of interest was developed, including the triglycerides and fatty acids constituting the feed, the alkanes resulting from the deoxygenation of the feed, and other intermediates and byproducts, such as alkenes, alcohols, aldehydes, and esters. A standard GC-FID-based method for the analysis of hydrocarbon mixtures (ASTM D 2887) was used as a starting point, and through a number of modifications to both hardware and programming, a method capable of affording a single chromatogram in which all the aforementioned components are fully eluted and well-resolved was developed. In addition to its reliability and its versatility, this approach is relatively fast, straightforward, and inexpensive, as no sample derivatization prior to analysis is required. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Supercritical reactive extraction for Jatropha curcas L. seed was demonstrated to be a viable process for biodiesel production process with high yield and the elimination of separate extraction step. However, because the solid seeds were reacted directly and susceptible to impurities contamination such as water and free fatty acid (FFA), it was important to determine their effects to the extraction efficiency and FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) yield in supercritical reactive extraction. In this study, varying amounts of water (0-40wt.%) and FFA (0-30wt.%) were added to the supercritical reactive extraction process performed at 300°C, 30min effective reaction time, 10MPa and 5.0ml/g methanol to solid ratio. It was found that the supercritical reactive extraction process had a higher tolerance limit for impurities than the non-supercritical acid-catalyzed in situ transesterification process. The former was able to withstand up to 30wt.% of water or FFA without significantly affecting the extraction efficiency and FAME content. A time variation study on the water content showed that the forward hydrolysis of triglyceride molecules to FFA led to a higher reaction rate. Furthermore, the re-hydrolysis reaction of methyl esters to FFA would also occur under a high concentration of methyl esters and water content. A thermal stability study demonstrated that there was no obvious ester decomposition for the process at or below 300°C for a reaction time not exceeding 30min. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, it is aimed to investigate the effects of parameters of transesterification on the cold flow properties of corn oil based biodiesel such as cloud point, pour point and cold filter plugging point. Reaction parameters examined were the transesterification temperature (in the range of 20-60°C), reaction time (10-60min), alcohol-to-oil ratio (3.15:1-12.85:1 in moles), amount of catalyst (0.25-2gcatalyst/100mL corn oil) and stirring speed (300-800rpm). As a result, it has been observed that when the transesterification reaction period is kept longer than 10min, there were no changes in cold flow properties of the biodiesel obtained. In addition, better cold flow properties were monitored when alcohol-to-oil ratio was kept between 3.15:1 and 4.15:1. While no effect of reaction temperature on cold flow properties was observed above 20°C, amount of basic catalyst used in the experiments gave the lowest cold flow properties at the percent of 0.75. Stirring speed has been ineffective in terms of cold flow properties in the transesterification process. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nowadays biodiesel is becoming an increasingly important and popular fuel, obtained from renewable sources, and contributes to pollutant emissions reduction and decreasing fossil fuels dependence. However, its easier oxidation and faster degradation in comparison to diesel led to compatibility problems between biodiesel and various metallic and polymeric materials contacted. Therefore, the objective of this work is to investigate the effect of different mixtures diesel-biodiesel (fuel type B5, B10, B20) used in Baja California, Mexico on the resistance of nitrile rubber fuel hoses at temperatures of 25°C and 70°C applying gravimetric tests, tensile strength measurements and scanning electron microscopy analysis. The factors affecting the material mass change were identified using an experimental design analysis. It was found that the fuel temperature did not conduct to significant mass loss of nitrile rubber fuel hose, while biodiesel concentration affected the properties of the elastomer, causing the phenomenon of swelling. The exposure of hoses to fuel with increasing concentrations of biodiesel led to tensile strength decrease. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Exergy analysis of any thermodynamic system can take care of the limitations of energy analysis such as irreversible losses, their magnitude and the source of thermodynamic inefficiencies apart from energy losses. In the present study, both the analyses along with heat release analysis are conducted on a natural aspirated diesel engine fuelled separately with palm biodiesel (PB), karanja biodiesel (KB), and petrodiesel (PD) using the experimental data. Since the engine performs best at about 85% loading condition, the energetic and exergetic performance parameters of the engine are evaluated at 85% loading condition for each type of fuel. The aim of the study is to determine the effect of fuel oxygen on energy and exergy efficiencies of a CI (compression ignition) engine. Various exergy losses, exergy destruction and their ratios associated with the heat transfer through cooling water, radiation, exhaust gas, friction, and some uncounted exergy destruction are investigated. Apart from exergy loss due to heat transfer; the uncounted exergy destruction (due to combustion) also plays a major role in the system inefficiency. Based on the comparative assessment of the obtained results, it is concluded that a better combustion with less irreversibility is possible with the increase in O2 content in the fuel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel production through polygeneration with heat as one of the by-products implies a possibility for cooperation between transport and district heating sectors by introducing large-scale biofuel production into district heating systems. The cooperation may have effects on both the biofuel production costs and the district heating production costs. This paper is the second part of the study that investigates those effects. The biofuel production costs evaluation, considering heat and electricity as by-products, was performed in the first part of the study. In this second part of the study, an evaluation of how such cooperation would influence the district heating production costs using Stockholm's district heating system as a case study was performed. The plants introduced in the district heating system were chosen depending on the future development of the transport sector. In order to perform sensitivity analyses of different energy market conditions, two energy market scenarios were applied. Despite the higher revenues from the sale of by-products, due to the capital intense investments required, the introduction of large-scale biofuel production into the district heating system does not guarantee economic benefits. Profitability is highly dependent on the types of biofuel production plants and energy market scenarios. The results show that large-scale biogas and ethanol production may lead to a significant reduction in the district heating production costs in both energy market scenarios, especially if support for transportation fuel produced from renewable energy sources is included. If the total biomass capacity of the biofuel production plants introduced into the district heating system is 900 MW, the district heating production costs would be negative and the whole public transport sector and more than 50% of the private cars in the region could be run on the ethanol and biogas produced. The profitability is shown to be lower if the raw biogas that is by-produced in the biofuel production plants is used for combined and power production instead of being sold as transportation fuel; however, this strategy may still result in profitability if the support for transportation fuel produced from renewable energy sources is included. Investments in Fischer-Tropsch diesel and dimethyl ether production are competitive to the investments in combined and power production only if high support for transportation fuel produced from renewable energy sources is included. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper evaluates the effects on profitability of biofuel production if biofuel producers would sell the waste heat from the production to a local district heating system. All analyses have been performed considering four different technology cases for biofuel production. Two technology cases include ethanol production which is followed by by-production of raw biogas. This biogas can be upgraded and sold as biofuel (the first technology case) or directly used for combined heat and power production (the second technology case). The third and the fourth technology cases are Fischer-Tropsch diesel and dimethyl ether production plants based on biomass gasification. Two different district heating price levels and two different future energy market scenarios were considered. The sensitivity analyses of the discount rate were performed as well. In the case of energy market conditions, the profitability depends above all on the price ratio between biomass (used as the feedstock for biofuel production) and crude oil (used as the feedstock for fossil diesel and gasoline production). The reason for this is that the gate biofuel prices (the prices on which the biofuel would be sold) were calculated assuming that the final prices at the filling stations are the same as the prices of the replaced fossil fuel. The price ratios between biomass and district heating, and between biomass and electricity, also have an influence on the profitability, since higher district heating and electricity prices lead to higher revenues from the heat/electricity by-produced. Due to high biofuel (ethanol + biogas) efficiency, the ethanol production plant which produces upgraded biogas has the lowest biofuel production costs. Those costs would be lower than the biofuel gate prices even if the support for transportation fuel produced from renewable energy sources were not included. If the raw biogas that is by-produced would instead be used directly for combined heat and power production, the revenues from the electricity and heat would increase, but at the same time the biofuel efficiency would be lower, which would lead to higher production costs. On the other hand, due to the fact that it has the highest heat efficiency compared to the other technologies, the ethanol production in this plant shows a high sensitivity to the district heating price level, and the economic benefit from introducing such a plant into a district heating system is most obvious. Assuming a low discount rate (6%), the introduction of such a plant into a district heating system would lead to between 28% and 52% (depending on the district heating price level and energy market scenario) lower biofuel production costs. Due to the lower revenues from the heat and electricity co-produced, and higher capital investments compared to the ethanol production plants, Fischer-Tropsch diesel and dimethyl ether productions are shown to be profitable only if high support for transportation fuel produced from renewable energy sources is included. The results also show that an increase of the discount rate from 6% to 10% does not have a significant influence on the biofuel production costs. Depending on the biofuel production plant, and on the energy market and district heating conditions, when the discount rate increases from 6% to 10%, the biofuel production costs increase within a range from 2.2% to 6.8%. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Gasification is a promising pathway for the conversion of biomass into energy products. In particular, the syngas generated through biomass gasification is of great interest for hydrogen production. Based on an overview of technological options, a base-case system for hydrogen production via biomass gasification is defined, and its environmental and thermodynamic performance is evaluated through a life cycle assessment and an exergetic analysis. The case study involves poplar gasification in a low-pressure char indirect gasifier, catalytic tar destruction, cold wet gas cleaning, syngas conversion and hydrogen purification. The calculated exergetic efficiency of the plant is 48%, a value comparable to that of conventional coal gasification technologies for hydrogen production. The total exergy loss of the plant (mainly associated with the flue gas streams) is found to be 4.6% of the fuel exergy provided to the overall plant, while 47% of the overall fuel exergy vanishes as exergy destruction within the individual components of the plant. The life cycle assessment of the system covers from poplar cultivation to hydrogen purification. Seven impact potentials are considered: cumulative energy demand, global warming, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, land competition, acidification and eutrophication. The life-cycle energy balance of the system suggests a relatively promising energy performance. Poplar cultivation and harvesting, biomass pre-treatment and syngas cleaning are identified as the subsystems with the largest contributions to the environmental impacts. Measures to enhance the environmental and energy performance of the system should focus on minimizing the poplar feedstock demand, improving the logistical planning for biomass supply, reducing the natural gas demand of the steam reforming subsystem, and optimizing the electricity demand of the gas cleaning subsystem. Lower consumption levels of fertilizers and diesel for poplar cultivation and harvesting should also be achieved. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is a lack of detailed investigations on the effects of butanol addition to diesel/biodiesel blends on particulate emissions. This study represents the first attempt of its kind to fully evaluate the potential impact of diesel-biodiesel-butanol blends on engine performance, physical, chemical and toxicological properties of the particulates emitted by a single cylinder direct injection compression ignition engine with the engine working at a constant engine speed and at three engine loads. Ultralow sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel blended with 20% palm oil methyl ester (PME) by volume was prepared (denoted as B20), and then blended with 5%, 10% and 15% of butanol by volume. The results indicated a marginal change in the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) up to 10% butanol addition, and an improvement in the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) at medium and high engine loads. Compared to B20, the particulate mass and element carbon (EC) concentrations, and the total number of particles were reduced significantly, whereas the proportion of organic carbon (OC) in the particles increased with an increase in butanol in the ternary fuel. Moreover, the geometric mean diameter (GMD) of the particles shifted towards smaller size. Butanol addition also showed a lower total particle-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emission, lower carcinogenic potential and also lower cytotoxicity of particle extracts, compared to those of B20. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cryptococcus curvatus is a highly promising oleaginous yeast strain that can accumulate intracellular lipids when grown on renewable carbon sources. In order to convert yeast lipids to biodiesel in a simple but cost-effective way, we aim to react whole yeast cells with methanol to produce biodiesel eliminating the step of drying and lipid extraction while adopting microwave energy for heating and disrupting cell walls. Through use of a screening test followed by response surface methodology, optimal parameters leading to the highest yield of crude biodiesel and FAMEs were identified. Under optimal conditions of reaction time (2. min), methanol/biomass ratio (50/1, v/m), stirring speed (966. rpm), KOH concentration (5%), and water content (80%), the yield of crude biodiesel (% of total lipids) was 56.1% after the first round reaction. A second round reaction using the residual yeast cells increased the total yield to 92%. Among the crude biodiesel, 63.88% was FAMEs as revealed by GC analysis. Results from this study indicated that it is feasible to produce biodiesel from wet microbial biomass directly without the steps of drying and lipid extraction. With the assistance of microwave, this process can be accomplished in minutes with good process efficiency. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Dual fuel configurations in compression ignition engines are considered as a promising solution to rely on alternative fuels that allows to respect at the same time the strict regulations on pollutants emissions. Looking at ethanol as one of the future transport biofuels, the authors investigate on the use of ethanol as the premixed fraction in a dual fuel engine. The activity is specifically focused on a light duty engine, since the dual fuel concept application, already implemented in heavy duty vehicles, was recently taken into account for smaller engines in automotive applications too.In the present paper the results of two research activities are reported and compared: tests on an optical single cylinder research engine and numerical simulations, so achieving a combined approach to the study of dual-fuel configuration.Optical diagnostics has been applied in a transparent direct injection diesel engine equipped with the head of an Euro5 commercial engine and the latest generation common rail injection system. Pure ethanol is injected in the intake manifold, while n-heptane is directly injected in the cylinder. UV digital imaging is applied to the optical engine allowing to detect crucial chemical intermediates, like OH, HCO, and CO, in terms of their spatial distribution and temporal evolution. This analysis allows to identify in-cylinder zones with high reactivity of mixed fuels and to investigate the effect of the presence of ethanol on the burning dynamics of the directly injected fuel.Numerical simulations are carried out by means of the OpenFOAM® library, that represents the closed valve phase of the engine cycle. Thanks to the adoption of detailed reaction kinetics, the predicted spatial distributions of the selected reaction intermediates are compared with the images provided by optical diagnostics. Moreover, the integrated emission intensity from the chosen chemical species is compared to the corresponding total concentration calculated histories, in order to verify the coherence of the numerical results also in terms of temporal evolution. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this research have been achieved the optimized experimental conditions to obtain the partial transesterification of sunflower oil with methanol, using CaO as an alkaline heterogeneous catalyst, to produce one mole of monoglicride (MG) and two moles of fatty acids methyl esters (FAME). This blend constitutes a new type of biofuel (Ecodiesel), applicable to diesel engines, which integrates the glycerine as monoglyceride (MG). Thus, similar results to those previously described by enzymatic partial alcoholysis of triglycerides are obtained through the kinetic control of the chemical reaction, so that the same type of biodiesel is obtained by using CaO, instead of the more expensive lipases. In order to obtain an improvement in conversion and kinematic viscosity, the influence on catalytic performance of several kinetic parameters was separately evaluated. It was obtained that a 6:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil, 7 wt% CaO catalyst, 65 C reaction temperature, 60 min time reaction and 0.3% water content respect to oil, gave the best results. Besides, CaO catalyst maintained sustained activity after being repeatedly used for 20 cycles. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents the development of a computer-aided decision support tool for identifying optimal biorefinery concepts for production of biofuels at an early design stage. To this end, a framework that uses a superstructure-based process synthesis approach integrated with uncertainty analysis is used. We demonstrate the application of the tool for generating optimal biorefinery concepts for a lignocellulosic biorefinery. In particular, we highlight the management of various sources of data, the superstructure (integrated thermochemical and biochemical conversion routes) needed to represent the design space, generic but simple models describing the processing tasks, and the formulation and solution of an MINLP problem under deterministic and stochastic conditions to identify the optimal processing route for multiple raw materials and products. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of market price uncertainties on the optimal solutions and calculate the associated risk to enable informed and risk-aware decisions. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Algae are an appealing source for bioenergy due to their high yields relative to terrestrial energy crops. The high cost of production, however, has prohibited commercialization. Hydrothermal liquefaction is a technology that converts more of the algae into oil than alternative technologies, thereby reducing the amount of expensive pond infrastructure and energy required for cultivation. We incorporate recent experimental results into an analysis that models the economic and life cycle performance of an algal biorefinery across a range of reaction conditions. Two strategies are explored: one pathway with gasification of the aqueous waste products for onsite energy recovery and another pathway featuring cultivation of Escherichia coli on the aqueous products and recycling of the biomass back through the reactor for boosted oil yields. We found that the maximum net energy ratio of 1.9 and minimum global warming potential of 1.0 kg CO2e L-oil-1 occurred with gasification, along with the minimum reaction temperature explored, 250 °C, and reaction times close to 1 h. The optimal economic and occupied land results occurred at a maximum temperature of 400 °C and with the shortest reaction time explored of 5 min. The cost of algal oil at these conditions was 1.64 L-oil-1 (or 263 bbl-1). For the regrowth pathway, the land footprint could be further reduced by 10%, and the optimal cost could be reduced to 1.59 L-oil-1. Forgoing gasification had a significantly detrimental effect on the other two metrics. Given the importance of economics to an algal biorefinery's operations, this could be a viable option. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - While photosynthetic microalgae, such as Chlorella, serve as feedstocks for nutritional oils and biofuels, heterotrophic cultivation can augment growth rates, support high cell densities, and increase triacylglycerol (TAG) lipid content. However, these species differ significantly in their photoautotrophic and heterotrophic characteristics. In this study, the phylogeny of thirty Chlorella strains was determined in order to inform bioprospecting efforts and detailed physiological assessment of three species. The growth kinetics and lipid biochemistry of C. protothecoides UTEX 411, C. vulgaris UTEX 265, and C. sorokiniana UTEX 1230 were quantified during photoautotrophy in Bold's basal medium (BBM) and heterotrophy in BBM supplemented with glucose (10 g L -1). Heterotrophic growth rates of UTEX 411, 265, and 1230 were found to be 1.5-, 3.7-, and 5-fold higher than their respective autotrophic rates. With a rapid nine-hour heterotrophic doubling time, Chlorella sorokiniana UTEX 1230 maximally accumulated 39% total lipids by dry weight during heterotrophy compared to 18% autotrophically. Furthermore, the discrete fatty acid composition of each strain was examined in order to elucidate lipid accumulation patterns under the two trophic conditions. In both modes of growth, UTEX 411 and 265 produced 18:1 as the principal fatty acid while UTEX 1230 exhibited a 2.5-fold enrichment in 18:2 relative to 18:1. Although the total lipid content was highest in UTEX 411 during heterotrophy, UTEX 1230 demonstrated a two-fold increase in its heterotrophic TAG fraction at a rate of 28.9 mg L-1 d-1 to reach 22% of the biomass, corresponding to as much as 90% of its total lipids. Interestingly, UTEX 1230 growth was restricted during mixotrophy and its TAG production rate was suppressed to 18.2 mg L-1 d-1. This constraint on carbon flow raises intriguing questions about the impact of sugar and light on the metabolic regulation of microalgal lipid biosynthesis. © 2014 Rosenberg et al.

AB  - In this work, a mixture of chloroform and methanol (1:1, v/v) was applied to oil extraction from Chlorella sp. at 30, 40, 50 and 60°C for 150 min extraction times. Kinetic studies revealed that the values of n and the rate constants were found to depend strongly on temperature. The activation energy was Ea=38.893 kJ/mol, and the activation thermodynamic parameters at 60°C were Δ S≠=-180.190 J/mol K, Δ H≠=36.124 kJ/mol and Δ G≠=96.128 kJ/mol. Both Δ H and Δ S yielded positive values, whereas Δ G was negative at 60°C, indicating that this process is endothermic, irreversible and spontaneous. The acidic transesterification process was also investigated by gas chromatographic analysis of the microalgae fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel) at different temperatures and reaction times. The fatty acid profile indicated that the main components were palmitic, linoleic and linolenic acids. The concentration of linolenic acid increased and oleic acid decreased as the temperature increased. Two-hour transesterification is the best reaction time for biodiesel production because it produces the highest percentage of unsaturated fatty acids (74%). These results indicate the potential of Chlorella sp. to produce biodiesel of good quality. © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis.

AB  - This article evaluates pathways to cost-effective production of biofuels at a commercial scale. A thermodynamic cultivation model was simulated using Aspen Plus V7.3.1 and used to predict the area required for algae growth. This model was combined with the most promising commercial-scale methods to harvest algae and extract the oil. Conversion experiments were conducted using oil extracted from Nannochloropsis salina algae, which was grown in salt water by Solix Biofuels. Glycerolysis was performed to reduce the free fatty-acid content of the oils. Transesterification was then carried out using a solid catalyst. Rate constants were regressed to adapt kinetic models to the rate data, which allowed the glycerolysis/transesterification process to be simulated using Aspen Plus V7.3.1. Cost estimates from the Aspen Process Economic Analyzer (APEA) were combined with industrial quotes and literature data. A cash flow analysis was performed for the entire carbon sequestration-to-biodiesel production train, yielding a biodiesel selling price of $4.34/gal. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the impact of various costing parameters on the viability of the process. These analyses show that the current bottlenecks for the large-scale production of biodiesel are cultivation techniques and extraction operations. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study presented life cycle water footprints (WFs) of biofuels from biomass in China based on the resource distribution, climate conditions, soil conditions and crop growing characteristics. Life cycle WFs including blue, green and gray water were evaluated for the selected fuel pathways. Geographical differences of water requirements were revealed to be different by locations the results indicated that water irrigation requirements were significantly different from crop to crop, ranging from 2-293, 78-137, and 17-621 m 3/ha, for sweet sorghum, cassava, and Jatropha curcas L., respectively. Four biofuel pathways were selected on this basis to analyze the life cycle WF: cassava based bioethanol in Guangxi, sweet sorghum based bioethanol in Northeast China, Jatropha curcal L. based biodiesel in Yunnan and microalgae based biodiesel in Hainan the life cycle WFs of bioethanol from cassava and sweet sorghum were 3708, and 17 156 m3 per ton of bioethanol, respectively, whereas for biodiesel produced from Jatropha curcas L. and microalgae, they were 5787, and 31 361 m3 per ton of biodiesel, respectively the crop growing stage was the main contributor to the whole life cycle of each pathway. Compared to blue and green water, gray water was significant due to the use of fertilizer during the growing of biomass. From the perspective of the WF, cassava based bioethanol in Guangxi and Jatropha based biodiesel in Yunnan were suitable for promotion, whereas the promotion for microalage based biodiesel in Hainan required improvement on technology. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - An experiment to establish the best reaction conditions for the transesterification of soybean oil is described. We conducted the ethylic and methylic routes using two different protocols, and evaluated how the variables time, stirring, alcohol/oil molar ratio, catalyst (%), catalyst type, and temperature affected the process. The highest yield of biodiesel was obtained using the following conditions: ethylic route - t=60min, stirring: 100rpm, ethanol/oil molar ratio=12:1, catalyst relative to oil (%)=0.2%, catalyst=potassium ethoxide, temperature=35°C; methylic route - t=30min, stirring: 100rpm, methanol/oil molar ratio=6:1, catalyst (%)=0.2%, catalyst=KOH, temperature=55°C. We analyzed the acidity, moisture content, density at 20°C, kinematic viscosity at 40°C, oxidative stability, and carbon residue at the biodiesels obtained under optimal conditions. The results were consistent with the values allowed by the Brazilian ANP (Resolution 07/2008). We also conducted the physicochemical analysis of the soybean oil used as feedstock to produce biodiesel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bio-energy demand is known to be influenced by geographical origin and social equity. This paper aims to highlight the influence of the proximity between biomass production and energy consumption on the demand for alternative bio-fuels. In the context of Burkina Faso, we explore potential demand for Jatropha oil (. Jatropha curcas) as a diesel substitute among engine owners. Survey data are based on a between-groups design: one group of respondents experiencing a local supply chain, while the other a global one. Results show that proximity has a significant effect on potential demand itself and on the formation and strength of beliefs regarding Jatropha oil. In a local supply chain context, the demand is superior and seems to be guided more by a certain economic and technical rationality. Conversely, the prospect of a Jatropha oil produced outside the village restrains demand and this latter is more determined by contextual factors and social interaction. Our analysis confirms that demand does not only depend on technical and economic factors such as price but also on the integration of the biomass production and processing in the socioeconomic life of local rural populations. Understanding demand construction and assessing underlying beliefs are key success factors for bio-energy projects. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuels are alternatives for vehicular transportation that have the promise of reducing imported petroleum, creating regional agricultural and energy sector employment, and decreasing emission of greenhouse gases. This study analyses greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the production and delivery of biofuels using the IH2 process. The IH2 process is a new technology for the conversion of a broad range of biomass types into liquid hydrocarbon transportation fuels spanning the range of gasoline and diesel. A cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) was used to calculate the greenhouse gas emissions associated with producing and using IH2 biofuels from diverse feedstocks. The biomass feedstocks analyzed include algae (microalgae), bagasse from sugar cane (Brazil or southeast US), corn stover from Midwest US locations, and forest feedstocks from northern Wisconsin. Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions savings of 30-96% were calculated for IH2 gasoline and diesel compared to fossil fuels. Different scenarios were investigated to understand the uncertainties in key inputs to the LCA model; in feedstock production, the IH2 biofuel production, and IH2 biofuel transportation. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Environmental concerns and the rising cost of crude oil have incentivized the search for alternative aviation fuels. However, any potential alternatives must be thoroughly characterized and tested. In this investigation nine potential biofuels derived from sustainable sources were tested for their compatibility with Jet A-1 aviation kerosene. The fuels chosen were n-butanol, n-hexanol, butyl levulinate, butyl butyrate, ethyl octanoate, methyl linolenate, farnesene, ethyl cyclohexane and limonene. Viscosities were determined between -30 and 40. °C and were observed to increase with decreasing temperature roughly in accordance with ideal fluid behavior. Cloud point temperatures of all samples were tested and all fuels except n-butanol and methyl linolenate were found to be below the specification maximum. Flash points of all fuels apart from pure and blends of ethyl cyclohexane and n-butanol were found to be greater than 38. °C, the minimum threshold specified in the standard. Of all the samples only the hydrocarbon fuels met the required energy content minimum with energy content decreasing with increasing oxygen content. The effect of each fuel on the range vs. the payload, relative to Jet A-1 was determined using a simplified model in order to ascertain likely impact of adoption upon airline operations. Only limonene fulfilled all the requirements of an alternative aviation fuel, though butyl butyrate and ethyl octanoate were acceptable except for the reduced energy density. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel production from non-edible Calophyllum inophyllum linn oil with high levels of Free Fatty Acid (FFA) (acid value-6.732mg KOH/g of oil) was investigated using whole-cell biocatalysts. Rhizopus oryzae cells immobilized within reticulated polyurethane foams were used as biocatalysts for biodiesel production. The effects of reaction parameters such as methanol-to-oil molar ratio, water content, and temperature for the production of biodiesel through methanolysis in a packed-bed reactor (PBR) were studied. Molar ratio of methanol-to-oil - 12:1, water content - 15%v/v, cell concentration - 20% and temperature 35°C were found to be the optimum. The yield of biodiesel obtained in batch methanolysis from C. inophyllum oil under optimized condition was 92%. Long-term stability of immobilized cells for methanolysis was verified using re-usability studies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In Turkey, more than 90% of passengers and goods are transported by roads. In order to flow this immense traffic nearly 2.7million m3 of gasoline, 11.5million m3 of diesel, and 5.2million m3 of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was consumed in 2011. Starting from 2013, Turkey plans to blend biofuels to gasoline and diesel gradually reaching to 10% (volume) by 2020. Turkey's economy has been growing at unprecedented rates since 2003. As a result, both diesel and LPG consumption reached to record levels. Yet, gasoline demand decreased almost linearly in the same period. Accordingly, forecasting road transportation fuel demand becomes more difficult and yet more important than ever before. Gasoline, diesel, LPG, bioethanol and biodiesel demand has been forecast for the first time in this study using semi-empirical models in the view of Turkey's Vision 2023 goals, Energy Market Regulatory Authority targets, and European Union directives. The models suggested that in 2023, annual gasoline consumption in Turkey could decrease below 2.0 million m3, whereas, diesel and LPG consumption could rise to 16.4 and 8.8 million m3, respectively. Consequently, 0.3 million m3 of bioethanol and 1.4 million m3 biodiesel could be required to fulfil the official targets in 2023. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Locating sites for new algae cultivation facilities is a complex task. The climate must support high growth rates, and cultivation ponds require appropriate land and water resources, as well as transportation and utility infrastructure. We employ our spatiotemporal Biomass Assessment Tool (BAT) to select promising locations based on the open-pond cultivation of Arthrospira sp. and strains of the order Sphaeropleales. A total of 64 000 sites across the southern United States were evaluated. We progressively applied screening criteria and tracked their impact on the number of potential sites, geographic location, and biomass productivity. Both strains demonstrated maximum productivity along the Gulf of Mexico coast, with the highest values on the Florida peninsula. In contrast, sites meeting all selection criteria for Arthrospira were located along the southern coast of Texas and for Sphaeropleales were located in Louisiana and southern Arkansas. Results were driven mainly by the lack of oil pipeline access in Florida and elevated groundwater salinity in southern Texas. The requirement for low-salinity freshwater (&lt;400 mg L-1) constrained Sphaeropleales locations; siting flexibility is greater for salt-tolerant species like Arthrospira. Combined siting factors can result in significant departures from regions of maximum productivity but are within the expected range of site-specific process improvements. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable biofuel produced by transesterification process from vegetable oils or fat. The immiscible nature of the reactants during the transesterification process results in poor mass transfer rate which causes long reaction time and low reaction rate. The transesterification is generally carriedout in a batch reactor which uses conventional electrical heating and mechanical stirring. The conventional method used in the batch reactors need more than one hour of electrical energy for both heating and stirring. Hence, few alternative energy stimulant methods were tried for the production of biodiesel. The biodiesel produced by these methods satisfies the biodiesel standards and characteristics of the biodiesel are similar to the biodiesel produced by the conventional method. This paper discus various energy stimulant methods which offer a fast, easy route to produce biodiesel with advantages of enhancing the reaction rate and improving the separation process as compared to the conventional method. These advanced technologies have the potential to significantly enhance the biodiesel production process with considerable potential in reducing production time and cost.

AB  - The study presents the results of investigations carried out on a four-cylinder, four-stroke, direct injection diesel engine operated with tea seed (Camellia sinensis) oil biodiesel. The oil from tea seeds was extracted from grounded seeds using the Soxhlet extraction apparatus. The biodiesel was produced by transesterification of tea seed oil with methanol in the presence of a catalyst (NaOH). After being blended with regular diesel fuel (D), the fuel properties of tea seed biodiesel (B) was determined according to ASTM and EN standards. The fuel mixtures (biodiesel content at the volumetric ratios of 10%B-90%D (B10), 20%B-80%D (B20), and 100%B (B100)) were tested in a direct injection diesel engine at full load condition. The results indicated a decrease in the observed power output with the increase in biodiesel content in the mixture. Specific fuel consumption (SFC) values were increased depending on the amount of biodiesel in the test fuels. While CO and CO2 emissions were reduced, NOx emissions were increased with increasing biodiesel contents in the mixture. It can be concluded that, tea seed oil, as an agricultural crop, might be a reasonable raw material for the biodiesel production. It was also shown that, up to 20% volumetric content of tea seed biodiesel could be effectively used in fuel mixture serving the purpose of reduction in diesel fuel usage. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this study, biodiesel is prepared from Sinapis alba L. oil commonly known as white mustard through transesterification of the crude oil with methanol in the presence of NaOH as catalyst. Optimum conditions for the reaction were established to achieve maximum biodiesel yield of 92% at 6:1 molar ratio (methanol to oil), by using 0.5 g of NaOH, reaction temperature 65°C, and reaction time 75 minutes. Sinapis alba oil biodiesel (SAOB) was testified by using various fuel properties such as kinematic viscosity at 40°C (5.45 cSt), density at 15°C (0.8721 kg/L), acid number (0.242 mg KOH/gm), flash point (90°C), cloud point (-10°C), pour point (-13°C), and sulfur contents (0.00432%). Based on these findings, it is stated that SAOB can be used as alternative fuel in diesel engines. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The attachment of alkoxy side chains to biodiesel and the associated effects on its cold flow properties are reported. High oleic methyl ester biodiesel was epoxidized using peroxy formic acid and subsequently alkoxylated using nine different alcohols employing BF3-ethereate complex as catalyst. A low molar excess for alcohols was used at moderately low reaction temperatures (40-50°C). A high conversion for attachment of alkoxy group ranging 84%-93% was achieved with excellent selectivity. Cloud points, pour points, and kinematic viscosities were measured to evaluate the cold flow properties of modified biodiesel. The lowest cloud point -11°C and pour point -14°C were obtained with n-decoxy biodiesel. Elevated kinematic viscosities were observed for all alkoxylated products. The lowest kinematic viscosity (6.26 mm2·s-1) was observed for methoxy biodiesel. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), 13C NMR, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) were used for structural elucidation. The reported alkoxylation route has high conversion rate and is convenient to implement. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The tribological response of bio-oil derived from Spirulina algae has been assessed, according to the choice of catalyst during esterification. The bio-oil was upgraded over the selected catalysts of KF/HZSM-5 and KF/Al2O3 with ethanol. Physical and chemical properties were assessed throughout with the crystal structure of the catalysts was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), chemical groups and components of the bio-oil by Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS). Tribological experiments were conducted using a bespoke piston ring-on-cylinder liner tribometer. Worn surfaces were observed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and the elemental contents and valences were tested by X-ray Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). It is shown that choice of catalyst used during the upgrading of the bio-oil has a significant effect on tribological performance. Catalytic esterification improved friction resistance and the anti-wear properties of the bio-oil. KF/Al2O3 was a better catalyst for doing this than KF/HZSM, a result of the ester and organic groups present in the KF/Al2O3 upgraded bio-oil. These groups acted to form a protective tribo-film between surfaces. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effect of addition of bio-fuel blend consisting of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline by volume, E85, on lubricated sliding wear of a eutectic Al-12.6% Si alloy was investigated. The alloy was tested under the loading conditions that promoted ultra-mild wear (UMW), using a mixture composed of equal proportions of E85 fuel and synthetic engine oil, designated as E85/oil (1:1) blend. UMW occurred in three stages when the E85/oil (1:1) blend was used: initially wear was limited to the Si particles that subsequently fractured and/or sunk into the Al matrix; this was followed by a running-in period of higher wear of Al matrix, and then a low steady state wear stage was reached, due to the formation of a protective tribolayer on the sliding surface-called an oil-residue layer (ORL). The ORL was supported by embedded Si particles and a subsurface microstructure consisting of nanocrystalline Al grains that formed as a result of severe local plastic deformation during sliding. The composition of the ORL incorporated nanocrystalline regions of Al, Si, ZnS and ZnO surrounded by amorphous regions consisting of carbon and possibly phosphates. Compared to the ORL formed on samples tested using unmixed engine oil (without E85) the E85/oil (1:1) blend generated higher proportions of Zn, S and P compounds in the ORL. It was proposed that the hydroxyl groups in ethanol molecules facilitated ZDDP degradation, thus leading to an ORL that was richer in anti-wear compounds and consequently lower volumetric wear was observed when the E85/oil (1:1) blend was used. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This report includes assessments of comparative studies on the physical, chemical, and motor properties of diesel fuels containing 30% (vol.) algae oil methyl esters (AME). The properties of this biofuel were compared with the properties of fossil diesel fuel and those of diesel fuel mixtures containing 30% conventional diesel fuel - standardized rapeseed oil methyl esters (RME). Motor studies were performed on a VALMET 320 DMG diesel generator onboard a ship while using fuel blends consisting of 30% AME (B30AME) or RME (B30RME) and 70% fossil diesel fuel. The B30AME's environmental and energy indicators were compared with indicators related to the B30RME and fossil diesel fuel (D). The experiments allowed the researchers to establish that the quality of the algae oil methyl esters and their mixing with the fossil diesel fuel complied with standard requirements. After measuring the emission of hazardous components, it was found that the main improvement to environmental indicators was related to a 10-75% reduction in the smokiness of the exhaust gas and a 5-25% reduction of hydrocarbons (HC) emissions compared to those of D. The smokiness of the exhaust gas when the engine was running at capacities close to the maximum was approximately 10% lower for B30RME compared to B30AME. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Using low-cost feedstocks such as rendered animal fats in biodiesel production willreducebiodieselexpenditures. One of the low-cost feedstocksfor biodiesel production could be the fat extracted from poultry feathers producedin slaughterhouses abundantly. This paper describes a new and environmentally friendly process for developing biodiesel production technology from feather waste produced in poultry industry. In this research the crude oil of poultry feather fat was extracted by soxhlet method using hexane as a solvent. The data resulted from gas chromatography (GC) revealed these percentages for fatty acid compositions: myristic acid (3%), palmitic acid (30%), stearic acid (22%), oleic acid (8.1%), linoleic acid (3%) and arachidonic acid (7%).In this experimental research, the effects of some parameters such as alcohol to oil molar ratio (4:1,6:1, 8:1), catalyst concentration (0.75,1 and 1.25% w/w) and the transesterification reaction time(40,60 and80min) on the percentage offatty acids conversioninto methyl ester(biodiesel) are studied. The results show increasing catalyst concentration up to 1% causes the oil to biodiesel conversion percentage having an upward trend and then adownward trend byincreasing catalyst concentration up to 1.25%. With increasing molar ratio from 4:1 to 6:1 and then 8:1, oil to biodiesel conversion percentage increased16% and2%, respectively. Ultimatelythe optimum point defined by response surface method (RSM) forproducing biodiesel from feather fat is calculated catalyst concentration of 1 wt%, 7.24:1 molar ratio and in 75 minutes resulting in conversion percentage of97.62%.

AB  - As the main driver for bioenergy is to enable society to transform to more sustainable fuel and energy production systems, it is important to safeguard that bioenergy deployment happens within certain sustainability constraints. There is currently a high number of initiatives, including binding regulations and several voluntary sustainability standards for biomass, bioenergy and/or biofuels. Within IEA Bioenergy studies were performed to monitor the actual implementation process of sustainability regulations and certification, evaluate how stakeholders are affected and envisage the anticipated impact on worldwide markets and trade. On the basis of these studies, recommendations were made on how sustainability requirements could actually support further bioenergy deployment. Markets would gain from more harmonization and cross-compliance. A common language is needed as 'sustainability' of biomass involves different policy arenas and legal settings. Policy pathways should be clear and predictable, and future revisions of sustainability requirements should be open and transparent. Sustainability assurance systems (both through binding regulations and voluntary certification) should take into account how markets work, in relation to different biomass applications (avoiding discrimination among end-uses and users). It should also take into account the way investment decisions are taken, administrative requirements for smallholders, and the position of developing countries. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.

AB  - The objective of this study was to test the performance of diesel engine using diesel B3 mixed with crude palm oil in ratios of 95: 5, 90: 10, and 85: 15, respectively, and to compare the results with diesel B3. According to the tests, they showed that the physical properties of the mixed fuel in the ratio of 95: 5 were closest to those of diesel B3. The performance of the diesel engine that used mixed fuels had 5-17% lower torque and power than that of diesel B3. The specific fuel consumption of mixed fuels was 7-33% higher than using diesel B3. The components of gas emissions by using mixed fuel had 1.6-52% fewer amount of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and oxygen (O2) than those of diesel B3. On the other hand, nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions when using mixed fuels were 10-39% higher than diesel B3. By comparing the physical properties, the performance of the engine, and the amount of gas emissions of mixed fuel, we found out that the 95: 5 ratio by volume was a suitable ratio for agricultural diesel engine (low-speed diesel engine). © 2014 Nattapong Namliwan and Tanakorn Wongwuttanasatian.

AB  - Carbon nanotube supported ruthenium catalysts, assembled at the water/oil interfaces, show excellent activity and selectivity for the hydrodeoxygenation of the bio-oil model compound of vanillin under mild conditions (1 MPa, 150 C). Based on a direct fluorescence image, the Ru/CNT catalysts are mainly distributed on the surface of the emulsion droplets, forming a Pickering emulsion. Simultaneous reaction and separation of the products are achieved in the constructed emulsions, which have great potential in the simplifications of the isolation and purification stages for bio-oil refining. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The yeast Metschnikowia pulcherrima, previously utilised as a biological control agent, was evaluated for its potential to produce lipids for biofuel production. Results: Cultivation in low cost non-sterile conditions was achieved by exploiting its ability to grow at low temperature and pH and to produce natural antimicrobial compounds. Although not previously classified as oleaginous, a combination of low temperature and restricted nutrient availability triggered high levels of oil production in M. pulcherrima cultures. This regime was designed to trigger the sporulation process but prevent its completion to allow the accumulation of a subset of a normally transitional, but oil-rich, 'pulcherrima' cell type. This approach resulted in yields of up to 40% lipid, which compares favourably with other oleaginous microbes. We also demonstrate that M. pulcherrima metabolises glycerol and a diverse range of other sugars, suggesting that heterogeneous biomass could provide a suitable carbon source. M. pulcherrima also grows well in a minimal media containing no yeast extract. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of the yeast to produce lipids inexpensively on an industrial scale by culturing the yeast in a 500 L, open air, tank reactor without any significant contamination. Conclusions: The production of antimicrobial compounds coupled to efficient growth at low temperature and pH enables culture of this oleaginous yeast in inexpensive, non-sterile conditions providing a potential route to economic biofuel production. © 2014 Santamauro et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Increasing the use of biofuels influences atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Although widely recognized, uncertainties related to the particular impacts are typically ignored or only partly considered. In this paper, various sources of uncertainty related to the GHG emission savings of biofuels are considered comprehensively and transparently through scenario analysis and stochastic simulation. Technology and feedstock production chain-specific factors, market-mediated factors and climate policy time frame issues are reflected using as a case study Fischer-Tropsch diesel derived from boreal forest biomass in Finland. This case study shows that the GHG emission savings may be positive or negative in many of the cases studied, and are subject to significant uncertainties, which are mainly determined by market-mediated factors related to fossil diesel substitution. Regardless of the considerable uncertainties, some robust conclusions could be drawn; it was likely of achieving some sort of but unlikely of achieving significant savings in the GHG emissions within the 100 year time frame in many cases. Logging residues (branches) performed better than stumps and living stem wood in terms of the GHG emission savings, which could be increased mainly by blocking carbon leakage. Forest carbon stock changes also significantly contributed to the GHG emission savings. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In parallel to the interest in renewable fuels, there has also been increased interest in homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion. HCCI engines are being actively developed because they have the potential to be highly efficient and to produce low emissions. Even though HCCI has been researched extensively, few challenges still exist. These include controlling the combustion at higher loads and the formation of a homogeneous mixture. To obtain better homogeneity, in the present investigation external mixture formation method was adopted, in which the fuel vaporiser was used to achieve excellent HCCI combustion in a single cylinder air-cooled direct injection diesel engine. In continuation of our previous works, in the current study a vaporised jatropha methyl ester (JME) was mixed with air to form a homogeneous mixture and inducted into the cylinder during the intake stroke to analyze the combustion, emission and performance characteristics. To control the early ignition of JME vapor-air mixture, cooled (30 C) Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) technique was adopted. The experimental result shows 81% reduction in NO x and 72% reduction in smoke emission. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel production is undergoing rapid technological reforms in industries and academia. This has become more obvious and relevant since the recent increase in the petroleum prices and the growing awareness relating to the environmental consequences of the fuel overdependency. In this paper, various technological methods to produce biodiesel being used in industries and academia are reviewed. Catalytic transesterification, the most common method in the production of biofuel, is emphasized in the review. The two most common types of catalysts; homogeneous liquids and heterogeneous solids, are discussed at length in the paper. Two types of processes; batch and continuous processes, are also presented. Although batch production of biodiesel is favored over continuous process in many laboratory and larger scale efforts, the latter is expected to gain wider acceptance in the near future, considering its added advantages associated with higher production capacity and lower operating costs to ensure long term supply of biodiesel. © IDOSI Publications, 2014.

AB  - Biomass combustion indoors has been associated with generation of various pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, respirable particles, toluene, benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), among others. In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (as a biomarker exposure to PAHs) levels in children living in three states in Mexico. We evaluated children living in communities that use biomass fuels to cook and to heat homes in the next states: Chiapas, Oaxaca and Quintana Roo. We found similar levels of 1-OHP in urine of children living in the three studied states, with mean levels of 3.5 ± 1.0; 4.5 ± 2.8 and 4.4 ± 2.5 g/L (geometric mean ± standard deviation), respectively for Chiapas, Oaxaca and Quintana Roo. In conclusion, our data indicate high exposure levels to PAHs in children living in the states studied in this work. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Whilst transport biofuels have enjoyed strong political support in Europe for much of the past decade, concerns over their full impacts have an almost equally long history. Since 2008 these concerns have centred most intently upon the land-use change impacts of biofuel production, whereby increased demand for biofuels leads nonagricultural landscapes to be converted-either directly or indirectly-into agricultural ones. Amongst other things, biofuel-driven land-use change might potentially lead to significant emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), losses of biodiversity, reduced ecosystem resilience, degradation of soil and water resources, declines in regional food security, or even land rights infringements through so-called 'land-grabbing'. Political debates surrounding biofuel-driven land-use change in Europe have historically been restricted, however, to considerations of technical modelling work addressing the GHG emissions that might result from this process, thereby ignoring a wide range of alternative issues. Adopting a discursive-institutionalist perspective, this paper scrutinises two interrelated sets of dynamics pertaining to the handling of this political issue in Europe. First, it examines how the specific bureaucratic context of Brussels has itself been constitutive of the discursive practices used by policy makers to establish and retain control of the prevailing political conception of biofuel-driven land-use change. Second, it examines how these practices have inevitably led to what Scott terms a "narrowing of vision" in policy makers' approach to this problem, with concomitant implications for the role occupied by conceptions of 'place' in the policy process. In both instances the argument is made that such interactions exclude critical perspectives on what is at stake in the drive for biofuels from relevant policy-making procedures altogether. In light of these conclusions, I contend that future geographical analyses of environmental policy making writ large should pay greater attention to the interactions of discourse and place, particularly if they are to better understand the precise mechanisms through which political controversy is ultimately managed and settled in modern democratic contexts today.

AB  - The only sustainable environmental friendly source of carbon for liquid fuel production is biomass, which is fixed by plants using atmospheric CO2. However, a major challenge for biomass-based routes is to economically produce the enormous quantities of liquid hydrocarbons needed by the transportation and chemical sector. The fast pyrolysis oil possesses many undesirable properties making it chemically far from a crude oil replacement. In hydropyrolysis process, bio-oil formed is of better quality than that formed under inert atmosphere and has relatively low oxygen content. At present, there are no systematic studies on the hydropyrolysis of biomass, which can give a detailed insight into the mechanistic aspects of the process. In addition to this, only several concepts have been proposed, which can be experimented. This review aims to provide a clear insight of the existing hydropyrolysis concepts and experiments carried out by different groups so far, along with the challenges and opportunities in the area. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Recently, biodiesel has emerged as an alternative fuel for achieving low-temperature combustion (LTC). Several articles in the literature have showed that oxygenated biofuels, including biodiesel, can improve combustion stability under high exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) operation, which is considered to be necessary for the removal of nitric oxides (NOx). The objective of this study was to investigate the performance and emissions of 20% biodiesel blended diesel fuel (B20) at various intake pressures and oxygen concentration levels to characterize the fuel for LTC application. The experimental investigation of B20 was carried out using a single-cylinder engine (SCE) at 1400 rpm and 50% load condition. A set of critical flow orifices with synthetic EGR was employed to simulate various intake pressures and EGR levels. The behavior of the B20 was first characterized under various intake conditions. The results showed that with high oxygen intake, B20 exhibited combustion and emission levels that were very similar to conventional diesel. However, B20 reduced combustion deterioration while exhibiting lower carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions than diesel under low oxygen intake conditions. © 2014 The Korean Society of Automotive Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - A factorial design and response surface approach has been employed to optimize the neutralization, partial reduction, magnetization and carbonization of highly alkaline Red Mud bauxite residues as derived from the Bayer process using highly acidic pyrolysis bio-oil as the limiting reagent. The impact of the factors temperature, reaction time and-most importantly-the minimum bio-oil/Red Mud ratio required was explored. The significant response parameters evaluated were the minimization of the sodium content and the quantity of the aqueous phase, the maximization of the carbon content and magnetization of the solid neutralized Red Mud phase as well as the stabilization of the pH of both phases close to 7. The optimum process parameters determined provide a starting point for a possible scale-up and suggest a potential pathway for the environmental remediation of Red Mud lagoons using a renewable biomass derived resource. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Biochar is a co-product from biomass pyrolysis that can sequester carbon when applied to soils. It may also reduce N2O and CH4 emissions from soils, increase fertilizer efficiency, increase soil organic carbon, and increase crop yields. Treatment of these additional agricultural effects in life cycle analyses (LCAs) of pyrolysis-based liquid fuels could significantly influence LCA results. In this study, we include these effects in analyses of fast and slow pyrolysis. We also consider scenarios in which biochar is combusted to produce electricity. Probability distribution functions are developed for biochar yield and carbon content whereas average, minimum, and maximum values for biochar's stability factor and agricultural effects are developed from a thorough literature review and used in baseline and sensitivity analyses. Overall, life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for pyrolysis-based gasoline are lower when biochar is applied to soil than when it is combusted. Carbon abatement (CA) values of fast and slow pyrolysis fuel production systems are comparable. CA is reduced for an alternative fast pyrolysis system in which the pyrolysis oil is combusted for heat and electricity generation rather than upgraded to a hydrocarbon fuel. In the baseline case with biochar soil application, inclusion of agricultural effects reduces GHG emissions by 2.1 g CO2e/MJ from 16 g CO2e/MJ. Biochar carbon content and yield exert the strongest influence on GHG emissions results. Results are also sensitive to biochar's ability to suppress N2O emissions and increase soil organic carbon, which are subject to high uncertainty. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This study compared the economic and environmental impacts of torrefaction on bioenergy supply chains against conventional pellets for scenarios where biomass is produced in Mozambique, and undergoes pre-processing before shipment to Rotterdam for conversion to power and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) fuels. We also compared the impacts of using different land quality (productive and marginal) for feedstock production, feedstocks (eucalyptus and switchgrass), final conversion technologies (XtY and CXtY) and markets (the Netherlands and Mozambique). At current conditions, the torrefied pellets (TOPs) are delivered in Rotterdam at higher cost (7.3-7.5 $/GJ) than pellets (5.1-5.3 $/GJ). In the long term, TOPs costs could decline (4.7-5.8 $/GJ) and converge with pellets. TOPs supply chains also incur 20% lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than pellets. Due to improved logistics and lower conversion investment, fuel production costs from TOPs are lower (12.8-16.9 $/GJFT) than from pellets (12.9-18.7 $/GJFT). Co-firing scenarios (CXtY) result in lower cost fuel (but a higher environmental penalty) than 100% biomass fired scenarios (XtY). In most cases, switchgrass and the productive region of Nampula provide the lowest fuel production cost compared to eucalyptus and the marginally productive Gaza region. Both FT and ion in Mozambique are more costly than in Rotterdam. For the Netherlands, both FT and power production are competitive against average energy costs in Western Europe. The analysis shows that large-scale bioenergy production can become competitive against fossil fuels. While the benefits of TOPs are apparent in logistics and conversion, the current higher torrefaction costs contribute to higher biofuel costs. Improvements in torrefaction technology can result in significant performance improvements over the future chain. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents an optimal control method of tracking the desired air-to-fuel ratio (AFR) based upon the adaptively estimated biofuel content for internal combustion engines equipped with the lean NOx trap (LNT) aftertreatment system. This biofuel content (or percentage of biofuel) is adaptively estimated based upon the exhaust oxygen AFR sensor signal under both the normal engine operations with lean combustion and the LNT regeneration operations with the closed-loop AFR control. The engine system is approximated by a third-order linear system in this paper. A linear quadratic optimal tracking controller is used to track the desired engine AFR during the LNT regeneration period. The robust stability of the closed-loop tracking control system with the adaptive biofuel content estimation is guaranteed over the entire biofuel range and engine speed between 600 and 5500 rpm by using the robust stability criteria for linear parameter variation systems, where the biofuel gain and engine speed are considered as the variable parameter. Several adaptive control schemes are studied through simulations, and then the selected control strategies are evaluated through dynamometer tests for a lean burn spark ignition engine. The best performance is achieved by the gain-scheduled adaptive scheme. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of woody biomass is a promising process capable of producing renewable transportation fuels to replace gasoline, diesel, and chemicals currently derived from nonrenewable sources. However, biomass pyrolysis is not yet economically viable and requires significant optimization before it can contribute to the existing oil-based transportation system. One method of optimization uses detailed kinetic models for predicting the products of biomass fast pyrolysis, which serve as the basis for the design of pyrolysis reactors capable of producing the highest value products. The goal of this work is to improve upon current pyrolysis models, usually derived from experiments with low heating rates and temperatures, by developing models that account for both transport and pyrolysis decomposition kinetics at high heating rates and high temperatures (>400 °C). A new experimental technique is proposed herein: spatiotemporally resolved diffuse reflectance insitu spectroscopy of particles (STR-DRiSP), which is capable of measuring biomass composition during fast pyrolysis with high spatial (10μm) and temporal (1ms) resolution. Compositional data were compared with a comprehensive 2D single-particle model, which incorporated a multistep, semiglobal reaction mechanism, prescribed particle shrinkage, and thermophysical properties that varied with temperature, composition, and orientation. The STR-DRiSP technique can be used to determine the transport-limited kinetic parameters of biomass decomposition for a wide variety of biomass feedstocks. Resolving differences: A new technique, spatiotemporally resolved diffuse reflectance insitu spectroscopy of particles (STR-DRiSP; see picture), capable of measuring biomass composition during fast pyrolysis with high spatial (10μm) and temporal (1ms) resolution has been developed. This new technique has the potential to revolutionize how pyrolysis is monitored and enhance the ability to understand pyrolysis kinetics. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - In the present study, the thermal decomposition behavior of three common biowastes in Taiwan (cedar sawdust, coffee bean residue, and rice straw) upon fast pyrolysis was studied. Products were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The composition of the resulting bio-oils was also quantified. TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) results indicate that thermal degradation of the biowaste samples occurs through four steps, namely, start of decomposition of extractives (&lt;490K), hemicellulose decomposition (490-650K), cellulose and lignin decomposition (650-780K), and lignin decomposition (&gt;780K). The temperature for thermochemical conversion was 700K. Maximum rates of bio-oil production (51, 48, and 28wt% for cedar sawdust, coffee bean residue, and rice straw, respectively) were observed when the flow rate of carbon dioxide was 30L/min. Char production decreased with increased reaction temperature, and increased with the increase in flow rate of carbon dioxide. Hence, char production was highly correlated with fluidization of the fluid bed. Bio-oil contained two phases, namely, the oily phase from lignin and cellulose, and the aqueous phase from cellulose and hemicellulose. The water content of the oily phase was relatively low and consisted mainly of extractives and low- and high-molecular-weight lignins. Extractives included hexane-soluble compounds consisting mainly of hydrocarbons. The oily phase was composed of hexane-soluble aliphatic, aromatic, and polar fractions. The aqueous phases of bio-oils derived from the three biowaste samples had compositions that were very similar, and most contained significant amount of aromatics and oxygenated compounds such as carboxylic acids, phenols, and ketones. When CO2 was utilized as fluidization gas, the vented gas produced by pyrolysis of the three biowaste samples contained roughly 95.3vol% CO2, and biomass pyrolysis produced around 4.6vol% CO2. The vented gases had compositions that were similar, and consisted mostly of CO2 (nearly 48.2-51.3vol%) and CO (about 44.2vol%). © 2014.

AB  - Coal bio-oil slurries (CBSs) were prepared by blending coal with bio-oil from the fast pyrolysis, and their apparent viscosities were measured by a rotary viscometer. The influences of coal rank, solid concentration, particle size distribution and temperature on the apparent viscosity and rheological properties of slurries were investigated. Additionally, the grey relational analysis was employed to determine the order of importance of factors affecting the apparent viscosity for different rank coals. Results show that, the CBS exhibits non-Newtonian fluid behavior and can be described by Herschel-Bulkley equation. The main factors for different rank coals affecting apparent viscosity of CBS are inherent moisture and carboxyl groups. The maximum solid concentration of CBS can reach 45-47wt. % for Shenmu bituminous coal. Appropriate solid particle size distribution and preparation temperature can provide satisfied slurries with low viscosity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present work explores the possibility of simultaneous reduction of NOx and smoke of a stationary CI (compression ignition) engine fuelled with biodiesel blend. Fuel injection timing is retarded which resulted in lower NOx emission with an increased smoke intensity. NOx emission of the biodiesel at the standard and retarded injection timing was predicted with the help of developed correlations and the same was compared with the NOx emission experimentally determined. It was observed that the predicted NOx emission of biodiesel is comparable with the experimentally determined. Fuel injection pressure was increased at the retarded injection timing and its effect on NOx and smoke emission was investigated. It was observed that the increase in smoke intensity resulting from the retarded injection timing was reduced significantly by increasing the fuel injection pressure. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Synthetic fuels, or synfuels, can be produced from gas, coal and biomass. The conversion of gas and coal is well established but lignocellulosic biomass conversion is slow to develop. This paper addresses the issue of the production cost of second generation biofuels via the thermo-chemical route, biomass to liquids (BtL). Techno-economic studies help identify promising conversion processes, but also introduce a false confidence in the technology that may lead to ill fated decisions. A large number of techno-economic studies have been published since the year 2000 showing a large variability in the results. This paper analyses the published data and presents causes of the observed variability, including a comparison with coal and gas to liquids.Large uncertainties remain however with regard to the precision of the economic predictions. It will be shown that the spread in the economic source data accounts for much of the spread in the predictions. These uncertainties affect both CtL and BtL cost predictions. It will be shown however that the results are relatively coherent and that most of the differences between the costs of synthetic fuels can be traced back to economies of scale considering mature technology. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study the energy and economic flows and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of olive oil production in Iran were investigated in terms of a life cycle assessment with considering four main stages of agricultural olive production, olive transportation, olive oil extraction and its oil transportation to the customer centers. Data was collected from 150 olive growers in Guilan province of Iran. Results revealed that the total energy consumption through the olive oil life cycle was 20344MJha-1 while the mass-based allocation method results indicated that the total energy consumption was 8035MJha-1. The total energy output was estimated as 23568MJha-1. The total GHG emissions was estimated to 1333kgha-1 (CO2eq) while the mass-based allocation method results indicated that the total GHG emissions was 525kgha-1 (CO2eq). The agricultural production stage ranked the first in GHG emissions among the four stages with the share of 93.81% of total GHG emissions. Results of econometric model estimation revealed that the impact of human labor, farmyard manure and electricity on olive oil yield and the impact of electricity and chemical fertilizers on GHG emissions were significantly positive. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study used the fast pyrolysis method to produce bio-oil from coffee bean residue. The oil was mixed with diesel fuel through emulsification to produce emulsified fuel with varying proportions. A single-cylinder diesel engine connected to a 12-kW power generation system was used as the test system to examine the performance indices of a diesel engine under various loads and rotational speeds when using three fuel mixtures with varying proportions of bio-oil (i.e., CPO (coffee bean residue pyrolysis oil) 0 (100% diesel), CPO 5 (5 vol.% bio-oil/95 vol.% diesel), and CPO 10 (10 vol.% bio-oil/90 vol.% diesel)). According to the results, compared to CPO 0, the addition of CPO 5 and CPO 10 increased the fuel consumed for the same power output. Although CPO 5 and CPO 10 had lower heating values that reduced combustion efficiency, the water content and emulsification properties of these fuels enhanced certain aspects of combustion. Increasing the proportion of bio-oil effectively reduced NOx emissions, but in certain situations, denser smoke was produced. The smoke resulted from the added bio-oil, which reduced heating values and combustion efficiency. The emulsification properties of the oil contributed to microexplosion of oil droplets, which enhanced combustion characteristics. © 2013.

AB  - In this paper, emulsion fuels from crude bio-oil and its molecular distillation fractions were prepared by single ultrasonic and ultrasonic-mechanical emulsification. The results showed that the emulsions from crude bio-oil and 0# diesel had the best stability, with a stability time of 31 days. The stability time of the bio-oil middle fraction emulsion was 216min, while that of the bio-oil heavy fraction emulsion was as low as 14min. The particle size distributions of the emulsions were analyzed by a Malvern particle size analyzer. Emulsion fuels made from crude bio-oil and the bio-oil middle fraction had a smaller droplet size of 8-60nm. In contrast, the emulsion fuel from the alcohol-diluted bio-oil heavy fraction had much larger droplet size, reaching up to 6000nm. Compared with single ultrasonic emulsification, ultrasonic-mechanical emulsification had positive effects on increasing the stability time of the crude bio-oil emulsion, but negative effects on the stability time of the bio-oil middle and heavy fraction emulsions. To explain the above differences, spherical shell mechanism models were proposed according to the composition properties of the crude bio-oil and its fractions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The BTL (biomass-to-liquid) process is an attractive process that produces liquid biofuels from biomass. The FT (Fisher-Tropsch) process is used to produce synfuels such as diesel and gasoline from gasified biomass. However, the H2S (hydrogen sulfide), COS (carbonyl sulfide) and CO2 (carbon dioxide) in the syngas that are produced from the biomass gasifiers cause a decrease of the conversion efficiency and deactivates the catalyst that is used in the FT process. To remove the acid gases, a pilot-scale methanol absorption tower producing diesel at a rate of 1BPD (barrel per day) was developed, and the removal characteristics of the acid gases were determined. A total operation time of 500h was achieved after several campaigns. The average syngas flow rate at the inlet of methanol absorption tower ranged from 300 to 800L/min. The methanol absorption tower efficiently removed H2S from 30ppmV to less than 1ppmV and COS from 2ppmV to less than 1ppmV with a removal of CO2 from 20% to 5%. The outlet gas composition adhered to the guidelines for FT reactors. No remaining sulfurous components were found, and the tar component was analyzed in the spent methanol after long-term operations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Several classes of endophytic fungi have been recently identified that convert cellulosic biomass to a range of ketones and other oxygenated molecules, which are potentially viable as biofuels, but whose oxidation chemistry is not yet well understood. In this work, we present a predictive kinetics model describing the pyrolysis and oxidation of diisopropyl ketone (DIPK) that was generated automatically using the Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG) software package. The model predictions are evaluated against three experiments that cover a range of temperatures, pressures, and oxygen concentrations: (1) Synchrotron photoionization mass spectrometry (PIMS) measurements of pyrolysis in the range 800-1340. K at 30. Torr and 760. Torr; (2) Synchrotron PIMS measurements of laser photolytic Cl-initiated oxidation from 550. K to 700. K at 8. Torr; and (3) Rapid-compression machine measurements of ignition delay between 591. K and 720. K near 10. bar. Improvements made to the model parameters, particularly in the areas of hydrogen abstraction from the initial DIPK molecule and low-temperature peroxy chemistry, are discussed. Our ability to automatically generate this model and systematically improve its parameters without fitting to the experimental results demonstrates the usefulness of the predictive chemical kinetics paradigm. © 2013 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - This is Part II of a series of three papers which jointly address the combustion chemistry of furan and its alkylated derivatives 2-methylfuran (MF) and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) under premixed low-pressure flame conditions. Some of them are considered to be promising biofuels. With furan as a common basis studied in Part I of this series, the present paper addresses two laminar premixed low-pressure (20 and 40. mbar) flat argon-diluted (50%) flames of MF which were studied with electron-ionization molecular-beam mass spectrometry (EI-MBMS) and gas chromatography (GC) for equivalence ratios φ= 1.0 and 1.7, identical conditions to those for the previously reported furan flames. Mole fractions of reactants, products as well as stable and reactive intermediates were measured as a function of the distance above the burner. Kinetic modeling was performed using a comprehensive reaction mechanism for all three fuels given in Part I and described in the three parts of this series. A comparison of the experimental results and the simulation shows reasonable agreement, as also seen for the furan flames in Part I before. This set of experiments is thus considered to be a valuable additional basis for the validation of the model. The main reaction pathways of MF consumption have been derived from reaction flow analyses, and differences to furan combustion chemistry under the same conditions are discussed. © 2013 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - Fuels of the furan family, i.e. furan itself, 2-methylfuran (MF), and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) are being proposed as alternatives to hydrocarbon fuels and are potentially accessible from cellulosic biomass. While some experiments and modeling results are becoming available for each of these fuels, a comprehensive experimental and modeling analysis of the three fuels under the same conditions, simulated using the same chemical reaction model, has - to the best of our knowledge - not been attempted before. The present series of three papers, detailing the results obtained in flat flames for each of the three fuels separately, reports experimental data and explores their combustion chemistry using kinetic modeling. The first part of this series focuses on the chemistry of low-pressure furan flames. Two laminar premixed low-pressure (20 and 40. mbar) flat argon-diluted (50%) flames of furan were studied at two equivalence ratios (φ= 1.0 and 1.7) using an analytical combination of high-resolution electron-ionization molecular-beam mass spectrometry (EI-MBMS) in Bielefeld and gas chromatography (GC) in Nancy. The time-of-flight MBMS with its high mass resolution enables the detection of both stable and reactive species, while the gas chromatograph permits the separation of isomers. Mole fractions of reactants, products, and stable and radical intermediates were measured as a function of the distance to the burner. A single kinetic model was used to predict the flame structure of the three fuels: furan (in this paper), 2-methylfuran (in Part II), and 2,5-dimethylfuran (in Part III). A refined sub-mechanism for furan combustion, based on the work of Tian et al. [Combust. Flame 158 (2011) 756-773] was developed which was then compared to the present experimental results. Overall, the agreement is encouraging. The main reaction pathways involved in furan combustion were delineated computing the rates of formation and consumption of all species. It is seen that the predominant furan consumption pathway is initiated by H-addition on the carbon atom neighboring the O-atom with acetylene as one of the dominant products. © 2013 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - This work is the third part of a study focusing on the combustion chemistry and flame structure of furan and selected alkylated derivatives, i.e. furan in Part I, 2-methylfuran (MF) in Part II, and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) in the present work. Two premixed low-pressure (20 and 40. mbar) flat argon-diluted (50%) flames of DMF were studied with electron-ionization molecular-beam mass spectrometry (EI-MBMS) and gas chromatography (GC) under two equivalence ratios (φ= 1.0 and 1.7). Mole fractions of reactants, products, and stable and radical intermediates were measured as a function of the distance to the burner. Kinetic modeling was performed using a reaction mechanism that was further developed in the present series, including Part I and Part II. A reasonable agreement between the present experimental results and the simulation is observed. The main reaction pathways of DMF consumption were derived from a reaction flow analysis. Also, a comparison of the key features for the three flames is presented, as well as a comparison between these flames of furanic compounds and those of other fuels. An a priori surprising ability of DMF to form soot precursors (e.g. 1,3-cyclopentadiene or benzene) compared to less substituted furans and to other fuels has been experimentally observed and is well explained in the model. © 2013 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - The combustion characteristics of promising alternative fuels have been studied extensively in the recent years. Nevertheless, the pyrolysis and oxidation kinetics for many oxygenated fuels are not well characterized compared to those of hydrocarbons. In the present investigation, the first chemical kinetic study of a long-chain linear symmetric ether, di-n-butyl ether (DBE), is presented and a detailed reaction model is developed. DBE has been identified recently as a candidate biofuel produced from lignocellulosic biomass. The model includes both high temperature and low temperature reaction pathways with reaction rates generated using appropriate rate rules. In addition, experimental studies on fundamental combustion characteristics, such as ignition delay times and laminar flame speeds have been performed. A laminar flow reactor was used to determine the ignition delay times of lean and stoichiometric DBE/air mixtures. The laminar flame speeds of DBE/air mixtures were measured in the stagnation flame configuration for a wide rage of equivalence ratios at atmospheric pressure and an unburned reactant temperature of 373. K. All experimental data were modeled using the present kinetic model. The agreement between measured and computed results is satisfactory, and the model was used to elucidate the oxidation pathways of DBE. The dissociation of keto-hydroperoxides, leading to radical chain branching was found to dominate the ignition of DBE in the low temperature regime. The results of the present numerical and experimental study of the oxidation of di-n-butyl ether provide a good basis for further investigation of long chain linear and branched ethers. © 2013 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - Biofuels are the first feasible option for greenhouse gas emission reduction in aviation. This paper uses the lead markets framework to consider potential advantages in process plant required to produce 2nd generation biofuels for aviation. Germany and Brazil both have the potential to develop a lead market. They are active in technology development and have a demand interest through a significant aircraft and airline industry. The USA has also been found to be a country with a very high lead market potential. Since the technology is at a demonstration stage, market information for the assessment of lead market advantages is not available. However, there are a range of indicators of firm activity and market potential that can be combined to make a general assessment. For this case, it is necessary for the lead market framework to be extended to consider international technology networks instead of a national lead market. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article looks at sustainable development and globalization from the perspective of the eco-innovation literature for the case of biofuels in transport. It assesses the potential for newly industrialized countries (NICs) to develop technology and hence export markets in biofuel equipment. An analysis of innovation indicators suggests those countries that have strong capacities in eco-innovation in general. The analysis considers demand and regulatory factors in addition to technological capabilities in biofuels and complementary sectors. A very large global market in biofuels for transport could develop. The case of biofuels in Brazil shows that demand-oriented innovation policy coordinated with supply-oriented research and development policies can be successful in NICs for developing markets in new technologies for sustainability. Brazil, China, Malaysia, Mexico, and South Africa, as well as Indonesia, Thailand, and possibly India, have the favorable combination of high biofuel production potential and the requisite technological capability to develop internationally competitive second-generation biofuel production technologies. © The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa L.) has gained considerable attention in North America as a potential oilseed feedstock for advanced biofuels and bioproducts. Progress has been made towards characterizing camelina's production potential for the western U.S. and Canada. However, little has been done to evaluate its potential for the north central region of the U.S. The objectives of the following study were to evaluate plant stand establishment, growth, and yield of 10 camelina cultivars and target the optimum sowing time for spring seeding in the northern Corn Belt. The study was conducted over three growing seasons between 2008 and 2010 in west central Minnesota, on a Barnes loam soil. Eight cultivars were evaluated in 2008, 10 cultivars in 2009, and four cultivars in 2010. Sowing dates ranged from 16 April to 15 June over the three-year study. Plant population density, time to 50% flowering, seed yield, and oil content were affected by sowing date, tending to decline with delayed sowing. Seed yield was significantly affected by cultivar only in 2009, whereas oil content was consistently affected by cultivar all three years. Across cultivars, seed yields were as high as 2300kgha-1 to as low as 743kgha-1 and were generally greatest for sowings between mid-April to mid-May. Across sowing dates and cultivars, oil content ranged from about 36 to 43% (wtwt-1) and declined with delayed sowing. Generally, seed yield and oil content differences tended to be small between most genotypes in the study. Results indicate that the best time to sow spring camelina in west central Minnesota is from about mid-April to mid-May. Further research is needed to optimize other agricultural inputs for camelina production in the northern Corn Belt. © 2014 .

AB  - Competitive production costs compared to conventional fuels are imperative for biofuels to gain market shares, as current tax advantages for biofuels are only temporary. Comparing production costs of different biofuels with fossil fuels is a challenge due to the complexity of influencing factors. The objective of this research paper is threefold: 1) to project future bio-fuel feedstock prices based on the crude oil price development, the price index for agricultural products, growth in world population, growth in wealth per capita income, and change in energy consumption per capita, 2) to simulate production costs under consideration of likely economies of scale from scaling-up production size and technological learning and 3) to compare different biofuels and fossil fuels by scenario analysis. A calculation model for biofuel production is used to analyse projected production costs for different types of biofuels in Europe for 2015 and 2020. Unlike engineering oriented bottom-up approaches that are often used in other biofuel studies, the macro-economic top-down approach applied in this study enables an economic comparison and discussion of various fuel types based on reference scenarios of crude oil prices of €50, €100, €150 and €200 per barrel. Depending on the specific raw material prices as well as the conversion costs, the analysis delivered a differentiated view on the production costs and thus on the competitiveness of each individual type of fuel. The results show that 2nd generation biofuels are most likely to achieve competitive production costs mid- to long-term when taking into account the effects from technological learning and production scale size as well as crude oil price scenarios between €50 and €200 per barrel for both reference years. In all crude oil price scenarios, bioethanol from lignocellulosic raw materials as well as biodiesel from waste oil are associated with high cost saving potentials which enable them to outperform fossil fuels and 1st generation biofuels. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The 2009 Renewable Energies Directive (RED) has set up ambitious targets concerning biofuel consumption in the European Union by 2020. Nevertheless, budgetary constraints and growing concerns about the environmental integrity of first-generation biofuels have imposed a phasing out of the fiscal instruments to promote them. Focusing on France, this paper combines an exogenous increase in oil prices and tax policies on fossil fuels. The objective is to determine the efficiency of an alternative incentive scheme for biodiesel consumption based on a higher price of the fossil fuel substitute. Policy simulations are implemented through a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model calibrated on 2009 French data. The results show that the 10% biodiesel mandate set by the RED would not be achieved even if the fixed taxes on diesel reach the same level as those on gasoline. Although integrating the rise in oil prices into the fiscal framework improves the biodiesel penetration rate, it remains below the target. Moreover, we find that the effects of biofuel consumption are limited to the biofuel chain sectors. In other agricultural sectors, the substitution effect of biodiesel with diesel is partially offset by the pricing effect induced by higher energy production costs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, an attempt was made to reduce the higher oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission of a crude rice bran oil methyl ester (CRBME) blend through modification of combustion process by retarding fuel injection timing and exhaust gas recirculation at an increased fuel injection pressure. At modified condition, delay period and peak pressure of CRBME blend were lower than those at normal condition. The occurrence of maximum heat release rate retarded with a higher magnitude when compared with normal condition. Experimental results show that as a result of combustion modification, NOx and carbon monoxide emissions were reduced significantly with marginal increase in smoke density. Brake thermal efficiency and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions of the engine were increased significantly as a result of this modification process. This investigation shows that the NOx emission of a biodiesel blend can be reduced with less sacrifice on smoke density and increase in the brake thermal efficiency by modifying the combustion process. © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis.

AB  - The dependency on imported petro-diesel along with the escalating price are adversely affecting the national economy of Nepal. As an alternative fuel, prospects of biodiesel production for partial substitution of petro-diesel are felt necessary to reduce the dependency on fossil fuel. This article outlines the economics of biodiesel production in the country. Three different cases are developed for the economic analysis in the chain of biodiesel production, which are aimed to overview the influences of yield of plant, cost of cultivation, and price of raw oilseeds to the production cost of biodiesel. The study concludes that the biodiesel production is economically viable with a plant yield greater than 2 kg/plant and with the price of oil seeds lower than 0.22 USD/kg, which has a positive return on investment. With the yield lower than 2 kg/plant, the production cost of biodiesel cannot compete with the current price of petro-diesel. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Controversy over EU-wide biofuel policy resonated within the UK, fuelling policy disagreements among UK public authorities. They disagreed over how to protect a space for future second-generation biofuels, which were expected to overcome harm from first-generation biofuels. The UK government defended rising targets for available biofuels as a necessary stimulus for industry to help fulfil the UK's EU obligations and eventually develop second-generation biofuels. By contrast, Parliamentary Select Committees opposed biofuel targets on grounds that these would instead lock-in first-generation biofuels, thus delaying or pre-empting second-generation biofuels. Those disagreements can be explained by different institutional responsibilities and reputational stakes towards 'promise-requirement cycles', whereby techno-optimistic promises generate future requirements for the actors involved. The UK government's stance illustrates a 'policy-promise lock-in', a dilemma whereby promised support is a requirement for credibility towards technology innovators and thus technoscientific development - but may delay the redirection of support from incumbent to preferable emerging technologies. Thus the sociology of expectations - previously applied to technological expectations from technology innovators - can be extended to analyse public authorities. © 2013 .

AB  - The friction and wear behaviors of catalytic methylesterified bio-oils were compared with those of a conventional crude bio-oil using a reciprocating friction-type tribometer. The microstructure of and typical elements in the worn surfaces were also examined. Results showed that the friction coefficient and wear loss of the frictional pairs significantly decreased after lubrication with the esterified bio-oils. This result can be attributed to the esterified bio-oils having more ester components than the crude bio-oil and to the formation of a chemical adsorption layer on the worn surfaces of the frictional pairs. The tribological mechanisms of the crude and esterified bio-oils can be ascribed to corrosive wear and to boundary lubrication, respectively. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study explores optimal operating conditions for power generation from wet ethanol in a HCCI engine using exhaust gas heat recovery. Wet ethanol is a difficult fuel to ignite as it requires high compressed gas temperatures to achieve ignition causing the requirement for substantial intake charge heating. A heat exchanger is retrofitted to a HCCI engine in this study to recover excess heat from the exhaust gases to provide the energy input for intake charge heating. This study builds on prior experimental research by focusing on optimal operating conditions for wet ethanol in HCCI with exhaust gas heat recovery. Operating points include intake pressures of 1.8 and 2.0. bar absolute, equivalence ratios of 0.50 and 0.55, combustion timings from just before TDC to misfire, and fuel mixtures from 70% to 100% ethanol (with water being the balance).The results suggest that the best operating conditions for the HCCI engine and heat exchanger system in terms of high power output, low ringing, and low nitrogen oxide emissions occur with high intake pressures, high equivalence ratios and highly delayed combustion timing. With a 2. bar absolute intake pressure, an equivalence ratio of 0.55, and a combustion timing near 8 CAD ATDC, 70% ethanol produced a power output of nearly 7.25. bar gross IMEP with low ringing and low nitrogen oxide emissions. This operating point was sustained by using heat transfer from hot exhaust gases into the intake charge, and thus no external heat addition was required - a substantial improvement over prior studies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The work is aimed at conversion of non-edible jatropha curcas de-oiled seed cake (the residue left after extraction of oil from the seed) into bio-oil and bio-char through pyrolysis process. A fluidized bed pyrolysis system with maximum feed rate of 12 g/min was designed and fabricated. The particle size range, sweep gas flow rate and operating temperature were optimized as 0.5 mm-0.99 mm, 8 L/min and 450°C respectively for obtaining maximum yield of bio-oil (48%) and bio-char (35.1%). The crude bio-oil has lower viscosity (1.98 cSt), higher moisture content (31%) and higher density (1040 kg/m3) as compared to commercial petro-diesel. The crude bio-oil was upgraded to make it suitable for engine application. The moisture content of the crude bio-oil was removed about 3% by weight using Na2SO4 as a reagent. The heavier fractions, tar, moisture and inorganic materials were removed from the crude oil by distillation in the temperature range of 40°C-80°C. The density, viscosity and moisture content of the upgraded bio-oil decreased to 1030 kg/m3, 1.77 cSt and 25% respectively.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The FT-ICR MS instrumentation approach facilitates direct assignment of elemental composition to >7000 resolved mass spectral peaks and three-dimensional mass spectral images for individual heteroatom classes highlight compositional diversity of the two samples and provide a baseline description of these materials. Aromatic nitrogen compounds and free fatty acids are predominant species observed in both the bio-oil and aqueous fraction. Residual organic compounds present in the aqueous fraction show distributions that are slightly lower in both molecular ring and/or double bond value and carbon number relative to those found in the bio-oil, albeit with a high degree of commonality between the two compositions. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Co-pyrolysis of forestry wastes and waste tyres is carried out using different facilities: a fixed bed reactor and a continuous auger reactor. Remarkably, only one phase is found in the liquid fraction, which is not achieved by mixture of the pure liquids. In addition, positive effects between waste tyre and biomass are evidenced, being more notable even synergetic in the auger reactor. It is found that whilst acidity, density and oxygen content decrease, pH and calorific value increase with respect to the merely biomass pyrolysis liquid, leading to upgraded bio-oil. Upgrading process is linked to the presence of radical interactions between waste tyres and biomass pyrolysis products. In addition, it is observed that the addition of waste tyres to the feedstock blend is significantly decreasing the amount of aldehydes and phenolic compounds, which is beneficial for improving the stability of the new bio-oils. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The transformation of the lipids extracted from duck tallow into biodiesel was achieved using activated alumina and CO2 under ambient pressure (1bar). Crude fatty acids (~98% assay) were also esterified to help us understand and validate the noncatalytic biodiesel conversion mechanisms. Its conversion efficiency was nearly 93.5(±0.5)%. The transformation of crude fatty acid into biodiesel proves that this newly developed technology for the production of biodiesel combines esterification of free fatty acids and transesterification of triglycerides into a single process that has a 98.5(±0.5)% conversion efficiency to biodiesel within 1min at 350-500°C. This paper addresses the simplest methodology for the production of biodiesel. Herein, it is confirmed that the main driving force of biodiesel conversion in the noncatalytic transesterification reaction is temperature rather than pressure. Noncatalytic biodiesel transformation can be achieved in the presence of a porous material via a thermochemical process in a continuous flow system. This noncatalytic biodiesel transformation was enhanced under the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cell disruption can increase the extraction efficiency of total lipids from microalgae for further conversion to biodiesel. Four different pretreatment methods were tested on mixed cultures of microalgae harvested in a stabilization pond system treating sewage: ultrasonication (US), microwaving (MW), autoclave (AC) and electroflotation by alternating current (EFAC). The best results in terms of total lipid yield were: MW (33.7±5.3%), followed by EFAC (24.8±7.1%), AC (15.4±2.3%), and US (13.3±3.0%). However, when both efficiency and costs are considered, EFAC gave the best result and can be an excellent option for simultaneous microalgae harvesting and cell disruption. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This communication reports the development of an algorithm for correction of specific gravity of biodiesels. The specific gravity of cottonseed oil biodiesels (for example) was measured at different temperatures and the algorithm was proposed for correction of this parameter depending on temperature, which highly influences loading and discharging of biodiesel. The obtained algorithm differs from that reported in EN 14214 and suggests that individual algorithms should be obtained for biodiesels produced from different oil sources. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recently, the potentiality of fluorescence spectroscopy to be used in the quantification of biodiesel content in diesel/biodiesel blends (DBB) was demonstrated. However, the source of the fluorescence dependence of the DBB with biodiesel concentration remains unanswered. In the present paper, a close analysis of the optical properties of the DBB was performed over a wide composition range. The findings suggest that the alterations in the fluorescence intensity can be accounted for only after taking into account changes in viscosity as well as absorbance, in a model where the fluorophores were considered as molecular rotors. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effect of various reduced catalysts for the upgrading of bio-oil produced by fast pyrolysis in a small batch reactor was evaluated using reduced Ni/SiO2, Co/SiO2, Pt/SiO2, Pd/SiO2, and conventional sulfided CoMo/Al2O3 catalysts. All of the reduced catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reactions carried out in the H2 pressure range of 1-5MPa and temperature range of 300-350̊C using guaiacol and woody tar as model compounds for fast pyrolysis oil demonstrated that at 300̊C, higher guaiacol conversion was achieved with the reduced Co/SiO2, Ni/SiO2, and Pd/SiO2 catalysts compared with the conventional sulfide CoMo/Al2O3 catalyst. However, only the reduced Co/SiO2 catalyst exhibited high HDO activity and selectivity toward aromatics in the guaiacol HDO reaction. The reduced Co/SiO2 catalyst also exhibited high HDO activity and selectivity toward aromatics in the HDO of woody tar, indicating that this catalyst may be active for direct deoxygenation of phenol yielding mostly benzene. Thus, the reduced catalysts, especially the Co/SiO2 catalyst, can be considered to be potential candidates for use as HDO catalysts with improved activity and selectivity. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A series of Li/CaO catalysts has been prepared by impregnating 0.5-5.0wt% Li in CaO by wet chemical method. Prepared Li/CaO catalysts have been characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area studies, in order to establish the structure and surface morphology of the catalyst. Hammett indicator test study was performed to determine the basic strength of the Li/CaO catalysts. The prepared Li/CaO catalysts have been employed as a heterogeneous catalyst for the transesterification of waste cottonseed oil (having 2.8wt% free fatty acid contents) with ethanol. Under optimal reaction conditions viz., ethanol/oil molar ratio of 12:1, catalyst to oil weight fraction of 5% and 65°C reaction temperature, 98% fatty acid ethyl ester yield was obtained in 2.5h of reaction duration. Under the optimized reaction conditions, the pseudo first order constant and Arrhenius activation energy were found to be 0.03min-1 and 70.0kJmol-1, respectively. Further Li/CaO catalyst was also found to be effective for the ethanolysis and methanolysis of vegetable oils having up to 3.4wt% free fatty acids. The use of 3-Li/CaO catalyst is advantageous considering that it not only utilizes waste cottonseed oil as a feedstock, but also renewable and nontoxic alcohol, ethanol, for the biodiesel production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this paper was to study the effects of the injection pressure and injection timing on the combustion and emission characteristics in a single-cylinder common-rail direct injection (CRDI) diesel engine fueled with waste cooking oil (WCO) biodiesel and commercial diesel fuel. The fuel property including fatty acid composition for the biodiesel were measured and compared with those of the conventional diesel fuel. The engine tests were conducted at two injection pressures (80 and 160MPa) and different injection timings from-25 to 0 crank angle degree (CAD) after top dead center (aTDC) under two different engine loads. The results showed that the indicated specific fuel consumption (ISFC) with respect to the injection timings of the biodiesel was higher than that of the diesel fuel under all experimental conditions. The peak cylinder pressure and the peak heat release rate of the biodiesel were slightly lower, while the ignition delay was slightly longer under all operating conditions. In terms of emissions, the biodiesel had benefits in reduction of smoke, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC) emissions especially with high fuel injection pressure. The nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions of the biodiesel were relatively higher than those of the diesel under all experimental conditions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Shortages in fresh water supplies today affects more than 1 billion people worldwide. Phytoremediation strategies, based on the abilities of aquatic plants to recycle nutrients offer an attractive solution for the bioremediation of water pollution and represents one of the most globally researched issues. The subsequent application of the biomass from the remediation for the production of fuels and petrochemicals offers an ecologically friendly and cost-effective solution for water pollution problems and production of value-added products. Results: In this paper, the feasibility of the dual application of duckweed and azolla aquatic plants for wastewater treatment and production of renewable fuels and petrochemicals is explored. The differences in absorption rates of the key wastewater nutrients, ammonium and phosphorus by these aquatic macrophytes were used as the basis for optimization of the composition of wastewater effluents. Analysis of pyrolysis products showed that azolla and algae produce a similar range of bio-oils that contain a large spectrum of petrochemicals including straight-chain C10-C21 alkanes, which can be directly used as diesel fuel supplement, or a glycerin-free component of biodiesel. Pyrolysis of duckweed produces a different range of bio-oil components that can potentially be used for the production of "green" gasoline and diesel fuel using existing techniques, such as catalytic hydrodeoxygenation. Conclusions: Differences in absorption rates of the key wastewater nutrients, ammonium and phosphorus by different aquatic macrophytes can be used for optimization of composition of wastewater effluents. The generated data suggest that the composition of the petrochemicals can be modified in a targeted fashion, not only by using different species, but also by changing the source plants' metabolic profile, by exposing them to different abiotic or biotic stresses. This study presents an attractive, ecologically friendly and cost-effective solution for efficient bio-filtration of swine wastewater and petrochemicals production from generated biomass. © 2014Muradov et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. ©2014 Muradov et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Enzymatic biodiesel is becoming an increasingly popular topic in bioenergy literature because of its potential to overcome the problems posed by chemical processes. However, the high cost of the enzymatic process still remains the main drawback for its industrial application, mostly because of the high price of refined oils. Unfortunately, low cost substrates, such as crude soybean oil, often release a product that hardly accomplishes the final required biodiesel specifications and need an additional pretreatment for gums removal. In order to reduce costs and to make the enzymatic process more efficient, we developed an innovative system for enzymatic biodiesel production involving a combination of a lipase and two phospholipases. This allows performing the enzymatic degumming and transesterification in a single step, using crude soybean oil as feedstock, and converting part of the phospholipids into biodiesel. Since the two processes have never been studied together, an accurate analysis of the different reaction components and conditions was carried out. Results: Crude soybean oil, used as low cost feedstock, is characterized by a high content of phospholipids (900 ppm of phosphorus). However, after the combined activity of different phospholipases and liquid lipase Callera Trans L, a complete transformation into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs >95%) and a good reduction of phosphorus (P <5 ppm) was achieved. The combination of enzymes allowed avoidance of the acid treatment required for gums removal, the consequent caustic neutralization, and the high temperature commonly used in degumming systems, making the overall process more eco-friendly and with higher yield. Once the conditions were established, the process was also tested with different vegetable oils with variable phosphorus contents. Conclusions: Use of liquid lipase Callera Trans L in biodiesel production can provide numerous and sustainable benefits. Besides reducing the costs derived from enzyme immobilization, the lipase can be used in combination with other enzymes such as phospholipases for gums removal, thus allowing the use of much cheaper, non-refined oils. The possibility to perform degumming and transesterification in a single tank involves a great efficiency increase in the new era of enzymatic biodiesel production at industrial scale. © 2014 Cesarini et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - In the present study biodiesel was produced by various fungal species isolated from Egypt using sugarcane molasses as substrate. In the first stage 6 oleaginous fungi, namely, Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Epicoccum nigrum, Fusarium oxysporum, Aspergillus parasiticus and Emericella nidulans var. lata were used for lipid production. Subsequent to fungal cultivation on sugarcane molasses the cultures were filtered and biodiesel was prepared by direct esterification of dry fungal biomass. Methyl esters of palmitic, stearic, linoleic and elaidic represented the major components while palmitoleic represented a minor component of biodiesel produced from tested oleaginous fungi. In the second stage, the spent medium of fungal culture was used as the fermentation medium for hydrogen production by Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. The maximum total H2 yield was obtained with the spent medium of E. nigrum and A. alternata. The results presented in this study suggest a possibility of interlinking the biodiesel production technology by fungi with hydrogen production by C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 to exploit the residual sugars in the spent media and therefore increase the economic feasibility of the biofuel production from molasses. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - Primary combustion intermediates in low-pressure premixed laminar 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF)/oxygen (O2)/argon (Ar) flames with equivalence ratios of 0.8 and 1.5 were investigated by using tunable synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization and molecular-beam mass spectrometry. DMF is a promising biofuel, with properties similar to those of gasoline. However, the combustion chemistry of DMF is not well-studied. Possible reaction pathways of DMF and its primary combustion derivatives were proposed based on the combustion intermediates identified in this work. Photoionization efficiency curves (PIEs) of the combustion intermediates in the DMF/O2/Ar flames were recorded. Ionization energies (IEs) were measured from the PIEs. The combustion intermediates were identified by the agreement of the measured IEs with those reported in the literatures or calculated at G3B3 level. H abstraction and the consecutive reaction products were identified, including 5-methylfurfural, (Z)-1-oxo-1,3,4-pentatriene, and 2-ethyl-5-methylfuran, etc. Furan was not observed in the low-pressure DMF flames. H and OH addition products were also identified, including 2-methylfuran, (2Z,3E)-1-oxo-1,3-pentadiene, and 2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-5-methylfuran. The extra methyl side chain may explain the lower laminar burning velocity of DMF relative to that of 2-methylfuran. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: As the production of biofuels from raw materials continuously increases, optimization of production processes is necessary. A very important issue is the development of wasteless methods of biodiesel production. One way of utilization of glycerol generated in biodiesel production is its microbial conversion to 1,3-PD (1,3-propanediol). Results: The study investigated the scale-up of 1,3-PD synthesis from crude glycerol by Clostridium butyricum. Batch fermentations were carried out in 6.6 L, 42 L and 150 L bioreactors. It was observed that cultivation of C. butyricum on a pilot scale did not decrease the efficiency of 1,3-PD production. The highest concentrations of 1,3-PD, 37 g/L for batch fermentation and 71 g/L for fed-batch fermentation, were obtained in the 6.6 L bioreactor. The kinetic parameters of 1,3-PD synthesis from crude glycerol established for batch fermentation were similar regarding all three bioreactor capacities. During fed-batch fermentation, the concentration of 1,3-PD in the 150 L bioreactor was lower and the substrate was not completely utilized. That suggested the presence of multifunctional environmental stresses in the 150 L bioreactor, which was confirmed by protein analysis. Conclusion: The values of effectivity parameters for 1,3-PD synthesis in batch fermentations carried out in 6.6 L, 42 L and 150 L bioreactors were similar. The parameters obtained during fed-batch fermentations in the 150 L bioreactor differed in the rate and percentage of substrate utilization. The analysis of cell proteins demonstrated that a number of multifunctional stresses occurred during fed-batch fermentations in the 150 L bioreactor, which suggests the possibility of identifying the key stages in the biochemical process where inhibition of 1,3-PD synthesis pathways can be observed. © 2014 Szymanowska-Powałowska and Białas; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The present study experimentally investigates spark-ignited combustion with 87 AKI E0 gasoline in its neat form and in midlevel alcohol-gasoline blends with 24% vol/vol isobutanol-gasoline (IB24) and 30% vol/vol ethanol-gasoline (E30). A single-cylinder research engine was used with an 11.85:1 compression ratio, hydraulically actuated valves, laboratory intake air, and was capable of external exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Experiments were conducted with all fuels to full-load conditions with λ = 1, using both 0% and 15% external cooled EGR. Higher octane number biofuel blends exhibited increased stoichiometric torque capability at this compression ratio, where the unique properties of ethanol enabled a doubling of the stoichiometric torque capability with E30 as compared to 87 AKI, up to 20 bar IMEPg (indicated mean effective pressure gross) at λ = 1. EGR provided thermodynamic advantages and was a key enabler for increasing engine efficiency for all fuel types. However, with E30, EGR was less useful for knock mitigation than gasoline or IB24. Torque densities with E30 with 15% EGR at λ = 1 operation were similar or better than a modern EURO IV calibration turbo-diesel engine. The results of the present study suggest that it could be possible to implement a 40% downsize + downspeed configuration (1.2 L engine) into a representative midsize sedan. For example, for a midsize sedan at a 65 miles/h cruise, an estimated fuel consumption of 43.9 miles per gallon (MPG) (engine out 102 g-CO2/km) could be achieved with similar reserve power to a 2.0 L engine with 87AKI (38.6 MPG, engine out 135 g-CO2/km). Data suggest that, with midlevel alcohol-gasoline blends, engine and vehicle optimization can offset the reduced fuel energy content of alcohol-gasoline blends and likely reduce vehicle fuel consumption and tailpipe CO2 emissions. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Despite the potential opportunities, there remain widespread concerns about bioenergy and biofuel feedstock sustainability, assessment and policy. This paper illustrates the value of the Rapid Impact Assessment Matrix (RIAM) for transparently presenting evidence and judgements relating to four biomass options that are potentially suitable for supplying heat to a university-sized facility. The RIAM approach provides comparable scores for: soybean biodiesel, waste cooking oil biodiesel, anaerobically co-digested food waste and manure; and timber pellets made from sawmill by-product. The high-level nature of the RIAM allows the user to structure a broader range of considerations and contingencies than the life-cycle approach embodied in EU biofuel legislation. We advocate the RIAM not as a substitute for LCA or any other form of assessment in a bioenergy context, but as a means of synthesising the results of different types of impact assessment and for making broader debates and uncertainties explicit, such that non-specialist knowledge users are both guided and made aware of differing scientific and stakeholder opinion. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pine oil biofuel, obtained by the distillation of oleoresins of pine tree, has been chosen as a new renewable fuel for its operation in diesel engine. Notably, the viscosity and cetane number of pine oil was observed to be lower than diesel. The motivation for this work stems from the basic notion that less viscous and lower cetane fuels are considered to be fumigated for their successful operation in diesel engine. As such, pine oil biofuel was vaporized and inducted into the engine cylinder through inlet manifold while diesel was sent through main injection system, providing ignition assistance for the pine oil/air mixture. Prior to conducting engine experiments, the evaporation characteristics of pine oil droplet were studied through suspended droplet experiment so as to get better insights on pine oil droplet evaporation at various temperatures. From this study, it was observed that at higher air temperature (150. °C), evaporation of pine oil was more effective than at lower temperatures (100. °C and 50. °C) and therefore, 150. °C was chosen as preheat temperature for engine fumigation study. Thus, as a novel attempt, the fundamental study on pine oil droplet evaporation is subtly coupled with engine studies, and the effect of vaporization of pine oil on engine characteristics was mapped. As an outcome of engine study, the maximum percentage of diesel replaced was noticed to be 36% at 100% load and 60% at 20% load. Significantly, the engine performance such as BSFC and BTE was observed to be improved with the increase in proportion of pine oil injection. Further, combustion of fumigated pine oil has been reported to be better, with 36% injection of pine oil showing 10.3% higher in-cylinder pressure than that for 6% injection of pine oil at 100% load. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the present research, microwave-assisted biodiesel production from Camptotheca acuminata seed oil catalyzed by novel Brönsted-Lewis acidic ionic liquid (IL) was investigated. A series of IL catalysts were prepared using Brönsted acidic IL [BSO3HMIM]HSO4 with various metal sulfates for the first time, and the catalytic mechanism of transesterification reaction using the prepared Brönsted-Lewis acidic IL was clarified. The results showed that [BSO3HMIM]HSO4-Fe2(SO4)3 represented a superior catalytic activity. Meanwhile, the parameters affecting the microwave-assisted conversion process were studied. A high conversion yield (95.7%) was achieved in short duration (about 60min) under relatively low temperature (60°C). Analyzing the FAMEs composition by GC-MS and main properties demonstrated that the biodiesel product prepared from C. acuminata seed oil was of high quality. In addition, a kinetic model was established for the conversion process. The results showed that microwave-assisted biodiesel production catalyzed by Brönsted-Lewis acidic IL was an efficient and environment-friendly technology for bioenergy industry. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, multivariate calibration based on partial least squares (PLS) and support vector regression (SVR) using the whole spectrum and variable selection by synergy interval (siPLS and siSVR) were applied to NIR spectra for the determination of animal fat biodiesel content in soybean biodiesel and B20 diesel blends. For all models, prediction errors, bias test for systematic errors and permutation test for trends in the residuals were calculated. The siSVR produced significantly lower prediction errors compared to the full spectrum methods and siPLS, with a root mean squares error (RMSEP) of 0.18%(w/w) (concentration range: 0.00%-69.00%(w/w)) in the soybean biodiesel blend and 0.10%(w/w) in the B20 diesel (concentration range: 0.00%-13.80%(w/w)). Additionally, in the models for the determination of animal fat biodiesel in blends with soybean diesel, PLS and SVR showed evidence of systematic errors, and PLS/siPLS presented trends in residuals based on the permutation test. For the B20 diesel, PLS presented evidence of systematic errors, and siPLS presented trends in the residuals. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microbial production of fatty acid derived chemicals and fuels is currently of great interest due to the limited resources and increasing prices of petroleum and petroleum-based products. The development of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) cell factory would represent an opportunity for biodiesel production due to its successful history in the biotechnology area. However, fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis is highly regulated and usually not high enough for developing an efficient production process. In S. cerevisiae, FAs are degraded by β-oxidation and a large fraction is utilized to synthesize steryl esters (SEs) and triacylglycerols (TAGs), which are not essential for the cell. Here, by eliminating non-essential FA utilization pathways, we developed a metabolic engineering strategy resulting in a S. cerevisiae strain that can overproduce FAs and in turn use these for producing FAEEs (biodiesel). Compared to the wild-type, there is an about 3-fold increase in free FA content in a strain devoid of both TAG and SE formation, a 4-fold increase in free FA content in a strain that is incapable of β-oxidation, and a 5-fold increase of free FAs in a strain lacking all of these non-essential FA utilization pathways. It is also demonstrated that there are similar positive effects on FAEE production in these deletion strains. The highest production of FAEEs is 17.2. mg/l in the strain in which all these pathways were blocked. The results of this study serve as a basis for further strategies to improve the production of FA derivatives in S. cerevisiae. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Dehydration of biomass-derived levulinic acid under solid acid catalysis and treatment of the resulting angelica lactone with catalytic K 2CO3 produces the angelica lactone dimer in excellent yield. This dimer serves as a novel feedstock for hydrodeoxygenation, which proceeds under relatively mild conditions with a combination of oxophilic metal and noble metal catalysts to yield branched C7-C10 hydrocarbons in the gasoline volatility range. Considering that levulinic acid is available in &gt;80 % conversion from raw biomass, a field-to-tank yield of drop-in, cellulosic gasoline of &gt;60 % is possible. Fuel for thought: Biomass-derived levulinic acid can be converted in three simple steps via the angelica lactone dimer into branched, gasoline-range hydrocarbons in high yield by using a combination of oxophilic metal and noble metal catalysts (see scheme).

AB  - Biodiesel is a green and popular renewable fuel and unlike mineral diesel, produces fewer toxic emissions. Jatropha curcas Linn is a nonedible fruit that commonly used in biodiesel production. This study evaluated the impacts of Jatropha seeds maturity on quantity and quality of yield oil. Production of biodiesel from Jatropha oil and ethanol using natrium hydroxide as the catalyst by transesterification was performed on half-matured (yellow) and matured (black) Jatropha seeds. Experimental investigations have been carried out to examine properties and performance of Jatropha, and different blends of Jatropha oil-diesel (JOD) in comparison to a petroleum-based diesel fuel. Half-matured stage of Jatropha is shown to produces 2.5% less oil than the matured stage. The quality of the maturity stages quantified in terms of mean square error (MSE), and the matured stage showed 13% better performance in contrast to the half-matured stage. Matured stage JOD blends indicate closer performance to petroleum-based diesel and can be used as a biodiesel without engine modification. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Industrial low-grade crude palm oil (LGCPO) generated from industrial palm oil mills must be pretreated before utilizing it as a biodiesel raw material. The pretreatment of LGCPO was conducted using benzenesulfonic acid (BZSA) as solid organic acid catalyst. Batch pretreatment of LGCPO was carried out to study the influence of BZSA dosage (0.25 - 3.5% wt/wt), methanol molar ratio to LGCPO (4:1 - 20:1), temperature (40 - 80°C), and reaction time (3 - 150 min). The effects of those parameters on the free fatty acid content, and the yield of pretreated LGCPO were reported. This study illustrated the feasibility of using LGCPO from palm oil mills to produce biodiesel. The biodiesel produced from LGCPO meets the international standards (ASTM D6751 and EN 14214). Three times recycling of BZSA was achieved without appreciable degradation in its activity. This study introduces a possible batch esterification process using BZSA followed by an alkaline transesterification reaction for a possible future industrial application. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The EPA will reconsider 2013 cellulosic biofuel quotas. The API and American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers submitted the information in October 2013 after the quotas' comment period ended, and EPA determined that the information is of central relevance, meeting the statutory requirements for granting the two trade associations' request for reconsideration. EPA believes that KiOR's announcement of reduced anticipated production in 2013, justifies reconsideration of the 2013 cellulosic biofuel standard. KiOR Inc, a Pasadena, TX, is expected to produce ∼ 920,000 gal of biofuels for the year at its Columbus, MS, plant, comprised of 35% gasoline, 40% diesel, and 25% fuel oil.

AB  - These last few years, the name of soybeans soared as a source of biodiesel. Soy biodiesel is an alternative fuel produced from soybean oil. Soybean potential as an alternative renewable energy source because it is expected to have the highest energy content compared to other alternative fuels. Opportunities to develop biodiesel using soybean oil in Indonesia is quite large, considering the soybean is a commodity that is already known and widely cultivated almost in all over Indonesia. In addition, the use of soybean for biofuel feedstock is expected to motivate farmers to cultivate soybeans, so their use is not limited to non-energy raw materials. Soybean varieties that have a high oil content as well as high yield is a source of major biodiesel feedstock. From 73 soybean varieties that have been released in Indonesia, has an average oil content of 18%. Varieties with high oil content can be used as raw material for biodiesel. Research on the use of soy as an ingredient of energy crops (biodiesel) have been carried out. In fact, soybean oil is the vegetable oil feedstock for most of the biodiesel being produced in the United States today. With the potential for soybean crops in Indonesia, both in terms of availability of land and varieties, the use of soybean oil for biofuel development in Indonesia is the flagship prospective materials for bio fuel substitute than other plants in the future. © IJRED.

AB  - Biofuels are acting as a renewable replacement for petroleum fuels due to some environmental and economic benefits. They are prepared by blending a major portion of diesel fuel and a certain minor percentage of bio-oils, which provides less greenhouse gas (GHG) compared to pure diesel. Recently, bioethanol has been the most widely used biofuel for transportation. Bioethanol can be produced from different kinds of agricultural raw materials classified into three categories: simple sugars, starch, and lignocellulose. Use of bioethanol-blended gasoline fuel for automobiles can significantly reduce petroleum use and exhaust GHG emission. Bioethanol from sugar cane, produced under the proper conditions, is essentially a clean fuel and has several clear advantages over petroleum-derived gasoline in reducing GHG emissions and improving air quality in metropolitan areas. However, there remains a compromise between GHG emission and saving of fossil fuel energy by introducing bioethanol either totally or as a blending component of engine fuel. Thus, considering biofuel as a replenishable energy source, the future pathway of energy management could be planned. © 2014 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Biodiesel, derived from the transesterification of vegetable oils or animal fats. Biodiesel is used in the convention diesel engine for the better performance and emission. From the study it is found that the use of biodiesel leads to the substantial reduction in Particulate Matter, Hydrocarbon and Carbon monoxide emissions accompanying with the imperceptible power loss, the increase in fuel consumption and the increase in NOx emission on conventional diesel engine with no or fewer modification. Biofuel density, viscosity and bulk modulus are linked to engine performance and emissions the physical and chemical properties of biodiesels can have significant effects on the combustion process, which will impact on the engine performance and emissions. © February 2014 IJENS.

AB  - In this work, we propose the optimization of a flowsheet for the production of i-butene from switchgrass. A superstructure embedding a number of alternatives is proposed. Two technologies are considered for switchgrass pretreatment, dilute acid and ammonia fiber explosion (AFEX) so that the structure of the grass is broken down. Surface response models are used to predict the yield. Next, enzymatic hydrolysis follows any of the pretreatments to obtain fermentable sugars, mainly xylose and glucose. i-Butene is obtained by fermentation of the sugars. Next it is separated mainly from CO2 for which PSA or membrane separation are considered. However, xylose cannot be easily converted, and thus we also evaluate the possibility of using it to produce ethanol. The problem is formulated as an MINLP with simultaneous optimization and heat integration. Finally, an economic evaluation is performed. The most promising process involves the use of dilute acid pretreatment and membrane purification of the i-butene. However, the decision related to the production of i-butene alone or the simultaneous production of i-butene and ethanol depends on the prices for ethanol and for switchgrass. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigated the effectiveness of successive bioaugmentation, conventional bioaugmentation, and biostimulation of biodegradation of B10 in soil. In addition, the structure of the soil microbial community was assessed by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The consortium was inoculated on the initial and the 11th day of incubation for successive bioaugmentation and only on the initial day for bioaugmentation and conventional bioaugmentation. The experiment was conducted for 32 days. The microbial consortium was identified based on sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and consisted as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, and Ochrobactrum intermedium. Nutrient introduction (biostimulation) promoted a positive effect on microbial populations. The results indicate that the edaphic community structure and dynamics were different according to the treatments employed. CO2 evolution demonstrated no significant difference in soil microbial activity between biostimulation and bioaugmentation treatments. The total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) analysis indicated a biodegradation level of 35.7 and 32.2 % for the biostimulation and successive bioaugmentation treatments, respectively. Successive bioaugmentation displayed positive effects on biodegradation, with a substantial reduction in TPH levels. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Properties of biodiesel can be related to the chemical composition of the biomass source used in transesterification. Saturated fatty acids confer high oxidative stability, while unsaturated fatty acids improve the cold flow properties, which are also influenced by the chain length. In the present study, blends of biodiesel produced from different vegetable oils were evaluated in order to obtain the proper blend to fulfill the European Standard EN14214 in terms of oxidative stability and cold flow properties. Citric acid was used to purify the methyl ester phase. Oxidative stability resulted highly dependent on polyunsaturated fatty esters while fatty ester chain length is a determining factor in cold flow performance of the blends. A preliminary study of the effectiveness of a commercial additive (a Poly alkyl methacrylate) in improving methyl ester flow at low temperatures was done, but no significant changes were found. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Harsh requirements regarding the exhaust gases emission have conditioned the development of new systems in the engine, as well as the development of ecological fuels. Sulfur extraction considerably impairs the lubrication properties of diesel fuel. This has consequences in the rapid wear of the elements that constitute the fuel injection system. Additives for the improvement of lubrication properties are added with the aim of eliminating the adverse effect of fuel. The problem related to the use of those additives lies in the fact that they contain heavy aromatic solvents such as methyl naphthalene, methyl naphthalene and biphenyl which are harmful to health. Therefore, the aim of this research is to determine whether there is a possibility to use biodiesel for the improvement of lubrication properties of fossil diesel with low sulfur content instead of standard additives.In this research biodiesel obtained from sunflower oil was blended with fossil diesel which did not have additionally added additives for the improvement of lubrication properties. The obtained results were compared with the other researches on the use of fossil diesel with added standard additives. The blends of fossil diesel and biodiesel content of 1-7%vv-1 were used here. The experimental research used different test fuels for the testing of chemical and lubrication properties of fuel, tractor engine performance and exhaust gas emissions.By adding biodiesel, fossil diesel properties remained within the limits set by the standard EN 590 while lubrication properties were significantly improved. On the other hand, power of tractor engine did not change significantly. Although biodiesel had lower heating value with respect to fossil diesel, blending 5, 6 and 7%vv-1 of biodiesel caused slight increase in the engine power. Tests of exhaust gas emissions indicated that the addition of biodiesel reduced the content of CO2 and CO. The problems related to the use of biodiesel as an additive can be reduced by oxidation fuel stability, increased specific fuel consumption, reduced thermal efficiency and increased NOx emission. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A heated Torch Integrated Sample Introduction System (hTISIS) has been applied to the analysis of petroleum products and biofuels through Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Three elements have been determined because of their importance in the petroleum industry: V, Ni and Mn. Sample injection has been accomplished by means of the introduction of a low sample volume (2.5 μl) into an air carrier stream. A peak has been thus obtained. Two sets of samples have been selected: five solvents (xylene, kerosene, nonane, undecane and hexadecane) and five real samples (biodiesel, diesel, kerosene, superethanol and gasoline). The chamber temperature has been varied when introducing either solvents or real samples. In both cases it has been found that sensitivity peaked at 110 °C heating temperature. However, non-spectral interferences caused by differences in the matrix composition became less severe as this variable was increased and they were virtually eliminated at temperatures of 150 °C (alkanes) and 200 °C (real samples). When comparing with a default spray chamber (i.e., conical chamber with an impact bead) 3 to 6 times lower LODs were obtained. At 150 °C, this parameter has taken values of approximately 80 ng l-1 for V and Ni to 140 ng l -1 for Mn. At 200 °C heating temperature it has been possible to carry out accurate ICP-MS determinations by applying external calibration. Additional advantages of the present approach were that no oxygen was required to avoid soot deposition at the sampler cone and that nickel, instead of platinum cones, was used. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Due to mounting concerns related to fossil fuel use and problems with their supply, the use of alternative sources of energy is increasing. One of the alternative sources is biomass and the European Union has adopted a biofuel directive that describes targets for the use of biofuels in the transport sector. The majority of biofuels produced in Europe comes from rapeseed. In this study, we focused on analyzing the efficiency of rapeseed biodiesel production. Energy efficiency in terms of Energy Return On Energy Invested (EROEI) was analyzed for two EU countries (Poland and The Netherlands) with different agro-ecological systems. Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) accounted for inputs, processes and outputs of energy in the biodiesel production system. Input parameters were derived from literature as well as from farmer's interviews. The use of the outputs-straw, meal, and glycerin-were included in the LCI system boundary. The EROEI values ranged from 1.73 to 2.36 in Poland and from 2.18 to 2.60 in the Netherlands. The low number of respondents makes it risky to draw hard conclusions about these values but the patterns observed show that intensifying the production process and increasing yield bears very little or no benefit in terms of energy produced. Due to a higher amount of organic manure and consequently lower amount of artificial fertilizers used in crop growth in the Netherlands, the rapeseed biodiesel production system in the Netherlands is more efficient than in Poland. In both cases, the EROEI is quite low. More detailed spatial energy efficiency assessments are required to determine if and where sustainable production may be possible. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Biodiesels, which are made from various crops, as well as animal fat, are renewable, bio-degradable, and non-toxic and are eco-friendly compared with fossil fuels. Currently, there are more than 350 oil-bearing crops identified as potential sources for biodiesel production. In this study, the potential of biodiesel obtained from a non-edible oil source (Moringa oleifera) was explored and compared with that of palm biodiesel and diesel fuel. The physico-chemical properties of M. oleifera methyl ester were determined, and the properties of 5% and 10% (by volume) blends thereof (MB5 and MB10, respectively) were compared with those of palm-oil blends (PB5 and PB10) and diesel fuel (B0). The performance of these fuels was assessed in a multi-cylinder diesel engine at various engine speeds and under the full-load condition whereas emissions were assessed under the both full-load and half load condition. The properties of palm and M. oleifera biodiesels and their blends meet the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards. Engine performance test results indicated that the PB5 and the MB5 fuels produced slightly lower brake powers and higher brake specific fuel consumption values compared to diesel fuel over the entire range of speeds examined. Engine emission results indicated that the PB5, MB5, PB10 and MB10 fuels reduced the average emissions of carbon monoxide by 13.17%, 5.37%, 17.36%, and 10.60%, respectively, and reduced those of hydrocarbons by 14.47%, 3.94%, 18.42%, and 9.21%, respectively. However, the PB5, MB5, PB10, and MB10 fuels slightly increased nitric oxide emissions by 1.96%, 3.99%, 3.38%, and 8.46%, respectively, and increased carbon dioxide emissions by 5.60%, 2.25%, 11.73%, and 4.96%, respectively, compared to the emissions induced by B0. M. oleifera oil is a potential feedstock for biodiesel production, and the performance of MB5 and MB10 biodiesel is comparable to that of PB5 and PB10 biodiesel and diesel fuel. Because the MB5 and MB10 fuels produce lower exhaust emissions than diesel fuel, these fuels can replace diesel fuel in unmodified engines to reduce the global energy demand and exhaust emissions to the environment. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The emergence of biofuel as a renewable energy source offers opportunities for significant climate change mitigation and greater energy independence to many countries. At the same time, biofuel represents the possibility of substitution between energy and food. For developing countries like India, which imports over 75% of its crude oil, fossil fuels pose two risks-global warming pollution and long-term risk that oil prices will undermine real living standards. This paper examines India's options for managing energy price risk in three ways: biofuel development, energy efficiency promotion, and food productivity improvements. Our salient results suggest that biodiesel shows promise as a transport fuel substitute that can be produced in ways that fully utilize marginal agricultural resources and hence promote rural livelihoods. First-generation bioethanol, by contrast, appears to have a limited ability to offset the impacts of oil price hikes. Combining the biodiesel expansion policy with energy efficiency improvements and food productivity increases proved to be a more effective strategy to enhance both energy and food security, help mitigate climate change, and cushion the economy against oil price shocks. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel production in Brazil has grown from 736m3 in 2007 to 2.7Mm3 in 2012. It is an emergent bioenergy for which it is important to guarantee environmental sustainability. The objective of this article is to characterise the biodiesel production chain in Brazil, to identify potential environmental impacts and to analyse key drivers and barriers for biodiesel environmental sustainability. This article explores these aspects and focusses on the increasing demand for the main feedstocks for biodiesel production in Brazil: soybean oil and beef tallow. The impacts of land use and land-use change on greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity and water, as well as the energy balance, were found to be critical for the environmental sustainability assessment and development of biodiesel chains. Increasing agriculture yields, diversifying feedstocks and adopting ethyl transesterification can contribute to minimise environmental impacts. It was also found that environmental impacts could be mitigated by appropriate policies aiming at an integrated optimisation of food and bioenergy production and through agro-economic-ecological zoning, allowing adequate use of land for each purpose. Despite the limitation and weakness of some sustainability tools and initiatives, certification and zoning can play an important role in the sustainability of the emerging biodiesel production in Brazil. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Microalgae can accumulate considerable amounts of lipids under different nutrient-deficient conditions, making them as one of the most promising sustainable sources for biofuel production. These inducible processes provide a powerful experimental basis for fully understanding the mechanisms of physiological acclimation, lipid hyperaccumulation and gene expression in algae. In this study, three nutrient-deficiency strategies, viz nitrogen-, phosphorus- and iron-deficiency were applied to trigger the lipid hyperaccumulation in an oleaginous Chlorella pyrenoidosa. Regular patterns of growth characteristics, lipid accumulation, physiological parameters, as well as the expression patterns of lipid biosynthesis-related genes were fully analyzed and compared. Results: Our results showed that all the nutrient stress conditions could enhance the lipid content considerably compared with the control. The total lipid and neutral lipid contents exhibit the most marked increment under nitrogen deficiency, achieving 50.32% and 34.29% of dry cell weight at the end of cultivation, respectively. Both photosynthesis indicators and reactive oxygen species parameters reveal that physiological stress turned up when exposed to nutrient depletions. Time-course transcript patterns of lipid biosynthesis-related genes showed that diverse expression dynamics probably contributes to the different lipidic phenotypes under stress conditions. By analyzing the correlation between lipid content and gene expression level, we pinpoint several genes viz. rbsL, me g6562, accA, accD, dgat g2354, dgat g3280 and dgat g7063, which encode corresponding enzymes or subunits of malic enzyme, ACCase and diacylglycerol acyltransferase in the de novo TAG biosynthesis pathway, are highly related to lipid accumulation and might be exploited as target genes for genetic modification. Conclusion: This study provided us not only a comprehensive picture of adaptive mechanisms from physiological perspective, but also a number of targeted genes that can be used for a systematic metabolic engineering. Besides, our results also represented the feasibility of lipid production through trophic transition cultivation modes, throwing light on a two-stage microalgal lipid production strategy with which heterotrophy stage provides sufficient robust seed and nitrogen-starvation photoautotrophy stage enhances the overall lipid productivity. © 2014Fan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Isocyanic acid (HNCO) has only recently been measured in the ambient atmosphere, and many aspects of its atmospheric chemistry are still uncertain. HNCO was measured during three diverse field campaigns: California Nexus—Research at the Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change (CalNex 2010) at the Pasadena ground site, Nitrogen, Aerosol Composition, and Halogens on a Tall Tower (NACHTT 2011) at the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (BAO) in Weld County, CO, and Biofuel Crops emission of Ozone precursors intensive (BioCORN 2011), in a cornfield NW of Fort Collins, CO. Mixing ratios varied from below detection limit (~0.003 ppbv) to over 1.2 ppbv during a period when agricultural burning impacted the BAO Tower site. Urban areas, such as the CalNex 2010 Pasadena site, appear to have both primary (combustion) and secondary (photochemical) sources of HNCO, 50 ± 9%, and 33 ± 12%, respectively, while primary sources were responsible for the large mixing ratios of HNCO observed during the wintertime NACHTT study in suburban Colorado. Isocyanic acid during the BioCORN study in rural NE Colorado was closely correlated to ozone and therefore likely photochemically produced as a secondary product from amines or formamide. The removal of HNCO from the lower atmosphere is thought to be due to deposition, as common gas phase loss processes of photolysis and reactions with hydroxyl radicals, are slow. These ambient measurements are consistent with some HNCO deposition, which was evident at night at these surface sites. © 2013. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The production of six regionally important cellulosic biomass feedstocks, including pine, eucalyptus, unmanaged hardwoods, forest residues, switchgrass, and sweet sorghum, was analyzed using consistent life cycle methodologies and system boundaries to identify feedstocks with the lowest cost and environmental impacts. Supply chain analysis was performed for each feedstock, calculating costs and supply requirements for the production of 453,592 dry tonnes of biomass per year. Cradle-to-gate environmental impacts from these modeled supply systems were quantified for nine mid-point indicators using SimaPro 7.2 LCA software. Conversion of grassland to managed forest for bioenergy resulted in large reductions in GHG emissions due to carbon uptake associated with direct land use change. By contrast, converting forests to cropland resulted in large increases in GHG emissions. Production of forest-based feedstocks for biofuels resulted in lower delivered cost, lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and lower overall environmental impacts than the agricultural feedstocks studied. Forest residues had the lowest environmental impact and delivered cost per dry tonne. Using forest-based biomass feedstocks instead of agricultural feedstocks would result in lower cradle-to-gate environmental impacts and delivered biomass costs for biofuel production in the southern U.S.

AB  - 5-Ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) can be prepared from the corresponding halomethylfurfural and absolute ethanol in good yield. The use of significantly more affordable 96% ethanol results in formation of levulinic acid or its ester in considerable amount (up to 16%), which is difficult to separate from the desired EMF. In the present study we report that the addition of oil shale ash prevents the hydrolysis of the furan ring and enables the use of 96% ethanol with great success. The developed procedure is applicable to a wide range of aqueous alcohols, is operationally simple and utilizes an inexpensive basic ash, which is deposited in millions of tons per year. Notably, the basicity of the ash is decreased during the process, making its deposits less hazardous to the environment. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Methyl esters of palm oil and rice bran oil were tested in a direct injection, naturally aspirated, single cylinder diesel engine. The diesel engine was operated with biofuels from no load to full load condition. The effects of different biofuels on engine parameters, namely, fuel consumption, electrical efficiency, lower heating value, higher heating value, and engine speed, were examined; also, the physical and chemical properties, such as specific gravity, moisture content, refractive index, acid value, iodine number, saponification value, and peroxide value, of the two methyl esters used in this study were estimated. Based on the Cetane number and iodine value, the methyl esters obtained from palm oil were found to be not suitable to use as biodiesel in cold weather conditions, but for hot climate conditions, biodiesel obtained from palm and rice bran sources were found to be suitable. Based on electrical efficiency, the methyl esters obtained from palm oil were found to be very good. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Combustion experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of using blends of ultralow sulfur diesel (ULSD) with biodiesel or n-butanol on physicochemical and toxicological characteristics of particulate emissions from a non-road diesel engine. The results indicated that compared to ULSD, both the blended fuels could effectively reduce the particulate mass and elemental carbon emissions, with butanol being more effective than biodiesel. The proportion of organic carbon and volatile organic compounds in particles increased for both blended fuels. However, biodiesel blended fuels showed lower total particle-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emissions. The total number emissions of particles ≤560. nm in diameter decreased gradually for the butanol blended fuels, but increased significantly for the biodiesel blended fuels. Both the blended fuels indicated lower soot ignition temperature and activation energy. All the particle extracts showed a decline in cell viability with the increased dose. However, the change in cell viability among test fuels is not statistically significant different with the exception of DB-4 (biodiesel-diesel blend containing 4% oxygen) used at 75% engine load. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The idea of renewable and regenerative resources has inspired research for more than a hundred years. Ideally, the only spent energy will replenish itself, like plant material, sunlight, thermal energy or wind. Biodiesel or ethanol are examples, since their production relies mainly on plant material. However, it has become apparent that crop derived biofuels will not be sufficient to satisfy future energy demands. Thus, especially in the last decade a lot of research has focused on the production of next generation biofuels. A major subject of these investigations has been the microbial fatty acid biosynthesis with the aim to produce fatty acids or derivatives for substitution of diesel. As an industrially important organism and with the best studied microbial fatty acid biosynthesis, Escherichia coli has been chosen as producer in many of these studies and several reviews have been published in the fields of E. coli fatty acid biosynthesis or biofuels. However, most reviews discuss only one of these topics in detail, despite the fact, that a profound understanding of the involved enzymes and their regulation is necessary for efficient genetic engineering of the entire pathway. The first part of this review aims at summarizing the knowledge about fatty acid biosynthesis of E. coli and its regulation, and it provides the connection towards the production of fatty acids and related biofuels. The second part gives an overview about the achievements by genetic engineering of the fatty acid biosynthesis towards the production of next generation biofuels. Finally, the actual importance and potential of fatty acid-based biofuels will be discussed. © 2014Janßen and Steinbüchel; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Steam reforming of bio-oil was an available low carbon technology to produce biomass-syngas. In this article, a series of catalysts have been prepared; the activity of catalysts was examined in a fluidized bed reactor. In these tests, carbon conversion, the mole fraction of H2, the mole of CO, and the ratio of H2/CO were taken as an index of the catalyst activity and the nickel/modified dolomite catalyst was chosen as the best catalyst for the bio-oil steam reforming to prepare biomass-syngas. The effects of reaction conditions, such as reaction temperature, steam-to-carbon mole ratio (S/C), and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), on catalytic reforming were studied and the results indicated that the optimum conditions were obtained at 700°C, S/C was 14, and WHSV was 0.5 h-1. The mole ratio of H 2/CO was more than 2 and carbon conversion was near 80% at the optimum conditions. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

The drop-in properties of advanced hydrocarbon biofuels pose considerable potential for biofuel supply chains to leverage the existing production and distribution infrastructures of petroleum supply chains, which may lead to significant capital savings. To achieve a higher modeling resolution and improve the overall economic performance, we explicitly model equipment units and material streams in the retrofitted petroleum processes and propose a multi-period planning model to coordinate the various activities in the petroleum refineries. Furthermore, in order to develop an integrated supply chain that is reliable in the dynamic marketplace, we employ a stochastic programming approach to optimize the expectation under a number of scenarios associated with biomass availability, fuel demand, crude oil prices, and technology evolution. The integrated model is formulated as a stochastic mixed-integer linear program, which is illustrated by a case study involving 21 harvesting sites, 7 potential preconversion facilities, 6 potential integrated biorefineries, 2 petroleum refineries, and 39 demand zones. Results show the market share of biofuels increases gradually due to the increasing crude oil price and biomass availability. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The conditions imposed by the renewable energy Directive 2009/28/EC make it mandatory for EU member countries to ensure that by 2020 fossil fuels used in the transport sector contain a 10% component of biofuel. The 10% limit is based on results of experiments conducted by engine manufacturers and researchers in the biofuels domain, which show that this percentage can be used in IC engines without major technical changes to equipment and engine systems. Taking into account that increasing the percentage of biodiesel in blends results in significant reductions of CO2 emissions, an immediate way to surpass the 10% limit is to carry out external and/or internal processes that will act on the physico-chemical properties of those biofuels. This paper presents data and results from experiments examining the process of ultrasonic irradiation of rapeseed oil methyl ester type biodiesel. The results show the effects of the irradiation process on biodiesel physical parameters such as density, kinematic viscosity, speed of sound through the medium, and isentropic bulk modulus. The values of these parameters directly influence the operation, performance and pollutant emissions of diesel engines. Primary results obtained demonstrate the possibilities of using what we call here the B25 blend with low-cost procedures and without major technical intervention in the equipment used to construct diesel engines. Two parameters important for the injection process (kinematic viscosity and density) show equal values for B25Us-irr ultrasonically irradiated for 350 seconds and diesel fuel ultrasonically irradiated for 420 seconds. The range of the achieved NOx pollutant emission reduction was between 18.2% for the ultrasonically irradiated blend B25Us-irr (no load) and 1.4% for the ultrasonically irradiated blend B100Us-irr (100% load), when compared with untreated basic biodiesel. © 2014 Copyright © 2014 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.

AB  - A method is described for quantification of sulfur at low concentrations on the order of mgkg-1 in biodiesel and diesel fuels using isotope dilution and sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ID-SF-ICP-MS). Closed vessel microwave-assisted digestion was employed using a diluted nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide decomposition medium to reduce sample dilution volumes. Medium resolution mode was employed to eliminate isobaric interferences at 32S and 34S related to polyatomic phosphorus and oxygen species, and sulfur hydride species. The method outlined yielded respective limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ) of 0.7mgkg-1 S and 2.5mgkg-1 S (in the sample). The LOD was constrained by instrument background counts at 32S but was sufficient to facilitate value assignment of total S mass fraction in NIST SRM 2723b Sulfur in Diesel Fuel Oil at 9.06±0.13mgkg-1. No statistically significant difference at a 95% confidence level was observed between the measured and certified values for certified reference materials NIST SRM 2773 B100 Biodiesel (Animal-Based), CENAM DRM 272b and NIST SRM 2723a Sulfur in Diesel Fuel Oil, validating method accuracy. © 2013.

AB  - High levels of sodium and potassium can be present in biodiesel fuel and contribute to corrosion, reduced performance and shorter engine lifetime. On the other hand, trace amounts of chromium and vanadium can increase the emission of pollutants during biodiesel combustion. Sample viscosity, immiscibility with aqueous solutions and high carbon content can compromise biodiesel analyzes. In this work, tungsten filaments extracted from microscope light bulbs are used to successively decompose biodiesel's organic matrix, and atomize and excite the analytes to determine sodium, potassium, chromium and vanadium by tungsten coil atomic emission spectrometry (WCAES). No sample preparation other than simple dilution in methanol or ethanol is required. Direct analysis of 10-μL sample aliquots using heating cycles with less than 150s results in limits of detection (LOD) as low as 20, 70, 70 and 90μgkg-1 for Na, K, Cr and V, respectively. The procedure's accuracy is checked by determining Na and K in a biodiesel reference sample and carrying out spike experiments for Cr and V. No statistically significant differences were observed between reference and determined values for all analytes at a 95% confidence level. The procedure was applied to three different biodiesel samples and concentrations between 6.08 and 95.6mgkg-1 for Na and K, and between 0.22 and 0.43mgkg-1 for V were obtained. The procedure is simple, fast and environmentally friendly. Small volumes of reagents, samples and gases are used and no residues are generated. Powers of detection are comparable to other traditional methods. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The demand for transport fuel has been increasing and expectations are that this trend will remain unchanged for the coming decades. Variations in the emissions the of carbon dioxide (CO2) carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HCs) have been computed for various blends of soyabean and mustard oils with petrol at different engine loads in computerised variable compression ratio multi-fuel (CVCRM) engine test rig. It is concluded that out of the two mustard oil blends, 20-PRM shows the lowest Carbon monoxide (CO) emissions (in percentage) at all the engine loads i.e., 2.5 kg, 5 kg and 7.5 kg, where as the blend of 20-PRM shows almost zero Carbon monoxide (CO) emissions at the load of 7.5 kg. The emission of Carbon dioxide (CO2) decreases on increasing the engine load for the blend of 15-PRS while it increases on increasing the engine load for other fuels. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Decisions involving strain selection, biomass to biofuel technology, and the location of cultivation facilities can strongly influence the economic viability of an algae-based biofuel enterprise. We summarize our past results in a new analysis to explore the relative economic impact of these design choices. Our growth model is used to predict average biomass production for two saline strains (Nannochloropsis salina and Arthrospira sp.), one fresh to brackish strain (Chlorella sp., DOE strain 1412), and one freshwater strain (order Sphaeropleales). Biomass to biofuel conversion is compared between lipid extraction and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) technologies. National-scale models of water, CO 2 (as flue gas), land acquisition, site leveling, construction of connecting roads, and transport of HTL oil to existing refineries are used in conjunction with estimates of fuel value (from HTL) to prioritize and select from 88,692 unit farms (UF, 405 ha in pond area), a number sufficient to produce 136E + 9 L year -1 of renewable diesel [36 billion gallons year -1 (BGY)]. Strain selection and choice of conversion technology have large economic impacts, with differences between combinations of strains and biomass to biofuel technologies being up to $10 million year -1 UF -1 . Results based on the most productive strain, HTL-based fuel conversion, and resource costs show that the economic potential between geographic locations within the selection can differ by up to $4 million year -1 UF -1 , with 1.8 BGY of production possible from the most cost-effective sites. The local spatial variability in site rank is extreme, with very high and low sites within 10 kms of each other. Colocation with flue gas sources has a strong influence on rank, but the most costly resource component varies from site to site. The highest rank UFs are located predominantly in Florida and Texas, but most states south of 37°N latitude contain promising locations. © 2014 Venteris, Wigmosta, Coleman and Skaggs.

AB  - Aims: To obtain information on the genetic control of phorbol esters (PE) biosynthesis in J. curcas. A valorization of byproducts after oil extraction could contribute to a significant improvement in the economic sustainability of this new biofuel crop, but its use as animal feed is currently prevented by the presence of toxic PE. Study Design: Direct and reciprocal crosses between toxic and non-toxic genotypes. Place and Duration of Study: Ghana, Mexico and Italy, between 2010-2013. Methodology: Two toxic genotypes from Africa and South America and two non-toxic genotypes from Mexico were used in the study as parental lines. The four genotypes were selected after analysis for complete homozygosis at 5 Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) loci. The toxic genotypes were direct and reciprocal crossed with non-toxic genotypes to obtain six F1 populations and two F2 populations. The hybrid nature of F1 seeds and the genetic segregation of F2 were analysed with SSR markers. Parental, F1 and F2 seeds were individually analyzed for the whole PE content in the kernel. Results: The set of markers has allowed the true hybrid nature to be confirmed for all crosses between toxic and non-toxic genotypes because the individuals were heterozygous at all loci. In the direct crosses between a toxic seed-bearing plant with a non-toxic pollinator all F1 seeds were toxic. Conversely, in the corresponding reciprocal crosses, all the seeds were non-toxic. These results show that in each case PE content in F1 seeds of J. curcas depends on the maternal phenotype and F2 seeds did not segregate for toxicity as expected for a trait under maternal control. Conclusion: The results of this work pointed out a maternal effect on the synthesis of the PE in the seeds of J. curcas and probably the tegument, tissue of maternal origin, contributes most to the PE content. © 2014 Vischi et al.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable energy source produced from natural oils and fats, and is being used as a substitute for petroleum diesel. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of using spent coffee grounds for biodiesel production and its by-products to produce pelletized fuel, which is expected to help the biodiesel production process achieve zero waste. For this experiment, spent coffee grounds sample was collected from Kaldis coffee, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Extraction of the spent coffee grounds oil was then conducted using n-hexane, ether and mixture of isopropanol to hexane ratio (50:50 %vol), and resulted in oil yield of 15.6, 17.5 and 21.5 %w/w respectively. A two-step process was used in biodiesel production with conversion of about 82 %w/w. The biodiesel quality parameters were evaluated using the American Standard for Testing Material (ASTM D 6751). The major fatty acid compositions found by Gas chromatography were linoleic acid (37.6%), palmitic acid (39.8%), oleic (11.7%), and stearic acid (8.6%). In addition, solid waste remaining after oil extraction and glycerin ratio (glycerin content from 20-40%) was evaluated for fuel pellet (19.3-21.6 MJ/Kg) applications. Therefore, the results of this work could offer a new perspective to the production of biofuel from waste materials without growing plants and/or converting food to fuel. © 2014 BRTeam.

AB  - Biofuels have increased in popularity because of rising oil prices and the need for energy security. However, finding new raw sources for biodiesel production is still challenging. The oil which comes from wastewater effluent generated in edible oil mills (EOM) can be considered a low-cost, widely available, emerging and interesting source for biodiesel production. This study tries to improve the coalescing filtration by using electrospun nanofibrous filters for oil recovery from the EOM effluent. In order to improve the separation efficiency of the filters, thermal treatments (90°C to 150°C) were used. Results indicate that oil recovery using coalescing filtration is a promising method for providing a new source for making biodiesel production more economical. © 2014 BRTeam.

Endophytes isolated from oleaginous plants possibly have the capacity to accumulate lipids similar to the hosts. However, little work has been reported in terms of endophytic bacteria isolation from oleaginous plants and their lipid production using lignocellulosic hydrolysate as substrate. Results: A new oleaginous endophyte HB1310 has been isolated from the thin-shelled walnut, and identified as Bacillus subtilis on the basis of both 16S rDNA gene sequencing and examination of its physiological and biochemical properties. This strain effectively accumulates cellular lipids using cotton stalk hydrolysate as a substrate. The optimum C/N ratio, culture temperature, and pH value were determined to be 50/1, 30°C, and 6.5, respectively. Batch fermentation was conducted in a bioreactor using these parameters. Satisfactory production, with a maximum lipid productivity of 2.3 g/L, lipid content of 39.8% (w/w), and cell dry weight (CDW) of 5.7 g/L, was obtained at a culture time of 48 h. Variations in the fluorescent intensity and lipid inclusion formation of cells collected at different sampling times illustrate the potential of this bacterium to be useful for cellular lipid production. The fatty acid profile of the produced bacterial lipids showed that the major constituents are myristic, palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acids with an estimated cetane number of about 61.8, indicating that this strain may be suitable for biodiesel production. Conclusions: The present investigation is the first report of an oleaginous endophytic bacterium isolated from the thin-shelled walnut. This strain is capable of producing high lipid contents rapidly using cotton stalk hydrolysate as a substrate, and its lipids are suitable for use as the feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2014 Zhang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The interest in using crude glycerol in animal feeding has reemerged due to its increasing availability and favorable price resulting from the expansion of biofuel industry. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of substituting corn for crude glycerol at different levels in the diet on ruminal fermentation using in-vitro true digestibility parameters. The experimental treatments consisted of substituting corn for liquid crude glycerol (0; 4; 8 and 12%) in dry matter basis. Diets consisted of 60% alfalfa hay and 40% corn and glycerol substituted the corn in the diet. In addition to the 48 hours traditionally applied in digestibility assays, different in-vitro digestibility times were used (0; 4; 8; 16; 48, 72 and 96 hours) in order to study digestion kinetics. The dietary corn substitution for increasing crude glycerol levels did not affect ammonia nitrogen content, metabolizable energy content, in-vitro digestibility of organic matter and neutral detergent fiber, nor ruminal degradation parameters. However this byproduct of biodiesel production may be tested in-vivo as an alternative energy feedstuff in ruminant diets.

AB  - Petroleum is highly affecting the economic development of developing countries. This study was undertaken because of the economic impact of petroleum in Ethiopia and is a model for developing countries. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of petroleum on the economy of the country and the prospect of biofuel to solve this adverse problem. National expense of petroleum was analyzed by using data collected from Ethiopian National Bank and Petroleum Enterprise. In 2007/08 fiscal year, the amount of petroleum imported showed 16% increase from the previous year while in the same period expenditure on petroleum was increased by 71%. This was due to the sharp increase in the price of petroleum in the international market. Thus in the last seven years, the cost of petroleum import was increased almost exponentially. From 2000/01 to 2009/10, the volume and value of diesel imported was grown exponentially. To lower the economic impact of petroleum, it is important to invest an alternative energy sources as substitutes and it can also address environmental problems on the other hand. The biofuels have economic significant to generate income for farmers and also creates job opportunity for the society thereby contributes a lot for economic development of the developing countries. This finding may provide basic knowledge of the role biofuel for petroleum substitute and thereby provides inputs to policy-makers, entrepreneurs, researchers, industrial actors and the society as a whole, thereby to facilitate biofuel production from the available resources. © IDOSI Publications, 2014.

AB  - Agriculture and forestry face the future challenge of finding climate-friendly and regenerative methods of powering their field and forest machinery. Alternative fuel and drive concepts have been presented by industry in the past but, so far, these have been unable to establish themselves against the dominating diesel-fuelled internal combustion engine. Such concepts include internal combustion engines and the fuels fatty acid methyl ester "biodiesel", rapeseed oil/vegetable oil fuel, "HVO" hydrogenated vegetable oils and biomethane, but also electrical drive with energy supply via fuel cells with hydrogen or using accumulators. The alternatives were discussed and evaluated according to 14 criteria in a technical discussion with experts from industry, associations and scientific institutions. Currently, the use of rapeseed oil fuel and biodiesel in internal combustion engines for agricultural and forestry work machinery is most advantageous for more climate protection and resource saving and is simultaneously rapidly applicable.

AB  - Algae have a great potential source of biofuels and also have unique importance to reduce gaseous emissions, greenhouse gases, climatic changes, global warming receding of glaciers, rising sea levels and loss of biodiversity. The microalgae, like Scenedesmus obliquus, Neochloris oleabundans, Nannochloropsis sp., Chlorella emersonii, and Dunaliella tertiolecta have high oil content. Among the known algae, Scenedesmus obliquus is one of the most potential sources for biodiesel as it has adequate fatty acid (linolenic acid) and other polyunsaturated fatty acids. Bio-ethanol is already in the market of United States of America and Europe as an additive in gasoline. Bio-hydrogen is the cleanest biofuel and extensive efforts are going on to bring it to market at economical price. This review highlights recent development and progress in the fi eld of algae as a potential source of biofuel. © 2014.

AB  - A bio-diesel is growing in popularity as a renewable fuel in dealing with increasing fuel effi ciency demands and emission restrictions. The combustion and injection characteristics of a 186 FA diesel engine were analyzed in blends with diff erent proportions of bio-diesel at both full and 50% load through a combination of numerical simulation and experimental study. The heat release rates and the main parameters of cyclic variations were compared and analyzed. The development of fuel concentration and temperature fi eld as well as the injection characteristics were simulated. It is shown that, with a blended bio-diesel, the values of indicated mean eff ective pressure, cylinder peak pressure, and other parameters of the combustion cycle variability were decreased, whereas the spray penetration distance and combustion duration had an increasing trend. © 2014 by Begell House, Inc.

AB  - A total of 20 different algal isolates were isolated from stagnant water samples collected from different districts of Punjab, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh. On the basis of morphological characterization, these algal isolates were tentatively identified as Chlorella, Oedogonium, Aphanocapsa, Phormidium, Spirogyra, Anabeana, Scenedesmus, Tolypothrix, Anacystis, Microcystis, Volvox and Spirulina. Data analysis revealed that the isolate JA8 had highest growth rate after 15 days of incubation. Increase in pH of the medium was recorded with the growth of algal isolates after 15 days of incubation and the highest increase in pH was recorded in JA18 (10.6).Supplementation of urea to the growth medium resulted in less fluctuation of pH of the medium. The isolate JA11 showed highest dry biomassweight(7.211 g/1)after one month of incubation. All the 20 isolates,were screened for their lipid content and the highest lipid content was recorded in the isolate JA8 (5.60 %). An increase in lipid content in the isolate JA8 (5.60 % to 7.52 %) and JA9 (5.25% to 7.11) was observed with the addition of glucose (10 g/1) to the growth medium. The highest saponification (169.69 mg/g of oil) and acid value (4.75 mg/g of oil) was shown by the isolate JA8. The fatty acid composition of three algal isolates JA8, JA9 and JA15 was determined with Gas liquid Chromatography analysis which indicated that the lipid fraction mainly comprises ofstearic acid, pentadecanoic acid, oleic acid and saturated fatty acids. Hence, the results revealed that the isolate JA8 may be considered best among the isolates.However, this lipid content is very low to use this isolate for biofuel production. So, there is need to explore the possibility of isolating another algae with high lipid content. © EM International.

AB  - In the present investigation, neem and mahua methyl ester were prepared by transesterification using potassium hydroxide as a catalyst and tested in 4-stroke single cylinder water cooled diesel engine. Tests were carried out at constant speed of 1500 rev/min at different brake mean effective pressures. A series of tests were conducted which worked at different brake mean effective pressures, OkPa, 1kPa, 2kPa, 3kPa, 4kPa, 5kPa, 6kPa and 6.5kPa. The performance and exhaust emission characteristics of the diesel engine were analyzed and compared with diesel fuel. Results showed that BTE of NME was comparable with diesel and it was noted that the BTE of N0100 is 63.11% higher than that of diesel at part load whereas it reduces 11.2% with diesel fuel at full load. In case of full load, NME showed decreasing trend with diesel fuel. BTE of diesel was 15.37% and 36.89% at part load and full load respectively. The observation indicated that BTE for MME 100 was slightly higher than diesel at part loads. The specific fuel consumption (SFC) was more for almost all blends at all loads, compared to diesel. At part load, the EGT of MME and its blends were showing similar trend to diesel fuel and at full load, the exhaust gas temperature of MME and blends were higher than diesel. Based on this study, NME could be a substitute for diesel fuel in diesel engine.

AB  - Castor (Ricinus communis L.) has been transformed from a wasteland colonizer to an important industrial oilseed crop. Its seed oil is one of the most sought-after vegetable oils because of its rich properties and variety of end-users. Castor is an ancient crop but its production now has been limited mainly to India, China and Brazil, for many reasons. Castor oil is a hot market commodity product. It has been recently recognized as an efficient feedstock for biodiesel production. Increasing demand world over for biofuel resources and many recently identified industrial uses of castor oil have escalated castor oil demand. Global demand for castor oil is rising constantly at 3-5% per annum. In the last decade, many countries have started making serious exploratory efforts at growing castor as there is a tremendous scope to establish castor as a supplementary crop production option to farmers and to provide significant returns on investment given high global demand for castor oil. In view of the increasing worldwide interest in castor oil, this review evaluates the global scenario of castor cultivation, exports and imports of castor oil, new interests in castor oil and genetic improvement in productivity. In addition, the current research challenges and priorities have been discussed in the review. © CAB International 2014.

AB  - Microalgae harvesting is a labor- and energy-intensive process and new approaches to harvesting microalgae need to be developed in order to decrease the costs. In this study; co-cultivatation of filamentous fungus (Aspergillus niger) and microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris) to form cell pellets was evaluated under different conditions, including organic carbon source (glucose; glycerol; and sodium acetate) concentration; initial concentration of fungal spores and microalgal cells and light. Results showed that 2 g/L of glucose with a 1:300 ratio of fungi to microalgae provided the best culturing conditions for the process to reach >90% of cell harvest efficiency. The results also showed that an organic carbon source was required to sustain the growth of fungi and form the cell pellets. The microalgae/fungi co-cultures at mixotrophic conditions obtained much higher total biomass than pure cultures of each individual strains; indicating the symbiotic relationship between two strains. This can benefit the microbial biofuel production in terms of cell harvest and biomass production. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - The present study was carried out in open private commercial field in El-Behira Governorate, Egypt (30″54′34, 87″N and 30″ 42′ 33, 78″ E) during the period from 15 February 2013 to 26 April 2013. The study deals with the effect of seven different concentrations of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) (control zero, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 and 3000 ppm) for 12 h and three types of planting media (sand, sand: peat moss l:l(v/v) and peat moss) on root performance of Jatropha curcas L. and Euphorbia tirucalli cuttings. Data were collected ten weeks after planting the cuttings. Three experiments were conducted where in Experiment 1: Cuttings were taken from two years old of Jatropha curcas L. terminal branches 6-8 cm length treated with IBA at different concentration showed the rooting behavior in the order: 1500 ppm>1000 ppm>3000 ppm>2500 ppm >2000 ppm>500 ppm> control. In case of propagation 1500 ppm IBA treatment was found to be the best (6.8 roots/cutting, 1.32 cm root length, 71.1 rooting percentage, 3.1 g fresh weight, 1.5 leaves/cutting, 2.4 cm length of the longest leaf and 38 days to sprout). In Experiment 2: Cuttings were taken from four years old of Jatropha curcas L. terminal branches 15-17 cm length treated with IBA at different concentration showed the rooting behavior in the order: 2500 ppm >3000 ppm >2000 ppm>1500 ppm>500 ppm>1000 ppm>control. In case of propagation 2500 ppm IBA treatment was found to be the best for (8.3 roots/cutting, 5.6 cm root length, 68.8 rooting percentage, 14.8 g fresh weight, 3.1 leaves/cutting, 4.6 cm length of the longest leaf and 50 days to sprout). In Experiment 3: Cuttings were taken from terminal branches of Euphorbia tirucalli 20-22 cm length treated with IBA at different concentration showed the rooting behavior in the order: 2500 ppm>1500 ppm>2000 ppm>3000 ppm>1000 ppm>500 ppm>control. In case of propagation 2500 ppm IBA treatment was found to be the best for (8.2 roots/cutting, 11.8 cm root length, 73.3 rooting percentage, 5.2 g fresh weight, 7.7 leaves /cutting and 46 days to sprout). The types of planting media treatment showed the rooting behavior in order: Sand>sand: Peat moss 1:1 (v/v)>peat moss for both cuttings of Jatropha curcas and Euphorbia tirucalli in all three experiment. © 2014 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

AB  - Diesel engine rules the transportation world due its performance and better economy standard and compared to its competitor. It leads to depletion of diesel fuel and arise of alternative fuel. Extensive researches have been carried out to bring out various biodiesel from different feedstock. From one among those this paper deals with biodiesel obtained from Adelfa. Adelfa oil methyl esters(AOME) were prepared using transesterification process and tests had been carried out in direct injection single cylinder diesel engine with their blends viz., AOME 10, AOME 20, AOME 30, AOME 40, AOME 100. The performance tests results shown higher brake thermal efficiency of AOME 10 is higher compared to all other blends. Various emissions such as unburnt hydro carbon (UBHC), carbon monoxide (CO), Carbon dioxide (CO2), Oxides of nitrogen (NOX) and smoke were studied. The results shown reduced UBHC, CO and smoke emissions for all blends of Adelfa biodiesel compared to conventional diesel. Based on the study, Adelfa biodiesel enact well closer to conventional diesel on the source of experimental investigation.

AB  - Most of the biodiesel produced today is made the base catalyzed reaction due to high conversion and no intermediate product during reaction. The experiments were carried out using methanol and two alkali catalysts i.e., Sodium hydroxide and Potassium hydroxide to transesterification of rapeseed oil were carried out for the production of biodiesel. The effect of catalyst concentration, methanol oil ratio, temperature, reaction time and stirring rate on the yield and quality of biodiesel was studied. The result of the study suggested that 0.6 % sodium hydroxide and 0.8 % potassium hydroxide catalyst concentration, 6:1 methanol oil ratio, 60 °C reaction temperature, 30 min reaction time and 300 rpm stirring rate were optimum for biodiesel production from rapeseed oil.

AB  - Due to widely depletion of fossil fuel, environment threat, and non-renewable energy resources led to a significant effort to develop and propose alternative transportation fuels. India has enormous potential for production of biofuels like Biodiesel that can be derived from various vegetable oils. It is oxygenated, sulphur-free, renewable fuel and biodegradable can be utilized in conventional diesel engines without major modification. The use of biodiesel as a fuel in conventional diesel engines causes high smoke emission and low thermal efficiency due to their more viscosity compared to neat diesel. Various methods are used to encounter this problems. Some of these methods are fuel blending and Acetylene enriched air on improve fuel economy and reduction of exhaust emission in diesel engine. In this work, Tamanu methyl ester (TME) and its 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20% blends (volume basis) with diesel were used as an alternative fuel in diesel engine. The performance and emissions characteristics were investigated and compared with neat diesel. The experimental results exhibit that TME in single fuel mode low performance and high smoke emission compared to diesel. Dual fuel mode with Acetylene enriched air further decreased the emission of CO, HC, and smoke with TME diesel blends as primary fuel at all outputs. With acetylene enriched air, due to high burning rates, NOx level significantly increased. It is concluded that acetylene enriched air can significantly improve performance of TME blends with a small penalty on NOx level.

AB  - Cashew nut shell (CNS) is the byproduct obtained from cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) processing industries and it is a soft honey comb structure containing a dark brown liquid known as Cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL). CNSL mainly consists of Anacardic acid, cardol, cardanol and small amount of other phenols and less polar substances. The composition percentage varies with many parameters like, nature of origin, climatic condition, method of extraction, etc. In this article, method of processing of CNS, yielding percentage of CNSL, variation in their composition with respect to type of processing, use of different constituents and their separation are listed. In addition to that, methods for separation of cardanol (a major constituent of technical CNSL) from oil, and feasibility of its use in diesel engine as a biofuel were discussed along with the physiochemical properties. Presence of long carbon linear chain gives excellent solubility in diesel. The calorific value of cardanol is high and is closer to diesel. The corrosiveness of it also very mild due to nature of phenolic compounds present in it. Higher viscosity is the only drawback of every vegetable oil and this can be lowered while blending with diesel and ethanol if necessary. From these studies, the cardanol have the properties much closer to the conventional diesel and which can be used as a biofuel in addition with diesel fuel.

AB  - Among the most attractive alternate energy source for fossil fuel is biodiesel. The potential use of Raphanus sativus oil for the production of biodiesel was investigated. Fatty acid profile of the Raphanus sativus oil was determined by using Gas chromatography (GC). Methyl ester production by transesterification of Raphanus sativus oil and the process parameter optimization was done to increases the yield percentage. The four important process parameters that influence the transesterification process are alcohol to oil molar ratio, catalyst concentration, temperature, reaction time. The yield percentage of Raphanus sativus methyl ester increases up to 94.5% at the optimized parameter values of alcohol to oil molar ratio, catalyst concentration, temperature, reaction time are 9:1, 1% wt, 50°C, 30 min respectively. Methyl ester blended with diesel at various proportions like B0, B20, B40, B60, B100 to analyse the performance of the diesel engine. The result shows that B20 blend gives the performance nearer to the diesel fuel. It was found that the emission level of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon level were reduces with increase in the blend ratio.

AB  - The production of biofuels (e.g., ethanol and biodiesel) requires a significant amount of water during feedstock production, transportation, and its conversion into biofuels. Therefore present study devoted to study the impact of biofuel production on water demand in Alberta. In scenario # 1, it is assumed that ethanol is produced from both wheat and wheat straw and that biodiesel is produced from rapeseed. Scenario #2 proposes ethanol production from wheat only and biodiesel production from rapeseed. The water requirements for biofuel production in both scenarios are calculated for Alberta for the year 2025. Data on the current availability of water in Alberta indicate that the Athabasca, North Saskatchewan, and Peace River basins of northern Alberta have enough water to grow crops for the production of biofuels. In 2025, Alberta will have to produce 3,754 million liters of ethanol and 270 million liters of biodiesel to meet the projected levels. If biofuels are produced from the crops grown in the abovementioned northern river basins, the province of Alberta should be able to meet biofuel demand in 2025 sustainably. The water requirement from these river basins for biofuel production will increase to 5.2%, 0.6%, and 11.6%, respectively, of the natural flow in scenario # 1 whereas, for scenario #2, the water requirement from these rivers basins will increase to 5.2%, 2.3%, and 16.1%, respectively, of natural flow. These increases in the requirements are much lower than the possible allowed withdrawal levels.

AB  - Background: The production of biofuels from renewable energy sources is one of the most important issues in industrial biotechnology today. The process is known to generate various by-products, for example crude glycerol, which is obtained in the making of biodiesel from rapeseed oil. Crude glycerol may be utilized in many ways, including microbial conversion to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD), a raw material for the synthesis of polyesters and polyurethanes.Results: The paper presents results of a study on the synthesis of 1,3-propanediol from crude glycerol by a repeated batch method with the use of Clostridium butyricum DSP1. Three cycles of fermentation medium replacement were carried out. The final concentration of 1,3-PD was 62 g/L and the maximum productivity, obtained during the second cycle, reached 1.68 g/L/h. Additionally, experiments conducted in parallel to the above involved using the entire quantity of the culture broth removed from the bioreactor to inoculate successive portions of fermentation media containing crude glycerol at concentrations of 80 g/L and 100 g/L. Under those conditions, the maximum 1,3-PD concentrations were 43.2 g/L and 54.2 g/L.Conclusions: The experiments proved that by using a portion of metabolically active biomass as inoculum for another fermentation formula it is possible to eliminate the stage of inoculum growth and thereby reduce the length of the whole operation. Additionally, that strategy avoids the phase of microbial adaptation to a different source of carbon such as crude glycerol, which is more difficult to utilize, thus improving the kinetic parameters of 1,3-PD production. © 2014 Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso.

AB  - Available estimates of the land use changes and greenhouse gas emissions of biofuels differ significantly across economic models. This paper focuses on the impacts of price-induced yield assumptions on U.S. corn ethanol results. These assumptions have dramatic impacts within the FAPRI modeling framework, but limited ones within the GTAP-BIO model. I show that these sensitivity to yield assumption results are not comparable because the ex ante land and production elasticities assumed in these two models are not comparable. The analysis reveals that the current focus solely on the value of the price-induced yield elasticity can be misleading. © 2014 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.

AB  - Bio-oil derived from biomass through fast pyrolysis process has the potential to displace a significant amount of petroleum fuels. However, the use of bio-oil in a diesel engine is very limited because of its poor properties, e.g., its low energy density, low cetane number, and high viscosity. Therefore, bio-oil should be emulsified or blended with other fuels that have high centane numbers. Because bio-oil has poor miscibility with petroleum fuels, the most suitable candidate fuels for direct mixing are alcohol fuels. In this study, bio-oil was blended with ethanol, and two types of cetane improvers were added to a blended fuel to improve the self-ignition property. The two types of cetane improvers, PEG 400 and 2-EHN, made it possible for bio-oil blended fuels to combust in a diesel engine with a maximum bio-oil content of 15 wt%. A high-compression-ratio piston is also proposed for the combustion of bio-oil in a diesel engine. © 2014 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - Biodiesel, an alternative and renewable fuel for diesel engines, consists of alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids, more commonly methyl esters and is typically made from nontoxic, biological resources such as edible and non-edible vegetable oils, animal fats, waste cooking oils and oil from algae by transesterification with methanol. Despite many processes of biodiesel production, transesterification method is successfully employed to reduce the high viscosity of triglycerides and improve other characteristics of biodiesel fuel. Biodiesel has been chosen as one of the interesting alternative fuels and has been receiving a lot of attention throughout the world as it is renewable, biodegradable, non-toxic and environmentfriendly fuel. Currently, it is economically not feasible to use food-grade vegetable oils to produce biodiesel because of the food shortage and day to day increase in feedstocks price. Much attention has been devoted to the application of low cost non-conventional and nonedible feedstocks from the wild plants to produce biodiesel. Plants bearing non-edible seeds have the potentials of reclaiming wasteland and do not compete with food crops and utilization of these non-conventional and non-edible feedstocks can be sustainable for biodiesel production. This paper is an attempt to review on production, fuel properties and blending effect of biodiesel from yellow oleander (Thevetia peruviana) seed oil, a non-edible feedstock having 60–65% oil content. © 2015, International Journal of ChemTech Research.

AB  - This paper deals with the performance and emission analysis of a multicylinder diesel engine using biodiesel along with an in-depth analysis of the engine heat losses in different subsystems followed by the energy balance of all the energy flows from the engine. Energy balance analysis allows the designer to appraise the internal energy variations of a thermodynamic system as a function of ''energy flows'' across the control volume as work or heat and also the enthalpies associated with the energy flows which are passing through these boundaries. Palm and coconut are the two most potential biodiesel feed stocks in this part of the world. The investigation was conducted in a four-cylinder diesel engine fuelled with 10% and 20% blends of palm and coconut biodiesels and compared with B5 at full load condition and in the speed range of 1000 to 4000 RPM. Among the all tested blends, palm blends seemed more promising in terms of engine performance, emission, and heat losses. The influence of heat losses on engine performance and emission has been discussed thoroughly in this paper. © 2014 M. J. Abedin et al.

AB  - Current study presents RSM based optimized production of biodiesel from palm oil using chemical and enzymatic transesterification. The emission behavior of biodiesel and its blends, namely, POB-5, POB-20, POB-40, POB-50, POB-80, and POB-100 was examined using diesel engine (equipped with tube well). Optimized palm oil fatty acid methyl esters (POFAMEs) yields were depicted to be 47.6±1.5, 92.7±2.5, and 95.4±2.0% for chemical transesterification catalyzed by NaOH, KOH, and NaOCH3, respectively, whereas for enzymatic transesterification reactions catalyzed by NOVOZYME-435 and A. n. lipase optimized biodiesel yields were 94.2±3.1 and 62.8±2.4%, respectively. Distinct decrease in particulate matter (PM) and carbon monoxide (CO) levels was experienced in exhaust emissions from engine operating on biodiesel blends POB-5, POB-20, POB-40, POB-50, POB-80, and POB-100 comparative to conventional petroleum diesel. Percentage change in CO and PM emissions for different biodiesel blends ranged from -2.1 to -68.7% and -6.2 to -58.4%, respectively, relative to conventional diesel, whereas an irregular trend was observed for NOx emissions. Only POB-5 and POB-20 showed notable reductions, whereas all other blends (POB-40 to POB-100) showed slight increase in NOx emission levels from 2.6 to 5.5% comparative to petroleum diesel. © 2014 Muhammad Waseem Mumtaz et al.

AB  - Introduction. Biofuel market in Ukraine is just beginning to be formed. There are several reasons for its slow development. First of all, weak environmental consciousness of consumers, absences of governmental support, as far as worldwide production of biofuels is usually subsidized at state level. Also, a huge problem is that the greater half of the raw materials, which could produce biomass fuels, which aims to export to Europe for their own needs. Purpose of the article: analyze the current state of the formation of domestic biofuel market and suggest approaches to further development. Result. Production and use of biofuels in Ukraine's agriculture would create more jobs, especially increase employment of rural population. The undeniable value of biodiesel is in its environmental friendliness and capabilities obtained from renewable raw materials. Other benefits of it are non-problem sales, steadily higher prices, and stable demand from foreign buyers. Now the theme of biodiesel powerfully heard in Western European countries. Now in Ukraine there isn't a plant which may be characterized by the European level of the biofuels production. Aborted foundation of raw materials and absence of guarantees for a stable supply of raw materials obviously block the development of such plants construction projects, in particular, the participation of foreign corporations. Another perspective direction of biofuels using is production and sale of bioethanol fuel. It is planned that by 2020 the share of biofuels using will be 20% of total fuel consumption in Ukraine. Taking into account very slow and declarative development of domestic biofuels market, these plans are, unfortunately, not feasible. Development of the biofuels market in Ukraine is possible under the following conditions: harmonization of Ukraine's legislation on biofuels with EU legislation; strategy of developed biofuels market in Ukraine implementation; the optimal variant for manufacture biofuels based on territorial and commodity factor determining; introduction programs and promote using biofuels in transport; software exports of biofuels; the introduction of financial incentives, investment and innovation supports in the biofuels production; production of biodiesel for own usage in agriculture; the tax incentives introduction in the biofuels production for own usage; consumption of biofuels, produced in Ukraine, stimulation. Conclusions. Thus, at this stage, most relevant tasks for the market development of biofuels in Ukraine are seen as follows: an increase in rape crops, development of technologies for its cultivation, agro-technical modernization, the maximum power output, development and implementation of the regulatory framework, harmonized with the EU legislation. At the same time, there is a need to conduct economic researches and calculations concerning the industry's development in future. In any case, we must strive that increasing economic efficiency of business becomes the result of change and transformation in the fuels market.

AB  - Analytical techniques are vital for the development of new added-value materials and products from biomass, such as liquid biofuels, by evaluating the quality and chemical composition of the raw materials and all materials and byproducts in the production process. This also enables the evaluation and implementation of environmental laws and better understanding of the economics of new biomass processes. Different analytical techniques are applied to different biomass feedstocks, such as sugarcane, soybean, corn, forests, pulp and paper, waste and agricultural residues, dependent on the final end biofuel product. This chapter highlights how the use of analytical chemistry can be used as a tool to ensure quality and sustainability of the biomass and liquid biofuels, with, some aspects of green analysis also considered. © Springer-Verlag London 2014.

AB  - Although biofuels have the potential to supplement conventional petroleum fuels in a variety of energy applications, and as transport fuels in particular, their use also poses some problems from an environmental perspective. Concerns exist relating to whether positive net energy (and therefore effective greenhouse gas mitigation) can be derived from biofuels, whether the cultivation of biofuel feedstocks leads to significant environmental degradation and whether their use could hamper the implementation of a more long-term transport energy paradigm. Yet a clear understanding of these issues, together with the more important technical aspects relating to biomass cultivation and biofuel production, has the potential to ensure that biofuels can play a successful role in weaning the planet off its current carbon dependency. In particular, the ability to assess the total life cycle of biofuels from cradle to grave emerges as a particularly important consideration in ensuring that cultivation and production processes are optimized. © Springer-Verlag London 2014.

AB  - The current taxation benefits for biofuels are only temporary. Therefore, biofuel production costs need to be able to compete with those of conventional fuels in order to gain market share in the future. However, highly complex influencing factors make a comparison of biofuel production costs with those of fossil fuels challenging. This chapter has three major goals: (1) a projection of future feedstock prices for biofuels based on the development of the price for crude oil, (2) a simulation of the effects of likely economies of scale from scaling-up production size and technological learning on production costs and (3) a scenario analysis comparing different biofuels and fossil fuels. European biofuel production costs for 2015 as well as 2020 are projected based on a calculation model for biofuel production. Our scenarios assume prices for crude oil between Euro 50 and Euro 200 per barrel for both reference years. Our results indicate that mid- to long-term, second-generation biofuels are very likely to achieve competitive production costs, if technological learning and economies of scale are factored in. Bioethanol made from lignocellulosic biomass and biodiesel from waste oil promise the highest cost-saving potential in all crude price scenarios and are capable of outperforming fossil fuels and first-generation biofuels in the future. © Springer-Verlag London 2014.

AB  - A full realization of alternative energy such as biofuels depends on the existence of a viable supply chain (SC) network. An agent-based simulation approach is pursued to understand the dynamics of the biofuels SC network. The interests of three SC actors are represented: users, biorefineries, and farmers. Each actor type has a binary decision option: adoption or non-adoption of biofuels. This SC network model is characterized by distributed control, time asynchrony, and resource contention among actors, who make decisions based on incomplete knowledge and delayed information. The decision dynamics of these actors are modeled using a computational ecosystem construct. A preliminary set of coupled payoff function for each actor type and each decision is developed to represent interdependencies among SC actors. The simulation model was used to evaluate three archetypes of subsidy policy. The SC network behavior is observed in terms of fraction of actors adopting the biofuel option. The SC network shows behaviors ranging from fixed point equilibrium under no delay and perfect knowledge to periodic and chaotic oscillations. The network behavior is very sensitive to the time delay parameter that partly influences the quality of information on which actors’ decisions are based. Several regions of SC behavior are identified. In particular, a chaotic behavior was observed. The work provides a methodological basis for further development, including identification of policies to control undesirable system behaviors. © 2014, The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.

AB  - This paper presents a comparative analysis of the diesel engine performance and emission characteristics, when operating on diesel fuel and various diesel-biodiesel (B10, B20, B40, B60) blends, at various loads and engine speeds. The experimental tests were performed on a four-stroke, four-cylinder, direct injection, naturally aspirated, 60 kW diesel engine D-243. The in-cylinder pressure data was analysed to determine the ignition delay, the Heat Release Rate (HRR), maximum in-cylinder pressure and maximum pressure gradients. The influence of diesel-biodiesel blends on the Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (bsfc) and exhaust emissions was also investigated. The bench test results showed that when the engine running on blends B60 at full engine load and rated speed, the autoignition delay was 13.5% longer, in comparison with mineral diesel. Maximum cylinder pressure decreased about 1-2% when the amount of Rapeseed Methyl Ester (RME) expanded in the diesel fuel when operating at full load and 1400 min-1 speed. At rated mode, the minimum bsfc increased, when operating on biofuel blends compared to mineral diesel. The maximum brake thermal efficiency sustained at the levels from 0.3% to 6.5% lower in comparison with mineral diesel operating at full (100%) load. When the engine was running at maximum torque mode using diesel - RME fuel blends B10, B20, B40 and B60 the total emissions of nitrogen oxides decreased. At full and moderate load, the emission of carbon monoxide significantly raised as the amount of RME in fuel increased. Copyright © 2014 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.

AB  - Fuels are continuing to be derived from fossil sources, but as production technology improves, biofuels and synthetic fuels are expected to emerge as scalable long-term sources of liquid fuels. Efforts are being made to ensure that this next-generation of fuels is cleaner burning than the last. In order to inform the production and processing of cleaner burning fuels, more needs to be known about how molecular structure influences the formation of pollutant emissions. Reducing airborne quantities of particulate matter (PM) is of particular interest for human health and the environment. This publication presents a 13C labelling technique, which has been developed and applied to identify the influence of local molecular structure on the formation of PM. The paper applied the technique based on the 13C stable isotope to trace the conversion of individual carbon atoms to PM in the case of several oxygenated and hydrocarbon molecules. A laminar tube reactor facility has been used for generating and collecting samples of PM under pyrolysis conditions. A number of single-component oxygenated and hydrocarbons (ethanol, propanol, pentanol, cyclopentanol, ethyl acetate, and toluene) have been enriched with 13C at specific carbon atom locations and the 13C/12C isotope ratios of PM were measured. The contribution to PM of particular carbon atoms within a molecule was evaluated, and the results shed new light of how individual carbon atoms in a molecule convert to PM. It was found that the conversion to PM of different atoms within a molecule varies widely, depending on the identity of their neighbouring moiety. Furthermore, it was shown that oxygen-containing functional groups have a significant influence on the formation of particulates, partly through a reduction in the conversion to PM of carbon atoms, which are adjacent to oxygen atoms. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - In this study, we demonstrate that while the energy density and lubricity of the C15 and C16 products of furan condensation of biomass-derived aldehydes with 2-methylfuran are consistent with requirements for diesel, these products do not meet specifications for cetane number and pour point due to their aromatic furan rings. However, a novel class of products that fully meet or exceed most specifications for diesel can be produced by converting the furan rings in these compounds to cyclic ether moieties. Full hydrodeoxygenation of furan condensation products to alkanes would require 55-60% higher hydrogen demand, starting from biomass, compared to the products of furan ring saturation, providing an additional incentive to support the saturated products. We also report here on a tunable class of catalysts that contain Pd nanoparticles supported on ionic liquid-modified SiO2 that can achieve complete saturation of the furan rings in yields of 95% without opening these rings. Furans to fuels: Production of diesel fuels from lignocellulosic feedstocks has largely relied on hydrodeoxygenation of oxygenates to alkanes. However, the products of selective ring saturation have been demonstrated herein to provide diesel additives of exceptional quality with minimal H2 input. Further, a new class of heterogeneous palladium catalysts with tunable surface properties achieves excellent yields to cyclic ethers without hydrogenolysis. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The effect of the rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) component in diesel fuel was assessed. Dynamic viscosity and density of blends were particularly observed. Measurements were performed at standard constant temperature. Increasing ratio of RME in diesel fuel was reflected in increased density value and dynamic viscosity of the blend. In the case of pure RME, pure diesel fuel, and the blend of both, temperature dependence of dynamic viscosity and density was examined. Considerable temperature dependence of dynamic viscosity and density was found out and demonstrated for all three samples. This finding is in accordance with theoretical assumptions and literature data sources. Mathematical models were developed and tested. Temperature dependence of dynamic viscosity was modelled using the 3rd degree polynomial. Temperature dependence of density was modelled using the 2nd degree polynomial. The proposed models can be used for flow behaviour prediction of RME, diesel fuel, and their blends. © 2014, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper investigates the impact of CAFE standards and alternative-fuel vehicle production incentives on the biofuel market and mandate, in particular. The study develops a structural model of the domestic light-duty vehicle sector, as well as reduced-form versions of domestic gasoline, diesel, and biofuel markets. The results suggest that holding CAFE standards at the 2010 level could facilitate U.S. ethanol market expansion, making it easier to meet the mandate. Alternative-fuel vehicle production incentives appear to have small effects. However, there is uncertainty about the level of automaker response to those incentives, and analysis indicates the model is fairly sensitive to the assumed level of response. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for microalgae biofuel infrastructure are sometimes neglected during a life-cycle analysis (LCA). Construction materials were found for a baseline facility designed to produce renewable diesel in the United States. Material use was amortized over the material lifetime of thirty years and then, using emission factors available in GREET 2, energy use and GHG emissions were found per MJ of renewable diesel (MJ RD). For the baseline, infrastructure GHG emissions were 8.9gCO2e/MJ RD. Plastic and concrete had the largest emissions, and the growth ponds used the most materials of any unit operation. Fossil fuels comprised 97% of all energy use, which came predominately from natural gas at 0.090MJ/MJ RD. A sensitivity analysis showed that changes to the pond liner thickness and material lifetime had the largest effects with the lifetime increasing the GHG emissions 28% over the baseline. Increasing the productivity (up to 50g/m2/d) or lipid content (up to 50wt.%) decreased the emissions. Infrastructure emissions were compared to those from the fuel-cycle of a reduced emission scenario, showing that infrastructure related emissions ranged from 17% to 57% of the fuel-cycle emissions, with higher values at lower productivities. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The notion of renewable energy provides an important mechanism for diversifying an energy portfolio, which ultimately would have numerous benefits including increased energy resilience, reduced reliance on foreign energy supplies, reduced GHG emissions, development of a green energy sector that contributes to economic growth, and providing a sustainable energy supply. The conversion of autotrophic algae to liquid transportation fuels is the basis of several decades of research to competitively bring energy-scale production into reality; however, many challenges still remain for making algal biofuels economically viable. Addressing current challenges associated with algal production systems, in part, requires the ability to assess spatial and temporal variability, rapidly evaluate alternative algal production system designs, and perform large-scale assessments considering multiple scenarios for thousands of potential sites. We introduce the development and application of the Algae Logistics Model (ALM) which is tailored to help address these challenges. The flexible nature of the ALM architecture allows the model to: 1) interface with external biomass production and resource assessment models, as well as other relevant datasets including those with spatiotemporal granularity; 2) interchange design processes to enable operational and economic assessments of multiple design configurations, including the integration of current and new innovative technologies; and 3) conduct trade-off analysis to help understand the site-specific techno-economic trade-offs and inform technology decisions. This study uses the ALM to investigate a baseline open-pond production system determined by model harmonization efforts conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy. Six sites in the U.S. southern-tier were sub-selected and assessed using daily site-specific algae biomass productivity data to determine the economic viability of large-scale open-pond systems. Results show that costs can vary significantly depending on location and biomass productivity and that integration of novel dewatering equipment, order of operations, and equipment scaling can also have significant impacts on economics. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A warm sunny climate and unoccupied arid land as in the American Southwest are favorable for algal cultivation. However, additional resource constraints affect the overall viability of specific sites and regions. We investigated tradeoffs between growth rate, water, and CO2 availability and costs for two strains: Nannochloropsis salina and Chlorella sp. We conducted site selection exercises to produce 7.95E+10Lyr-1 (21billiongalyr-1 (BGY)) of renewable diesel (RD). Experimental trials from the National Alliance for Advanced Biofuels and Bio-Products (NAABB) team informed the growth model of our Biomass Assessment Tool. We simulated RD production by both lipid extraction (LE) and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Sites were screened for the availability of freshwater and flue gas, and prioritized by the net value of biofuel minus water (the least-expensive and available source) and flue gas delivery costs. Water sources considered were ground waters ranging in salinity from fresh to brines and seawater. We found that HTL produced more RD per unit biomass than LE, resulting in an improvement in economic efficiency of 76%. Selections constrained by production and water were concentrated along the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern Atlantic coasts. Adding flue gas constraints increased the spatial distribution to include sites nationwide. The 21BGY target required ~3.8millionha of mainly forest (41.3%) and pasture (35.7%). Exclusion in favor of barren and scrub lands forced most production to the southwestern US, but with increased water consumption (5.7 times) and decreased economic efficiency (-38%). © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Integrating reaction steps is of key interest in the development of processes for transforming lignocellulosic materials into drop-in fuels. We propose a procedure for performing the aldol condensation (reaction between furfural and acetone is taken as model reaction) and the total hydrodeoxygenation of the resulting condensation adducts in one step, yielding n-alkanes. Different combinations of catalysts (bifunctional catalysts or mechanical mixtures), reaction conditions, and solvents (aqueous and organic) have been tested for performing these reactions in an isothermal batch reactor. The results suggest that the use of bifunctional catalysts and aqueous phase lead to an effective integration of both reactions. Therefore, selectivities to n-alkanes higher than 50 % were obtained using this catalyst at typical hydrogenation conditions (T=493 K, P=4.5 MPa, 24 h reaction time). The use of organic solvent, carbonaceous supports, or mechanical mixtures of monofunctional catalysts leads to poorer results owing to side effects; mainly, hydrogenation of reactants and adsorption processes. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The promotion of biofuels as energy for transportation in the industrialised countries is mainly driven by the perspective of oil depletion, concerns about energy security and global warming. Nevertheless, the production of biofuels entails emissions to the environment coming from the different stages in the product life cycle. This paper evaluates the environmental impact of pure rapeseed biodiesel (B100) production and consumption in the public transport sector, in terms of GHG emissions released by every stage in the life cycle, in order to identify proper interventions to reduce the emissions. The methodology applied to this purpose is an Attributional Life Cycle Analysis (ALCA). The Agricultural phase results to be the process that produces the highest GHG emissions, mainly because of the production and the use of nitrogen fertiliser.

AB  - The last decade has seen a rapid increase in the production and consumption of biodiesel in the EU. This development has been especially stimulated by EU policy as a means to promote energy security and to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. However, in recent years, biodiesel production has been questioned due to the possible impact on food prices. This paper aims to explore the impact of EU biodiesel prices on diesel and rapeseed oil prices, using a Vector Error Corrections Model (VECM). Impulse response functions and forecast error variance decompositions are also computed in order to investigate the interrelationships within the relevant time series. Unlike the predominant literature, which mainly addresses the US and Brazilian ethanol sector, this paper focuses on the European biodiesel market. Our results suggest that biodiesel prices are mainly affected by feedstock prices, but there is no strong evidence that changes in biodiesel prices affect food prices.

AB  - Dairy effluent (DE) was evaluated for cultivation of the oleaginous micro alga Chlorococcum sp. RAP13 under mixotrophic and heterotrophic modes. The alga grew better and accumulated more lipids under heterotrophic cultivation. Supplementation of biodiesel industry waste glycerol (BDWG) to DE enhanced the biomass production as well as lipid accumulation. While the biomass yield was 0.8. g/L for mixotrophic cultivation, it was 1.48. g/L and 1.94. g/L respectively when cultivated with 4% or 6% BDWG. The cells accumulated 31% lipid when grown in mixotrophic mode, and heterotrophic cultivation with 4% or 6% BDWG resulted in a lipid accumulation of 39% and 42% respectively. Saturated fatty acids production was elevated in the DE, and the major fatty acid components of the algal oil were palmitic (16:0), oleic (18:1), stearic (18:0), linoleic (18:2) and linolenic (18:3) acids. DE quality improved with reduction in COD and BOD after algal cultivation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Over the last ten years biofuels production has increased dramatically. One of the main factors is the rise in world oil prices, coupled with heightened interest in the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions and concerns about energy security. The increment in production has been driven by governmental interventions. In the US, the world's largest fuel ethanol producer, strong financial incentives are guaranteed for biofuel manufacturers. While, in the European Union, the worlds largest biodiesel producer, biofuel consumption is mostly driven by blending mandates in both France and Germany. In the case of Malaysia, biodiesel started to be exported since 2006. The policy mandate of B5 blend of palm oil based biodiesel into diesel in all government vehicles was implemented in Februarv 2009. It is expected that the blend of B5 will be increased to B10 in future. This paper seeks to examine the impact of BIO on the Malaysian palm oil market. A structural econometric model consisting of eight structural equations and four identities was proposed in this study. The model has been estimated by two stage least squares method using annual data for the period 1976-2011. The specification of the structural model is based on a series of assumptions about general economic conditions, agricultural policies and technological change. The study indicates that counterfactual simulation of an increase from B5 to B10 predicts a positive increase (23.31 per cent) in palm oil domestic consumption. 109.3 per cent decrease in stock. 0.07 per cent increase in domestic price of palm oil and a marginal (0.05 percent) Increase in production. An increase in domestic demand would make Malaysia more competitive regionally and globally with benefits accruing to all Malaysians.

AB  - Oxidation stability is a parameter of great importance for biodiesel quality control to both producers and subsequent consumers. To maintain the quality of biodiesel, currently the most effective and economical method is the addition of antioxidants that prevent or retard the biofuel oxidation reaction. In this study, efficiency and cost of synthetic antioxidants added to B100 biodiesel from soybean oil and pork fat were evaluated, using butylhydroxyanisole (BHA), butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), in pure form or in mixtures, according to a simplex-centroid mixture experimental design. Results demonstrate an increased induction period (IP) in all trials when compared to the control sample, and TBHQ was the only antioxidant alone that met all the specification standards, while BHT and BHA alone met only the American standard specifications. The antioxidant mixture that presented the highest synergistic effect was that of TBHQ and BHA. Multi-response optimization indicated an optimum formulation containing 75 % TBHQ and 25 % BHA with an IP of 7.27 h at 110 °C and the antioxidant mixture cost of 31.31 USD, to be added for a ton of biodiesel. This simplex-centroid mixture experimental design shows an ability to be applied in the biodiesel, oils and fats industry to evaluate the oxidation stability and the occurrence of synergism between different mixtures of synthetic or natural antioxidants and their costs. © 2014 AOCS.

AB  - The global demand for energy, particularly for transport fuels, will continue to increase significantly in the future. In addition to other options, like increased technological efficiencies, traffic reduction or modal shift, biofuels are promoted to contribute strongly to the transport sector in the years to come. Biofuels are also promoted as part of the EU strategy for decarbonising the transport sector with the aim of reducing associated GHG emissions. This paper considers some of the most important biofuels. A selection of biofuel options (biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethane, hydrotreated vegetable oils and fats, lignocellulosic-based fuels) were characterised by their conversion technologies and stage of development. They were analysed, concerning technical (overall efficiency), economic (investments and biofuel production costs) and environmental aspects (GHG performance). Additionally, GHG mitigation costs were calculated with regard to the GHG-based biofuel quota. © 2014, Müller Langer et al.; licensee Springer.

AB  - Oxidation stability is a parameter of great importance for biodiesel quality control to both producers and future consumers. Keeping the quality of biodiesel, currently the most effective and economical method is the addition of antioxidants. Natural antioxidants can be an alternative to prevent or retard the degradation of biofuels from vegetable oils. In this study, it was evaluated the oxidative stability of B100 biodiesel from soybean oil in the presence of alcoholic extracts of rosemary, oregano and basil. The results suggested that the induction period, which precedes the oxidation process, was delayed in the presence of antioxidants, compared with the control, in all cases studied. The joint optimization, for all essay temperatures, demonstrated that a mixture containing 25% of rosemary ethanolic extract and 75% of oregano ethanolic extract is the most effective to retard the oxidation process. This simplex-centroid mixture experimental design shows viability to be applied in the biodiesel, oils and fats industry to evaluate the oxidation stability and the occurrence of synergism between different mixtures of synthetic or natural antioxidants. Besides, the results showed that the B100 biodiesel containing extract of oregano can provides, at 25 °C, a storage period seven times higher than the estimated for pure B100. © 2014 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

AB  - Depleting petroleum reserves, rising petroleum prices, threat to the environment from exhaust emissions and global warming create an intensive international interest in developing alternate and renewable fuels for engines. The use of biodiesel is seriously considered as an alternative fuel. But the problems with biodiesel are higher viscosity and lower volatility resulting in incomplete combustion and hence higher exhaust emission levels. The addition of alcohol with biofuel will increase the combustion efficiency and hence reduce the engine exhaust emission levels. In this study, the thermal cracked cashew nut shell liquid (TC-CNSL) is blended with ethanol, isobutanol,n-butanol, and tert-butanol separately, each with the volume percentage of 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%, respectively. Single cylinder, direct injection, water cooled 1500 RPM diesel engine was used for this study.
The engine was run at full load with various percentages of above said alcohols. The performance and emissions of the different percentage of alcohol with TC (CNSL) are compared. It is observed that the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) is improved with the use of TC (CNSL)alcohol additive compared to those of neat TC (CNSL) oil. Carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions with TC (CNSL)alcohol additives are observed to be lower compared to those of neat TC (CNSL) oil at higher loads. The NOx emission is slightly lower with TC (CNSL)–alcohol additives. But the low pressure rise and heat release are higher for neat TC (CNSL) as compared to TC (CNSL)-alcohol additives. © 2014 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.

AB  - To facilitate enzyme and pathway engineering, a selection was developed for improved sesquiterpene titers in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. α-Bisabolene, a candidate advanced biofuel, was found to protect yeast against the disruptive action of nonionic surfactants such as Tween 20 (T20). An experiment employing competition between two strains of yeast, one of which makes twice as much bisabolene as the other, demonstrated that growth in the presence of T20 provided sufficient selective pressure to enrich the high-titer strain to form 97% of the population. Following this, various methods were used to mutagenize the bisabolene synthase (BIS) coding sequence, coupled with selection by subculturing in the presence of T20. Mutagenesis targeting the BIS active site did not yield an improvement in bisabolene titers, although mutants were found which made a mixture of α-bisabolene and β-farnesene, another candidate biofuel. Based on evidence that the 3' end of the BIS mRNA may be unstable in yeast, we randomly recoded the last 20 amino acids of the enzyme and, following selection in T20, found a variant which increased specific production of bisabolene by more than 30%. Since T20 could enrich a mixed population, efficiently removing strains that produced little or no bisabolene, we investigated whether it could also be applied to sustain high product titers in a monoculture for an extended period. Cultures grown in the presence of T20 for 14 days produced bisabolene at titers up to 4-fold higher than cultures grown with an overlay of dodecane, used to sequester the terpene product, and 20-fold higher than cultures grown without dodecane. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - India being agricultural based country, has large scope and hope for producing biofuels as alternate for depleting fossil fuel. This paper is focusing on the use of neat non-edible oil in diesel engine at higher proportion. As the vegetable oil indicates high cetane value, it is the best suitable fuel without any fuel modification. The neat non-edible oil simarouba glauca (SG) with low sulphur diesel (LSD) used as fuel for this combustion analysis. The propositions are SG 50% by volume (50 SG) in the blend of SG oil and LSD. The Kirloskar, direct injection type, vertical single cylinder, diesel engine was used and operating parameters such as compression ratio (CR), intake air temperature (IAT), injection pressure and injection timing were optimised using Taguchi optimization technique and Gray Relation method. The optimized parameters were analyzed using ANOVA to study the influence and percentage contribution of involved parameters on desired response parameter Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE). The use of 50 SG blend performed well with 29.6 % BTE and producing 68 bar cylinder peak pressure at 7° bTDC for full load condition. The use of 50 SG blend performed well the results of the experiments were also used in developing non linear regression equation for response parameter. © Research India Publications.

AB  - In this study the possibility of producing diesel-like fuel from Shea butter (SB) is explored using catalytic hydrodeoxygenation reaction (HDO). Firstly, thermodynamic simulation studies were carried out using Aspen Hysys® to establish the process feasibility. The catalyst precursor, molybdenum oxalate (MoOx) was prepared from the reaction of Bis(acetylacetonato)dioxomolybdenum (VI) and oxalic acid in both acidic (pH 2) and basic (pH 10) environment using HF and NaOH as buffers, respectively and incorporated into Al2O3 support. The catalysts characterization results showed that polymeric molybdates [Mo2O5(OH)(C2O4)2]3- and monomeric molybdates [MoO2(OH)2(C2O4)2]4- are the Mo species present on the acidified MoOx/Al2O3 and basic MoOx/Al2O3, respectively according to the Raman spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction. The HDO of SB at 370 °C and 1 bar showed that the basic MoOx/Al2O3 has higher conversion of about 98% nC18 while the acidified MoOx/Al2O3 has comparably lower conversion of 92% nC18 within 35 min of reaction time, but the acidified MoOx/Al2O3 showed higher selectivity of 42% for the production of iso-paraffins (iC18) compared to 34% obtained for the basic MoOx/Al2O3. The high iC18 production was ascribed to the acidity of MoOx/Al2O3 (pH 2) catalyst due to fluoride ion functionalization. This result is encouraging for further research towards industrialization. © Sila Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is being directly used as alternative fuel in the compression ignition (CI) engines.
The biofuel in the biodiesel produces high smoke and increases the Nitric oxide emission due to high viscosity and less calorific value. This paper is focused on the jatropha oil and rubber seed oil, which is blended with a diesel and injected in to a single cylinder four stroke diesel engine to study emission characteristics of the engine. The fuel injection pressure is maintained at 220 bar and the injection timing was 24°. The mass flow rate was kept constant. The B20, B40, B60 biodiesel were prepared by volume of 20%, 40%, 60% and biofuel blends with diesel. The tests were conducted at different engine load conditions of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and100% at the rated power of 4.4kW. The results revealed that the biodiesel of B20 was less in emission of carbon monoxide (CO), unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) and high in emission of Nitric oxide (NOx) when compared with the other blends. © Research India Publications.

AB  - This work demonstrates that Jatropha cinerea (J. cinerea) seed oil has potential as a new, non-conventional, bio-energy resource. The physical and chemical properties of J. cinerea seeds, collected from its natural habit, were evaluated. The length-, diameter- and weight- of seeds were in the ranges of 8 to 12 mm, 7.5 to 11 mm, and 0.2 to 0.7 g, respectively. Additionally, the amount of oil in the seed kernel was 65.77 wt.%, and it contained 15% saturated, 33% monounsaturated, and 51% polyunsaturated fatty acids. The major constituent (50.8 wt%) of crude J. cinerea oil was linoleic acid. Based on its content of phorbol esters (0.22 mg g-1), J. cinerea was considered to be a non-toxic Jatropha species. Iodine, saponification, and acid values of the J. cinerea seed oil were similar to those of the J. curcas seeds oil; therefore, it was suggested that J. cinerea oil had the quality required for biodiesel production from J. cinerea seeds oil was produced by a sonotransesterification process, evaluating the effect of the methanol: oil molar ratio (MOR), temperature, and reaction time. The best conditions for biodiesel production were 25ºC, a MOR of 4:1, and a notably short reaction time of 20 s. These conditions were very advantageous as compared to those required by conventional processes, and very promising for the development of a low cost biodiesel production process using J. cinerea seed oil as a feedstock. © 2014, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa.

AB  - This review proposes the use of residual glycerol, generated in biodiesel production, as raw material for production of oxygenate additive to biofuel. Oxygenated additives, such as glycerol ethers, increase the value of fuel mixture and engine performance. This represents a new methodology in line with the green chemistry principles. The etherification reaction, responsible for the additives production (glycerol ethers), can be effected by the heterogeneous acid catalysts application due to their specificities, like the possibility of reusing, greater strength and higher acidity. It was found that the Keggin heteropolyacids (HPW) supported on niobia have a potential that can be exploited for further industrial application.

AB  - Biodiesel from Jatropha curcas seeds is one promissory option in the biofuels field. This is a crop that develops in tropical countries which can grow on marginal soils with low irrigation and helps to control the erosion. This bush grows quickly and produces seeds with approximately 35% oil content and it does not compete with food crops. However, for the production of biodiesel from Jatropha to be sustainable and profitable it is required research and technological development at all stages of the production chain. This articleshows the results of a research process that aims the determination of some significant physical and mechanical characteristics of Jatropha curcas seeds. This data are important, because they provide necessary information in the design of equipment and processes for Jatropha curcas oil production; especially, for mechanical oil extraction. As a result of the research process different properties were determined, for example: compression (2.8 mm) and energy (332 N.mm) required for fracture, average dimensions of seeds (length: 10.8 mm/width: 17.8 mm/thickness: 8.6 mm), fractions of shell (38%) and albumen (62%) in the seed, moisture content of seed (5.2%), oil content (29%), calorific value of shell (0.3 MJ/kg) and albumen (0.8 MJ/kg). All these variables are important parameters in the design of equipment, but also are useful to evaluate alternative uses for by-products of the oil extraction process, for example as energy source. Besides, the available information in Colombia about Jatropha is not much.

AB  - To improve the properties of bio-oil, a new method was proposed that does not involve introduction of any energy medium. An ether-soluble fraction (ES), a dichloromethane soluble fraction (DCMS), and a dichloromethane insoluble fraction (DCMIS) of bio-oil were obtained using ether and dichloromethane as extraction solvents. The same amount of each fraction (10 g) was blended into bio-oil with a certain quantity of 100 g. The three samples were then placed in sealed vials and heated for 12, 60, and 180 h at both 60 °C and 80 °C in an oil bath. Based on the aging properties of the three fractions, blended bio-oil was prepared using ES and DCMS in certain volume ratio. The total yield of the three fractions combined was around 90 wt%; the weight loss was thought to be due to the volatilization of low molecular weight matter and water during the process of solvent evaporation using a rotary evaporator. The aging test results indicated that the DCMIS fraction had the poorest properties compared with ES and DCMS such as acid number, water content and viscosity. In order to get the best properties of blended bio-oil, the optimal volume ratio of ES/DCMS was 1/2 according to the aging test.

AB  - Bioethanol production poses different challenges that require an integrated approach. Usually previous works have focused on specific perspectives of the global problem. On the contrary, bioethanol, in particular, and biofuels, in general, requires an integrated decision making framework that takes into account the needs and concerns of the different members involved in its supply chain. In this work, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for the optimal allocation, design and production planning of integrated ethanol/yeast plants is considered. The proposed formulation addresses the relations between different aspects of the bioethanol supply chain and provides an efficient tool to assess the global operation of the supply chain taking into account different points of view. The model proposed in this work simultaneously determines the structure of a three-echelon supply chain (raw material sites, production facilities and customer zones), the design of each installed plant and operational considerations through production campaigns. Yeast production is considered in order to reduce the negative environmental impact caused by bioethanol residues. Several cases are presented in order to assess the approach capabilities and to evaluate the tradeoffs among all the decisions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, fluoride ion functionalized nickel oxalate supported on molybdenum modified zeolite (NiMoFOx/Zeol) catalyst was synthesized, characterized and tested on the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of oleic acid (OA) into paraffinic fuel. The NiMoFOx/Zeol characterization results confirmed the presence of both Ni and Mo as well as the formation of NiMoO4 which is a highly HDO reactive specie at 2θ value of 43.6° according to the XRD result. NiMoFOx/Zeol also showed loss in crystallinity and reduction in the average particle size leading to increase in the pore volume and specific surface area due to the combined effects of fluoride ion presence, oxalic acid functionalization and calcination. The effect of temperature, pressure and NiMoFOx/Zeol loading studied showed that initial increase in their values increased the yield of the target fractions until some points where reduction was observed. The best observed experimental conditions to hydrodeoxygenate 40 g (∼45 mL) of OA into 75% n-C18 and 23% i-C18 were 360 °C, 30 mg NiMoFOx/Zeol loading and 20 bar using 100 mL H2/min. The presence of i-C18 was due to the functionalization of the catalyst with fluoride ion. The catalyst reusability result displayed excellent qualities with marginal loss of only 2% in activity after third reuse due to the improved synthesis protocol that employed organometallic precursor. The results are strongly encouraging for further studies toward industrialization of HDO process. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Excessive use of fossil fuels to satisfy our rapidly increasing energy demand has created severe environmental problems, such as air pollution, acid rain and global warming. Biofuels are a potential alternative to fossil fuels. First- and second-generation biofuels face criticism due to food security and biodiversity issues. Third-generation biofuels, based on microalgae, seem to be a plausible solution to the current energy crisis, as their oil-producing capability is many times higher than that of various oil crops. Microalgae are the fastest-growing plants and can serve as a sustainable energy source for the production of biodiesel and several other biofuels by conversion of sunlight into chemical energy. Biofuels produced from microalgae are renewable, non-toxic, biodegradable and environment friendly. Microalgae can be grown in open pond systems or closed photobioreactors. Microalgal biofuels are a potential means to keep the development of human activities in synchronization with the environment. The integration of wastewater treatment with biofuel production using microalgae has made microalgal biofuels more attractive and cost effective. A biorefinery approach can also be used to improve the economics of biofuel production, in which all components of microalgal biomass (i.e., proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) are used to produce useful products. The integration of various processes for maximum economic and environmental benefits minimizes the amount of waste produced and the pollution level. This paper presents an overview of various aspects associated with biofuel production from microalgae, including the selection and isolation of microalgal species, various cultivation and harvesting techniques as well as methods for their subsequent conversion into biofuels. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Germany is required by European Union legislation to achieve a 10% mixture of renewable energy in all road transport fuels by the year 2020. This paper intends to quantify the water use impacts of Germany's compliance with the transport fuel goal of the EU Renewables Directive. Although the stated purpose of this Directive is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector and address energy security concerns, a more encompassing analysis considering sustainable development paths must include other environmental impacts, including water resource use. The water footprint indicator can contribute to a more intelligent environmental analysis of biofuel targets, although it alone cannot attest to the sustainability of human water use. This research builds upon the results of a similar study that aimed to quantify the freshwater impacts of meeting this EU transport fuel goal across Member States. By looking more closely at the case of Germany, country-specific data can be used in the analysis that lead to different results than those reached in the previous study. Results indicate that achieving a 10% mixture of biofuels in the road transport sector could lead to a 64% increase in the water footprint of the transport fuel sector when compared to a baseline scenario of no policy implementation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The insecure supply of fossil fuel coerces the scientific society to keep a vision to boost investments in the renewable energy sector. Among the many renewable fuels currently available around the world, biodiesel offers an immediate impact in our energy. In fact, a huge interest in related research indicates a promising future for the biodiesel technology. Heterogeneous catalyzed production of biodiesel has emerged as a preferred route as it is environmentally benign needs no water washing and product separation is much easier. The number of well-defined catalyst complexes that are able to catalyze transesterification reactions efficiently has been significantly expanded in recent years. The activity of catalysts, specifically in application to solid acid/base catalyst in transesterification reaction depends on their structure, strength of basicity/acidity, surface area as well as the stability of catalyst. There are various process intensification technologies based on the use of alternate energy sources such as ultrasound and microwave. The latest advances in research and development related to biodiesel production is represented by non-catalytic supercritical method and focussed exclusively on these processes as forthcoming transesterification processes. The latest developments in this field featuring highly active catalyst complexes are outlined in this review. The knowledge of more extensive research on advances in biofuels will allow a deeper insight into the mechanism of these technologies toward meeting the critical energy challenges in future. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel plantations have been hyped as a means to reinvigorate Africa's rural areas. Yet there is still apprehension about the negative environmental and social impacts of large-scale commercial biofuel production around rising food prices, land grabbing, ecological damage, and disruption of rural livelihoods. Given the extent of Jatropha curcas production in Ghana and Ethiopia and Castor bean (Ricinus communis) in Ethiopia, this paper presents the results of a study that assessed the socio-economic implications of industrial Jatropha plantations on local livelihoods in Ghana, and of industrial Jatropha and Castor plantations on local livelihoods in Ethiopia. This study used primary data collected from 234 households in Ghana and 165 in Ethiopia. The cultivation of Jatropha and Castor has had several important effects on local livelihoods in the study sites, most notably decreases in household landholdings due to the arrival of industrial Jatropha or Castor plantations; and the resulting changes these plantations have caused in household socio-economic status, food security, fallow periods, and fodder availability. We consider how a lack of meaningful consultation between local people, their traditional authorities and the biofuel company managers, along with shortcomings in each country's broader land acquisition process and poor land use information, may have contributed to these overall negative effects on local livelihoods. We conclude by suggesting several ways that emerging biofuel industries could be improved from the perspective of local people and their livelihoods. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - The utilization of syngas shows a highly potential to improve the economic potential of the stand-alone power unit-based gasification plants as well as enhancing the growing demand of transportation fuels. The thermochemical conversion of biomass via gasification to heat and power generations from the earlier study is further enhanced by integrating Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis with the existing gasification pilot scale studied previously. To support the potential and perspectives in major economies due to scaling up in developing countries such as Thailand, the objective of this work is to develop a base case process model coupled with techno-economic evaluation for the FT synthesis. In particular, the FT process configurations are designed and assessed using current kinetic laboratory data by our research group for modeling specific reactions in PFR reactor. The calculation of equipment sizing incurred several major unit operations is performed for once-through mode (no recycles of unconverted syngas) with electricity co-production. This study provides a detailed base-case model for the FT synthesis with the capacities of 1, 2 and 3 MW of syngas technology sharing and the comparison between the integrated- and non-integrated FT syntheses with respect to techno-economic criteria. The integration of FT synthesis with biomass gasification in this study results in the significant assessment of energy efficiency and cost reduction by 36.92% and 16%, respectively. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, nickel II oxalate complex (NiOx) was prepared by functionalization of nickel with oxalic acid (OxA) and incorporated into Al2O3 to synthesize alumina supported nickel oxalate (NiOx/Al2O3) catalyst for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of oleic acid (OA) into biofuel. The synthesized NiOx/Al2O3 was characterized and the X-ray fluorescence and elemental dispersive X-ray results showed that NiOx was successfully incorporated into the structure of Al2O3. The X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy results confirmed that highly dispersed Ni species are present in the NiOx/Al2O3 due to the functionalization with OxA. The catalytic activity of the NiOx/Al2O3 on the HDO of OA produced a mixture of 21% iso-C18 and 72% n-C18 at a 360 °C, 20 bar, 30 mg NiOx/Al2O3 loading pressure and gas flow rate of 100 mL/min. The presence of i-C18 was ascribed to the OxA functionalization which increased the acidity of NiOx/Al2O3. The NiOx/Al2O3 reusability study showed consistent HDO ability after 5 runs. These results are promising for further research into biofuel production for commercialization. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - After initial studies, further research work on the combustion properties of second generation biofuels, obtained through solvolysis in polyhydroxy alcohols is oriented towards different types of liquefied wood that exhibit several favorable properties. In this study, different types were obtained by altering the reactant ratios of the fuels. These were focused on increased wood content and elevated pH value that would increase the techno-economic attractiveness of the fuel. Three different types of fuels were tested in a laboratory scale gas turbine, and evaluated through CO, THC and NOx emissions measurements, while varying multiple operating parameters. To achieve sufficient atomization quality, the high viscosity of the fuels was reduced by preheating to 100 °C. To speed up the droplet evaporation process and additionally to resemble conditions present in commercially available systems, high temperatures of primary air were employed by the use of exhaust gas heat regenerator. CO and THC emissions were found to be highly dependent on wood content and turbine inlet temperature, whereas with partial neutralization of the fuel this dependency was less pronounced and only NOx concentrations were influenced by altered elemental composition of the fuel. Results indicate it is possible to maintain successful combustion in microturbines even with fuels that exhibit higher pH value and reduced reactivity and with fuels containing higher amounts of lignocellulosic biomass. © 2014 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative fuel obtained from renewable sources. However, during the biodiesel autooxidation, reactive compounds could be formed. Those compounds increase the biodiesel corrosivity and the degradation of the fuel. This work presents a study of the corrosion of metals commonly used in auto-parts exposed to biodiesel and biodiesel-fatty acids blends. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed during the exposition time in order to determine the susceptibility of the metals to corrosion. The polarization resistance (Rp) values at the initial exposition times were of the order of 1×109 ohm cm2, and the associated capacitances were of the order of 10-11F cm-2 for all metals. The Nyquist impedance diagrams of copper and carbon steel-immersed in biodiesel-fatty acid blends after the second day of immersion-showed at least 2 capacitive loops. Although the capacitance values of lowest frequency loop are still too small (10-9F.cm-2) to be associated with a metal double layer capacitance, the values of these capacitances increased with the increment of the exposition time. It is possible that for longer times of exposition, the electrochemical parameter related with the lowest capacitive loop of the impedance can be associated to the metal corrosion phenomena.

AB  - The sugarcane industry in Brazil has been considered promising for the production of advanced fuels and bio-based products. However, the sugarcane crop requires high volumes of fossil fuel for cultivation and transport. The use of biodiesel as a diesel substitute could reduce the environmental burdens associated with this high consumption. This work performed a stochastic evaluation of the environmental and economic implications of the integrated production of sugarcane bioethanol and soybean biodiesel, in comparison with the traditional sugarcane-to-ethanol process. The analysis was focused on the states of Goiás, Mato Grosso and São Paulo, where this integration would be particularly attractive. The environmental aspects addressed were the fossil energy use and the GHG emissions in a cradle-to-gate approach. The economic analysis comprised the evaluation of the net present value of an incremental cash flow generated by the soybean production and by the adjacent plants of oil extraction and biodiesel. Results indicate that the integrated system is likely to improve the ethanol environmental performance, especially with regard to the fossil energy use. The integration is economically feasible but highly uncertain; however, it could be significantly improved through fiscal incentives to biodiesel producers, founded on the reduction of fossil energy use and on improvements in logistics. In addition, the proposed model may also assist in the design of other integrated systems applied to the sugarcane sector in Brazil. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fuel mixtures like ethanol-diesel blend, diesel-vegetable oil, alcohol-vegetable oil, alcohol-diesel-vegeta-ble oil, ester of vegetable oil-diesel are used as fuel for Compression Ignition (CI) engines. Vegetable and rice bran oil are also being used satisfactorily for partial replacement of the diesel fuel. In the present study, the performance of CI engine fuelled by Rice bran oil methyl ester ethanol blends was evaluated and compared with diesel. Increase in proportion of ethanol in blends decreased the emission of exhaust gases. The engine produced almost similar power on all the fuel blends and its brake thermal efficiency was higher on blended fuel. Though at higher percentage of ethanol, the blends had more brake specific fuel consumption but at the same time the thermal efficiency also increased with increase in ethanol percentage. The experimental results proved that the use of ethanol blended biodiesel in compression ignition engines is a viable alternative to diesel.

AB  - Globally, the environmental awareness is driving the research towards energy resources that are more beneficial to milieu. Biofuel is considered to be a remarkable option for that. Among the sources of biofuels, vegetable oils are the cheapest, easily available and in abundant quantity. However, some processes are needed to make vegetable oils suitable for engines because vegetable oils have certain detrimental properties. In this study, three potential feedstocks, namely, moringa, sesame and rice bran oils are critically investigated as potential sources for biodiesel production. The work was divided into several steps: firstly, the production of biodiesel from the three feedstocks; secondly, the measurement of the important physical and chemical properties of biodiesels; and finally, the development of mathematical equations with the help of polynomial curve fitting method for biodiesel-diesel and biodiesel-biodiesel blends to predict the most important properties, such as kinematic viscosity, flash point, calorific value, CFPP of the blended biodiesel. The experiment has shown that the three feedstocks can be considered to be feasible sources for biodiesel. It is seen from the experiment that biodiesel blends have notable effect on properties; for instance, the viscosity of the rice bran oil is improved to 5.1631 mm2 s-1 from 5.3657 mm2 s-1, when mixed with sesame biodiesel at a volume ratio of 3:1. Moreover, it is improved to 5.0921 mm2 s-1, when mixed with moringa biodiesel at a volume ratio of 3:1. Moreover, flash point and CFPP of rice bran biodiesel are also improved, when mixed with sesame or moringa biodiesel in any percentage. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014.

AB  - Recently, farmers have become interested in growing alternative crops for the production of biofuels such as biodiesel. Using small-scale cold presses and conversion systems to offset variable diesel fuel prices, biodiesel could be produced on-farm. Research is limited on the economics of on-farm biodiesel production. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to 1) assess economics of a current small-scale biodiesel production system and 2) use the data collected to develop a prediction model for a small-scale, on-farm biodiesel production system scenario. Auburn University Biosystems Engineering Department's biodiesel production system utilizes all waste vegetable oils (WVO) from dining facilities on campus, totaling 3,300 gal yr-1. Biodiesel is produced for approximately $2.21 gal-1 ($0.58 L-1) using base catalyzed transesterification techniques and one dedicated technician. Process data from 2010 was extrapolated to an onfarm scenario with estimates made for oilseed processing techniques and yield based on previous studies. Opportunity costs of oilseeds were assessed as well as current soyhull pellet prices. Ultimately, a decision assistance tool was developed for use by farmers. This model allows farmers to input basic variables to determine if producing biodiesel or selling crops is most profitable. Model outputs included total biodiesel and meal yields, meal value, WVO transportation cost, oilseed extrusion cost, biodiesel production cost, and operating costs. Simulations indicated that in 2010 soybean biodiesel resulted in the highest cost of production which was inversely proportional to soybean acreage. Canola followed closely, but WVO was the least expensive in terms of production cost as an essentially free feedstock with only transportation and process cost added. Biodiesel production cost fluctuated heavily with commodity market pricing. Model results revealed that by producing biodiesel with the 2010 soybean crop, farmers could have reduced losses by $10.00 acre-1. While this system would not give farmers strong economic advantage, it is feasible and has the potential to reduce losses. © 2014 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers

AB  - This work illustrates a comparative study on the applicability of the basic heterogeneous calcium oxide catalyst prepared from waste mollusks and crabs shells (MS and CS, resp.) in the transesterification of waste cooking oil collected from seafood restaurants with methanol for production of biodiesel. Response surface methodology RSM based on D-optimal deign of experiments was employed to study the significance and interactive effect of methanol to oil M: O molar ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction time, and mixing rate on biodiesel yield. Second-order quadratic model equations were obtained describing the interrelationships between dependent and independent variables to maximize the response variable (biodiesel yield) and the validity of the predicted models were confirmed. The activity of the produced green catalysts was better than that of chemical CaO and immobilized enzyme Novozym 435. Fuel properties of the produced biodiesel were measured and compared with those of Egyptian petro-diesel and international biodiesel standards. The biodiesel produced using MS-CaO recorded higher quality than that produced using CS-CaO. The overall biodiesel characteristics were acceptable, encouraging application of CaO prepared from waste MS and CS for production of biodiesel as an efficient, environmentally friendly, sustainable, and low cost heterogeneous catalyst. © 2014 Nour Sh.

AB  - Biofuels are one of those renewable fuel sources developed to fuel the transportation sector to replace conventional petroleum based fuels. Due to widespread research and development programs from last two decades, significant progress has been made in the field of biofuels. The first and second generation biofuels are produced from various food crops and plant seed oils. Algae has been identified as a the potential source to produce biofuels, which can replace transportation fuels derived from fossil energy sources due to various advantages than the previous two generation feed stocks. The ability to produce high amounts of oil, efficiency in harvesting solar energy, adaptability to different climatic conditions and capability to produce valuable byproducts makes algae as a potential source for renewable energy source. In the present work the key concentration is directed towards producing renewable biofuels from algal biomass by transesterfication process. Its Characterization study reveals that algal based biodiesel is an alternative source of diesel. © 2014 SERSC.

AB  - Biofuels have raised controversy regarding their environmental, social, and economic sustainability. The complexity of biofuel decisions and investments by both industry and society requires integration of scientific knowledge, public information, and values from a diversity of sources. Environmental assessments can identify multiple impacts of different options. Open and collaborative knowledge creation can support decisions in two ways: by building trust and credibility and by developing more robust understanding of key issues. Open assessment is a decision-support method that allows widespread participation in a transparent and freely accessible process. In this article, we evaluate two open assessment case studies concerning biodiesel production. The evaluation compiles the participants’ views regarding the potential of the assessment process to influence decisions in terms of quality of content, applicability, efficiency, and openness. According to the evaluation, openness can be feasibly implemented and is much appreciated by participants. More experience using broad and active participation is needed for further development of methods and tools. However, the currently common practices of closed and disengaged processes limit decision making. In addition, suitable tools and practices, as well as the inclusion of participants with appropriate skills, are needed to facilitate open collaboration. © 2014 ProQuest.

AB  - The indigenous strain Botryococcus braunii TN101 was isolated and acclimatized under laboratory condition. Upstream and downstream process was thoroughly explored for biofuel production. During semi-continuous cultivation, the alga was grown under batch mode for 6 days; thereafter 40% of algal culture was harvested at every three days interval. At semi-continuous system, the indigenous strain grows well and produces high biomass productivity of 33.8 g m-3 day-1. A two step combined harvesting process was designed using ferric iron and organic polymer Poly-(d)glucosamine and harvested 99.5% of biomass. Lipid extraction was optimized using different solvents, cyclohexane and methanol at 3:1 ratio supported for maximum extraction of lipids in Botryococcus up to 26.3%. Physicochemical properties of lipid was analyzed and found, saponification values 184, ester values 164, iodine values 92 and the average molecular weight of the lipids are 920 g mol-1. The lipid contains 9.7% of FFA level, therefore, a simultaneous esterification and transesterification of free fatty acids and triacylglycerides were optimized for biodiesel production and the methyl ester yield was recorded up to 84%. In addition, an optimization study was carried out for the removal of pigments present in the biodiesel; the result revealed that 99% of pigments were removed from the biodiesel using activated charcoal. The biodiesel profile was analyzed by 1H and 13C NMR and GC-MS analyzer, methyl palmitate and methyl oleate was the major fatty acid found. Based on the areal and volumetric biomass productivity, it is estimated that the indigenous strain can produce 101 tons ha-1 year-1 of biomass. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effect of nitrogen starvation on the biomass and lipid productivities of Chiorella pyrenoidosa was studied in an internally illuminated bubble column photobioreactor (IIBCPBR) designed on the basis of energy efficiency. Algal culture was grown in the inside column with a culture volume of 4.5 L providing illuminated surface area of 0.1219 m2. The biomass growth rate and total lipid content were 3.12 g/L and 0.482 gIg, respectively, under nitrogen starvation after 8 days of cultivation period. Higher biomass productivity per total energy input (0.57 g W-1 day-1) and lipid productivity per total energy input (0.273 g W-1 day-1 ) were achieved with the IIBCPBR design under nitrogen starvation compared to other alternative designs reported in literature. The proposed HBCPBR design can potentially reduce the energy input in algal cultivation by as much as 40% compared to other bubble column photobioreactors. © Global Science Publications.

AB  - Cold start and altitude relight pose special challenges to the gas turbine combustion system in the operating envelope when using biofuel with different properties. To ensure proper ignition characteristics, the properties for different biofuel blends are compared to Jet A-1 fuel. This investigation reviews proper engine operability and finds the minimum fuel-to-air ratio for these conditions. Also, some features of the combustor aerodynamics are accounted for by considering various differential pressures across the combustor. The relevant variables to simulate altitude relight and cold start are pressure and temperature since they are critical factors to consider for successful ignition. Another significant parameter to consider is the amount of spark energy to ensure ignition of a sufficiently rich mixture. Light-up at altitude is critical because there is a limited window of opportunity. Therefore, a significantly higher fuel-to-air ratio region obtained by delivering enough fuel vapors locally will greatly assist thee ventual start or restart of the engine. The altitude relight facility at Universite Lavalis capable of generating conditions for cold start down to −50° C and relight up to an altitude of 15,240 m (50,000 ft or 50 kft). This rig represents an economical way to simulate these altitude conditions with the use of a steam ejector that can cover a wide pressure range and Mach number. As demonstrated with test results and properties for the various biofuel/Jet A-1 blends, significant improvements were noted for a number of these drop-in biofuel blends because of their higher reactivity as reflected in their higher content of long-chain paraffins. © 2014, Begell House Inc.

AB  - Second generation biofuels, especially fuels from lignocellulose biomass, which are manufactured from non-food feedstock play a key role to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the dependency on fossil oil. The bi°CRACK process represents a new biomass-To-liquid concept to generate advanced biofuel by liquid-phase pyrolysis. As liquid heat carrier vacuum gas oil (VGO), an intermediate heavy oil product from the vacuum distillation, is used. Since autumn 2012 a fully integrated pilot plant at the refinery in Schwechat/Austria with a nominal biomass capacity of 100 kg/h is in continuous operation and generates data for up-scaling the technology to an industrial scale. This paper reports the results of the continuous operation. The influence of various reaction parameters, such as the reaction temperature, on yield and composition of the reaction products were investigated. As expected from previous results with a semi batch lab-scale reactor, within the selected range of temperature (350 °C to 400 °C), elevated temperature leads to decreasing amount of biochar and rising liquefaction. Based on the results could be shown that 10 to 20 % of the biogenic carbon can be transferred directly into raw fuels with the bi°CRACK concept. Additionally 11 to 18 % of the bio-carbon merges into the remaining heat carrier. Copyright © 2014, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Biofuels are key products for the sustainability of the world energy consumption in the next years. Biodiesel in particular is a non-toxic, biodegradable, environmentally friendly alternative diesel fuel. Nowadays, the main problem for the commercialization of biodiesel is its final cost, that is strongly dependent (about 85 % of the total) by the feedstock used. A possible way to lower the biodiesel production costs is using raw oils, which contain a higher amount of Free Fatty Acids (FFA) that should be eliminated before the transesterification reaction to avoid soaps formation. In this work the regression of kinetic parameters of heterogeneously catalyzed esterification with a packed-bed reactor was made. Robust techniques for kinetic parameters estimation and simultaneous discrimination of rival models were adopted and combined with a dedicated differential-algebraic equation (DAE) model that characterizes the system. The main kinetic parameters were regressed using kinetic models other than literature models in considering the activity (UNIQUAC model was used to calculate the activity coefficients) of the components instead of the concentration because the oil/methanol/water/FAME system is highly non ideal. The kinetic parameters were obtained using equilibrated resins, i.e. using the catalyst after having let it to adsorb reactants and products at the operative conditions. The regressed parameters allow to represent the system in a wide range of operating conditions with a little residual error.. Copyright © 2014, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - One of the pillars of sustainable development is the mobility, which has significant energy demand. Nowadays in Europe the demand for diesel fuel continuously growing, while the demand for gasoline decreases slightly. Currently, the biodiesel is the biofuel which is blended into the gas oil with the highest amount in case of Diesel engines, which can be produced from different, even waste-derived triglycerides (with transesterification with alcohol). Due to the adverse properties of biodiesel the storage stability of biodiesel/diesel blends have to be examined in detail. In our experimental work we studied the changes in the qualities of biodiesels produced from vegetable oil which contained various waste cooking oil (waste-derived component) share (10, 30, 50 %), and its 7 and 10 % blends with gas oil in case of long-term (more than 150 weeks) storage. We found that with the increasing the proportion of used cooking oil in the vegetable oil used as raw material for biodiesel the oxidation reactions took place in greater amount during the storage of the biodiesel product. Biodiesel made from vegetable oils containing 10 % used cooking oil was the most applicable for blending; in case of using higher proportion it is very necessary to use further amount of antioxidant additives to minimize the degradation. The test results suggest that without the addition of additives the biodiesels are not allowed to store longer than six months, and the diesel-biodiesel blends are not allowed to store longer than 1 year. We established mathematical relationships which describe well the relationship between the Rancimat induction period and the kinematic viscosity and the acid number in case of the investigated biodiesels..

AB  - The liquid engine fuels are the main power source of the transportation in the passenger sector. Within this, the waste originated engine fuels can play the main role to achieve the prediction of EU, to reach the 10 % ratio of the renewable fuels until 2020. Thus the sustainable and environmental friendly production of this components is momentous. To achieve all this goals the European Union created the 2003/30/EC and further the 2009/28/EC Directives to encourage the bio components blending in the engine fuels. Nowadays the research, development and market entry of the second generation or new generation biofuels are under introduction. The main reason is the demand for better quality fuels and wider raw material basis. All of these above mentioned reasons explain the investigation of unconventional feedstocks which do not endanger the security of food supplement and/or can be processed with lower operation costs. For example these feedstocks can be non-edible hybrids such as rapeseed oils with high euric acid content obtained from special hybrids of rape (e.g. Brassica Napus) or high oleic acid containing oil sunflowers (Saaten Union Capella) waste lards (used cooking oil, slaughterhouse lards) or raw materials from long term unused agricultural area (abandoned area). The precondition of availability is the sustainable and the technical compatibility with running engine and vehicle construction, thus this bio components can be blended in the motor fuels unlimited quantity. Considering the utilization properties of currently used first generation biofuels, the maximum amount of biocomponent in the applied motor is 10 % bioethanol in the case of gasoline and 7 % fatty acid methyl ester in the case of diesel fuels. One of the reliable production technology of second generation biofules which can be blended into diesel fuels is the heterogenic catalytic hydrogenation of triglycerides and waste lards. In this context we studied the heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of used cooking oils on aluminium-oxide supported transition metal catalyst. The applied operation parameters were the following: temperature: 320 - 380 °C, pressure: 20 - 80 bar, LHSV: 1.0 h-1, H2/hydrocarbon ratio: 600 Nm3/m3. The yield of gas oil boiling range products at the favourable operation parameters was close to the theoretical yield (80 - 90 %). The quality characteristics of these products were very favourable; for example the cetane number was higher than 75, the aromatic content was lower than 0.1 % and the sulphur content was lower than 5 mg/kg. To sum it up, the quality characteristics satisfied the CWA 15940:2009 (9th March) NSAI standard's (Automotive fuels - Paraffinic Diesel from synthesis gas hydrotreatment - Requirements and test methods) requirements. The actual EN 590:2013 standard does not limit the blending rate of these bio components, while on the other hand the blending of biodiesel (fatty-acid-methyl ester) is limited (max 7 v/v%). Consequently these products which were obtained by catalytic hydrogenation of vegetable oils can be blended in gasoil up to 10 %, and this way we can meet the requirements of the EU which prescribe at least 10-80 % bio component blending in motor fuels by 2020.

AB  - In this study a multi-scale simulation of the propane aromatization process is presented. The recent interest in this technology derives from the development of new conversion routes of third generation biomass. Advanced processes for the production of drop-in biofuels from vegetable (e.g. algal) oils are based on hydrogenation reactions, which lead to the production of green diesel, and selective cracking reactions that maximise the production of bio-jet fuels C10-C15 fractions. These catalytic processes involve the cracking of triglycerides, saturation of double bonds, heteroatoms rejection (especially deoxygenation) and isomerization. Moreover, while glycerol is the low added value co-product for oils transesterification (Bianchi et al., 2009), propane represents more than 30 % of the final product in the hydrotreatment of the lipid fraction. Propane can be upgraded by catalytically convert it to aromatics, which are additives for jet-fuels and bulk feedstock for the chemical industry. The low selectivity towards aromatics strongly reduces the efficiency of the overall process, caused by a large production of cracking gases. In general, zeolites with MFI pore structure are used due to their high resistance to deactivation (Pirola et al., 2010) with metal components, such as gallium, added to enhance the dehydrogenation function. Kinetic studies of propane aromatization over H-ZSM-5 at 500 °C and atmospheric pressure in a wide range of conversions are reported in the literature (Nguyen et al., 2006). Based on these and similar results (Bhan et al., 2005), a general kinetic model for propane aromatization has been developed. In this work the revised kinetic model is presented and embedded in the multi-scale simulation of a propane aromatization process, performed with the commercial code Invensys PRO/II. Several technologies have been designed to directly convert LPG into aromatics (BTX). In this study the Cyclar process (Giannetto et al., 1994) developed by UOP and BP was selected..

AB  - Biomass is the world's largest source of renewable energy and can replace part of the fossil sources. Main components of biomass are cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin, which are compounds of C, H and O and represent high energy content. Fast pyrolysis (flash pyrolysis) at temperatures up to 500 °C for a time of few seconds gives a high yield of bio-oil to around 80 %, containing hundreds of components, such as alkanes, alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, aromatics, phenols, also ketones, esters, ethers, sugars, alcohols and others. Bio-oil can be directly used as fuel in boilers or after upgrading as motor fuel and a source of chemicals. By upgrading, the catalytic cracking in the presence of zeolites and hydrogenation are mainly used. The paper describes the results of fractionation of bio-oil by aqueous extraction. The yield and composition of the obtained fractions are given. Copyright © 2014, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - We are faced with the problem of energy/carbon dioxide (CO2) in the coming decades. Microalgae has been considered as one of the most promising biomass feedstocks for the production of biofuels. Meanwhile, the productivity of these photosynthetic microorganisms in converting CO2 into carbon-rich lipids, which are only a step or two away from biodiesel, significantly exceed that of agricultural crops without competing for arable land. Worldwide, research and demonstration programs are being carried out to develop the technologies required to expand algal lipid production from a craft to a major industrial process. This paper describes the recent advances on microalgae used for biofuel (e.g., biohydrogen, biodiesel and bioethanol) production, including their cultivation, harvesting, and processing. In addition, the various aspects associated with the design of microalgae production units are described, providing an overview of the current state of the development of algae cultivation systems (photobioreactors and open ponds). Algal cultivation systems integrated with algae-based biorefineries could yield diverse bioresources, such as biodiesel, green gasoline, bio-jet fuel, isolated proteins, food starches, textiles, organic fertilizers, which can mitigate the costs of biofuel production. Algae cultivation becomes a closed-loop engineered ecosystem by utilizing the energy, nutrients and CO2 held within residual waste materials to provide all necessary inputs except sunlight. Consequently, developing this biotechnology is a tangible step towards a waste-free sustainable society. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014.

AB  - The notion to provide ignition support for the effective operation of lower cetane fuels in a diesel engine has been ably adopted in the present study for the sole fuel operation of pine oil biofuel. Having noted that the lower cetane number and higher self-ignition temperature of pine oil biofuel would inhibit its direct use in a diesel engine, combined ignition support in the form of preheating the inlet air and installing a glow plug in the cylinder head has been provided to improve the auto-ignition of pine oil. While, an air preheater, installed in the inlet manifold of the engine, preheated the inlet air so as to provide ignition assistance partially, the incorporation of glow plug in the cylinder head imparted the further required ignition support appropriately. Subsequently, the operational feasibility of neat pine oil biofuel has been examined in a single cylinder diesel engine and the engine test results were analyzed. From the experimental investigation, though the engine performance and emissions such as CO (carbon monoxide) and smoke were noted to be better for pine oil with an inlet air temperature of 40°C, the engine suffered the setback of knocking due to delayed SOC (start of combustion). However, with the ignition support through glow plug and preheating of inlet air, the engine knocking was prevented and the normal operation of the engine was ensured. Categorically, at an inlet air temperature of 60°C, BTE (brake thermal efficiency) was found to be in par with diesel, while emissions such as CO and smoke were reduced by 13.2% and 16.8%, respectively, for neat pine oil biofuel at full load condition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel also called as fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) has become more attractive because of its environmental benefits. Biodiesel is the most promising renewable, biodegradable, alternative fuel is produced from various lipids sources. Here the municipal secondary sewage sludge is taken as potential sources of lipids. The potential of using sludge from municipal waste water treatment plant as feedstock for lipid is investigated because of disposal problems occurring due to increase of urbanization and industrialization. The secondary or activated sludge composed of suspended solids and microbial cells containing phospholipids produced during aerobic biological treatment. In this study, analyses were done on lipid extraction and biodiesel production from dried secondary sludge. A maximum of lipids was extracted using hexane and methanol as solvent from secondary sludge. FAME is obtained from triglycerides by acid - catalyzed transesterification using sulfuric acid. Once the biodiesel is produced it is analyzed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry(GC-MS). GC-MS method is used for determination of fatty acid, esters,alcohol, mono,di,tri glycerides obtained. The analysis of FAME revealed fatty acids composition with predominance of palmitic acid, steric acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid.

AB  - Microalgae, an autotrophic organism has been established as a potential source for biodiesel production. Suitable candidates from marine origin have been selected as viz., Nannochloropsis oculata, Dunaliella salina, and Isochrysis galbana. The microalgae were grown in controlled conditions and an assessment of their growth rate and lipid productivity were made. To analyze the effect of temperature on the growth of different microalga, temperature stress was induced. Biochemical changes in the culture and changes in fatty acid profiles of the culture before and after temperature stress are reported. Temperature stress increased lipid productivity in microalgae. The lipid obtained from microalgae were converted to biodiesel by chemical transesterification. Also the biodiesel thus obtained was mixed with commercial diesel to produce biodiesel blend in different ratios. The biodiesel properties of Biodiesel 20, Biodiesel 50 and Biodiesel 100 (pure biodiesel), were comparable to that of commercial diesel.

AB  - In this investigation the extraction of oil from Sardinella longiceps fish were performed by using Bligh and Dyer method To know the functional groups of the extracted fish oil FT-IR analysis was performed using IR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 8400S) system. The physio-chemical properties of extracted fish oil Sardinella longiceps was characterized and the results were tabulated. The results revealed the presence of alcohols and phenols, carboxylic acids, alkanes, boron compounds, esters, saturated aliphatic, aromatics, halogen compounds and phosphorus compounds in the fish oil. The performance and emission characteristics of the test engine were investigated at different loads with Sardine Fish oil – Diesel blends of R20,R40, R60 and diesel. The effects of the Sardine Fish Oil-Diesel Blended fuels on the engine brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), exhaust gas temperature (EGT) and exhaust emissions were investigated. Experimental results reveal that there is an increase in BSFC and decrease in BTE when the fish oil content in the test fuel is increased. Emission analysis reveals that there is an increase in NOx emission for all SFO Diesel blends when compared to diesel, whereas there is a significant reduction in CO2, and Smoke emissions for SFO blends than diesel. From the engine test results it can be concluded that 20% of Sardine Fish Oil can be substituted for diesel without any engine modification as a fuel. © 2014, Sphinx Knowledge House.

AB  - Biodiesel is a clean-burning renewable substitute fuel for conventional petroleum diesel, which is made from vegetable oils or animal fats by a monoalcoholic transesterification process. Biodiesel production using nanocatalyst is one of the approaches in the search of alternative fuel. In this present investigation, the synthesized iron nanoparticles were used as a nanocatalyst for the production of biodiesel using Pongamia pinnata oil with methanol. The transesterification reaction for the conversion of triglycerides into fatty acid methyl esters was carried out at a molar ratio of 3:1 methanol to oil, reaction time of 2 h, stirring speed of 400 rpm at 65°C. The amount of iron nanoparticles used for this study was 1% (wt/wt). The physico-chemical properties of the Pongamia pinnata fatty acid methyl esters including specific gravity, kinematic viscosity, flash point, cloud point, water content, carbon residue, refractive index, copper corrosion and calorific value were 0.873, 4.6 mm2/s at 40°C, 178 °C, 5°C, 0.012 vol. %, 0.033 mass %, 1.445, 1b and 3788 cal/gm respectively. The obtained values of physico-chemical properties are in accordance with the specifications of biodiesel as per ASTM D6751 standard. These findings conclude that the synthesized iron nanoparticles acted as a catalyst to produce biodiesel and the obtained biodiesel was considered as suitable alternatives to the conventional diesel. © 2014, Sphinx Knowledge House.

AB  - The world is entering into a new era in a few years but the most required fuel sources are depleting at a rate which that we cannot control. The increase use of the fossil fuels are also effecting the environment by the emission of CO2 gases in the atmosphere, which are resulting in increase in global temperature. Thus a new fuel source which has less CO2 emission and is economically feasible is required. The production of bio-diesel from algae is one such promising method. The bio-diesel is having less CO2 and NOx emissions. As the algae are grown in CO2 rich environment it helps us to reuse the CO2 in the air. In this paper the transesterification of micro and macro algae and their yield and the property of the bio-diesel produced are compared. The comparison was made between the Oedigonium species which is a macro algae and the Nanochloropsis species which is a microalgae. © 2014, Sphinx Knowledge House. All rights reserved.

AB  - Colonial, green alga Botryococcus braunii is rich in biodiesel components hydrocarbons and oils and is one of the possible sources of renewable biofuel. Since NaCl has been reported to stimulate oil and hydrocarbon production in this alga, the study has been targeted at the potential application of vast resource of salt-rich sea water for its commercial cultivation. Chu-13 nutrient medium prepared in sea water exhibited a marked positive impact on hydrocarbon and oil content of the isolated algal strains without much affecting the growth. Moreover, this medium in sea water was also lethal for Anopheles mosquito larvae which cause substantial losses of algal biomass during their outdoor cultivation. There was significant effect on the relative ratios of various types of oils and hydrocarbons produced by the algal strains in response to sea water. This finding suggests the possible exploitation of NaCl-rich sea water for outdoor commercial cultivation of B. braunii for biomass and bioenergy production. © 2014 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

AB  - A physical model based on a thermodynamic analysis was designed to characterize the combustion reaction parameters. The time-variations of pressure and temperature required for the calculation of specific heat ratio are obtained from the solution of energy conservation equation. The chemical combustion of biofuel is modeled by an overall reaction in two-steps. The rich mixture and EGR were varied to obtain the optimum operating conditions for the engine. The NOx formation is modeled by using an eight-species six-step mechanism. The effect of various formation steps of NOx in combustion is considered via a phenomenological model of combustion speed. This simplified model, which has been validated by the most available published results, is used to characterize and control, in real time, the impact of biofuel on engine performances and NOx emissions as well. It has been demonstrated that a delay of the ignition timing leads to an increase of the gas mixture temperature and cylinder pressure. Furthermore, it has been found that the CO is lower near the stoichiometry. Nevertheless, we notice that lower rich mixture values result in small NOx emission rates. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In a global context in which obtaining new energy sources is of paramount importance, the production of biodiesel from plant crops is a potentially viable alternative to the use of fossil fuels. Among the species used to produce the raw material for biodiesel, Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) has enjoyed increased popularity in recent years, due partly to its ability to grow in degraded zones and under arid and semi-arid conditions. The present study evaluates the potential for JCL production under irrigation with non-conventional water resources in abandoned agricultural soils of the island of Fuerteventura (Canary Islands, Spain), which is one of the most arid parts of the European Union. JCL growth and productivity are compared during the first 39 months of cultivation in two soil types (clay-loam and sandy-loam) and with two irrigation water qualities: recycled urban wastewater (RWW) and desalinated brackish water (DBW). The results indicate that JCL growth (in terms of plant height and stem diameter) was significantly influenced both by soil type and water quality, with better development observed in the sandy-loam soil under RWW irrigation. Productivity, measured as cumulative seed production, was not affected by soil type but was affected by water quality. Production under RWW irrigation was approximately seven times greater than with DBW (mean ~2142 vs. 322 kg · ha-1). The higher nutrient content, especially P, K and Mg, and lower B content of the RWW were found to be key factors in the greater productivity observed under irrigation with this type of water. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - The use of alternative fuels for the mitigation of ecological impacts by use of diesel has been focus of intensive research. In the present work, algal oils extracted from cultivated biomass of Cladophora sp., Spirogyra sp. and Oedogonium sp. were evaluated for the lipase-mediated synthesis of fatty acid monoalkyl esters (FAME, biodiesel). To optimize the transesterification of these oils, different parameters such as the alkyl group donor, reaction temperature, stirring time and oil to alcohol ratio were investigated. Four different alcohols i.e. methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and n-butanol were tested as alkyl group donor for the biosynthesis FAME and methanol was found to be the best. Similarly, temperature 50 C and stirring time of 6 h were optimized for the transesterification of oils with methanol. The maximum biodiesel conversions from Cladophora (75.0%), Spirogyra (87.5%) and Oedogonium (92.0%) were obtained when oil to alcohol ratio was 1 : 8.

AB  - Greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted by road transport vehicles as a direct result of fossil fuel combustion and other environmental pollutants released throughout the life cycle of petroleum based fuels, encourage a shift towards alternative transport fuels. Within this frame, an environmental assessment was performed so as to evaluate the environmental implications of alternative fuels (natural gas and biofuels) penetration in the city buses of the city of Athens. The results are evaluated in terms of CO2, CO, HC, PM and NOx emissions. The findings show that CO2 emissions are significantly reduced in CNG buses compared to diesel powered buses. CO2 emissions can also be reduced by 7.85% in B10 blends and 78.45% in B100 blends, compared to diesel. The environmental assessment can be considered as a basis so as to investigate the viability of replacement of petroleum- based diesel with natural gas and biofuels in city transport buses. Concepts for sustainable bus transportation can be incorporated using the methodology defined in this study, in order to promote a sustainable transportation system and mitigate the climate change. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Four lipid extraction methods (Bligh & Dyer, hexane & isopropanol, dichloromethane & methanol, and hexane) were evaluated to extract lipid from freeze- and oven-dried fungus Mortierella isabellina ATCC42613. The highest lipid yield (41.8%) was obtained from Bligh & Dyer extraction on the oven-dried fungal biomass with a methanol:chloroform:water ratio of 2:1:0.8. Other lipid extraction methods on both freeze- and oven-dried samples had lipid yields ranging from 20.7% to 35.9%. Non-polar lipid was the main lipid class (more than 90% of total lipid) in M. isabellina. Regarding fatty acid profile, there was no significant difference on fatty acid concentration between different drying and extraction methods. Estimation of biodiesel fuel properties using correlative models further demonstrated that the fungal biodiesel is a good alternative to fossil diesel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work describes the use of intermediate pyrolysis system to produce liquid, gaseous and solid fuels from pelletised wood and barley straw feedstock. Experiments were conducted in a pilot-scale system and all products were collected and analysed. The liquid products were separated into an aqueous phase and an organic phase (pyrolysis oil) under gravity. The oil yields were 34.1. wt.% and 12.0. wt.% for wood and barley straw, respectively. Analysis found that both oils were rich in heterocyclic and phenolic compounds and have heating values over 24. MJ/kg. The yields of char for both feedstocks were found to be about 30. wt.%, with heating values similar to that of typical sub-bituminous class coal. Gas yields were calculated to be approximately 20. wt.%. Studies showed that both gases had heating values similar to that of downdraft gasification producer gas. Analysis on product energy yields indicated the process efficiency was about 75%. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Due to the fast fossil fuel depletion and at the same time global warming phenomenon anticipated for the next coming years, the necessity of developing alternative fuels e.g. biofuels (i.e. bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas and etc.) has turned into an important concern. Recently, the application of the bio-solvency properties of biodiesel for recycling waste polymers has been highlighted. However, the impact of polymer dissolution on cold flow characteristics of biodiesel was never investigated. The present study was set to explore the impact of different solvents in stabilizing biodiesel-polymer solution. Among them, acetone was proved to be the best fuel stabilizer. Subsequently, cold flow characteristic i.e. cloud point, of the biodiesel-polymer-acetone fuel was found to have improved (decreased) due to the inclusion of acetone. Finally, flash point analysis of the fuel blends containing acetone was done to ensured high safety of the fuel blend by dramatically increasing the flash point values of biodiesel-polymer fuel blends. © 2014 BRTeam.

AB  - Microalgal bioenergy systems are gaining attention as a commercial biotechnical platform for producing renewable transportation fuels. In recent years, process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) has been extensively applied to understand the life cycle environmental impacts of emerging microalgal biofuel systems. However, conventional process-based LCA fails to account for the role of ecological goods and services within fuel and product life cycles. Additionally, traditional life cycle energy analysis suffers from several limitations such as ignoring the difference in quality and substitutability of resources, and accounting for only the first law of thermodynamics. To address these shortcomings, a hybrid Ecologically based-LCA (EcoLCA) model is developed to quantify the contribution of ecological resources within the algae-to-fuel supply chain and to compare the resource intensity of producing microalgal derived renewable diesel (RD) to that of petroleum diesel (PD). Multiple thermodynamic return on investment (ROI) metrics and performance indicators are used to quantify the consumption of ecological goods and services, environmental impacts, and resource intensity of producing microalgal RD. Results indicate that the quality corrected thermodynamic return on investment and renewability index for microalgal RD ranges from 0.17 to 0.44 and 3.51% to 6.36% respectively, depending on the choice of coproduct options and processing technologies. This work reveals that algae-to-fuel systems are highly dependent on non-renewable ecological resources reflected in their low renewability index; have a low quality corrected thermodynamic ROI (<1) and thus are not energetically viable; and are more ecologically resource intensive as compared to their petroleum equivalent - potentially negating their environmental benefits. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.

AB  - The relation between spray quality and combustion performance in a micro gas turbine has been studied by burning a viscous biofuel at different fuel injection conditions. Emissions from the combustion of a viscous mixture of straight vegetable oils have been compared to reference measurements with diesel No. 2. The effect of fuel viscosity on pollutant emissions is determined by adjusting the injection temperature. The measurements confirm that a reduction in fuel viscosity improves the spray quality, resulting in faster droplet evaporation and more complete combustion. CO emission levels were observed to decrease linearly with viscosity in the tested range. For the pressure-swirl nozzle used in the tests, the upper viscosity limit is found to be 9 cP. Above this value, droplet evaporation seems to be incomplete as the exhaust gas contains a considerable amount of unburned fuel. Additionally, the influence of increased injection pressure and combustor temperature is evaluated by varying the load. Adding more load resulted in improved combustion when burning diesel. In case of vegetable oil, however, this trend is less consistent as the decrease in CO emissions is not observed over the full load range. The outcome of this study gives directions for the application of pyrolysis oil in gas turbines, a more advanced biofuel with high viscosity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many observers view Jatropha as a miracle plant that grows in harsh environments, halts land degradation and provides seeds for fuel production. This makes it particularly attractive for use in Ethiopia, where poverty levels are high and the degradation of agricultural land is widespread. In this article, we investigate the potentials and limitations of a government-initiated Jatropha project for smallholders in northeastern Ethiopia from a green economy perspective. Data are based on a 2009 household survey and interviews with key informants, as well as on a 2012 follow-up round of interviews with key informants. We conclude that the project has not contributed to a greener economy so far, but has the potential to do so in the future. To maximize Jatropha's potential, interventions must focus mainly on smallholders and pay more attention to the entire biofuel value chain. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - Crude glycerol, an inevitable byproduct during biodiesel production, is emerging as a potential feedstock for fermentation, due to its availability and a reasonable price. The anaerobic digestion of glycerol derived from biodiesel manufacturing, in which COD was found to be 1010 g/kg, was studied in batch laboratory-scale reactors. Dissimilation of glycerol by Escherichia coli is strictly linked to their capacity to synthesize the highly reduced product 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO). The present study is focus on the development of adaptive mutant strains of Escherichia coli EC-MW (ATCC 11105), through microwave irradiation, at frequency 2.45 GHz and irradiation time 5 min pulse irradiation. The mutants were used for high bioethanol production from glycerol feedstock. Consequently, glycerol oxidative pathway (bioethanol) enhanced upon the parallel reduction in the 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) pathway. The modified E. coli strains were able to increase bioethanol production upon fermentation reaching the level 280 g/L.

AB  - This paper presents results from comprehensive field surveys of jatropha projects in Mozambique, Tanzania and Mali in 2012. The article singles out the salient economic and social impact results and derives lessons. The results clearly demonstrate the weak business case for jatropha biofuel production at this time. Plantations were found to be unviable because of insurmountable up-front capital requirements in combination with slow and unreliable crop maturation, inefficient oil pressing owing to a lack of scale and experience, inadequate utilization of by-products, and competitively-priced fossil diesel and palm oil. For smallholders, jatropha only has limited value as a hedge crop in environmentally and economically disadvantaged areas. Better prospects have to wait for the advent of improved jatropha varieties. Social impacts from the perspective of project managers were rather mixed: overall, food security perceptions were positive and no massive forced human displacements were noted so far, though some disputes over land access and compensation were reported. Labor legislation was apparently respected on plantations, and positive gender effects, regional income/employment effects and better public facilities were also reported. The projects generated considerable employment, albeit mostly of a temporary nature, as lack of economic viability had caused many projects to close down again. When introducing next-generation biofuel projects, bettermonitoring by various actor groups is recommended, as well as long-term investment plans that include integral exit strategies. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The depleting, non-renewable energy sources and enhancing environmental pollution has fuelled the necessity of an alternative energy source. Bio diesel is one such renewable, alternative fuel that has drawn attention due to feasibility in its production from "soap stock", which is a refinery byproduct of vegetable oils and is having high free fatty acid (FFA) content. The production of biodiesel from soap stock (ss) is a viable process since it is not involved in the utilization of edible vegetable oils. It is an ecofriendly fuel due to liberation of low amounts of CO2when compared with petro diesel and hence reduces global warming and its consequences. It is necessary to look about a suitable catalyst that can convert FFA of soap stock into mono alkyl esters on reaction with a monohydric alcohol. So, a two-step heterogeneous catalysis process is selected for conversion of FFA of soap stock into biodiesel via transesterificaction, when treated with methanol in presence of ferric sulphate, which is the catalyst used.

AB  - Microbial lipid is a promising source of oil to produce biofuel if it can be generated from lignocellulosic materials. Mortierella isabellina is a filamentous fungal species featuring high content of oil in its cell biomass. In this work, M. isabellina was studied for lipid production from corn stover. The experimental results showed that M. isabellina could grow on different kinds of carbon sources including xylose and acetate, and the lipid content reached to 35 % at C/N ratio of 20. With dilution, M. isabellina could endure inhibition effects by dilute acid pretreatment of corn stover (0.3 g/L furfural, 1.2 g/L HMF, and 1 g/L 4-hydroxybenozic acid) and the strain formed pellets in the cell cultivations. An integrated process was developed combining the dilute acid pretreatment, cellulase hydrolysis, and cell cultivation for M. isabellina to convert corn stover to oil containing fungal biomass. With 7.5 % pretreated biomass solid loading ratio, the final lipid yield from sugar in pretreated biomass was 40 % and the final lipid concentration of the culture reached to 6.46 g/L. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.

AB  - The paper analyses the impact of: 1) CO2 pricing; 2) using biodiesel on the multimodal freight transport system in and through the Netherlands taking the changes in the transport demands for road, rail, and inland waterway into account. Special attention is given to the impact on the market share of various barge classes in inland waterway transport. This paper presents the GIS-based multimodal flow estimation model which is applied in the scenario analysis to simulate, visualise, and evaluate the impacts of the tested policies. The scenario analysis shows that the impact of CO2 pricing is limited in terms of both reducing CO2 emissions and realising modal shift. Pricing CO2 at €90 per ton or using biodiesel B30 (a blend of 30% biofuel and 70% diesel) would achieve similar effects on the total transport network cost increase and modal shift from road to intermodal transport. The analysis shows also that the largest class of barge (VIb) would be less cost efficient than class Va barges if the fuel costs increased by 50%, because the benefit gained by Va barges from less fuel consumption per TEU per km would be higher than the cost saving per TEU per km gained by VIb barges from the scale economy of barge size.

AB  - Singapore has pledged to attain 7-11% Business-As-Usual carbon emissions reduction by 2020. About 19% of CO2 contribution stemmed from road transport in 2005. Commercial vehicles, which uses mainly diesel, consumed 695 million litres diesel in 2012. An estimated 115,585 tonnes or 127 million litres cooking oils (derived from seeds/fruits) were consumed in 2010, in which the bulk of used cooking oil is re-incorporated into the food preparation process while only a small amount is being recycled into biodiesel or disposed into the sewerage. Nevertheless, the present research reveals that biodiesel derived from spent cooking oil has potential to be a viable fuel supplement. Surveys were carried out involving three market segments - suppliers, processors and end-users - to identify the barriers and obstacles in mass production of biodiesel. A key enabler of biodiesel as a fuel supplement towards a greener environment lies in government mandate/policies in promoting greater biodiesel usage. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Clostridium pasteurianum cells immobilized on silica were used as biocatalysts for bioconversion of both pure and biodiesel-derived crude glycerol to butanol, 1,3-propanediol (PDO) and ethanol. Among five concentrations (1, 2, 3, 5, 10 % w/v) of cell immobilized support studied, 3 % w/v cell immobilized support performed the best and was chosen for further studies. The cross-linked cells produced higher amount of solvents than non-cross linked cells. The flow cytometric results revealed that presence of pure as well as crude glycerol had no adverse effect on cellular morphology of C. pasteurianum. The maximum yields of butanol, ethanol and 1,3-PDO obtained with immobilized cells were 0.36 (25 g/L pure glycerol), 0.11 (10 g/L pure glycerol) and 0.54 g/g (10 g/L pure glycerol), respectively. Among the three crude glycerol concentrations studied, 25 g/L crude glycerol gave maximum yield of n-butanol (0.23 g/g), and 5 g/L crude glycerol formed maximum 1,3-PDO (0.61 g/g). Only traces of ethanol were detected at all concentrations of crude glycerol studied. A comparison of free and immobilized cells revealed that immobilized cells performed better than free cells for mixed alcohols production at higher concentrations of both pure and crude glycerol. Thus, the use of immobilized cells is a viable option for converting high concentrations of biodiesel derived crude glycerol into alternate energy sources. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The role of bio-derived, eco-friendly products such as butanol and ethanol as an additive in petro-diesel has been studied. Dispersion properties and physical stability of the blends have been ascertained with the aid of transmittance and backscattering profiles. Combustion phenomenon of blended fuel when monitored shows rapid ignition as compared to diesel, thereby suggesting reduction in ignition delay. Engine performance experiments are carried out in single cylinder compression ignition (CI) engine and the results show marginal reduction in brake thermal efficiency and exhaust gas temperatures as compared to diesel. A reduction of 3.5% in fuel consumption is observed with blend as compared to that with diesel for generating equivalent brake power. Physical properties such as density, viscosity, net calorific value, cetane index and copper strip corrosion are determined and found in accordance with ASTM standards. Reduction in size of soot particles is observed at the end of blend combustion.

AB  - In the current research work, effect of microwave irradiation energy on the esterification of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) to produce PFAD methyl ester / biodiesel was intensively appraised. The PFAD is a by-product from refinery of crude palm oil consisting >85% of free fatty acid (FFA). The esterification reaction process with acid catalyst is needed to convert the FFA into fatty acid methyl ester or known as biodiesel. In this work, fabricated microwave-pulse width modulation (MPWM) reactor with controlled temperature was designed to be capable to increase the PFAD biodiesel production rate. The classical optimization technique was used in order to study the relationship and the optimum condition of variables involved. Consequently, by using MPWM reactor, mixture of methanol-to-PFAD molar ratio of 9:1, 1 wt.% of sulfuric acid catalyst, at 55°C reaction temperature within 15 min reaction time gave 99.5% of FFA conversion. The quality assessment and properties of the product were analyzed according to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), European (EN) standard methods and all results were in agreement with the standard requirements. It revealed that the use of fabricated MPWM with controlled temperature was significantly affecting the rate of esterification reaction and also increased the production yield of PFAD methyl ester. © 2014 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - Ketchup is highly viscous and contains high concentrations of carbohydrates. These properties make waste ketchup more costly to treat prior to disposal. In this study ketchup was used to grow Ochromonas danica, a phagotrophic microalga that can produce and accumulate intracellular lipids using soluble or particulate organic substrates. Effects of the following factors on high-density O. danica fermentation were evaluated: nitrogen source, pH, temperature, agitation speed, aeration method, dissolved oxygen concentration, and nutrient feeding strategy. Under the optimized conditions the alga grew with a doubling time of about 10 h. Cell yield and intracellular lipid yield from the consumed ketchup carbohydrate were 40% and 18%, respectively. The intracellular lipid content could be raised to 40%. The developed process may also be applied to effectively convert other organic wastes to algal lipids, for use as, e.g., biofuel feedstock. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With many of the poor people in Brazil living in rural areas, local governments have intensified their efforts to design and implement effective policies that boost rural development. In 2004, a national program for production and use of biodiesel was launched aiming at increasing income among less endowed family farmers across the country. With expectations building on further expansion of the mandatory blending of biodiesel with fossil diesel, national and local government bodies are challenged by the search for policies able to foster biodiesel crop production through the wider cultivation of crops that produce more oil than soybean (e.g. sunflower and castor bean) and by improving the participation of less endowed farmers, especially in semi-arid regions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to perform an ex-ante integrated assessment of the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of four biodiesel policy scenarios towards different farm types in a semi-arid and more humid region of southeast Brazil. The applied modelling framework was a combination of a technical coefficient generator (TechnoGIN) and a bio-economic farm model (FSSIM). We explored the impact of market-driven (bonus price policy), input provision (fertiliser and land preparation policy) and oil production (oil mill policy) policy scenarios on soybean farmers in Chapada Gaúcha and maize/beans farmers in Montes Claros. The impacts of the different policies on farm gross margins, oil crop production, labour requirements, nitrogen losses and biocide residues were assessed against the baseline scenario. Our results indicated that the scope for biodiesel crops on smallholder, non-soybean producers in Montes Claros is less evident than in Chapada Gaúcha, particularly among the less endowed farmers for whom the increase in farm gross margin in all scenarios is limited to only 6% while oil production was 140. kg per farm, which is very low compared to the 41% increase and more than 48,000. kg of oil of soybean producers. The most effective policy scenario was the provision of inputs such as fertiliser and land preparation. Because in Montes Claros farmers have limited access to fertiliser, machinery and biocides, strategies that enable farmers to increase their cropped area (i.e. land preparation policy more than doubled the crop area) and crop yield levels (i.e. fertiliser policy almost quadrupled crop yields) have highest potential to benefit these farming systems. © 2014.

AB  - The global warming and shortage of energy are two critical problems for human social development. CO2 mitigation and replacing conventional diesel with biodiesel are effective routes to reduce these problems. Production of microalgal lipids as biodiesel feedstock by a freshwater microalga, Chlorella vulgaris, with the ability to fixate CO2 is studied in this work. The results show that nitrogen deficiency, CO2 volume fraction and photoperiod are the key factors responsible for the lipid accumulation in C. vulgaris. With 5% CO2, 0.75g/L of NaNO3 and 18:6h of light/dark cycle, the lipid content and overall lipid productivity reached 14.5% and 33.2mg/(L·day), respectively. Furthermore, we proposed a technique to enhance the microalgal lipid productivity by activating acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) with an enzyme activator. Citric acid and Mg2+ were found to be efficient enzyme activators of ACCase. With the addition of 150mg/L of citric acid or 1.5mmol/L of MgCl2, the lipid productivity reached 39.1 and 38.0mg/(L·day), respectively, which was almost twofold of the control. This work shows that it is practicable to produce lipids by freshwater microalgae that can fixate CO2, and provides a potential route to solving the global warming and energy shortage problems.

AB  - This study presents experimental measurements of the biochemical methane production for whole and lipid extracted Nannochloropsis salina. Results show whole microalgae produced 430cm3-CH4g-volatile solids-1 (g-VS) (σ=60), 3 times more methane than was produced by the LEA, 140cm3-CH4g-VS-1 (σ=30). Results illustrate current anaerobic modeling efforts in microalgae to biofuel assessments are not reflecting the impact of lipid removal. On a systems level, the overestimation of methane production is shown to positively skew the environmental impact of the microalgae to biofuels process. Discussion focuses on a comparison results to those of previous anaerobic digestion studies and quantifies the corresponding change in greenhouse gas emissions of the microalgae to biofuels process based on results from this study. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study we tried to develop, test and optimize a batch microwave system using waste cooking vegetable oil (WCVO) that was used as biodiesel feedstock. Two catalysts, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were tested in this study. Transesterification reactions between oil and methanol were carried out in presence of microwaves. It was observed that by using of microwaves, the reaction times were drastically reduced. As high as 99.5% conversions could be achieved for 0.5% KOH concentration. Moreover, quality analysis of biodiesels according to international standards was performed and the samples were found to meet the necessary specifications.

AB  - A new biofuel similar to biodiesel was obtained in the 1,3-selective transesterification reaction of sunflower oil with ethanol using as biocatalyst a Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ROL) immobilized on Sepiolite, an inorganic support. The studied lipase was a low cost powdered enzyme preparation, Biolipase-R, from Biocon-Spain, a multipurpose additive used in food industry. In this respect, it is developed a study to optimize the immobilization procedure of these lipases on Sepiolite. Covalent immobilization was achieved by the development of an inorganic-organic hybrid linker formed by a functionalized hydrocarbon chain with a pendant benzaldehyde, bonded to the AlPO4 support surface. Thus, the covalent immobilization of lipases on amorphous AlPO 4/sepiolite (20/80 wt %) support was evaluated by using two different linkers (p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and benzylamine-terephthalic aldehyde, respectively). Besides, the catalytic behavior of lipases after physical adsorption on the demineralized sepiolite was also evaluated. Obtained results indicated that covalent immobilization with the p-hydroxybenzaldehyde linker gave the best biocatalytic behavior. Thus, this covalently immobilized lipase showed a remarkable stability as well as an excellent capacity of reutilization (more than five successive reuses) without a significant loss of its initial catalytic activity. This could allow a more efficient fabrication of biodiesel minimizing the glycerol waste production. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - A life cycle assessment study is performed for the energy requirements and greenhouse gas emissions in an algal biodiesel production system. Subcritical water (SCW) extraction was applied for extracting bio-crude oil from algae, and conventional transesterification method was used for converting the algal oil to biodiesel. 58MJ of energy is required to produce 1kg of biodiesel without any co-products management, of which 36% was spent on cultivation and 56% on lipid extraction. SCW extraction with thermal energy recovery reduces the energy consumption by 3-5 folds when compared to the traditional solvent extraction. It is estimated that 1kg of algal biodiesel fixes about 0.6kg of CO2. An optimized case considering the energy credits from co-products could further reduce the total energy demand. The energy demand for producing 1kg of biodiesel in the optimized case is 28.23MJ. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel quality associated with biochemical components of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Scenedesmus obliquus under different nitrate levels were investigated. The highest lipid contents of 54.5% for C. pyrenoidosa and 47.7% for S. obliquus were obtained in nitrate absence. Carbohydrate peaked at 0.3gL-1 with values of 40.7% for C. pyrenoidosa and 42.5% for S. obliquus. Protein content seemed species dependent, which decreased substantially to 11.2% in C. pyrenoidosa and 8.8% in S. obliquus under nitrate absence in present research. Better biodiesel quality (e.g. cetane number &gt;58, iodine value &lt;69) could be obtained from C. pyrenoidosa in nitrate absence and S. obliquus in 0.3gL-1, where the highest saturated fatty acids (39.5 for C. pyrenoidosa, 31.2 for S. obliquus) and the lowest unsaturated fatty acids (60.5 for C. pyrenoidosa, 68.8 for S. obliquus) were obtained. These results suggest that microalgae grown in the presence of nitrogen may limit biodiesel quality. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae were selected and isolated from acid mine drainage in order to find microalgae species which could be cultivated in low pH condition. In the present investigation, 30 microalgae were isolated from ten locations of acid mine drainage in South Korea. Four microalgae were selected based on their growth rate, morphology, and identified as strains of KGE1, KGE3, KGE4, and KGE7. The dry biomass of microalgae species ranged between 1 and 2 g L -1 after 21 days of cultivation. The growth kinetics of microalgae was well described by logistic growth model. Among these, KGE7 has the highest biomass production (2.05±0.35 g L-1), lipid productivity (0.82±0.14 g L-1), and C16-C18 fatty acid contents (97.6 %). These results suggest that Scenedesmus sp. KGE 7 can be utilized for biodiesel production based on its high biomass and lipid productivity. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.

AB  - Biodiesel has proven to be a reasonable substitute to petroleum diesel owing to continuous depletion and pollution caused by the latter. The uncomplicated process of production of fatty acid methyl ester or biodiesel as it is commercially known has made it an even better substitute of fossil diesel. The preparation of biodiesel involves the use of alcohol (methanol) and hydroxides (NaOH). There is a possibility that some of these compounds remain unreacted and needs to be washed with water. This residue water containing alcohol and hydroxide residues if discharged in the soil may affect its quality. This research paper deals with the effect of biodiesel effluent on various physicochemical properties of soil. The result of the research proves that the biodiesel effluent if discharged in soil will degrade soil quality. © Springer International Publishing 2014.

AB  - This article presents a study on screening of microalgal strains from the Peking University Algae Collection and heterotrophic cultivation for biodiesel production of a selected microalgal strain. Among 89 strains, only five were capable of growing under heterotrophic conditions in liquid cultures and Chlorella sp. PKUAC 102 was found the best for the production of heterotrophic algal biodiesel. Composition of the growth medium was optimised using response surface methodology and optimised growth conditions were successfully used for cultivation of the strain in a fermentor. Conversion of algal lipids to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) showed that the lipid profile of the heterotrophically cultivated Chlorella sp. PKUAC 102 contains fatty acids suitable for biodiesel production. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.

AB  - Some species of microalgae have high productivity and lipid content, which makes them good candidates for biodiesel production. Biomass separation and cell disruption are important steps in biodiesel production from microalgae. In this work, we explored the fundamentals of electroflotation by alternating current (EFAC) with non-consumable electrodes to simultaneously harvest microalgae and disrupt cells from mixed microalgae obtained from waste stabilization ponds. The harvesting ef ficiency was evaluated using chlorophyll-a and turbidity, which reached removals of 99% and 95%, respectively, during a batch time of 140 min. Cell disruption was evaluated using lipid extraction, and the best results were achieved with a batch time of 140 min, which resulted in a 14% yield. Therefore, EFAC was shown to be an attractive potential technology for simultaneous microalgal harvesting and cell disruption. © IWA Publishing 2014.

AB  - Oil and natural gas exploration and production (E&amp;P) activities generate emissions from diesel engines, compressor stations, condensate tanks, leaks and venting of natural gas, construction of well pads, and well access roads that can negatively impact air quality on both local and regional scales. A mobile, autonomous air quality monitoring laboratory was constructed to collect measurements of ambient concentrations of pollutants associated with oil and natural gas E&amp;P activities. This air-monitoring laboratory was deployed to the Allegheny National Forest (ANF) in northwestern Pennsylvania for a campaign that resulted in the collection of approximately 7 months of data split between three monitoring locations between July 2010 and June 2011. The three monitoring locations were the Kane Experimental Forest (KEF) area in Elk County, which is downwind of the Sackett oilfield; the Bradford Ranger Station (BRS) in McKean County, which is downwind of a large area of historic oil and gas productivity; and the U.S. Forest Service Hearts Content campground (HC) in Warren County, which is in an area relatively unimpacted by oil and gas development and which therefore yielded background pollutant concentrations in the ANF. Concentrations of criteria pollutants ozone and NO2 did not vary significantly from site to site; averages were below National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with oil and natural gas (ethane, propane, butane, pentane) were highly correlated. Applying the conditional probability function (CPF) to the ethane data yielded most probable directions of the sources that were coincident with known location of existing wells and activity. Differences between the two impacted and one background site were difficult to discern, suggesting the that the monitoring laboratory was a great enough distance downwind of active areas to allow for sufficient dispersion with background air such that the localized plumes were not detected. Monitoring of pollutants associated with oil and natural gas exploration and production activity at three sites within the Allegheny National Forest (ANF) showed only slight site-to-site differences even with one site far removed from these activities. However, the impact was evident not in detection of localized plumes but in regional elevated ethane concentrations, as ethane can be considered a tracer species for oil and natural gas activity. The data presented serve as baseline conditions for evaluation of impacts from future development of Marcellus or Utica shale gas reserves. Copyright © 2014 A&amp;WMA.

AB  - The European Union develops common EU policy and strategy on biofuels and sustainable bio-economy through several documents. The encouragement of biofuel[U+05F3]s consumption is therefore the obligation of each EU member state. The situation in Slovenian fuel market is presented and compared with other EU countries in the frame of prescribed values from EU directives. Diesel is the most common fuel for transportation needs in Slovenia. The study was therefore performed on diesel. The sampling net was determined in accordance with the fuel consumption statistics of the country. 75 Sampling points were located on different types of roads. The quantity of bio-component in diesel samples was determined by direct LSC method through measurement of C-14 content. The measured values were in the range from 0 up to nearly 6 mass percentage of bio-component in fuel. The method has proved to be appropriate, suitable and effective for studies on the real fuel market. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article details the approach of using untreated oilseed triglycerides (plant oil) that can be produced at local and regional scales to supply fuel for farming operations. The main objective of this research was to conduct fuels and engines testing on triglyceride gasoline blends, congruent with practices already adopted at farm scales. Most farm equipment is powered by diesel engines. One of the major drawbacks of substituting triglycerides for diesel fuel is their density and viscosity in cold conditions. By blending triglycerides with 10% to 30% gasoline, however, their density and viscosity can be lowered, thus allowing the blended fuel substitute to be consumed in an unmodified diesel engine. Blended and unblended triglycerides were tested in 4.5Ll EPA Tier-2 and EPA Tier-3 diesel engines at the CSU Engines &amp; Energy Conversion Laboratory. Maximum power testing was conducted in the field on a tractor. The Cold Filter Plug Point and Cloud Point of these blends were tested. The values differed significantly when compared to diesel. The viscosities were 7X greater than that of diesel. Phosphorous, sulfur, sodium, and potassium contents were greater compared to diesel but within the ASTM 6751 Biodiesel standard limits. The emission testing on the 4.5L Tier-3 engine showed that NOx levels were within ±5% of diesel and PM was within ±10% of diesel for the triglyceride blend. The thermal efficiency was close to diesel while the mass based fuel consumption was approximately 10% higher than that of diesel. Reduction in the peak power was observed due to a reduction in lower heating value. © 2014 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers

AB  - Although biodiesel fuels' use is getting more and more popular, there are only few reports in the literature of poisoning with such agents, and none referring to their preservatives: biocides. We present the management of a 49-year-old Caucasian male who was admitted, after accidental ingestion of biocide solution, in the intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital. In spite of his devastating condition upon arrival to the hospital, he had a remarkable recovery with no local or systemic sequel due to multidisciplinary and early supportive approach of his care.

AB  - A controlled field experiment was conducted to assess the potential for fermentative-methanogenic biostimulation (by ammonium-acetate injection) to enhance biodegradation of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in groundwater contaminated with biodiesel B20 (20:80 v/v soybean biodiesel and diesel). Changes in microbial community structure were assessed by pyrosequencing 16S rRNA analyses. BTEX and PAH removal began 0.7 year following the release, concomitantly with the increase in the relative abundance of Desulfitobacterium and Geobacter spp. (from 5 to 52.7 % and 15.8 to 37.3 % of total Bacteria 16S rRNA, respectively), which are known to anaerobically degrade hydrocarbons. The accumulation of anaerobic metabolites acetate and hydrogen that could hinder the thermodynamic feasibility of BTEX and PAH biotransformations under fermentative/methanogenic conditions was apparently alleviated by the growing predominance of Methanosarcina. This suggests the importance of microbial population shifts that enrich microorganisms capable of interacting syntrophically to enhance the feasibility of fermentative-methanogenic bioremediation of biodiesel blend releases. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The use of residues or wastes in biofuel production is a potential solution to the questioned increase of the food market price. The hydrogenation (more specifically hydrodeoxygenation) of residues or wastes rich in free fatty acids seems to be an interesting option for the valorisation of this type of feedstock. The major obstacle of this process is the high temperature and high H2 pressure process requirement. The way to reduce it is the use of a co-solvent e.g. supercritical fluids. At supercritical conditions, CO 2 is completely miscible with H2 and at the same time is also a great solvent for non-polar liquids allowing enhanced efficiency of the hydrogenation leading to the ability to perform reactions at milder conditions. This work deals with the heterogeneous hydrogenation of cattle fat in the presence of CO2. Total reaction pressures up to 140 bar at 340 °C and the residence time from 1 to 6 hours as well as the reuse of catalyst were examined. Depending on the chosen reaction conditions a diverse end products can be obtained. The CO2 presence influences positively the concentration of hydrocarbons minimising the presence of glycerides' content in the final product mixture. At elevated CO2 pressure, a high concentration of hydrocarbons simultaneously with a low presence of free fatty acids and glycerides' content in the mixture was obtained. A similar effect was observed for reaction carried out for 6 hours, when above 90 wt% of all hydrocarbons present in the mixture were the saturated ones. Additionally, the reuse of catalyst increases the saturated hydrocarbons' content to values similar to those obtained for reactions with prolonged residence time. In the CO2-assisted reactions, the diesel-like hydrocarbons were formed with at least two fold higher content than in reactions without CO2. © the Partner Organisations 2014.

AB  - The biomass of halophytic microalga Tetrasel mis sp. with 16%. w/w solids was converted into biocrude by a hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) process in a batch reactor at different temperatures (310, 330, 350 and 370. °C) and reaction times (5, 15, 30, 45 and 60. min). The biocrude yield, elemental composition, energy density and severity parameter obtained at various reaction conditions were used to predict the optimum condition for maximum recovery of biocrude with improved quality. This study clearly indicated that the operating condition for obtaining maximum biocrude yield and ideal quality biocrude for refining were different. A maximum biocrude yield of ~65. wt% ash free dry weight (AFDW) was obtained at 350. °C and 5. min, with a severity parameter and energy density of 5.21 and ~35. MJ/kg, respectively. The treatment with 45. min reaction time recorded ~62. wt% (AFDW) yield of biocrude with and energy density of ~39. MJ/kg and higher severity parameter of 7.53. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Global optimization for sustainable design and synthesis of a large-scale algae processing network under economic and environmental criteria is addressed. An algae processing network superstructure including 7800 processing routes is proposed. Based on the superstructure, a multiobjective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is developed to simultaneously optimize the unit cost and the unit global warming potential (GWP). To efficiently solve the nonconvex MINLP model with separable concave terms and mixed-integer fractional terms in the objective functions, a global optimization strategy that integrates a branch-and-refine algorithm based on successive piecewise linear approximations is proposed and an exact parametric algorithm based on Newton's method. Two Pareto-optimal curves are obtained for biofuel production and biological carbon sequestration, respectively. The unit annual biofuel production cost ranges from $7.02/gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE) to $9.71/GGE, corresponding to unit GWP's of 26.491 to 16.52 kg CO2-eq/GGE, respectively. © 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The crude bio-oil produced from the glycerol-assisted liquefaction of swine manure which had large amount of long chain esters, was upgraded by thermal cracking over a modified zeolite catalyst. The effects of thermal cracking temperature (350-425 °C), reaction time (15-60 min) and catalyst loading (0-10 wt%) on the yield and quality of the upgraded oil were analyzed. The yield of upgraded bio-oil decreased with the increase of reaction temperature, reaction time and catalyst loading, but the viscosity, heating value and composition of the upgraded bio-oil became more desirable. Taking into the consideration both the yield and quality of the upgraded bio-oil, the optimal thermal cracking could be achieved over 5 wt% catalyst at 400 °C for 30 min. Under this condition, the yield of upgraded bio-oil was 46.14 wt% of the crude bio-oil, and 62.5% of the energy stored in the crude bio-oil was recovered. The oxygen content of the upgraded bio-oil was 15.04%, which was less than half of the original value of 33.98%. The viscosity of the upgraded bio-oil was 3.6 cP, compared with 188.9 cP for the crude bio-oil. The heating value of the upgraded bio-oil was 41.4 MJ/kg, compared with 30.54 MJ/kg for the crude bio-oil. Both the viscosity and heating value of the upgraded bio-oil were comparable to those of commercial diesel. The GC-MS analysis showed that the catalytic upgrading resulted in the increased cracking of long-chain acid methyl esters (such as hexadecanoic acid methyl ester), forming various alkanes, alkenes and their isomers, and short-chain acid methyl esters (such as heptanoic acid methyl ester). Elevated temperature and high catalyst loading enhanced the selectivity of thermal cracking towards alkanes and alkenes in the upgraded bio-oil. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Processes for the biotechnological production of kerosene and diesel blendstocks are often economically unattractive due to low yields and product titers. Recently, Clostridium acetobutylicum fermentation products acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE) were shown to serve as precursors for catalytic upgrading to higher chain-length molecules that can be used as fuel substitutes. To produce suitable kerosene and diesel blendstocks, the butanol:acetone ratio of fermentation products needs to be increased to 2-2.5:1, while ethanol production is minimized. Here we show that the overexpression of selected proteins changes the ratio of ABE products relative to the wild type ATCC 824 strain. Overexpression of the native alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase (AAD) has been reported to primarily increase ethanol formation in C. acetobutylicum. We found that overexpression of the AADD485G variant increased ethanol titers by 294%. Catalytic upgrading of the 824(aadD485G) ABE products resulted in a blend with nearly 50wt%≤C9 products, which are unsuitable for diesel. To selectively increase butanol production, C. beijerinckii aldehyde dehydrogenase and C. ljungdhalii butanol dehydrogenase were co-expressed (strain designate 824(Cb ald-Cl bdh)), which increased butanol titers by 27% to 16.9gL-1 while acetone and ethanol titers remained essentially unaffected. The solvent ratio from 824(Cb ald-Cl bdh) resulted in more than 80wt% of catalysis products having a carbon chain length≥C11 which amounts to 9.8gL-1 of products suitable as kerosene or diesel blendstock based on fermentation volume. To further increase solvent production, we investigated expression of both native and heterologous chaperones in C. acetobutylicum. Expression of a heat shock protein (HSP33) from Bacillus psychrosaccharolyticus increased the total solvent titer by 22%. Co-expression of HSP33 and aldehyde/butanol dehydrogenases further increased ABE formation as well as acetone and butanol yields. HSP33 was identified as the first heterologous chaperone that significantly increases solvent titers above wild type C. acetobutylicum levels, which can be combined with metabolic engineering to further increase solvent production. © 2014.

AB  - The bioconversion of residual glycerol obtained from biodiesel synthesis into 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) was carried out using Ca-alginate immobilized-cells cultures of Klebsiella pneumoniae BLh-1. The immobilization parameters bead size and cell concentration were determined for the best possible productivity and were found to be 3.4mm and 100mgmL-1, respectively. In 12 h-batch cultivations, immobilized cultures showed a 1,3-PD productivity of 1.85gL-1h-1, up from 1.22gL-1h-1 obtained in 16 h-batch cultivations using free-suspended cells. The possibility of reuse of the biocatalysts was tested in 5-cycles repeated batch cultures, with entrapped cells keeping their operational stability and biological activity, with 1,3-PD productivities as high as 4.48gL-1h-1. Other important metabolites such as 2,3-butanediol and ethanol were also produced (10.11gL-1 and 3.71gL-1, respectively) during the repeated batches. These results show the feasibility of using and further developing immobilized-cell systems of K.pneumoniae for the efficient bioprocessing of residual glycerol. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The government of Mexico is mandating increased use of gasoline-ethanol blends as a method for reducing air pollution. However, tests on light-duty vehicles have revealed mixed results in terms of fuel economy and emissions. In addition, little information on the performance of light-duty vehicles fueled by gasoline-ethanol blends exists outside the conditions in Mexico City. Fuel economy and emission factors for commercial Regular (87 octane) and Premium (92 octane) gasoline were compared to corresponding 5% v/v (E05R/E05P) and 15% v/v (E15R/E15P) ethanol blends under the conditions in Monterrey, Mexico, the third largest urban center in the country. Fuel economy was estimated under real-world driving conditions. CO2, CO, NOx, and unburned hydrocarbons (HC) emissions were measured for cold- and hot-start tests, as well as for constant-speed (40km/h) real in-city driving. The highest fuel economy was achieved with pure gasoline, which decreased by as much as 4.4% when an E05R gasoline blend was used and as much as 9.9% when an E15R blend was evaluated. For the Premium blends, the fuel economy decrease was lower: 2.9% and 5.5%, respectively. Even more significantly, the newest vehicles tested experienced the lowest decrease in fuel economy. Overall, the Premium blends, and in particular the E15P blend, resulted in decreased CO, NOx, and HC emissions. However, mixed results for NOx emissions were obtained during the start tests. In addition, HC emissions were higher for the Premium blends compared to the corresponding Regular blends. CO2 emissions changes were not significant for the constant-speed tests. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nowadays in Europe the demand for diesel fuel is continuously growing, while the demand for gasoline decreases slightly. Currently, the biodiesel is the biofuel which is blended into the gas oil with the highest amount in case of Diesel engines, which can be produced from different, even waste-derived triglycerides (with transesterification with alcohol). Due to the adverse properties of biodiesel the storage stability of biodiesel/diesel blends has to be examined in detail. In our experimental work we investigated the changes in the qualities of biodiesels produced from vegetable oil which contained various waste cooking oil (waste-derived component) share (10, 30, 50%), and its 7 and 10% blends with gas oil in case of long-term (more than 130 weeks) storage. We found that with increasing the proportion of used cooking oil in the vegetable oil used as raw material for biodiesel, the oxidation reactions took place in a greater degree. Biodiesel made from vegetable oils containing 10% used cooking oil was the most applicable for blending; in case of using higher proportion it is very necessary to use a further amount of antioxidant additives to minimize the degradation.

AB  - In the present study, the potential of Cynara C. utilisation for CHP, H2 and syngas production as a precursor for second generation biofuels with respect to CO2 mitigation by means of air gasification was investigated. Gasification was conducted at a temperature range of 700-900°C at atmospheric pressure, with a main parametric study concerning the effects of temperature and various values of λ (0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) on gasification product distribution. The experimental results of Cynara C. gasification showed that the yield (v/v%) of syngas is optimised at a higher temperature and lower λ, while for H2, the maximum yield in v/v% was obtained at a lower temperature. Syngas (H2+CO) reached 72.9 v/v% with a LHV of 9.84MJ/Nm3 (based on N2 free gas) at a temperature of 900°C and λ=0.2. H2 achieved a syngas yield of 22 v/v% at 700°C and λ=0.2. According to the results, producer gas is recommended for H2 production rather than for CHP. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper employs the general equilibrium model MAGNET to assess the effects of the European Commission's proposals for the revision of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) on land use changes in the European Union and worldwide. The focus of the paper is to evaluate the sensitivity of the land use changes to different assumptions on the blending mix between ethanol and biodiesel for meeting the 5 % blending target of first generation biofuels, on the intensification level of agricultural production and on the available agricultural land. The results suggest that net land use changes (LUC) in the EU due to the revised RED are limited and are more sensitive to the share of ethanol and biodiesel in meeting the blending target compared to different assumptions on the availability of land and of yields that can be achieved when substituting land with other production factors. LUC in the rest of the world stem from increased EU imports of feedstock and of biofuels. LUC is especially sensitive to the substitution between land and fertilizer in regions with extensive agricultural production systems. In regions trading vegetable oil and oilseeds with the EU, and in regions producing ethanol, LUC is influenced by the share of ethanol in the biofuel mix used in the EU. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), a renewable liquid biofuel popularly known as biodiesel, is emerging as a suitable replacement to common diesel fuel (CDF) in unmodified Compression Ignition (CI) engine. Various methods have been reported for the production of biodiesel from vegetable oil, such as direct use and blending, microemulsification, pyrolysis, and transesterification. Biodiesel fuel has better properties than petrodiesel fuel; it is renewable, biodegradable, non-toxic, and essentially free of sulfur and aromatics. Biodiesel seems to be a realistic fuel for future; it has become more attractive recently because of its environmental benefits. Biodiesel is an environmentally friendly fuel that can be used in any diesel engine without modification. Lower-cost feedstocks are needed since biodiesel from foodgrade oils is not economically competitive with petroleum-based diesel fuel. Inedible plant oils have been found to be promising crude oils for the production of biodiesel. The cost of biofuel and demand of vegetable oils can be reduced by inedible oils and used oils, instead of edible vegetable oil. © Research India Publications.

AB  - Spent Bleaching Earth (SBE) is an industrial solid waste of vegetable oil industry that has a high residual oil to be potentialy converted to biodiesel. This study aims at developing a biodiesel production process technology by utilizing residual palm oil contained in SBE and to test the use of hexane in the trans-esterification process. Optimization process was done by using the Response Surface Method (RSM). The variables studied included catalyst concentration and reaction time. On the other hand, the deoiled SBE resulted from biodiesel production was tested as an adsorbent on biodiesel purification after being reactivated. The method used in the biodiesel production included an in situ acid catalysed esterification followed by in situ base catalysed trans-esterification. The results of RSM showed that the optimum process was obtained at NaOH concentration of 1.8% and reaction time of 104.73 minutes, with a predicted response rate of 97.18% and 95.63% for validation results. The use of hexane could also increase the yield of biodiesel which was obtained on the ratio of hexane to methanol of 0.4:1 (volume of hexane: volume of methanol). On the other hand, the reactivated bleaching earth was effective as an adsorbent in biodiesel production, which was still conform with the Indonesian National Standard.

AB  - Controlling the activity and selectivity of hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of biomass-derivatives is critical for the utilization of biomass as renewable sources for chemicals and fuels. Furfural, produced by the hydrolysis and dehydration of xylose from hemicellulose, is a promising biomass-derivative to produce important biofuels like 2-methylfuran. Using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and surface science measurements on Fe/Ni(1 1 1) model surfaces, our results indicate that furfural bonds to the bimetallic surfaces primarily through the CO bond with the furan ring tilted away from the surface, leading to the production of 2-methylfuran through the HDO reaction with furfuryl alcohol being identified as the likely intermediate. Similar preferential interaction of the CO group over the furan ring is also confirmed on SiO2-supported FeNi bimetallic catalysts. The similar trends observed on model surfaces and supported catalysts demonstrate the feasibility of using single crystal surfaces to identify precious-metal-free bimetallic catalysts for biomass conversion. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The long hydrocarbon fatty acyl chain is energy rich, making it an ideal precursor for liquid transportation fuels and high-value oleo chemicals. As Saccharomyces cerevisiae has many advantages for industrial production compared to Escherichia coli. Here, we attempted to engineer Saccharomyces cerevisiae for overproduction of fatty acids. First, disruption of the beta-oxidation pathway, elimination of the acyl-CoA synthetases, overexpression of different thioesterases and acetyl-CoA carboxylase ACC1, and engineering the supply of precursor acetyl-CoA. The engineered strain XL122 produced more than 120mg/L of fatty acids. In parallel, we inactivated ADH1, the dominant gene for ethanol production, to redirect the metabolic flux to fatty acids synthesis. The engineered strain DG005 produced about 140mg/L fatty acids. Additionally, Acetyl-CoA carboxylase was identified as a critical bottleneck of fatty acids synthesis in S. cerevisiae with a cell-free system. However, overexpression of ACC1 has little effect on fatty acids biosynthesis. As it has been reported that phosphorylation of ACC1 may influent its activity, so phosphorylation sites of ACC1 were further identified. Although the regulatory mechanisms remain unclear, our results provide rationale for future studies to target this critical step. All these efforts, particularly the discovery of the limiting step are critical for developing a "cell factory" for the overproduction of fatty acids by using type I fatty acids synthase in yeast or other fungi. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This article evaluates the sustainability and economic potential of microalgae grown in brewery wastewater for biodiesel and biomass production. Three sustainability and two economic indicators were considered in the evaluation within a life cycle perspective. For the production system the most efficient process units were selected. Results show that harvesting and oil separation are the main process bottlenecks. Microalgae with higher lipid content and productivity are desirable for biodiesel production, although comparable to other biofuel's feedstock concerning sustainability. However, improvements are still needed to reach the performance level of fossil diesel. Profitability reaches a limit for larger cultivation areas, being higher when extracted biomass is sold together with microalgae oil, in which case the influence of lipid content and areal productivity is smaller. The values of oil and/or biomass prices calculated to ensure that the process is economically sound are still very high compared with other fuel options, especially biodiesel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work evaluates the life cycle environmental impacts of producing microalgal biodiesel via baseline and improved technological routes under several coproduct options and allocation schemes, and compares the results to traditional petroleum diesel. Multiple environmental impact categories, as well as sustainability metrics are utilized to assess the environmental sustainability and viability of emerging microalgal biofuels. Analysis reveals that for baseline scenarios the fossil energy return on investment (EROIfossil) ranges from 0.16 to 0.45, energy return on investment (EROI) from 0.15 to 0.40, and life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (gCO2 eq./MJ-fuel) from 142 to 352-depending on the choice of allocation methodology and coproduct option. For improved scenarios EROIfossil range from 0.50 to 1.87, EROI from 0.39 to 1.18, and life cycle GHG emissions from 35 to 141. Further analysis reveals that microalgal fuels provide benefits in only two out of the ten examined environmental impact categories-relative to petroleum diesel. The results are compelling as they suggest that the choice of production pathway and allocation scheme has a significant impact on algae's energy and environmental performance, and in select cases can alter the net energy balance and GHG reduction potential of microalgal fuel production from negative to positive. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel are gaining increased public and scientific attention as an alternative to petroleum diesel fuel, driven by factors such as oil price spikes, energy security and environmental concerns. In this study, low grade wastewater sludge originated from wastewater treatment unit of vegetable oil factory as a viable alternative lipid source for biodiesel production was evaluated. The lipid mass fraction of the dry and ash-free sludge was 12.44±0.87%, which mainly comprised of C16-C18 fatty acids. The in-situ transesterification process under subcritical water and methanol conditions was applied as a green pathway to convert lipids into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). The reaction parameters investigated were temperatures (155-215°C), pressures (5.5-6.5MPa) and methanol to lipid mass ratios (1:1, 5:1 and 9:1). The highest FAME yield of 92.67±3.23% was obtained at 215°C, 6.5MPa and methanol to lipid mass ratio of 5:1. Statistical analysis based on response surface methodology in 3-factor-3-level central composite designed experiments and analysis of variance were applied to examine the relation between input parameters and the response and to locate the optimum condition. Results showed that 98% of the variability in the response could be adequately explained by the second-order polynomial model. The optimum FAME yield (90.37%) was obtained at 215°C, 6.5MPa and methanol to lipid mass ratio of 5.12:1. Experimental validation (N=3) demonstrated satisfactory agreement between the observed and predicted values with an error of at most 3.3%. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Metal halides are selective catalysts suitable for production of the fuel precursors furfural and 5-HMF from sugars derived from lignocellulosic biomass. However, they do not perform nearly as well when applied to biomass even in combination with immiscible extracting solvents or expensive ionic co-solvents. Here, we couple metal halides with a highly tunable co-solvent system employing renewable tetrahydrofuran (THF) to significantly enhance co-production of furfural and 5-HMF from biomass in a single phase reaction strategy capable of integrating biomass deconstruction with catalytic dehydration of sugars. Screening of several promising metal halide species at 170 °C in pH-controlled reactions with sugar solutions and larger 1 L reactions with maple wood and corn stover revealed how the interplay between relative Brønsted and Lewis acidities was responsible for enhancing catalytic performance in THF co-solvent. Combining FeCl3 with THF co-solvent was particularly effective, achieving one of the highest reported simultaneous yields of furfural (95%) and 5-HMF (51%) directly from biomass with minimal levulinic acid formation (6%). Furthermore, over 90% of the lignin from biomass was extracted by THF and recovered as a fine lignin powder. Tuning the volume ratio of THF to water from 4 : 1 to 1 : 1 preserved 10% to 31% of the reacted biomass as a glucan-rich solid suitable for further catalytic reaction, enzymatic digestion, or possible pulp and paper production.

AB  - Bio-alcohols (e.g. ethanol, butanol) are primarily obtained as diluted aqueous solutions from biomass fermentation, and thus the subsequent isolation is a very costly process. So the direct transformation of bio-alcohols in water will have great advantages. This study describes the development of catalysts used for the self-condensation of bio-alcohols in water (that mimic the primary fermentation solutions). Efficient iridium catalysts have been developed rationally from homogeneous to heterogeneous, and the immobilized catalysts could be reused without any loss of activity, which is very important for the development of practical processes. The expected self-condensation could be realized with 80-90% selectivity in water and air. Such a protocol might be used for producing butanol from ethanol solution directly, which is an improved higher-alcohol biofuel. Other useful chemicals, such as 2-ethylhexanol, could also be obtained from renewable resources through this condensation reaction. This journal is © the Partner Organisations 2014.

AB  - In this study, we propose the use of tung cake for the production of organic acids, with an emphasis on citric acid by solid-state fermentation. We evaluated the conditions of production and the by-products from the biodiesel chain as raw materials involved in this bioprocess. First, we standardized the conditions of solid-state fermentation in tung cake with and without residual fat and with different concentrations of glycerine using the fungus Aspergillus niger. The solid-state fermentation process was monitored for 7 days considering the biomass growth and pH level. Citric acid production was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Fungal development was better in the crude tung cake, consisting of 20% glycerine. The highest citric acid yield was 350 g kg-1 of biomass. Therefore, the solid-state fermentation of the tung cake with glycerine led to citric acid production using the Aspergillus niger fungus. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - Saponifiable lipids (SLs) were extracted with hexane from wet biomass (86. wt% water) of the microalga Nannochloropsis gaditana in order to transform them into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs, biodiesel). The influence of homogenization pressure on SL extraction yield at low temperature (20-22. °C) was studied. Homogenization at 1700. bar tripled the SL extraction yield. Two biomass batches with similar total lipid content but different lipidic compositions were used. Batch 1 contained fewer SLs (12.0. wt%) and neutral saponifiable lipids (NSLs, 7.9. wt%) than batch 2 (21.6 and 17.2. wt%, respectively). For this reason, and due to the selectivity of hexane toward NSLs, high SL yield (69.1. wt%) and purity (71.0. wt%) were obtained from batch 2. Moreover, this extract contains a small percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (16.9. wt%), thereby improving the biodiesel quality. Finally, up to 97.0% of extracted SLs were transformed to FAMEs by acid catalyzed transesterification. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article provides an economic assessment of greenhouse gas emissions savings associated with the use of biofuels for the transportation sector in Spain. The reference year used is 2010 in accordance with the target for the implementation of biofuels and other renewable fuels set down in European legislation (Directive 2003/30). The assessment is based on the premise that an increased use of biofuel will displace a similar amount of fossil fuel on a BTU basis, with the amount of biofuel used in 2010 taken as a reference point to conduct the estimates.The results show that the most cost-efficient biofuel is the biodiesel obtained from waste oil. Regarding the differences between first- and second-generation biofuels, the results show that the latter had very high associated costs. Reaching the biofuel target for 2010 by primarily using first-generation used-oil biodiesel blends would have led to a saving of 58°M€. In contrast, reaching this target by exclusively using second-generation biofuels would have led to a 1000M€ increase in total costs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the present study, there is a need to reduce the consumption of conventional fuel and related fossil fuels. So, in order to promote the use of renewable sources such as biofuels there is a requirement for the effective evaluation of the performance of engines based on the second law of thermodynamic. In this paper, the analysis of energy, exergy, mean gas temperature and exhaust gas temperature of a compression ignition (CI) engine using diesel and Karanja methyl ester blends are done. The results are calculated at various compression ratios under full load and at different engine loads at a compression ratio of 18:1. It is observed that the exergy efficiency, mean gas temperature, brake thermal efficiency increases with increase in compression ratio as well as load. The exhaust gas temperature and destruction of exergy decreases with increase in compression ratio and increases with increase in load for all blends of fuel.

AB  - Transformation of coconut oil into biodiesel by using dimethyl carbonate (DMC) via a non-catalytic transesterification reaction under ambient pressure was investigated in this study. The non-catalytic transformation to biodiesel was achieved by means of a heterogeneous reaction between liquid triglycerides and gas phase DMC. The reaction was enhanced in the presence of porous material due to its intrinsic physical properties such as tortuosity and absorption/adsorption. The numerous pores in the material served as micro reaction chambers and ensured that there was enough contact time between the liquid triglycerides and the gaseous DMC, which enabled the completion of the transesterification. The highest fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) yield achieved was 98. ±. 0.5% within 1-2. min at a temperature of 360-450. °C under ambient pressure. The fast reaction rates made it possible to convert the lipid feedstock into biodiesel via a continuous flow system without the application of increased pressure. This suggested that the commonly used supercritical conditions could be avoided, resulting in huge cost benefits for biodiesel production. In addition, the high value of the byproduct from the transesterification of the lipid feedstock with DMC suggested that the production biodiesel using this method could be more economically competitive. Finally, the basic properties of biodiesel derived from the non-catalytic conversion of rapeseed oil with DMC were summarised. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present analysis is to study the effect of nano additives of Cobalt Oxide (Co3O4) on the performance and emission characteristics of GSOME (Grape Seed Oil Methyl Ester) biodiesel (B20) in a four stroke, single cylinder, air cooled and direct injection diesel engine. The Co3O4 nano particle size range is less than 100 nm. The additive (Co3O4) was added to B20 at a dosage of 50ppm and 100ppm. The GSO(Grape Seed Oil) was mixed with Co3O4 nanoparticles with the aid of an ultrasonicator. The fuel properties of D80B20, (80% Diesel + 20% GSOME), D80B20 Co3O450 (80% Diesel + 20% GSOME +50ppm Co3O4 nano particles), D80B20 Co 3O4100 (80% Diesel + 20% GSOME+100ppm Co3O 4 nano particles) were studied and compared according to ASTM standard test methods for biodiesel. It was noticed that the addition of nano cobalt oxide additive acts as an oxygen buffer which improves the combustion, brake thermal efficiency and reduces specific fuel consumption at full load conditions. The Co3O4 nano additive resulted in maximum reduction in hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), smoke opacity and oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) at full load operation.

AB  - This work evaluated the feasibility of microencapsulating Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 cells by emulsification for fermentation to produce biobutanol. The effects of selected emulsification process on viability of the vegetative cells and spores were investigated to enable the selection of appropriate form of bacterium for immobilisation. The spores were found to be more suitable for microencapsulation than the vegetative cells. Design of experiment and mathematical models were then used to evaluate the effects of gellan gum concentration, HLB of surfactant blend, temperature and stirring speed on the properties of the microspheres produced. Using the predicted optimal conditions, the spores were successfully immobilised in spherical microspheres for use in fermentation. The microencapsulated spores were easily revived by heat shock treatment and could produce 8.2 g/l of butanol, which was higher than that generally reported in literature. The microencapsulation method developed provides means of producing reusable microbioreactors for anaerobic spore-forming microorganisms. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - It is important that increasing seed oil yield in species of Brassica to improve the crops as biodiesel feedstocks does not result in unforeseen increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Studies were conducted to determine if genotypes of Brassica napus and Arabidopsis thaliana varying in seed oil content (SOC) potential had differences in plant and rhizospheric characteristics that could impact GHG emissions. Varying SOC productivity in B. napus resulted in changes in C and N partitioning within the plant, and in some cases had effects on N2O emission in the field. Although changes were observed in the composition of the rhizosphere of A. thaliana with modified SOC, there was also evidence that rhizospheric bacteria-to-plant signals could be used to improve growth and stress resistance in the plants. Project 4c in the Green Crop Network (GCN) investigated the possible ramifications of varying SOC on various plant growth, rhizospheric and agronomic characteristic of Brassica napus L. and Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. The influence of certain bacteria-to-plant signals (i.e., lipo-chitooligosaccharides) was also investigated in these species. The rationale for these investigations was based on the fact that very little is known about how changing seed oil productivity in brassicas might affect other plants processes (e.g., C and N partitioning, root exudations, rhizospheric conditions) that might affect GHG emission from biodiesel feedstock crops designed specifically for maximized SOC.

AB  - Hydrocracking of used cooking oil catalyzed by Ni-bentonite has been conducted. Synthesis of Ni-bentonite was begun with the activation of bentonite by refluxing the bentonite using 6 M HCl followed by 1 % Ni metal impregnation derived from precursor NiCl2·6H2O. Ni-bentonite was analyzed by FT-IR, XRD and gas sorption analyzer. Its acidity value was analyzed by gravimetric sorption of pyridine base. Ni-bentonite catalyst was used for hydrocracking of used cooking oil by temperature variation of 300, 350, 400 and 450 °C. Hydrocracking products were analyzed by gas chromatography to be compared with the commercial gasoline, diesel oil and gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) to determine the content and composition of the biofuels. The experimental results showed that the activation of bentonite increased the acidity value of bentonite from 0.07838 mmol/g to 1.12 mmol/g. Ni-bentonite catalyst had the highest acidity of 1.19 mmol/g. Based on the analysis of the gas chromatography, hydrocracking products had components which synonymous with commercial gasoline and diesel oil. The optimum temperature of producing biofuel from used cooking oil with Ni-bentonite catalyst was 300 °C. Hydrocracking products contained 2-propanone, dodecanae, octanoic acid, decanoic acid, dodecanoic acid and 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid.

AB  - Moringa peregrina leaves and pods are known for their medicinal and nutritional values. In this paper, M. peregrina seeds had been investigated for the first time as a potential source for bio-fuel. Physical characterization revealed that M. peregrina seed is composed of about 59% kernel and 41% husk. The kernel was found to contain about 38% of oil. Higher heating values of 18.21, 20.65 and 39.99MJ/kg were obtained for M. peregrina seed husk, M. peregrina seed oil cake and M. peregrina seed oil respectively. Thermochemical characteristics and thermal behavior of M. peregrina seed husk and M. peregrina seed oil cake in an inert atmosphere of N2 were studied. The initial results showed that M. peregrina seed husk and M. peregrina seed oil cake could potentially produce energy through thermochemical conversion processes. Low iodine value (67.73gI2/100g oil) and high saponification value (187.53mgKOH/g oil) were reported for M. peregrina seed oil. Thus, a high cetane number (60.16) was reported for M. peregrina seed-oil-based biodiesel. M. peregrina seed oil was found to contain very low free fatty acids (0.35%), rendering its conversion into biodiesel possible in one step by alkaline catalyst. A high fraction of unsaturated fatty acids was observed in M. peregrina seed oil (81.24%) while 76.92% of M. peregrina seed oil was contributed by monounsaturated fatty acids with oleic acid as the major component (72.19%). Therefore, high thermo-oxidative stability was observed in M. peregrina seed oil. However, its significant fraction of long-chain fatty acids (C20:0+C20:1+C22:0) (6.76%) may affect the cold flow properties of the derived biodiesel. We concluded from this study that M. peregrina is a potential source for both bio-fuel and food. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Oil content and composition, biomass productivity and adaptability to different growth conditions are important parameters in selecting a suitable microalgal strain for biodiesel production. Here, we describe isolation and characterization of three green microalgal species from geothermal flora of Central Anatolia. All three isolates, namely, Scenedesmus sp. METUNERGY1402 (Scenedesmus sp. ME02), Hindakia tetrachotoma METUNERGY1403 (H. tetrachotoma ME03) and Micractinium sp. METUNERGY1405 (Micractinium sp. ME05) are adaptable to growth at a wide temperature range (25-50°C). Micractinium sp. ME05, particularly has superior properties for biodiesel production. Biomass productivity, lipid content and lipid productivity of this isolate are 0.17gL-1d-1, 22.7% and 0.04gL-1d-1, respectively. In addition, Micractinium sp. ME05 and Scenedesmus sp. ME03 mainly contain desirable fatty acid methyl esters (i.e. 16:0, 16:1, 18:0 and 18:1) for biodiesel production. All isolates can further be improved via genetic and metabolic engineering strategies. © 2014.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz) is an attractive alternative and sustainable oilseed crop for multipurpose uses, including as a biofuel feedstock. To evaluate the value of C. sativa in Lombardia (north Italy), seven genotypes were cultivated under different climates of two consecutive years and growing seasons; quality and quantity of seed, oil, and flour were analyzed. Genotypes mainly influenced seed weight (0.98-1.56 g/1000 seeds), protein (245-401 mg/g), glucosinolates, and phytic acid. Oil content (27.5%-37.2%) and fatty acid (FA) composition varied with year and growing season among genotypes. Oils were rich in linolenic and linoleic acids (68.4%-80.8%). The monounsaturated acids ranged from 16.4%-25.6%, although erucic acid was much lower at 4.30%. Saturated FAs represented a small fraction. Low free FAs content (0.01%-0.81%) and different amounts of tocopherols (0.44-2.69 μg/mg) in oils depended on years. Correlations among seed and biochemical traits were found. Genotypes with low protein and high phytic acid contents would not be the best for flour quality. Genotypes showing high levels of protein and C18:3/C18:2 fatty acids ratio could be useful for humans and livestock. Genotype with relatively high C18:1 fatty acid content can be used mainly for biofuel production. Altogether, the data indicated that C. sativa cultivation could be promoted as an economically profitable oilseed crop in north Italian environments. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widely studied in environmental matrices, such as air, water, soil and sediment, because of their toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. Because of these properties, the environmental agencies of developed countries have listed sixteen PAHs as priority pollutants. Few countries have limits for these compounds for ambient air, but they only limit emissions from stationary and mobile sources and occupational areas. There are several studies to specifically address the 16 priority PAHs and very little for the alkyl PAHs. These compounds are more abundant, more persistent and frequently more toxic than the non-alkylated PAHs, and the toxicity increases with the number of alkyl substitutions on the aromatic ring. In this study, a method was developed for the analysis of PAHs and alkyl PAHs by using a GC-MS and large injection volume injection coupled with program temperature vaporisation, which allows for limits of detection below 1.0ngμL-1. Several variables were tested, such as the injection volume, injection velocity, injector initial temperature, duration of the solvent split and others. This method was evaluated in samples from particulate matter from the emissions of engines employing standard diesel, commercial diesel and biodiesel B20. Samples were collected on a dynamometer bench for a diesel engine cycle and the results ranged from 0.5 to 96.9ngmL-1, indicating that diesel/biodiesel makes a significant contribution to the formation of PAHs and alkyl PAHs. © 2014.

AB  - Microalgae are considered to be a promising alternative feedstock for next generation biofuels because of their rapid photosynthetic growth rates and less impact on land-use. In this study, we employed a series of laboratory microcosm experiments to explore effects of temperature on growth and cell characteristics of 12 species. The research results indicted a wide range of responses of population demographic rates and physiology of phytoplankton cells to temperature. Chlorophyta could grow at a wide range of temperature from 15 to 35 °C, with the optimum temperature of 20 to 30 °C, mainly around 25 °C; whereas cyanobacteria had a higher tolerance to high temperature than chlorophyta, the optimum temperature for growth was between 30 and 35 °C. At the optimum temperature, most species (mainly large-sized green algae) generally showed grow rapidly with slightly high lipid and chlorophyll a contents in algal cell, whereas chlorophyll a content in algal cell was not completely determined by algal size and volume. In conclusion the study identifies key tradeoffs among functional traits to determine the suitability of diverse algal species as biofuel feedstock, further to provide scientific basis on screening successfully the potential candidate species for use in bio-oil production under temperature stress.

AB  - Vegetable oil is one of the main first generation liquid biofuels. The fuel characteristics of vegetable oil such as viscosity and atomization cannot be accommodated by existing diesel engines. An alternate process has been developed to improve the fuel characteristics of vegetable oils through the process of alcoholysis to produce a fuel called biodiesel. It can be used in engines as substitute for fossil fuel. This paper reviews the characteristics of different oils available for biodiesel production and the production technologies, engine performance using vegetable oil and biodiesel, and emission studies. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The European Commission proposed amendments to the Directive 98/70/EC and Directive 2009/28/EC, which call for the inclusion of indirect changes in land use (iLUC) to the estimated volume of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within the life cycle of transportation biofuels. The paper investigates possible emissions reductions in the life cycle of biodiesel (FAME) according to six scenarios with special focus on iLUC. Including iLUC for rapeseed biodiesel production in Poland results in GHG emission reduction lower than the required 50% starting from January 2017. However, in some rapeseed growing regions, at least 50% emission threshold can be achieved when reduced tillage (małopolskie, opolskie, pomorskie and zachodniopomorskie) or no-tillage (małopolskie, opolskie, podkarpackie, pomorskie, śla{ogonek}skie and zachodniopomorskie) is applied. All these regions are located in temperate moist climate region, which is combined with higher level of soil organic carbon sequestration compared to dry climate.It was estimated that when including iLUC in the calculations of greenhouse gas emissions, the agricultural sector in Poland can produce 548 thousand ton of rapeseed, which meets the Directive 2009/28/EC sustainability criteria (50% GHG emission reductions), under the condition that improvement of agricultural management (soil carbon accumulation) will occur. This production can supply 202 thousand tons of FAME, which would amount to 33% of transport fuel from renewable energy sources by 2020, according to National Renewable Energy Action Plan. After 2020, the additional amount of transportation fuels required by the Directive 2009/28/EC will have to be derived from another biofuels or renewable energy sources.

AB  - This work describes the production of biodiesel from Jatropha curcas oil. The kernel samples provided by Embrapa-PI, were first crushed in a blender and then subjected to extraction with hexane. The oil yield was between 54.71±0.47 and 64.16±2.88%. The J.curcas oil was then submitted to two different kinds of degumming, first with water and second with H3PO4 to evaluate the influence of these processes in the yield of the transesterification reaction. Methyl and ethyl biodiesel prepared from the degummed oil with H3PO4 had higher conversions than those prepared with the degummed with water. Therefore, among the processes of degumming studied, H3PO4 was more suitable for the treatment of J.curcas oil. The study shows the results about oxidation stability were good, because the biodiesels methyl and ethyl biodiesel have induction period at 13.51h and 13.03h without antioxidant addition when submitted a Rancimat text. Such biodiesels had their physicochemical parameters defined under the specifications of ANP Resolutions n° 14/2012 (ANP- National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels from Brazil). The results showed that J.curcas cultivation in Brazil is an adequate source for biodiesel production, considering the technical standards available. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The micro-explosion phenomenon is involved in emulsified fuel droplets placed in a hot atmosphere, such as spray combustion. Droplets of water-in-sunflower oil emulsion are used, since they are representative of a class of emulsions used in practical applications of biofuels. Once the micro-explosion is triggered after a short delay, the rapid (≤1 ms) vaporization of the inside water droplets and the subsequent disintegration of the emulsion droplet blow the fragmented droplets away. These fragmented droplets are called "child-droplets", and they are too small and fast for an on-the-fly infra-red imaging thermal characterization. The present study focuses on the thermal reaction of a thin plate when impacted by them. Thorough and detailed tests are carried out, to make sure that the plate and the acquisition system are collecting a data that is actually representative of the child-droplets thermal energy. A quantitative post-processing is applied to the transient temperature field on the plate. It leads to the thermal energy of the whole plate, and of representative samples of individual child-droplets. The results show that their thermal energy is governed by a log-normal distribution. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recently interest has been revived in the use of plant-derived waste oils as renewable replacements for fossil diesel fuel. Olive-pomace oil (OPO) extracted from alperujo (by-product of processed olives for olive oil extraction), and produced it in considerable quantities throughout the Mediterranean countries, can be used for biodiesel production. A steam treatment of alperujo is being implemented in OPO extraction industry. This steam treatment improves the solid-liquid separation by centrifugation and facilitates the drying for further extraction of OPO. It has been verified that the steam treatment of this by-product also increases the concentration of OPO in the resulting treated solid, a key factor from an economic point of view. In the present work, crude OPO from steam-treated alperujo was found to be good source for producing biodiesel. Oil enrichment, acidity, biodiesel yield and fatty acid methyl ester composition were evaluated and compared with the results of the untreated samples. Yields and some general physicochemical properties of the quality of biodiesel were also compared to those obtained with other oils commonly used in biodiesel production. As for biodiesel yield no differences were observed. A transesterification process which included two steps was used (acid esterification followed by alkali transesterification). The maximum biodiesel yield was obtained using molar ratio methanol/triglycerides 6:1 in presence of sodium hydroxide at a concentration of 1% (w/w), reaction temperature 60°C and reaction time 80min. Under these conditions the process gave yields of about 95%, of the same order as other feedstock using similar production conditions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper reports the design of a vascular structure for an artificial tree, also known as an evaporation-driven porous substrate bioreactor (PSBR), for efficient biofuel production using microalgae. This system consists of multiple vertical ribs, each of which is made of porous membrane and grows algal cells on its surface as a biofilm. Nutrient medium flow through the reactor is driven by evaporation at the terminal end of the porous membrane, and nutrients are delivered from the porous membrane to the cells by diffusion. Flow through the membrane was modeled as a function of the physico-chemical and morphological properties of the membrane, as well as the environmental parameters governing evaporation. It was determined that under typical operating conditions, the evaporative flux from the evaporator region ranged from about 14 to 66 mg/m2 s. Moreover, there was a membrane pore radius that maximized nutrient medium flow as a result of the competition between capillary, viscous, and gravitational forces. For the range of evaporative fluxes observed in this study, this pore radius was about 10 μm. Furthermore, a design example is provided for artificial trees made of three different commercially available membrane materials. A design methodology was demonstrated for maximizing photosynthetic productivity by tuning the evaporation-driven flow rate to ensure sufficient nutrient delivery to cells without incurring large evaporative loss rates. It was observed that both the growth rate and the evaporation-driven nutrient delivery rate were directly related to the irradiance in outdoor artificial trees, which provides a passive and efficient nutrient delivery mechanism. It is expected that the design principles along with the physical models governing the fluid flow in these vascular structures will aid researchers in developing novel applications for artificial trees. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The catalytic pyrolysis of palm kernel shell was investigated in a fluidized bed with zsm-5 and equilibrium FCC (Ecat) catalysts. Catalytic pyrolysis oil yields were remarkably reduced and gas yields were increased due to the higher catalytic reaction of primary volatiles compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis. Char yields were affected by temperature and the pore structure of the catalysts. The pyrolysis oil was characterized by lower H/C and O/C molar ratios due to aromatization and deoxygenation of volatiles by the catalysts. The catalytic pyrolysis oils contained more oxygen and nitrogen and less sulfur than petroleum oils. The oils had a high concentration of nitriles, with a carbon number distribution similar to fatty acids. The catalytic pyrolysis oils featured high nitriles yield with Ecat and high aromatics yield in the light fraction with zsm-5, due to characteristics of the catalyst. The catalytic pyrolysis oils showed potentials as feedstocks for bio-diesel and chemicals. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With a view to ever-increasing demand for biomass energy, bio-oils were made from typical microalgae and introduced into CD 15W-40 diesel engine oil as partial alternatives. The lubrication performance of the bio-oils was evaluated with a four-ball friction and wear tester, and their action mechanism was investigated with various modern surface analytical techniques. Results show that as-prepared bio-oils had excellent lubrication performance. Namely, with the increase of bio-oil content in diesel engine oil, the friction coefficient gradually declined, and the wear scar diameter of the steel balls initially declineds but rose later therewith. Particularly, the diesel engine oil containing 10% (mass fraction) of bio-oil had desired tribological properties. Besides, the bio-oil obtained via catalytic liquefaction with La2O3 catalyst possessed better lubrication performance than the one obtained via direct liquefaction without catalyst, and the former was able to significantly reduce the friction coefficient and wear scar diameter of the steel balls. In terms of the lubrication mechanism, C- and N-containing organic compounds in the lubricating oil can be adsorbed and deposited on contact surfaces of the steel sliding pair to form a lubricating film, while a protective film composed of Fe2O3 and FeN was formed on sliding steel surfaces via tribochemical reactions. As a result, good lubrication and protection efficacy was acquired. The present research, hopefully, is to help to provide reference to broadening the application scope of bio-oil.

AB  - Rotational perennial grass/clover has multiple effects in cropping systems dominated by cereals. This study evaluated the environmental impact of rotational grass/clover ley for anaerobic digestion in a cereal-dominated grain production system in Sweden. Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was used to compare two scenarios: (i) a cropping system including only spring barley and winter wheat; and (ii) a cropping system including 2-year grass/clover ley in combination with spring barley and winter wheat. The functional unit was one tonne of grain. The two main functions of the grass/clover crop were to provide feedstock for biogas production and to act as an organic fertiliser for allocation among the cereal crops in the rotation. Special consideration was given to nitrogen (N) management and the rotational effects of the grass/clover ley. In total, 73% of the N requirement of cereals in the ley scenario was met through symbiotic N fixation. Replacing diesel with biogas and mineral fertiliser with digested grass/clover biomass (digestate) reduced the use of fossil fuels substantially, from 1480. MJ per tonne in the reference scenario to -2900. MJ per tonne in the ley scenario. Potential eutrophication per tonne grain increased in the ley scenario, mainly owing to significantly higher ammonia emissions from spreading digestate and the larger area required for producing the same amount of grain. Potential acidification also increased when N mineral fertiliser was replaced by digestate. Crops relying on symbiotic N fixation are a promising feedstock for reducing the use of non-renewable energy in the production chain of farm-based bioenergy, but careful handling of the N-rich digestate is required. Replacing cereals intended for feed or food with bioenergy crops leads to indirect land use changes (iLUC) when the displaced crops must be produced elsewhere and the benefits obtained when biofuels replace fossil fuels may thereby be outweighed. In this study, the iLUC factor assumed had a critical effect on global warming potential in the ley scenario. However, carbon sequestration and the higher yield potential of subsequent cereal crops can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from iLUC to a varying extent. We recommend that crop sequences rather than single crops be considered when evaluating the environmental impact of production systems that include perennial legumes for food, feed and bioenergy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Antioxidants are additives for the prevention of the degradation of biofuels. This study evaluated the oxidative stability of B100 biodiesel from soybean oil with the addition of three synthetic antioxidants, butylhydroxyanisole (BHA), tertbutyl-hydroquinone (TBHQ) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), either pure or mixed, according to the simplex-centroid mixture design. The obtained kinetic parameters indicated that the addition of the three pure antioxidants and a ternary mixture of the antioxidants resulted in an induction period that was greater than that of the control sample. Furthermore, based on the induction period (ip), the antioxidant BHT was the most efficient in preventing the oxidation of the B100 biodiesel used. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study describes the results obtained in the synthesis of a biofuel that avoids the production of glycerol by applying supported KF as alkaline heterogeneous catalyst, to generate two moles of fatty acid methyl esters and one mole of monoglyceride from one mol of triglyceride. In this respect, the selective transesterification process of sunflower oil with methanol was carried out with KF (10 wt%) supported on three different solids, Al2O3, ZnO and MgO. The standard experimental conditions employed in the heterogeneous selective methanolysis reaction were: 12 mL of sunflower oil, 2.7 mL of methanol, 0.8 g of catalyst, at 65 °C temperature and one hour of reaction time. In all cases 100% conversion was obtained, with high selectivity values, greater than 90%, and quite suitable viscosity values, 4.5-8.5 cSt. In this way, the best catalytic behavior in the first use was obtained by using Al2O3 as support. However, although in the five consecutive reuses all catalysts exhibited a continuous decrease in their catalytic activities; the lower one was for KF catalyst using MgO as support. In summary, these three KF supported catalysts are very suitable to obtain a new biofuel, similar to conventional biodiesel, applicable to diesel engines. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable energy source, alternative to fossil fuels, which has received much attention because it presents similar characteristics and, in some cases, even better than mineral diesel. However, to ensure the quality control of this biofuel, the National Petroleum Agency (ANP) has set appropriate limits to maintain their chemical and physical-chemical characteristics. In this context, a biosensor based on carbon peroxidase from turnip extract was used for the determination of unreacted triglycerides in samples of biodiesel. The device tested presented accuracy, simplicity and low cost. The results when compared with gas chromatography show a variation of 5.8 % in the triglycerides concentration and a linear region of 5.5 to 55 μmol L -1 and a detection limit of 4.0 10-8mol L -1 (IUPAC method). Analyses performed by biosensors fall into the Green Analytical Chemistry because they use few reagents and generate a low level of waste.

AB  - In Brazil, biodiesel is obtained mainly from soybean oil by alkaline trans-esterification process in the presence of methanol. However, being a first generation biodiesel, it may compete with the generation of foods. Soybean oil contains a high percentage of esters of fatty acids with a high degree of unsaturation, which can facilitate the oxidation process of biofuel compromising its storage. Thus, it is necessary to conduct studies that propose alternatives to increase the oxidative stability of biodiesel from soybeans. In this context, the establishment of blends between biodiesel of soy and other types of biodiesels (first and second generation), presents itself as a promising alternative. Due to the presence of significant amount of fatty acids with double bonds, oxidative stability has been found to be of significant concern when the biodiesel is stored over an extended period of time. Degradation by oxidation yields oxidation products that may compromise fuel properties, impair fuel quality and engine performance. Faced with this problem, this paper aimed at evaluating the oxidative stability of biodiesel blends from soybean, crambe, babassu and waste of swine fat by applying a 23 factorial design and response surface methodology. The tests were carried out using the Rancimat 873, according to the official determination of the oxidative stability in accelerated testing, based on the Induction Period (IP).

AB  - This study evaluates the production of biodiesel and ethanol from spent coffee grounds (SCG). The extraction of oil from SCG, biodiesel production and ethanol production processes were studied. The liquid-to-solid ratio and temperature were evaluated in the ultrasound-assisted extraction of the oil from SCG. The highest yield (12%) was obtained using 4mLg-1 liquid-to-solid ratio at 60°C for 45min. The process to produce biodiesel showed a yield of 97% into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). The highest glucose yield (192mggSCG-1) was obtained by hydrolysis with 0.4molL-1 sulfuric acid at 121°C for 15min. The hydrolysate was used as fermentation medium for ethanol production by Saccharomyces cerevisiae obtaining 19.0gL-1 at 10h of process of ethanol with a yield of ethanol and productivity of 0.50gg-1 and 1.90gL-1h-1, respectively. Spent coffee grounds were considered a potential feedstock for biodiesel and ethanol production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The current study hypothesizes that false flax (Camelina sativa L.), as a high-value biofuel feedstock, could be grown under humid conditions of western Lithuania and that nitrogen fertilisation could influence its seed yield and oil content. The following objectives were pursued: 1) to determine the optimum nitrogen fertiliser rate for winter (N0, N50, N100, N150) and summer (N0, N30, N60, N90, N120) types of false flax, 2) to estimate false flax seed oil content, its composition and feasibility to use it for the production of biodiesel fuel. The experiments were conducted in 2008-2011 at the Vėžaičiai Branch of the Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry. It was revealed that the highest (1.28 t ha-1, in 2010) and (1.29 t ha-1, in 2011) as well as cost-efficient summer false flax seed yield was produced having fertilised with 90 kg ha-1of nitrogen. Significantly highest (1.2 t ha-1, in 2011 and 1.6 t ha-1, in 2010) winter false flax seed yield was obtained having fertilised with N100. In our study, the seed oil content of summer false flax amounted to 40.3% and that of winter false flax was lower - 37.0%. Nitrogen fertilisation (N150and N120) increased protein content in winter false flax seed from 22.98% to 26.97% and in summer false flax seed from 20.53% to 23.23% and did not reduce seed oil content. Methyl esters of false flax oil have a high iodine value and an especially high content of polyunsaturated linolenic acid: it reached 38.2% in winter false flax oil and 34.3% in summer false flax oil. Therefore false flax methyl esters can be used as fuel for diesel engines only in mixtures containing 40-50% of methyl esters of animal origin (used frying oil or pork lard). The most effective antioxidant Ionol BF200 (optimal dosage - 500 ppm) as well as the most effective depressants Wintron XC-30 (optimal dosage - 1500 ppm) and Infineum R-442 (optimal dosage - 1200 ppm) were selected for improvement of oxidation stability and cold flow properties of esters.

AB  - Improvements in lipid productivity would enhance the economic feasibility of microalgal biodiesel. In order to optimise lipid productivity, both the growth rate and lipid content of algal cells must be maximised. The lipid content of many microalgae can be enhanced through nitrogen limitation, but at the expense of biomass productivity. This suggests that a two-stage nitrogen supply strategy might improve lipid productivity. Two different nitrogen supply strategies were investigated for their effect on lipid productivity in Chlorella vulgaris. The first was an initial nitrogen-replete stage, designed to optimise biomass productivity, followed by nitrogen limitation to enhance lipid content (two-stage batch) and the second was an initial nitrogen-limited stage, designed to maximise lipid content, followed by addition of nitrogen to enhance biomass concentration (fed-batch). Volumetric lipid yield in nitrogen-limited two-stage batch and fed-batch was compared with that achieved in nitrogen-replete and nitrogen-limited batch culture. In a previous work, maximum lipid productivity in batch culture was found at an intermediate level of nitrogen limitation (starting nitrate concentration of 170 mg L-1). Overall lipid productivity was not improved by using fed-batch or two-stage culture strategies, although these strategies showed higher volumetric lipid concentrations than nitrogen-replete batch culture. The dilution of cultures prior to nitrogen deprivation led to increased lipid accumulation, indicating that the availability of light influenced the rate of lipid accumulation. However, dilution did not lead to increased lipid productivity due to the resulting lower biomass concentration. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Farmgate prices (i.e. price delivered roadside ready for loading and transport) for biomass feedstocks directly influence biofuel prices. Using the latest available data, marginal (i.e. price for the last ton) farmgate prices of $51, $63, and $67 dry ton-1 ($2011) are projected as necessary to provide 21 billion gallons of biofuels from about 250 million dry tons of terrestrial feedstocks in 2022 under price-run deterministic, demand-run deterministic, and stochastic simulations, respectively.Sources of uncertainty in these feedstock supply and price projections include conversion efficiency, global market impacts on crop price projections, crop yields, no-till adoption, and climate.Under a set of low, high, and reference assumptions, these variables introduce an average of +/- $11 dry ton-1 (~15%) uncertainty of feedstock prices needed to meet EISA targets of 21 billion gallons of biofuels produced with 250 million dry tons of biomass in 2022.Market uncertainty justifies the need for fairly frequent (i.e. annual or biennial) re-assessment of feedstock price projections to inform strategies toward commercialization of biofuels. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd 8 4 July/August 2014 10.1002/bbb.1489 Modeling and Analysis Modeling and Analysis Published in 2014 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A study has been made of coconut oil hydrocatalysis mechanisms at 280C and 5 MPa initial hydrogen pressure over 1 h reaction time in the presence of the catalysts NiWS/Al2O3, NiMo/Al2O3, NiMoS/Al2O3, CoMo/Al2O3, and CoMoS/Al2O3. It is proved that under these conditions decarbonylation/decarboxylation reactions predominate on NiWS/Al 2O3, decarbonylation/ decarboxylation and deoxygenation reactions compete on NiMo/Al2O3 and NiMoS/Al 2O3, and deoxygenation reactions predominate on CoMo/Al2O3 and CoMoS/Al2O3 catalysts. It is shown that sulfidation of the catalyst facilitates hydrogenation reactions. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Bio-oils and bio-chars were obtained from sewage sludge (SS) by liquefaction with ethanol (or acetone) as the solvent at the temperature of 280, 320 and 360. °C. The migration and transformation of HMs as Pb, Zn, Cu and Ni during liquefaction were thoroughly investigated. Meanwhile, the environmental risk of HMs in the bio-oils and bio-chars was assessed according to the risk assessment code (RAC). The results showed that the liquefaction solvent and temperature significantly affected the redistribution of HMs. HMs distributed mainly into the bio-chars, with less than 10% into the bio-oils. Increasing liquefaction temperature would promote a higher HM content in bio-oils. The environmental risk of HMs in bio-chars was mitigated compared to SS, especially for Ni. However, the environmental risk of Zn and Ni in bio-oils was undesirably high in comparison with bio-chars. It was suggested that the bio-oil should be pretreated before utilization. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In order to improve energy supply diversity and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, sustainable bio-fuels are strongly supported by EU and other governments in the world. While the feedstock of biofuels has caused a debate on the issue of sustainability, the used cooking oil (UCO) has become a preferred feedstock for biodiesel manufacturers. However, intensive energy consumption in the trans-esterification process during the UCO biodiesel production has significantly compromised the carbon reduction potentials and increased the cost of the UCO biodiesel. Moreover, the yield of biodiesel is only ~90% and the remaining ~10% feedstock is wasted as by-product glycerol. Direct use of UCO in diesel engines is a way to maximize its carbon saving potentials. This paper, as part of the EPID (Environmental and Performance Impact of Direct use of used cooking oil in 44 tonne trucks under real world driving conditions) project, presents the life cycle analysis of Straight UCO (SUCO) in terms of CO2 and energy consumption, compared with the UCO biodiesel and petroleum diesel. The UK carbon calculator developed by UK Department for Transport was used for the calculations. The results show that SUCO renewable fuel can reduce the WTW carbon footprint by 98% compared to diesel and by 52% compared to the UCO biodiesel. Copyright © 2014 SAE International.

AB  - High-silica zeolites have been reported recently as efficient catalysts for liquid- and gas-phase condensation reactions because of the presence of a complementary source of basicity compared to Al-rich basic zeolites. Herein, we describe the controlled generation of these active sites on silica-rich FAU, BEA, and MFI zeolites. Through the application of a mild base treatment in aqueous Na2CO3, alkali-metal-coordinating defects are generated within the zeolite whereas the porous properties are fully preserved. The resulting catalysts were applied in the gas-phase condensation of propanal at 673 K as a model reaction for the catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis oil, for which an up to 20-fold increased activity compared to the unmodified zeolites was attained. The moderate basicity of these new sites leads to a coke resistance superior to traditional base catalysts such as CsX and MgO, and comparable activity and excellent selectivity is achieved for the condensation pathways. Through strategic acid and base treatments and the use of magic-angle spinning NMR spectroscopy, the nature of the active sites was investigated, which supports the theory of siloxy sites as basic centers. This contribution represents a key step in the understanding and design of high-silica base catalysts for the intermediate deoxygenation of crude bio-oil prior to the hydrotreating step for the production of second-generation biofuels. Creating new basic sites: Through activation treatments in alkaline media, basic sites with high activity, stability, and selectivity are generated in high-silica FAU, BEA, and MFI zeolites, which enable the efficient deoxygenation of pyrolysis oil by condensation reactions. Intermediate bio-oil upgrading is key for the sustainable and profitable production of advanced biofuels. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Requirements as torque, power, specific fuel consumption and emitted compounds are highly influenced by the chemical composition of the fuel being burned. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the use of oxygenated fuels on emissions of NOx, CO, HC, CO2 and particle number and size distribution (11.5&lt;Da&lt;365.2nm). In this paper a cycle diesel engine coupled to a dynamometer bench was used, where three types of fuels were employed, B5 (diesel with 5% of biodiesel); B5E6 (ternary composition containing 89% diesel, 5% of biodiesel and 6% of ethanol); and B100 (100% of biodiesel). The performance of a diesel engine was also evaluated to see the impact of the oxygenated fuels in this kind of engine. The use of ethanol with high latent heat of vaporization and low cetane number added to the binary blend (B5) shown an increase in the HC emissions and a reduction in NOx emissions when compared to B5. The use of pure biodiesel (B100) with high oxygen content showed a reduction in the HC emissions, but presented the highest emissions for both NOx and particle number of smaller diameter among the studied fuels. The use of more oxygenated fuels reduced the power output and increased the fuel consumption, but the exergy analysis showed that the energy efficiency of these fuels could be considered similar to the B5 fuel. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - By 2050, it is predicted that biofuels will provide 27% of total transport fuel and avoid around 2.1Gt CO2 emissions per year when produced sustainably. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that can be produced by trans-esterification in any climate using already developed agricultural practices. This paper aims to study various physical and chemical properties of biodiesel synthesized from edible and non-edible feedstocks. These feedstocks include Croton megalocarpus, Calophyllum inophyllum, Moringa (Moringa oleifera), palm (Elaeis guineensis) and coconut (Cocos nucifera). The physical and chemical properties of biodiesel-diesel blends were also presented. Furthermore, the regression analysis method was used to predict the properties of biodiesel blends. It has been found that blending of diesel with biodiesel has resulted in much improvement in kinematic viscosity, density, calorific value and oxidation stability. However, flash point and viscosity index decrease as the percentage of diesel increases. Moreover, the mathematical relationships developed in this study show a high regression values (R2) between properties and biodiesel-diesel blends. As a conclusion, it is believed that the outcome of this study gives the readers valuable results that help to predict the properties of biodiesel and its blends with diesel which are substantial parameters in the design of fuel system for biodiesel engine. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This project aims at using ethanol as an alternate fuel for Direct Injection Compression Ignition engine and blending it with some lubricating oils to increase the lubricating property of ethanol. This replacement of conventional Diesel with ethanol requires some of the properties of ethanol to be altered. The corrosive nature of ethanol is very high that it may corrode the fuel pump system. In order to increase the lubricating property of ethanol, it is blended with some of the lubricating oils. Some of the preferred lubricating oils are methyl esters of Jatropha oil, Pongamia oil etc. Ethanol is blended with these lubricating oils to reduce the corrosive property of Ethanol. The blended ethanol lubricating oil homogenous mixture's properties are compared with conventional diesel. The different fuel blends are used in the direct injection CI engine, the performance and emission characteristics are calculated and they are compared with diesel and a perfect blend is analysed.

AB  - Vegetable oil reverse micelle microemulsions as an alternative method for biodiesel production has been studied to eliminate transesterification reaction and avoid unpurified glycerol formation. The sorbitane oleate ester surfactants due to high solubilization capacity in oils have formed reverse micelle microemulsions with karanj oil and ethanol. The phase behaviour of span 80 and 85 based Karanj oil-ethanol microemulsion have been studied with their physicochemical parameters i.e. density and viscosity for formulating optimized systems as biofuel. The kinematic viscosity being an important physicochemical parameter elucidate karanj oil-ethanol microemulsion a better biofuel with span 80 than with span 85 as their resultant viscosities were in close agreement with ASTM biodiesel standards. It has been found that the microemulsification is a sustainable method for producing biofuels without chemical reactions as green fuel.

AB  - The hydrothermal decomposition of biomass is an alternative to the traditional pyrolysis processes to obtain liquid fuels with an increased energy density. Hydrothermal liquefaction is claimed to produce bio-oils with improved characteristics such as a reduced content of oxygen, avoiding at the same time the energy consuming biomass drying step necessary in the traditional thermochemical processes. However, at present the use of this technology is limited by the severe conditions needed and by the difficulties connected with the realization of a continuous process. In this work an innovative process, operating at atmospheric pressure and at moderate temperatures, is proposed, where water subcritical conditions are achieved locally by means of the energy released during cavitation. The process was tested on lab-scale on two biomass feeds obtaining a crude bio-oil with a composition very similar to that of fossil oil and greatly improved respect to those obtained in traditional pyrolysis processes. © 2014 WIT Press.

AB  - We examine the social desirability of renewable diesel production from imported palm oil in the EU when greenhouse gas emissions are taken into account. Using a partial market equilibrium model, we also study the sectoral social welfare effects of a biofuel policy consisting of a blend mandate in a small EU country (Finland), when palm oil based diesel is used to meet the mandated quota for biofuels. We develop a market equilibrium model for three cases: i) no biofuel policy, ii) biofuel policy consisting of socially optimal emission-based biofuel tax credit and iii) actual EU biofuel policy. Our results for the EU biofuel market, Southeast Asia and Finland show very little evidence that a large scale use of imported palm oil in diesel production in the EU can be justified by lower greenhouse gas emission costs. Cuts in emission costs may justify extensive production only if low or negative land-use change emissions result from oil palm cultivation and if the estimated per unit social costs of emissions are high. In contrast, the actual biofuel policies in the EU encourage the production of palm oil based diesel. Our results indicate that the sectoral social welfare effects of the actual biofuel policy in Finland may be negative and that if emissions decrease under actual biofuel policy, the emission abatement costs can be high regardless of the land use change emissions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To improve lipid productivity, co-cultivation of Chlorella sp. U4341 and Monoraphidium sp. FXY-10 for lipid production was studied. Compared with mono-cultivations, co-cultivation of the two microalgae significantly increased the accumulation of total biomass and total lipid yield, and enhanced the lipid productivity (29.52mgL-1d-1). Fatty acid compositions significantly varied in different cultivations. The content of C18 fatty acids in co-cultivation significantly increased, especially for oleic acid (32.45%) and linolenic acid (10.03%) compared with that in mono-cultivation. Moreover, high saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (55.85%) were obtained in co-cultivation, which suggests their potential as a biodiesel feedstock. © 2013 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

AB  - Discourses on the fast-track land reform programme in Zimbabwe have produced multiple and contested knowledge. Current debates have addressed the increase in biofuel production, which has been pioneered by different state and non-state actors. This has led to debates about understanding who wields more power in terms of the regulation of the agro-based fuel industry at a time of land redistributive reforms in Zimbabwe. Little attention, however, has been given to the issue of water resources in the current biofuel production projects. By examining the large-scale production of Jatropha and sugar cane in Chisumbanje and Mwenezi districts in Zimbabwe, we seek to unravel how the new investors have accumulated land and water resources. We analyse how this lead to water competition between the communities, settled in Chisumbanje and Mwenezi, and the new biofuel actors. In the following discussion, we seek to answer the following questions. What is the configuration of the new politics of water and post-land reform in Zimbabwe and how has it been impacted by biofuel production? How has competing water interests impacted principles of Water Act (1998) in Zimbabwe as biofuel production requires the use of large volumes of water? How are water resources creating conflicts over access and use in these communities? What role do water institutions play in these circumstances? How are different smallholder farmers and new conglomerates sharing water in a tense environment especially after fast-track land reform? We use ethnographic fieldwork in Mwenezi district and archival research in the case of Chisumbanje to outline various debates and viewpoints related to these questions. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Although biodiesel is among the most studied biofuels for diesel engines, it is usually produced from edible oils, which gives way to controversy between the use of land for fuel and food. For this reason, residues like olive-pomace oil are considered alternative raw materials to produce biodiesel that do not compete with the food industry. To gain knowledge about the implications of its use, olive-pomace oil methyl ester, straight and blended with diesel fuel, was evaluated as fuel in a direct injection diesel engine Perkins AD 3-152 and compared to the use of fossil diesel fuel. Performance curves were analyzed at full load and different speed settings. To perform the exergy balance of the tested fuels, the operating conditions corresponding to maximum engine power values were considered. It was found that the tested fuels offer similar performance parameters. When straight biodiesel was used instead of diesel fuel, maximum engine power decreased to 5.6%, while fuel consumption increased up to 7%. However, taking into consideration the Second Law of the Thermodynamics, the exergy efficiency and unitary exergetic cost reached during the operation of the engine under maximum power condition for the assessed fuels do not display significant differences. Based on the exergy results, it may be concluded that olive-pomace oil biodiesel and its blends with diesel fuel may substitute the use of diesel fuel in compression ignition engines without any exergy cost increment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It is common knowledge that the presence of trace metals in biofuels can be detrimental to the environment and long-term sustainable development. This study provides an insight into selective catalytic preparation of biofuel to compare uptake of trace metals in the biodiesel fraction with preferential base catalysts. The role of specific metal hydroxides in controlling trace metal content in biofuel production is relatively unexplored, and the effect of different homogeneous catalysts (NaOH, KOH) on metal retention in biodiesel from commercial neem oil was examined. A detailed study of this nature of catalyst vs. metal uptake is in the interest of sustainable living and could make a significant contribution to biofuels research. Both catalysts displayed variable uptake for certain toxic elements, which was attributed to the behavior of the catalyst in the reaction mixture. A general comparison reflected specific trends in metal retention (ICP-MS) with the use of different base catalysts. Challenges encountered by extending the study and using a heterogeneous catalyst (CaO) are presented. Our work could play a significant role in influencing catalyzed transesterfication processes to control elemental and toxic metal uptake in biofuels. The impact of our work on sustainable living is presented. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - Bio-diesel is an alternative to petroleum-based fuels resultant from animal fats, vegetable oils, and used waste cooking oil including triglycerides. Transesterification is the most familiar method and leads to monoalkyl esters of vegetable oils and fats, called bio-diesel when used for fuel purposes. The used cooking oils are used as raw material, adaption of continuous transesterification process and recovery of high quality glycerol from biodiesel by-product (glycerol) are most important options to be considered to lower the cost of biodiesel. The transesterification reaction is affected by molar ratio of glycosides to alcohol, catalysts, reaction temperature, reaction time and free fatty acids and water content of oils or fats. The mechanism of the transesterification show how the reaction occurs and progresses. The processes of transesterification with supercritical catalysts are also addressed.

AB  - The growth behavior of canary grass (Phalaris canariensis L) when cultivated in presence of farming fuels is reported in this work. P. canariensis L. is relevant in several countries. It is an emergent plant for phytoremediation and biofuel activities. The following variables: root length, stem length, total plant weight, green tissue weight (tiller, leaf), and total chlorophyll and chlorophyll a/b ratio, were monitored during the growth in presence of commercial fuels (premium grade, regular grade, diesel, and kerosene) at different concentrations. We applied a comprehensive statistical analysis to understand the results: Univariate analysis, factorial analysis of variance, and subsequent Tukey test were applied to the variables to assess the significance of the differences found. The normality of these variables was analyzed with the Shapiro Wilk test. All parameters were affected by all type and concentrations of fuels and its interaction. This is one of the first reported cases which describe the growth parameters responses from canary grass when cultivated in presence of an essentially constant concentration of farming fuels. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

Zhu et al. 2011a, Applied Thermal Engineering 31 (14-15): 2271-2278; Zhu et al. 2011b, Fuel 90: 1743-1750; Banapurmath, Tewari, and Hosmath 2008, Renewable Energy 33: 2007-2018; Banapurmath 2009, "Performance, Combustion and Emission Characteristics of a Single Cylinder Direct Injection CI Engine Operated on Dual Fuel Mode Using Honge Oil and Producer Gas." PhD thesis, 1-195; Banapurmath et al. 2011, Waste and Biomass Valorization 2: 1-11). In this context, the main objective of the present work is to study methods of biofuel production such as Honge oil methyl ester (HOME) using a conventional transesterification process and bioethanol from the Calliandra calothyrsus shrub using a new pretreatment method known as hydrothermal explosion. Further, experimental investigations were carried out on a single-cylinder, four-stroke, direct-injection stationary diesel engine operating in a dual-fuel mode using HOME, bioethanol and producer gas combinations to determine its performance, combustion and emission characteristics. The performance of the dual-fuel engine was analyzed at optimized engine conditions. HOME-Bioethanol (BE) blends such as HOME+ 5% bioethanol (BE5), HOME+ 10% bioethanol (BE10) and HOME+ 15% bioethanol (BE15) were prepared by adding bioethanol to HOME (on volume basis) in different proportions ranging from 5 to 15% with an increment of 5%. In this present work, the effect of different BE blends on the performance of producer gas fuelled dual fuel engine was studied. Experimental investigation on dual fuel engine using BE5-Producer gas operation resulted in up to 4-9% increased brake thermal efficiency with decreased hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and marginally increased nitric oxide (NOx) emission levels compared to HOME-Producer gas, BE10-producer gas and BE15-producer gas mode of operation. However, it was observed that, the overall performance of BE-producer gas operation was found to be lower compared to diesel-producer gas operation. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Corn cob (CC) and waste cooking oil (WCO) were co-pyrolyzed in a fixed bed. The effects of various temperatures of 500°C, 550°C, 600°C and CC/WCO mass ratios of 1:0, 1:0.1, 1:0.5, 1:1 and 0:1 were investigated, respectively. Results show that co-pyrolysis of CC/WCO produce more liquid and less bio-char than pyrolysis of CC individually. Bio-oil and bio-char yields were found to be largely dependent on temperature and CC/WCO ratios. GC/MS of bio-oil show it consists of different classes and amounts of organic compounds other than that from CC pyrolysis. Temperature of 550°C and CC/WCO ratio of 1:1 seem to be the optimum considering high bio-oil yields (68.6wt.%) and good bio-oil properties (HHV of 32.78MJ/kg). In this case, bio-char of 24.96MJ/kg appears attractive as a renewable source, while gas with LHV of 16.06MJ/Nm3 can be directly used in boilers as fuel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fast microwave-assisted pyrolysis (fMAP) in the presence of a microwave absorbent (SiC) and catalyst (HZSM-5) was tested on a Chlorella sp. strain and on a Nannochloropsis strain. The liquid products were characterized, and the effects of temperature and catalyst:biomass ratio were analyzed. For Chlorella sp., a temperature of 550. °C, with no catalyst were the optimal conditions, resulting in a maximum bio-oil yield of 57. wt.%. For Nannochloropsis, a temperature of 500. °C, with 0.5 of catalyst ratio were shown to be the optimal condition, resulting in a maximum bio-oil yield of 59. wt.%. These results show that the use of microwave absorbents in fMAP increased bio-oil yields and quality, and it is a promising technology to improve the commercial application and economic outlook of microwave pyrolysis technology. Additionally, the use of a different catalyst needs to be considered to improve the bio-oil characteristics. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Emulsification technique is one of the most important methods to the reduction of pollutants from diesel engine. In this research, a single cylinder diesel engine was operated with water in canola biodiesel as fuel and the effect of water emulsification on the engine performance and emissions were investigated. Emulsified biodiesel fuels of 3.5 and 10 water/water-biodiesel mixture fuel ratios by volume were used in a light-duty diesel engine, operating at various engine speeds. The results show that the brake engine torque, the brake engine power and the brake thermal efficiency decrease as the water percentage in the emulsion increases but the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) increases as the percentage of water increases in the emulsion fuel. In addition, carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) increase as the percentage of the water increases in the emulsion fuel. However, exhaust gas temperature, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and smoke emissions decrease as the percentage of water increases in the emulsion fuel.

AB  - The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of aldol condensation adducts is of key interest in the preparation of biofuels from biomass by catalytic routes. In this work, furfuryldeneacetoneis taken as model of biomass-derived condensation adduct with furanic rings, unsaturations and carbonyl functionalities. Four noble metal catalysts (alumina-supported Ru, Rh, Pd and Pt) were tested. Obtained results show that Rh and Ru catalysts are only active for the hydrogenation of aliphatic double bonds; whereas Pd, and specially Pt catalysts, are active for the total HDO of the adduct, yielding n-octane, with selectivities higher than 30% at 493. K after 24. h on stream (total conversion and carbon balance closure higher than 90%). Based on these results, a mechanism (considering serial, parallel and equilibrium steps) and the corresponding kinetic model have been proposed for explaining the different selectivity trends observed for these metals. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Transesterification has proved to be the best option for obtaining biodiesel and, depending on the type of alcohol used in the reaction, the type of biodiesel may be methyl ester or ethyl ester. Leaking biodiesel can reach water bodies, contaminating aquatic organisms, particularly fish. The objective of this study was to determine whether the soluble fraction of biodiesel (Bd), produced by both the ethylic (BdEt) and methylic (BdMt) routes, can cause cytotoxic, biochemical and genotoxic alterations in the hepatocyte cell line of Danio rerio (ZFL). The metabolic activity of the cell was quantified by the MTT reduction method, while genotoxic damage was analyzed by the comet assay with the addition of specific endonucleases. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant/biotransformation enzymes activity also were determined. The results indicate that both Bd increased ROS production, glutathione S-transferase activity and the occurrence of DNA damage. BdMt showed higher cytotoxicity than BdEt, and also caused oxidative damage to the DNA. In general, both Bd appear to be stressors for the cells, causing cytotoxic, biochemical and genetic alterations in ZFL cells, but the type and intensity of the changes found appear to be dependent on the biodiesel production route. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The agronomic performance of Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz (camelina or false flax) sown in autumn and spring over two consecutive years was tested in northern Italy. Seven C. sativa genotypes were tested and compared with rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). The main phenological stages and biometric traits were recorded, along with seed yield. In general, camelina showed a seed yield similar to that of rapeseed cultivated in the same locality and in the last decade in Italy. On average, the grain yields of camelina and rapeseed grown in the same location and conditions were ∼1340 and 1625kgha-1, respectively. The agronomic performance of camelina varied, with climatic events having a greater effect than sowing season or genotypes. Among the investigated genotypes, however, C. sativa accession CAM 40 was the most adaptable to unfavourable environmental conditions and CAM 172 to favourable conditions. With regard to the two sowing seasons, autumn planting allowed for better performance than spring planting during the second cultivation year. The phenotypic plasticity of camelina was estimated for the first time in the present work. Branching capability was the most plastic trait under favourable yielding conditions. Among the tested genotypes, CAM 40 showed limited yield plasticity and CAM 172 demonstrated high plasticity for the same trait, offering a greater potential for future genetic improvement. © CSIRO 2014.

AB  - Successful development of a large-scale microalgae-based biofuels industry requires comprehensive analysis and understanding of the feedstock supply chain-from facility siting and design through processing and upgrading of the feedstock to a fuel product. The evolution from pilot-scale production facilities to energy-scale operations presents many multi-disciplinary challenges, including a sustainable supply of water and nutrients, operational and infrastructure logistics, and economic competitiveness with petroleum-based fuels. These challenges are partially addressed by applying the Integrated Assessment Framework (IAF) - an integrated multi-scale modeling, analysis, and data management suite - to address key issues in developing and operating an open-pond microalgae production facility. This is done by analyzing how variability and uncertainty over space and through time affect feedstock production rates, and determining the site-specific "optimum" facility scale to minimize capital and operational expenses. This approach explicitly and systematically assesses the interdependence of biofuel production potential, associated resource requirements, and production system design trade-offs. To provide a baseline analysis, the IAF was applied to a set of sites in the southeastern U.S. with the potential to cumulatively produce 5 billion gallons per year. The results indicate costs can be reduced by scaling downstream processing capabilities to fit site-specific growing conditions, available and economically viable resources, and specific microalgal strains. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Thermally-enhanced bioremediation is a promising treatment approach for petroleum contamination; however, studies examining temperature effects on anaerobic biodegradation in zones containing light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) are lacking. Herein, laboratory microcosm studies were conducted for a former refinery to evaluate LNAPL transformation, sulfate reduction, and methane generation over a one-year period for temperatures ranging from 4 to 40 °C, and microbial community shifts were characterized. Temperatures of 22 and 30 °C significantly increased total biogas generation compared to lower (4 and 9 °C) and higher temperatures (35 and 40 °C; p < 0.1). Additionally, at 22 and 30 °C methane generation commenced ~6 months earlier than for 35 and 40 °C. Statistically significant biodegradation of benzene, toluene and xylenes was observed at elevated temperatures but not at lower temperatures (p < 0.1). Additionally, a novel differential chromatogram approach was developed to overcome challenges associated with resolving losses in complex mixtures of hydrocarbons, and application of this method revealed greater losses of hydrocarbons at 22 and 30 °C as compared to lower and higher temperatures. Finally, molecular biology assays revealed that the composition and activity of microbial communities shifted in a temperature-dependent manner. Collectively, results demonstrated that anaerobic biodegradation processes can be enhanced by increasing the temperature of LNAPL-containing soils, but biodegradation does not simply increase as temperature increases likely due to a lack of microorganisms that thrive at temperatures well above the historical high temperatures for a site. Rather, optimal degradation is achieved by holding soils at the high end of, or slightly higher than, their natural range. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - A method for synthesizing augmented biofuel processes, which improve biomass carbon conversion to liquid fuel (ηcarbon) using supplemental solar energy as heat, H2, and electricity is presented. For a target ηcarbon, our method identifies augmented processes requiring the least solar energy input. A nonconvex mixed integer nonlinear programming model allowing for simultaneous mass, heat, and power integration, is built over a process superstructure and solved using global optimization tools. As a case study, biomass thermochemical conversion via gasification/Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and fast-hydropyrolysis/hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is considered. The optimal process configurations can be categorized either as standalone (ηcarbon≤54%), augmented using solar heat (54%≤ηcarbon≤74%), or augmented using solar heat and H2 (74≤ηcarbon≤95%). Importantly, the process H2 consumption is found to be close to the derived theoretical minimum values. To accommodate for the intermittency of solar heat/H2, we suggest processes that can operate at low and high ηcarbon. © 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The impacts of alternative harvesting and extraction technologies on the economic and financial feasibility of an algal farm are analyzed. Two harvesting technologies and three extraction technologies are compared as to their impacts on the revenues, expenses, and cost of production for an algal farm. Analysis is completed using the Farm-level Algae Risk Model (FARM) to simulate the economic feasibility and probabilistic cost of algal lipid production for the farms with alternative technologies. The economic analysis incorporates production, price, and financial risks algal farms will likely face over a 10-year period. The baseline harvesting system, centrifuge, is compared to the electrocoagulation (EC) system. For extraction a wet solvent system is postulated as the baseline and is compared to the Hydrothermal Liquefaction-Catalytic Hydrothermal Gasification (HTL-CHG) and pyrolysis systems. Results indicate that each of the new technologies is an improvement over the baseline. The combination of the most promising harvesting and extraction systems shows a 64% improvement in net present value (NPV) and a 90% reduction in the cost of producing lipid compared to the baseline. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study demonstrates low-emission combustion of diesel, biodiesel and straight vegetable oil (VO) in a fuel-flexible combustor employing a flow blurring (FB) injector for fuel atomization. Measurements of gas temperature and CO and NO. x concentrations at various axial and radial locations of the combustor are acquired using custom-designed thermocouple and gas sampling probes. Heat loss rate through the combustor is estimated from wall temperatures measured by an infra-red camera. A simple droplet model is used to predict fuel vaporization behavior in the dark-region near the injector exit. Results show that the FB injector produced clean blue flames indicating mainly premixed combustion for all three fuels. Matching profiles of heat loss rate and product gas temperature show that the combustion efficiency is fuel independent. NO. x emissions for the three fuels agree with each other within the measurement uncertainties. CO emissions of straight VO are slightly higher than those for diesel and biodiesel. This difference in CO emissions is explained by the slower evaporation rate of straight VO droplets compared to diesel or biodiesel droplets. This study shows that with FB injector, straight VO without preheating or chemical pre-processing can be cleanly combusted in furnaces, boilers, or stationary power generation systems, thereby offering significant economical and environmental benefits. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We report distilled technical cashew nut shell liquid (DT-CNSL) as a non-transesterified biofuel and also as an additive to convert triglycerides to biofuel, without the need for the formation of methyl esters. DT-CNSL blends of diesel obey physico-chemical parameters of diesel. DT-CNSL offers stability to blends of straight vegetable oil (SVO) and tallow oil in diesel. Fluorescence studies using charge transfer probes show that the blend of DT-CNSL, triglycerides and diesel is a uniform solution, and fluorescence behavior is similar to that of diesel. The economics for the cultivation of cashew (Anacardium occidentale), its industrial use and rich carbon sink properties indicate that DT-CNSL could complement or replace traditional biodiesel crops like Jatropha and improve income for farmers. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bioethanol is a promising substitute for conventional fossil fuels. The focus of this work was to convert commercial cellulose (Avicel® PH-101) to ethanol. In the first step, cellulose was selectively converted to glucose. Cellulose hydrolysis was carried out under microwave irradiation using hydrochloric acid as catalyst. Process parameters - acid concentration, irradiation time, and power consumption - were optimized. A yield of 0.67g glucose/g cellulose was achieved under modest reaction conditions (2.38M acid concentration, irradiation time - 7min, 70% of power consumption). The glucose thus produced was then converted to ethanol by fermention with yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The speed, selective nature of the process and the attractive overall yield indicate that cellulose, a vast carbohydrate source, could indeed be a sustainable feedstock for bioethanol production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. (jatropha) is a species identified for biofuel production because of the high quality of the oil produced by its seeds. However, jatropha is undomesticated and little information is available about its reproductive characteristics. Breeding and genetic improvement programs are much needed for the jatropha development as a bioenergy crop. Information about floral display and mode of reproduction are considered essential for breeding programs. In this study, the total number of female flowers, male to female flower ratio, fruit set, in vitro pollen germination, and the formation of fruits by apomixis, self-pollination, and natural pollination were evaluated in 17 jatropha accessions planted in South Florida. The total number of female flowers per inflorescence and male to female flower ration ranged from 2.8 to 9.1 and 9.9:1 to 55.4 : 1, respectively. During summer 2011, high fruit setting average was observed (75.5%). In vitro pollen germination varied from 64.6% during spring 2011 to 51.6% during fall 2011. The fruit set observed was from 10.1% to 64.0% through natural pollination and apomixes, respectively. Characteristics such as fruit fresh weight, number of seeds per fruit, seed dry weight, and oil content were influenced by mode of reproduction. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The use of Jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) as a source of biofuel is documented. The physiological characteristics and growth studies of Jatropha have received less attention. In the present study, we measured leaf gas exchange with an infrared gas analyzer for red (immature) and green (mature) leaves of Jatropha curcas in response to various environmental conditions including photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), vapor pressure difference, and temperature. The seedlings were grown in pots for 45 days in a natural environment. Jatropha is a C3 plant based on its leaf-gas exchange characteristics. The optimal light-saturated photosynthetic CO2 assimilation, leaf conductance, and transpiration occurred in the range of 500-1000 μmol m-2 s-1 PPFD, depending upon the leaf positions and leaf types during growth. The net rates of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration, and water-use efficiency were significantly affected by the leaf position and epigenetic variables, i.e. temperature, vapor pressure difference, and irradiance. © TÜBİTAK.

AB  - The world is facing many global challenges, such as sustainable production methods, and adapting to climate change. As a result of the climate change and the developing of the living standard of the people, the pressure on energy and water resource is increasing, and pollution of the air and water as well as the degradation of land are increasing in a tremendous way and will continue to grow. In Jordan, as a poor water country, a low quantity of rainfall, especially in southern Jordan, is a major cause of drought. Consequently, producers will face a bigger productivity drop. Cultivating special plants to produce energy and producing biofuel are considered alternative energy sources. Analysing the use of these alternatives is very complex because the technical issue, environmental, social and economic impact should be assessed. Nevertheless, using scare resources, such as water, and the impact on food security are other variables that should be considered. This study focuses on producing biofuel in an agricultural area from an economic point of view, with specific attention on food and water security as well as the environmental impact. The study depended on a case study that applies planting Jatropha to produce biofuel. As a conclusion the producing oil from Jatropha has high potential to be profitable. Socially and environmentally of producing biofuel from Jatropha is will not be on competition in using the resources with other crops, because it could be planted in marginal land and using low quality water. The growing global demand for liquid biofuel has been seen as a way to create new employment opportunities through the work in the farms or in the biofuel factories, thus leading to increase income generation and rural development, in addition to saving the energy from other sources.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biodiesel is a green, safe, renewable alternative fuel, which could partly solve the problem of energy shortage and environmental pollution. Heterogeneous catalysis is an economically and ecologically important process because catalysts have many advantages: noncorrosive, environmentally benign and fewer disposal problems. They are also much easier to be separated from liquid products and can be designed to give higher activity and longer catalyst lifetimes. This work aims to develop a novel approach for biodiesel production from soybean oil by using heterogeneous catalyst. RESULTS: A series of solid base catalysts were prepared from the support attapulgite (ATP) loaded with potassium carbonate by an impregnation method. The optimal catalyst preparation conditions were 400°C calcination temperature and 4.2:1 molar ratio of K:ATP. When transesterification reaction was carried out with a molar ratio of methanol to oil 22:1, a reaction time 3.0 h, a reaction temperature 60°C and catalyst amount 8.0%, the highest biodiesel yield reached 93.4%. The catalyst has longer lifetime and maintained sustained activity after being used for five cycles. CONCLUSIONS: The prepared heterogeneous catalyst had high catalytic activity for the transesterification reaction. The properties of biodiesel make it a realistic fuel as an alternative to diesel. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Herein, a duckweed biocrude produced from the hydrothermal liquefaction of Lemna minor was treated in subcritical water with added H2. Effects of several different commercially available materials such as Ru/C, Pd/C, Pt/C, Pt/γ-Al2O3, Pt/C-sulfide, Rh/γ-Al2O3, activated carbon, MoS2, Mo2C, Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3, and zeolite on the yields of product fractions and the deoxygenation, denitrogenation, and desulfurization of biocrude at 350°C were examined, respectively. All the materials showed catalytic activity for deoxygenation and desulfurization of the biocrude and only Ru/C showed activity for denitrogenation. Of those catalysts examined, Pt/C showed the best performance for deoxygenation. Among all the upgraded oils, the oil produced with Ru/C shows the lowest sulfur, the highest hydrocarbon content (25.6%), the highest energy recovery (85.5%), and the highest higher heating value (42.6MJ/kg). The gaseous products were mainly unreacted H2, CH4, CO2, and C2H6. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A critical factor in implementing microalgal biofuels for mass production is the nutrient requirements. The current study investigated the fate of macro- and micronutrients and their availability in a sequential phototrophic- heterotrophic production process for the lipid rich microalga Auxenochlorella protothecoides. More than 99 % (by weight) of overall process nutrients were supplied during the initial photoautotrophic stage reflecting its significantly larger volume. Under photoautotrophic growth conditions only 9-35 % of supplied Mn, S, Fe, N, Mg, and Cu and less than 5 % of P, Mo, Co, B, Zn, and Ca were consumed by the algae. The rest of these nutrients remain in the spent growth media during the culture concentration-down from an 800 L phototrophic pond to a 5 L heterotrophic fermenter. In contrast, Zn, Mo, Mn, Mg, Ca, and N were exhausted (90-99 % removal) during the first 25 h of the heterotrophic growth stage. The depletion of these key nutrients may have ultimately limited the final biomass density and/or lipid productivity achieved. Approximately 10-20 % of the total supplied S, Mn, Fe, N, and Cu and 5 % of Ca and Zn were assimilated into algal biomass. Several elements including N, P, Mn, B, Cu, Ca, Mg, S, and Fe were released back into the liquid phase by anaerobic digestion (AD) of the residual biomass after lipid extraction. The nutrients recovered from the AD effluent and remaining in the spent medium should be recycled or their initial concentration to the phototrophic stage decreased to enhance process economics and sustainability for future commercialization of algal-derived biofuels. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxygenated terpenoids such as 1,4-cineole and 1,8-cineole can be major components of turpentine and essential oils. These terpenoids can also be produced from sugars via a biosynthetic approach. Catalytic deoxygenation of these substrates has the potential to efficiently generate commercially important chemicals and high density fuels for turbine or diesel propulsion. RESULTS: The low-temperature deoxygenation reactions of 1,4-cineole and 1,8-cineole over the heterogeneous acid catalysts Amberlyst-15, Nafion SAC-13, and Montmorillonite K10 have been studied. 1,4-cineole was found to isomerize to terpinene-1-ol followed by dehydration to a mixture primarily composed of α- and γ-terpinene. In a similar manner, 1,8-cineole was found to isomerize to α-terpineol followed by dehydration to primarily terpinolene and α-terpinene. Amberlyst-15 was the most active catalyst on a mass basis and gave 100% conversion of 1,4-cineole in 24 h at 85°C. Longer reaction times or higher reaction temperatures led to significant conversion of the dehydrated monoterpenes to diterpenes. Similar trends were observed for Nafion SAC-13 and Montmorillonite K10. CONCLUSION: This work provides important mechanistic information regarding the dehydration chemistry of cineoles and shows the potential of heterogeneous acid catalysts to effectively convert oxygenated terpenoids to high density hydrocarbon mixtures with potential uses as renewable diesel fuels.

AB  - In this study, a novel method for the production of biodiesel under mild conditions using fine particles of sodium methoxide formed in dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is proposed. Biodiesel is generally produced from vegetable oils by the transesterification of triglycerides with methanol. However, this reaction produces glycerol as a byproduct, and raw materials are not effectively utilized. Transesterification with DMC has recently been studied because glycerol is not formed in the process. Although solid-state sodium methoxide has been reported to be inactive for this reaction, the catalytic activity dramatically increased with the preparation of fine catalyst powders by crystallization. The transesterification of canola oil with DMC was studied using this catalyst for the preparation of biodiesel. A conversion greater than 96% was obtained at 65. °C for 2. h with a 3:1. M ratio of DMC and oil and 2.0. wt% catalyst. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Direct catalytic conversion of pine wood under H2 into an organic liquid composed of saturated alkanes and aromatics has been achieved. The resulting organic liquids are easily isolated from the aqueous phase with a yield up to 30 wt%. Importantly, the oxygen content is about 3 wt% and has a higher heating value of 41 MJ kg-1 which is very close to standard diesel (44 MJ kg-1) used in automotive fuels. The multi-functional catalysts comprise well size controlled bimetallic nanoparticles (Cu-Ru) supported on heteropolyacid salts. The residual acidic proton of the heteropolyanion salt combined with bimetallic nanoparticles produced a multifunctional catalyst, featuring depolymerisation, deoxygenation and hydrogenation in a single batch reactor. Current results present an alternative approach to transform lignocellulosic biomass (oxygen content higher than 40 wt%) directly into an organic liquid (oxygen content less than 5 wt%) suitable as additives in biofuels.

AB  - Because some algae can be grown photoautotrophically, heterotrophically, and/or mixotrophically, they show promise for lipid production as biofuel feedstock with different conditions. In this study, we analyzed microalga Chlorella sorokiniana for biomass and lipid production under three culture modes. The best growth performance was obtained under mixotrophic conditions compared with photoautotrophic and heterotrophic conditions. With the addition of 4gL-1 glucose, the specific growth rate (3.40d-1) and maximum biomass dry weight (DW, 3.55gL-1) in the mixotrophic culture were 1.8- and 2.4-fold of those in the heterotrophic culture, and 5.4- and 5.2-fold of those under the photoautotrophic culture. Most significantly, the biomass yield based on consumed glucose reached values of up to 0.82gg-1, which was only 0.34gg-1 in the corresponding heterotrophic condition. Moreover, the lipid content in mixotrophic algae also substantially increased. At a light intensity of 50μmolm-2s-1, a lipid content of 45% was achieved compared to only 13% in the heterotrophic culture. The PSII inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) had little effect on the maximum DW and lipid content in the heterotrophic culture, but caused a significant decline in the mixotrophic culture. Mixotrophic cultures supplied with air grew as well as cultures supplied with 1% CO2. Mixotrophy also changed the temperature profiles for growth, increasing the optimum from 25°C to 37°C. These results indicate that C. sorokiniana may be an ideal candidate for mixotrophic cultivation that offers great potential in the production of renewable biomass for bioenergy applications. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To better understand the process of fuel biodeterioration, Jet-A and F-76 diesel fuel were exposed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common fuel contaminant, and Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus, a marine hydrocarbon degrader, and the extent of hydrocarbon decomposition produced by these bacteria determined. Degradation assays containing fuel-minimal media mixtures and bacteria were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) to discern the consumption of fuel hydrocarbons. Experiments were conducted in closed systems to prevent evaporation of hydrocarbons and allow accurate quantitation. Results indicated that P.aeruginosa preferred to consume mid-range normal alkanes (C12-C18) followed by higher chain n-alkanes (C19-C23). Cycloparaffins were consumed at much lower rates, while aromatic and isoparaffins were not consumed. However, M.hydrocarbonoclasticus showed a different profile with preferential degradation of shorter n-alkanes (C8-C11) and specific aromatic compounds. Both types of bacteria were incapable of degrading branched alkanes. During larger scale bioreactor tests, bacteria were able to degrade similar hydrocarbons. This study clearly demonstrated that the effects of fuel biodeterioration can go well beyond corrosion and filter fouling, with different bacteria metabolizing different fuel hydrocarbons and presenting the possibility for microbes to directly change fuel composition and properties. Results are discussed in light of the use of newer alternative fuels which can have dramatically different hydrocarbon profiles compared to conventional petroleum fuels. © 2014.

AB  - In 2011 the Global Bioenergy Partnership (GBEP) released a set of indicators for sustainable bioenergy. However, two important issues still remain unresolved. One of them is the definition of "sustainability", and the other is the lack of a holistic assessment tool for drawing conclusions from the indicators. The aim of this paper is to provide clarification on the concept of sustainability in the context of the GBEP indicators, and to develop a holistic assessment tool for assessing the sustainability of bioenergy programmes. The GBEP indicators are diverse in terms of "what to measure", and some of them are not sufficiently directly related to the concept of sustainability. This makes the indicators ambiguous regarding to sustainability assessment. This study identifies whether the GBEP indicators are concerned with strong or weak sustainability, and develops a tool based on Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) which can be used for assessing sustainability of bioenergy programmes using the GBEP indicators. The tool is demonstrated in an example for assessing the sustainability of biofuel production in a case study of Kyoto. We found that the biodiesel production in Kyoto performs well on the environmental pillar, but badly on the economic pillar, and based on the weights applied in this study the overall sustainability is better than diesel fuel. The holistic assessment tool provides practical information to policymakers on both ex-ante and ex-post policy evaluations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Algae can be a viable source for biofuel production, but the source of nitrogen used to cultivate could affect algae yields. Here, we observe how various nitrogen treatments can impact the growth and biovolume of microalga Nannochloropsis salina as well as invasion of undesired organisms. Invading organisms increase the likelihood of crashes of the desired microalgae culture. Experiments were conducted over 28 days in open aquaria in a greenhouse. We used five different nitrogen treatments; ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), urea (CH4N2O), and a mixture of all these sources. Highest values for Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), a measure of potential harvest rate based on population productivity, were observed in the urea treatment, but cell size was smaller compared to other treatments. Sodium nitrate and the mixture of nitrogen sources also had high MSY values but larger cell sizes, making them the treatments with highest total biovolume. The highest percentages of lipid by weight, but also highest densities of invading organisms were observed in the mixed treatment. Our results suggest that tradeoffs between biovolume and lipid yields as well as culture success can ultimately decide what nitrogen sources to use. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Several commercial and near-commercial opportunities for liquid and gaseous wood-based fuels are being explored by pulp and paper companies. Ensyn is undertaking a $4-million expansion to upgrade its existing production facility in Renfrew, to a dedicated biofuels facility with enhanced production capacity of 13 million litres/year of a liquid biofuel. The company uses its Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP®) technology, a pyrolysis process, to produce RFO™ for sale as heating oil or as a refinery feedstock for production of gasoline and diesel in an application known as refinery coprocessing. Valmet, UPM and Fortum have partnered to develop transportation and heating fuels, as well as high value bio-liquids, from woody biomass. The five-year development project will use a catalytic pyrolysis technology called LignoCat to upgrade bio-oil. KiOR is making advanced biofuels via pyrolysis from various non-food feedstocks including woody biomass.

AB  - The increased need for biodiesel feedstocks has caused various vegetable oils to be examined for this purpose. In the present work, the methyl esters of kapok (Ceiba pentandra) oil were prepared. The essential fuel properties were comprehensively determined and evaluated in comparison to specifications in biodiesel standards and some prior results. The kinematic viscosity of kapok oil methyl esters was greater than expected, an observation traced to the elevated amounts of methyl esters with cyclic moieties. Overall, kapok oil is a potential biodiesel feedstock. The 1Hand 13C NMR spectra of kapok methyl esters are reported. © 2014.

AB  - Technological, energetic, economic and environmental feasibilities of a production system should be analyzed for the best conditions for implementing a process to be established. Refined soybean oil is a high-cost feedstock for biodiesel production, because it involves crop production, oil extraction and refining. Desolventizing and refining steps are required to obtain edible oils within the market quality standards. The introduction of a new technology, i.e. the direct use of the rich-in-soybean oil ethanolic miscella to produce biodiesel would however avoid these high energy demanding steps. Material and energy flow analysis are tools adopted to evaluate production systems and to identify the most energy demanding steps, in order to improve the processes. This study aimed to establish a comparative analysis between the conventional biodiesel production process in Brazil and the direct rich-in-soybean oil ethanolic miscella transesterification based on the energy flow. Energy flows confirmed that biodiesel feedstock production is the most energy demanding step, followed by oil extraction. Rich-in-oil miscella transesterification step by chemical route demanded less energy, followed by refined oil ethanolysis and methanolysis. The enzymatic catalysis had the highest energy demand, due to the amount and especially, the catalyst support composition. Generally speaking, refined oil ethanolysis process presented better energy balance (60.5MJkg-1), followed by refined oil methanolysis (55.4MJkg-1), rich-in-oil miscella chemical ethanolysis (44.3MJkg-1), rich-in-oil miscella enzymatic ethanolysis with co-solvent (9.5MJkg-1) and rich-in-oil miscella enzymatic ethanolysis (9.4MJkg-1). This showed that rich-in-oil miscella process has high potential to produce biodiesel competitively. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Basic materials of biodiesels and molecular structure of different biodiesels were discussed with special focus on their oxidation stability and post-additization. Commercial biodiesels produced from rapeseed oil and used cooking oil were blended to diesel fuel in 5%, 7%, and 10% mass fraction. The samples were stored at ambient temperature for one year to simulate the effects of strategic storage and/or long stock turnover rate. Following the one year storage period the samples were treated with BHT antioxidant and/or succinic type detergent-dispersant additives in 300mgkg-1, 600mgkg-1 and 900mgkg-1 concentrations. BHT was applied as antioxidant additive, while the detergent-dispersant additives were either newly developed additives (polyisobutylene succinic anhydride derivatives containing fatty acid methyl ester in their molecular structure) or commercial ones. Structure of the developed additives and their mechanism is described in detail. Rancimat and Seta TOST devices were applied to evaluate the effect of the additives on the oxidation stability of the samples. It was found that the decrease of oxidation stability during storage can be partially compensated with post-additization by suitable detergent-dispersant additives. Oxidation of biodiesels during Rancimat measurement was investigated with infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that during the thermal oxidation fatty acid methyl esters decompose to carbonyl, carboxyl and hydroxyl compounds, while cis-trans isomerization also occurs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas has been recognized as an ideal plant for biodiesel. There are unlimited reasons to consider Jatropha curcas a better tree borne oilseed plants than any other as it grows well on arid soils and entail minimal investment. The present study evaluates the effect of seed storage on quality and quantity of oil content such that it can be used for oil extraction and ensures availability of biodiesel throughout the year. The seeds were collected and stored at four temperatures viz. -5°C, 0 °C, 5°C and room temperature (open air condition) for 15 months of storage durations and evaluated at every three months interval. There was a significant decrease in oil content and oil quality with increase in storage duration. Although, the seed stored at temperature 5°C gave the highest quality and quantity attributes at all durations. The first 3 months of storage account for the least decline as in the initial oil content in Kernel weight basis (54.61%) and seed weight basis (36.12%), there was a only decrease of 4.67% and 4.97% respectively at 5°C whereas in other temperatures viz. -5°C, 0°C and room temperature (open air condition), there was a decline of 18.11, 14.48 and 9.06% in kernel weight basis and 18.36, 15.14 and 9.30% in seed weight basis respectively which accelerated with duration. Similarly, quality parameters viz. moisture content, acid value, iodine value, saponification value, refractive index (30°C), relative viscosity and specific gravity were initially as 7.59%, 1.42 mg KOH g-1 oil, 108.61 g I 100g-1 oil, 189.37 mg KOH g-1 oil, 1.466, 21.30 and 0.911 respectively which 2 change to 13.71 %, 1.74 mg KOH g-1 oil, 107.95 g I 100g-1 oil, 191.48 mg KOH g-1 oil, 1.470, 23.45 and 2 0.918, respectively after 3 months of storage. Hence, change in quality and quantity parameters indicated the importance of proper seed storage on availability of bio-diesel throughout the year and economics in its processing i.e., transesterification. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).

AB  - To achieve effective bioremediation within short warm seasons of cold climates, microbial adaptation periods to the contaminant should be brief. The current study investigated growth phases for soil spiked with diesel, Syntroleum, or fish biodiesel, using microbial inocula adapted to the specific substrates. For modeling hydrocarbon degradation, multi-phase first order kinetics was assumed, comparing linear regression with nonlinear parameter optimization of rate constants and phase durations. Lag phase periods of 5 to &gt;28d were followed by short and intense exponential growth phases with high rate constants (e.g. from kFish=0.0013±0.0002 to kSyntr=0.015±0.001d-1). Hydrocarbon mineralization was highest for Syntroleum contamination, where up to three times higher cumulative CO2 production was achieved than for diesel fuel, with fish biodiesel showing initially the slowest degradation. The amount of hydrocarbons recovered from the soil by GC-MS decreased in the order fish biodiesel&gt;diesel&gt;Syntroleum. During initial weeks, biodegradation was higher for microbial inocula adapted to a specific fuel type, whereby the main effect of the inoculum was to shorten the lag phase duration; however, the inoculum's importance diminished after daily respiration peaked. In conclusion, addition of an inoculum to increase biodegradation rates was not necessary. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The environmental advantages of biofuels cannot only evaluate the final production of pollutants resulting from the combustion of biofuels in the vehicle, but it is necessary to take into account the entire life cycle of fuels including the initial phase of production of raw materials through production to finally the fuel burning vehicle and how it affects the vehicle mechanisms. The Article describes the possibilities of powering diesel engines based on vegetable oils (RME, rapeseed oil) as an alternative to standard diesel fuel. It deals with the properties of biofuels and their potential use in the internal combustion engines by the structural adjustment of the fuel system or the combustion chamber. It also highlights the potential negative impacts of vegetable oils on the machine's operability and the possibility of reducing the negative effects. The article is based on laboratory analysis of tribotechnical diagnostics. They describe the current state of oil, its primary and secondary pollution and wear of the machine. The important method is ferrography to which the main emphasis is focused. The experimental section analyzes the impact of biofuels on the quality of oil used to fill diesel engines, and establishes an optimal oil change interval. For minimization the negative effects of biofuels is tribotechnical diagnosis necessary part of fuels quality evaluation.

AB  - Due to the increasing environmental demands of the European Union for reducing emissions, it is necessary to utilize biofuels at the expense of the conventional fossil fuel BA95. Biofuels in spark-ignition engines usually use ethanol at a ratio of up to 85% to 15% of the conventional fuel BA95. Such a fuel is known as E85. Butanol also has very similar properties to ethanol. Ethanol is a higher alcohol. For comparison, ethanol and butanol fuels with conventional fuels were chosen for the vehicle Saab 9-5, turbo-charged 2.3l. This vehicle is completely adapted to operation on ethanol fuel (broad adaptation control unit, suitable sealing elements, fuel pump, etc.). The engine performance and emissions were monitored when operating on these fuels as compared to the conventional fuels BA95. It can be stated that the engine reached higher performance parameters when operating on ethanol and butanol fuels. This is due to the fact that the control unit increases the fuel supply during operation on biofuels (lower calorific value of fuel). There is no lean combustion and the possible damage to the engine during long-term operation. From the perspective of bootable showing, butanol fuel has worse parameters compared to ethanol fuel and conventional fuels.

AB  - Lignocellulosic residues as for instance corncobs can be used as substrates for the production of biofuels. The corncobs are usually pre-treated in a thermal-physical step (steam explosion) before enzymatic hydrolysis. The pre-treatment process increases the accessibility of the raw material for the hydrolysis. The products of the hydrolyses are used as substrates for the fermentation of bio-ethanol. As an alternative, the hydrolysates could be used for the fermentation of oleaginous yeasts. These yeasts produce and accumulate lipids from glucose during growth. For the energetic use in the form of bio-diesel, the lipids can be converted into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) in the same way as vegetable oils. The fibre composition of the raw material was determined in regard to the proportions of cellulose, hemicellulose und lignin. It was investigated whether different corn varieties show varying compositions. The fibre compositions before the pre-treatment of ten different varieties of corncobs (from locations in Upper Austria) were determined. No significant differences were observed (cellulose: 38.8% ± 2.5%, hemicellulose: 44.4% ± 5.2%, lignin: 11.9% ± 2.3% in the dry matter).

AB  - In urban forestry and greening millions of tons of lignocellulosic waste is produced every year. Although lignocellulosic materials are considered one of the most promising feedstock for the bioethanol production, biomass from urban greening and forestry goes unused. Aim of this research was to investigate the potential of such waste biomass for bioethanol production. Woody and non-woody vegetation from different sources was investigated: old and fresh leaves, and mixed waste from urban greening which contained grass, twigs, and leaves. Cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin contents in the samples were determined using fibre analysis. Dilute acid was used for pre-treatment at temperature of 130°C in order to compare yields from different methods. Thermochemical pre-treatment was followed by enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation. Produced glucose and ethanol contents were measured using electrochemical analyser. Waste from urban greening had the highest cellulose content of 22.96% and gave the best glucose and ethanol yields, 154.5 g kg-1 and 62.5 g kg-1, respectively when the sample was pre-treated with dilute H2SO4. In addition, map analysis was used to assess the area manageable by urban forestry and greening in the city of Tartu to estimate the potential of greening and forestry waste as a substrate for bioethanol production that could be used as a fuel in city's public transportation system. In conclusion, it was shown that the waste from urban greening and forestry is a very promising raw material for biofuel production considering its localization and high cellulose content.

AB  - Research on biofuel production pathways from algae continues because among other potential advantages they avoid key consequential effects of terrestrial oil crops, such as competition for cropland. However, the economics, energetic balance, and climate change emissions from algal biofuels pathways do not always show great potential, due in part to high fertilizer demand. Nutrient recycling from algal biomass residue is likely to be essential for reducing the environmental impacts and cost associated with algae-derived fuels. After a review of available technologies, anaerobic digestion (AD) and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) were selected and compared on their nutrient recycling and energy recovery potential for lipid-extracted algal biomass using the microalgae strain Scenedesmus dimorphus. For 1 kg (dry weight) of algae cultivated in an open raceway pond, 40.7 g N and 3.8 g P can be recycled through AD, while 26.0 g N and 6.8 g P can be recycled through HTL. In terms of energy production, 2.49 MJ heat and 2.61 MJ electricity are generated from AD biogas combustion to meet production system demands, while 3.30 MJ heat and 0.95 MJ electricity from HTL products are generated and used within the production system. Assuming recycled nutrient products from AD or HTL technologies displace demand for synthetic fertilizers, and energy products displace natural gas and electricity, the life cycle greenhouse gas reduction achieved by adding AD to the simulated algal oil production system is between 622 and 808 g carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2e)/kg biomass depending on substitution assumptions, while the life cycle GHG reduction achieved by HTL is between 513 and 535 g CO2e/kg biomass depending on substitution assumptions. Based on the effectiveness of nutrient recycling and energy recovery, as well as technology maturity, AD appears to perform better than HTL as a nutrient and energy recycling technology in algae oil production systems. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biomass and lipid accumulation of heterotrophic microalgae Chlorella protothecoides by supplying mixed waste substrate of brewer fermentation and crude glycerol were investigated. The biomass concentrations of the old and the new C. protothecoides strains on day 6 reached 14.07 and 12.73. g/L, respectively, which were comparable to those in basal medium with supplement of glucose and yeast extract (BM-GY) (14.47. g/L for old strains and 11.43. g/L for new strains) ( P > 0.05). Approximately 81.5% of total organic carbon and 65.1% of total nitrogen in the mixed waste were effectively removed. The accumulated lipid productivities of the old and the new C. protothecoides strains in BM-GY were 2.07 and 1.61. g/L/day, respectively, whereas in the mixed waste, lipid productivities could reach 2.12 and 1.81. g/L/day, respectively. Our result highlights a new approach of mixing carbon-rich and nitrogen-rich wastes as economical and practical alternative substrates for biofuel production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel obtained from microalgae is considered a promising alternative to conventional diesel fuel. However, it has been proposed that cultivation of algae for the sole purpose of making biodiesel is neither economically efficient nor sustainable. Nevertheless, there are several ways in which microalgae can be utilized to their full potential. One possibility is to view the cultivation and utilization of microalgae as a complex process that includes wastewater treatment, carbon dioxide sequestration, production of nutritional supplements, biofuels etc. The aim of this paper is to review the most promising possibilities of combining different cultivation strategies/technologies with the coproduction of high value products (e.g. Ω-fatty acids) and biofuels (algal diesel, ethanol and biogas).

AB  - A new biodiesel-like biofuel is obtained by the enzymatic ethanolysis reaction of sunflower oil with ethanol, in free solvent media, by using BIOLIPASE-R, a multipurpose alimentary additive from Biocon®-Spain that is a low cost lipase from a strain of Rhizopus oryzae. This biofuel is composed by two parts of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) and one of monoglyceride (MG), which in this form integrates glycerol, through the application of the 1,3-selective lipases. Thus, this process minimizes waste generation and maximizes the efficiency of the process because no residual glycerol is produced. Response surface methodology (RSM) is employed to evaluate the main reaction parameters (reaction temperature, oil/ethanol ratio and pH) on the sunflower oil conversion. Water content and amount of lipase were also previously investigated. Regarding the results, we found that it operates optimally with a water content of the reaction medium of 0.15%, 0.05%-0.1% lipase by weight relative to the weight of oil used, OPEN ACCESS 20 °C, volume ratio (mL/mL) oil/ethanol 12/3.5 and pH 12 (by addition of 50 μL of 10 N NaOH solution). These results have proven a very good efficiency of the biocatalyst in the studied selective process. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - The large number of vehicles necessitated the introduction of rules that focus in addition to traffic safety on the ecology of operation of the engine especially. Over time, the emission limits in amendments to regulations tightened, and this also applies to agriculture. One of the efforts of the EU is the introduction of biofuels precisely because, among other things, they have an impact on reducing emissions from the operation of internal combustion engines. Fatty acid methyl ester is promoted as the best substitute for diesel fuels, in the Czech conditions, namely rapeseed methyl ester (RME - Rapeseed Methyl Ester). The requirements for diesel fuel are established with the standard EN 590 and the requirements for RME with the standard EN 14 214. Efforts are made to promote replacement of the old fleet with the new. A large percentage of obsolete vehicles in poor condition still remain in use in small farms. In this paper, a comparison of a smoke combustion engine tractor Zetor 8641 Forterra when using fuels with different ratios of diesel and RME is provided. For comparison, a common test is performed in the technical emission (measurement of smoke on the principle of free acceleration). In order to assess the influence of the technical condition of an internal combustion engine and rapeseed methyl ester on smoke, gradually simulated faults of turbochargers, opening pressure and spray of pre-injection fuel injectors on a selected motor are used. The result showed that deteriorating technical condition of an internal combustion engine decreases the positive effect of rapeseed oil methyl ester blended into the fuel on smoke.

AB  - After the successful implementation of B5, 5% palm (Elaeis guineensis) based biodiesel, in Malaysia on June 1, 2011, the Malaysian government is now looking to phase out B5 by replacing it with B10 or even a higher blending ratio. Being non-edible feedstock, jatropha (Jatropha curcas) can play a vital role along with the existing palm oil. This experiment was conducted in a four-cylinder diesel engine fuelled with B5, 10%, and 20% blends of palm (PB10 and PB20) and jatropha (JB10 and JB20) biodiesel and compared with fossil diesel at full load and in the speed range of 1000 to 4000 RPM. The brake power was decreased on average 2.3% to 10.7% while operating on 10% and 20% blends of palm and jatropha biodiesel. An average of 26.4% BSFC increment was observed for PB20 and JB20 blends. An average of 30.7% carbon monoxide (CO) and 25.8% hydrocarbon (HC) emission reductions were found for 20% blends. On average, the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission is decreased by 3.3% while operating on PB10 and PB20 blends, whereas it is increased by 3.0% while operating on JB10 and JB20 blends. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate modified TiO2 doped with C4H4O6HK as heterogeneous solid base catalyst for transesterification of non-edible, Silybum marianum oil to biodiesel using methanol under ultrasonication. Upon screening the catalytic performance of modified TiO2 doped with different K-compounds, 0.7 C 4H4O6HK doped on TiO2 was selected. The preparation of the catalyst was done using incipient wetness impregnation method. Having doped modified TiO2 with C4H 4O6HK, followed by impregnation, drying and calcination at 600 °C for 6 h, the catalyst was characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM, BET, TGA, UV and the Hammett indicators. The yield of the biodiesel was proportional to the catalyst basicity. The catalyst had granular and porous structures with high basicity and superior performance. Combined conditions of 16:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil, 5 wt.% catalyst amount, 60 °C reaction temperature and 30 min reaction time was enough for maximum yield of 90.1%. The catalyst maintained sustained activity after five cycles of use. The oxidative stability which was the main problem of the biodiesel was improved from 2.0 h to 3.2 h after 30 days using ascorbic acid as antioxidant. The other properties including the flash point, cetane number and the cold flow ones were however, comparable to international standards. The study indicated that Ti-0.7-600-6 is an efficient, economical and environmentally, friendly catalyst under ultrasonication for producing biodiesel from S. marianum oil with a substantial yield. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Limited resources of conventional fuels such as petrodiesel have led to the search for alternative fuels. Various convention batch/continuous processes for the biodiesel production have been developed before the recent year. All processes are time consuming with high labor cost. Thus, we need a new process for biodiesel production which reduces the reaction time and production cost as well as save the energy. In this work, ultrasonic assisted transesterification of Jatropha curcas oil is carried out in the presence of methanol and potassium hydroxide (KOH) as catalyst, keeping the molar ratio of oil to alcohol 1:5, catalyst concentration 0.75 wt% of oil, ultrasonic amplitude 50% and pulse 0.3 cycle, 7 min reaction time under atmospheric condition. Ultrasonic mixing has increased the rate of transesterification reaction as compare to the mechanical mixing. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The study aimed to investigate the biodegradation of contaminated soil with biodiesel, diesel, and petroleum by autochthonous soil microorganisms and also enriched with Bacillus subtilis by means of colorimetric method. The phytotoxicity was evaluated in recently contaminated soil and after 240 days to ensure the decrease of toxicity. The biodegradation assessment was carried out with redox 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) indicator and by the extraction of the contaminant in the soil with hexane. The amount of contaminant extracted from recently contaminated soil was compared to the amount found on the buried samples for 240 days. The phytotoxicity rates were evaluated by the use of Lactuca sativa seeds. Values of root and hypocotyl elongation were subjected to analysis of variance using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The results revealed that the autochthonous microorganisms were active on recently contaminated soil with biodiesel, because all biodiesel was biodegraded. Hence, only 0.001 g of biodiesel was extracted, and the phytotoxicity decreased after 240 days. On the other hand, the contaminated soil with diesel and petroleum was little active in 2,6-DCPIP test, and consequently, there was a large contaminant amount in soil after 240 days. Furthermore, petroleum and diesel were phytotoxic after biodegradation. The complex composition of the petroleum and diesel requires interactions of the microbial community able to biodegrade hydrocarbons and also metabolites from biodegradation. The naturally present microorganisms in the soil were capable of degrading the pollutant as much as the samples enriched with B. subtilis. The 2,6-DCPIP test is a simple and inexpensive methodology to analyze the potential biodegradation of all microorganisms of the soil and if the inoculation of the biodegrading microorganisms it will be necessary. Therefore, it would be helpful in bioremediation strategies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

AB  - Expectations are high for energy crops. Government policies in the United States and Europe are increasingly supporting biofuel and heat and power from cellulose, and biomass is touted as a partial solution to energy security and greenhouse gas mitigation. Here, we review the literature for yields of 5 major potential energy crops: Miscanthus spp., Panicum virgatum (switchgrass), Populus spp. (poplar), Salix spp. (willow), and Eucalyptus spp. Very high yields have been achieved for each of these types of energy crops, up to 40tha-1y-1 in small, intensively managed trials. But yields are significantly lower in semi-commercial scale trials, due to biomass losses with drying, harvesting inefficiency under real world conditions, and edge effects in small plots. To avoid competition with food, energy crops should be grown on non-agricultural land, which also lowers yields. While there is potential for yield improvement for each of these crops through further research and breeding programs, for several reasons the rate of yield increase is likely to be slower than historically has been achieved for cereals; these include relatively low investment, long breeding periods, low yield response of perennial grasses to fertilizer, and inapplicability of manipulating the harvest index. Miscanthus × giganteus faces particular challenges as it is a sterile hybrid. Moderate and realistic expectations for the current and future performance of energy crops are vital to understanding the likely cost and the potential of large-scale production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work deals with the investigation of the spatiotemporal distribution of the biodiesel producing local industrial units in Greece. For this purpose, a Geographical Information System (GIS) based application was used to interpret the spatiotemporal changes of the biodiesel production units. The number of these units increased from one being established in 2005 to 20 in 2013. Nineteen of them were established in Eastern Greece and only one in the western part. An S-shape equation was adapted to forecast the future biodiesel production. The 'capacity' curve levels off at 950dam3y-1 while 'distributed' biodiesel levels off at 140dam3y-1. The biodiesel 'real production' is expected to become 120dam3y-1. Finally, the externalities, the driving forces and the barriers that influence the penetration of biodiesel in the local market were investigated as well. It was found that, local biodiesel production decreases proportionately to the decreasing of the diesel consumption, keeping the biodiesel:diesel mixing ratio constant. It seems that, the Greek biodiesel market can be used as an example of the European Union (EU) market which also follows an S-shape curve. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In Italy the use of vegetable oils for energy production is widespread and rapidly increasing especially in small power plants. Some studies have investigated long-term engine performance, and have highlighted some problems connected with the use of vegetable oils. In particular the quality of the engine lubricating oil is important. In this paper this quality has been monitored by remaining useful life (RUL) through the level of the antioxidant additive in the lubricating oil. The study was carried out on two electric generators of 350kW power fueled with refined sunflower and palm oils. The good mathematical relationships found between RUL and engine operating time could be used as reference to optimize the lubricating oil change and to identify the beginning of problems or defects affecting the engine. These possibilities could eliminate the need for scheduled oil changes and save operating costs. This aspect is particularly important for small power plants where maintenance and lubricating oil costs are not negligible. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The liquefaction of ligno-cellulosic biomass materials of bamboo, poplar, pine and eucalyptus woods was investigated in methanol under high pressure with H2SO4 as catalyst. The results indicated that the biomass materials are converted into bio-gas, solid residue and bio-oil after reaction at 200°C for 30 min. The bio-oil can be further separated into a variety of high value-added products such as alkyl polyglycosides, levulinate acid esters, and polyphenols. Alkyl polyglycosides is the main component of the liquefied products and accounts for 83.38% by weight; besides, phenolic products are mainly composed of 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol, eugenol and 3, 4-dimethoxyphenol, which account for about 65.79% by weight. Considering the molecular structure of lingo-cellulosic materials, it was proposed that cellulose and hemicellulose are transformed to alkyl glucoside, levulinate esters, etc. with methanol catalyzed by sulfuric acid under high pressure. Due to electron donating effects of phenolic hydroxyl and methoxy groups, guaiacol, phenol and a series of phenolic compounds are formed through the cleavage of C-C bond of guaiacyl units in lignin.

AB  - This paper reports on the production of biodiesel from baobab (Adansonia digitata L.) seed kernel oil, its fuel properties are evaluated which its finding are limited. The transesterification of baobab oil was carried out using sodium methoxide as a homogeneous catalyst. One factor at a time experimental design was used to study the effect of temperature (30-70. °C), time (0.5-2.5. h), catalyst to oil ratio (0.7-3.5. wt.%) and methanol to oil ratio (10-50. wt.%) on the transesterification of baobab oil. Optimum biodiesel production conditions were as follows: reaction temperature (60. °C), reaction time (1. h), catalyst to oil ratio (1.4. wt.%) and methanol to oil ratio (30. wt.%). An optimum biodiesel yield of 96. wt.% was obtained. Important fuel properties such kinematic viscosity, density, flash point, pour point, cloud point, oxidation stability and cetane number were measured and compared to the biodiesel properties in the European and American biodiesel standards (EN and ASTM standard). Results show that important fuel properties of biodiesel from baobab oil met both EN and ASTM standard. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed on a putative biodiesel production plant in which the freshwater alga Chlorella vulgaris, was grown using an existing system similar to a published commercial-scale hybrid cultivation. The hybrid system couples airlift tubular photobioreactors with raceway ponds in a two-stage process for high biomass growth and lipid accumulation. The results show that microalgal biodiesel production would have a significantly lower environmental impact than fossil-derived diesel. Based on the functional unit of 1 ton of biodiesel produced, the hybrid cultivation system and hypothetical downstream process (base case) would have 42% and 38% savings in global warming potential (GWP) and fossil-energy requirements (FER) when compared to fossil-derived diesel, respectively. Sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the most influential process parameters on the LCA results. The maximum reduction in GWP and FER was observed under mixotrophic growth conditions with savings of 76% and 75% when compared to conventional diesel, respectively. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The complexity and large variability of transport-emitted aerosols leads to necessity of comprehensive characterization of their physico-chemical and toxicological properties, remaining great uncertainties in health effect assessments. Particles produced by combustion of fossil diesel (B0), 20% rapeseed methyl ester in fossil diesel (B20), and pure rapeseed methyl ester (B100) were sampled from exhaust of an Opel Astra diesel engine using sulfated ash, phosphorous and sulfur (SAPS) lube oil with low and high ash content. Microscopic and chemical characterization is performed to quantify the common and specific properties of diesel/biodiesel exhausts. Hydrophobic saturated aliphatic dominate diesel particle chemistry. Oxygen and nitrogen-containing functionalities are specific for more hydrophilic biodiesel particles. A full range of chemical species for individual particles is grouped by clustering technique combined with water-soluble ion measurements. Analysis of group abundance shows carbonaceous particles (soot externally mixed with inorganic salts) and inorganic fly ash (metal oxides) in a structure of exhaust, in correlation with inorganic contaminations in fuel and lube oil. Quantification of particle types in terms of physicochemical relevance supports the identification of groups which may act as biomicromarkers discriminating between diesel and biofuel exhaust and micromarkers of using high ash lube oil, thus providing a basis for correlative toxicological assessment of diesel/biofuel engine emissions. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.

AB  - The production of chemicals directly from sugars is an important step in biomass conversion. Herein, tetrahydro-2,5-furandimethanol (THFDM), obtained from fructose, is formed by using a combination of acid and hydrophobic Ru/SiO2 in a water/cyclohexane biphasic system. Two key factors enable the high selectivity towards THFDM: modifying the hydrogenation catalyst so that it has hydrophobic properties, and the continuous hydrogenation of generated 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural in the cyclohexane phase. Moreover, the selectivity towards THFDM is found to depend strongly on the acid catalyst used. Divide and conquer: A method for direct catalytic conversion of fructose to tetrahydro-2,5-furandimethanol (THFDM) via 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) is reported. High selectivity towards THFDM is achieved by using a catalyst combination of acid and a hydrophobic ruthenium catalyst (Ru/SiO2-TM) in a water/cyclohexane biphasic system by continuous hydrogenation of generated HMF. The use of the hydrophobic Ru/SiO2-TM is the key, as it prevents hydrogenation of fructose to mannitol and sorbitol in the water phase. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - An experimental study has been carried for almost first time to use methyl esters derived from waste chocolate oil produced from chocolate industry, in an indirect injection diesel engine. Effects of engine speed, engine load output, injection timing of the biofuel and the blend ratio with pure diesel fuel on the engine output torque, combustion noise (maximum pressure rise rate), maximum pressure and maximum heat release rate have been studied. Raw waste oil extracted from the industrial process to produce chocolate has been used to produce the biofuel and its physical and chemical properties have been measured and performance of diesel engine combustion has been evaluated in a Ricardo E6 research engine. It has been found that the biofuel (chocolate oil methyl ester) properties are almost similar to that of diesel and the engine performance was similar to diesel engine running on pure diesel fuel. There is no need to modify the engine when this biofuel is used. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Ukraine was once considered the breadbasket of the Soviet Union, its agriculture subject to both extensification and intensification measures. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, both these processes were reversed, giving modern-day Ukraine the image of untapped agricultural potential. Alongside the country's proximity to the European Union and its access to the Black Sea, this has made Ukraine a key candidate as a global supplier of feedstock for biofuel. Demand for the latter is rising noticeably, especially in the wake of current European and international blending targets for liquid biofuels. Ukraine has responded with a number of initiatives to further biofuel feedstock production. We have compiled a material flow account for Ukraine, focusing especially on the development of the agricultural sector since the early 1990s. By complementing this physical account with an in-depth analysis of political and economic developments, we are able to trace the impact of rising demand for biofuel feedstock on Ukraine. We find that the attempt to establish a biofuel sector based largely on rapeseed was not successful but has nonetheless left the country at a cross-road in the development of both its economy and its resource use. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A four-ball tribological test was used to investigate the effects of a TiF3 catalyst on the tribological behaviors of biofuel soot (BS)-contaminated liquid paraffin (LP). The effects of load and rotational speed were studied as well. Scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were conducted to investigate surface element content and chemical valence state, respectively. Results showed that the extreme pressure properties of BS-contaminated LP were all promoted with or without the presence of 0.5 wt% TiF3. The TiF3 catalyst material significantly contributed to the antiwear and the antifriction properties of LP with or without BS contamination. These results were caused by the decomposition of the TiF3 catalyst into TiO2 and fluoride (FeF2) which improved the lubricity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A detailed lipid characterization of Scenedesmus acutus PVUW12, with emphasis on the evaluation of triacylglycerols (TAGs) as a biodiesel feedstock, is presented. When algal cells were grown in nitrogen-free medium (N stress), a lipid increase was detected that was mainly due to TAG accumulation. In situ fluorescence measurements allowed the kinetics and extent of neutral lipid accumulation to be followed. Under N stress, the productivity of total lipids and TAGs increased significantly (80.99 and 63.74 mg L-1 day-1, respectively) compared with controls (29.51 and 16.23 mg L-1 day-1, respectively). Monounsaturated fatty acids were the major fraction and increased further (49.74 %) in stressed cells, with oleic acid as the most abundant compound (46.97 %). The polyunsaturated fatty acid composition of this algal oil appears to meet the European Standard EN 14214. These results indicate that S. acutus oil meets the requirements for its use as a biodiesel feedstock. Since this strain was also proposed for wastewater bioremediation, this opens up the possibility of its use in an integrated system combined with biofuel production. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Wavelength of light is a crucial factor which renders microalgae as the potential biodiesel. In this study, Tetraselmis sp. and Nannochloropsis sp. as famous targets were selected. The effect of different light wavelengths on growth rate and lipid production was studied. Microalgae were cultivated for 14days as under blue, red, red-blue LED and white fluorescent light. The growth rate of microalgae was analyzed by spectrophotometer and cell counting while oil production under improved Nile red method. Optical density result showed the microalgae exhibited better growth curve under blue wavelength. Besides, Tetraselmis sp. and Nannochloropsis sp. under blue wavelength showed the higher growth rate (1.47 and 1.64day-1) and oil production (102.954 and 702.366a.u.). Gas chromatography analysis also showed that palmitic acid and stearic acid which were compulsory components for biodiesel contribute around 49-51% of total FAME from Nannochloropsis sp. and 81-83% of total FAME from Tetraselmis sp. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Growth and TAG production by Yarrowia lipolytica were compared for cells cultured in nitrogen-complete medium containing waste glycerol derived from biodiesel production, as well as pure glycerol, dextrose, or canola oil as the carbon sources. Growth and TAG production were also analyzed for Y. lipolytica cells cultured in nitrogen-limited media containing either pure glycerol or glycerol plus dextrose. Significantly greater amounts of TAGs were synthesized by Y. lipolytica cultured in minimal media compared to rich media (approximately 3-fold on dry weight basis when grown on glycerol). Cultures in minimal medium containing glycerol yielded 31% TAGs on a dry cell weight (dcw) basis, while cultures in minimal medium containing glycerol plus dextrose produced 38% TAGs (dcw), with glycerol consumption favored over dextrose consumption. Our results suggest that Y. lipolytica could serve as a source of TAGs for biodiesel production using crude waste glycerol generated by biodiesel synthesis. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Instead of sole nutrient starvation to boost algal lipid production, we addressed nutrient limitation at two different seasons (autumn and spring) during outdoor cultivation in flat panel photobioreactors. Lipid accumulation, biomass and lipid productivity and changes in fatty acid composition of Nannochloropsis oculata were investigated under nitrogen (N) limitation (nitrate:phosphate N:P 5, N:P 2.5 molar ratio). N. oculata was able to maintain a high biomass productivity under N-limitation compared to N-sufficiency (N:P 20) at both seasons, which in spring resulted in nearly double lipid productivity under N-limited conditions (0.21 g L-1 day-1 ) compared to N-sufficiency (0.11 g L-1 day-1). Saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids increased from 76% to nearly 90% of total fatty acids in N-limited cultures. Higher biomass and lipid productivity in spring could, partly, be explained by higher irradiance, partly by greater harvesting rate (∼30%). Our results indicate the potential for the production of algal high value products (i.e., polyunsaturated fatty acids) during both N-sufficiency and N-limitation. To meet the sustainability challenges of algal biomass production, we propose a dual-system process: Closed photobioreactors producing biomass for high value products and inoculum for larger raceway ponds recycling waste/exhaust streams to produce bulk chemicals for fuel, feed and industrial material. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI.

AB  - Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines have potential to provide both diesel like efficiencies and very low NOx and particulate matter (PM) emissions. There is growing global interest in using alternative biofuels in order to reduce the reliance on conventional fossil fuels. Therefore this experimental study was carried out to investigate performance, combustion and emission characteristics of HCCI engine fueled with ethanol and methanol and compare it with baseline gasoline fuel. The experiments were conducted on a modified four-cylinder four-stroke engine at different engine speeds using port fuel injection technique for preparing homogeneous charge. To achieve auto-ignition of air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber, intake air pre-heater was used. In-cylinder pressure data acquisition with subsequent heat release analysis and exhaust emission measurements were done for combustion and emission diagnostics. In this paper, effect of intake air temperature and air-fuel ratio on combustion parameters, thermal efficiency, combustion efficiency, ringing intensity and emissions in HCCI engine is analyzed and discussed. Results show that methanol and ethanol are good replacements to gasoline in HCCI combustion mode. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study presents the utilization of metal oxides for the biofuel production from vegetable oil. The physical and chemical properties of the diesel-like products obtained, and the influence of reaction variables on the product distribution were investigated. Six different metal oxides (Co 3O4, KOH, MoO3, NiO, V2O 5, and ZnO) were employed as catalysts and the results indicated that the metal oxides are suitable for catalyzing the conversion of oil into organic liquid products (OLPs). The maximum conversion (87.6%) was obtained with V 2O5 at 320 °C in 40 min whereas a minimum conversion (55.1%) was obtained with MoO3 at 390°C in 30 min. The physical characteristics of the product obtained (density, specific gravity, higher heat value, flash point and kinematic viscosity), were in line with ASTM D6751 (B100) standards. The hydrocarbons majorly present in the product were found to be methyl and ethyl esters. Furthermore, OLPs obtained were distilled and separated into four components. The amount of light hydrocarbons, gasoline, kerosene and heavy oil like components obtained were 18.73%, 33.62%, 24.91% and 90.93%, respectively. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Calcination temperature greatly influences the total basicity and surface area of catalysts. Investigations were conducted on calcium and niobium (CaO-Nb2O5) mixed oxides catalysts prepared via conventional solid state method (oxides were mixed and ground in agate mortar) and calcined at different temperatures ranging from 300-800°C for 5 h. The catalysts were then characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), CO 2temperature-programmed desorption (TPD-CO2), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analyzer and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The formation of Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 at lower calcination temperatures (&lt; 600°C) reduced the surface area of the catalyst and masked the basic active sites, hence lowered the total basicity of the catalyst. Besides, low surface area and total basicity were observed at higher calcination temperatures (&gt; 600°C), due to sintering of the fine crystals, which promotes cluster agglomeration. Thus, the optimum calcination temperature for CaO/Nb2O5 mixed oxides was 600°C, which produced the largest surface area (7 m2/g) and total basicity (1301 μmol/g). The biodiesel was produced via transesterification of palm oil, methanol and the catalysts calcined at various temperatures. CaO/Nb 2O5 mixed oxide calcined at 600°C showed the highest biodiesel conversion (98%) with methanol/oil molar ratio of 12, 3 wt.% of catalyst, a reaction temperature of 65°C and reaction time of 2 h.

AB  - In the present study, the waste coral was utilized as a source of calcium oxide for transesterification of soybean oil into biodiesel (methyl esters). Characterization results revealed that the main component of the waste coral is calcium carbonate which transformed into calcium oxide when calcined above 700 °C. The Box-Behnken design of experiment was carried out, and the results were analyzed using response surface methodology. Calcination temperature, methanol- soybean oil molar ratio and catalyst concentration were chosen as variables. The methyl ester content (wt%) was response which must be maximized. A second-order model was obtained to predict methyl ester content as a function of these variables. Each variable was placed in the three low, medium and high levels (calcination temperature of 700, 800 and 900 °C; catalyst concentration of 3, 6 and 9 wt%; methanol-to-oil ratios of 12:1, 18:1 and 24:1). The optimum conditions from the experiment were found that the calcination temperature of 900 °C, catalyst concentration of 6 wt% and methanol-to-oil ratio of 12:1. Under these conditions, methyl ester content reached to 100 wt%. The waste catalyst was capable of being reused up to 4 times without much loss in the activity. © 2013 Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Modern agriculture is causing extensive environmental damage. Arguments have been put forward that a systemic change is needed in agriculture to address the major environmental challenges faced by mankind. This is a case study of a research farm whose aim is to form a farming system that has a minimal impact on carbon and nitrogen cycles while maintaining biodiversity. For the farm to minimise its impact on the global carbon cycle and associated climate change, it is important to reduce fossil energy use. The research farm has minimised all its inputs, but uses a diesel-run tractor. Agriculture's primary function is to provide food of adequate quality. The hypothesis of this study is that using biomass from arable land for tractor work on the farm would reduce the amount of food produced relative to using fossil fuel for tractor work. The objective of this paper was to develop scenarios for biomass-derived tractor work for the study farm chosen and to investigate their impact on food production. Food availability was measured by the number of people the farm could supply, denoted as Np. A farm nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) balance was also applied to the different scenarios. The investigated scenarios for replacing fossil fuel tractor work were draught horsepower combined with cold-pressed rape-seed oil in a tractor, ethanol from wheat produced in a conventional ethanol plant, and farm-made ethanol from potatoes. Using wheat and potato to produce ethanol reduced food production by 23% and 18% respectively, compared to using conventional diesel. Combining a draught horse and on-farm cold-pressed rapeseed oil only reduced the food production by 6%. N is maintained in all scenarios due to the nitrogen-fixing leys. P can be maintained in the fields if bones are recycled, but nutrients, especially K, are moved from meadow to field. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The Farm-level Algae Risk Model (FARM) is used to simulate the economic feasibility and probabilistic cost of biomass and bio-crude oil production for two projected algae farms. The two farms differ in their cultivation system: an open raceway pond (ORP) and a photobioreactor (PBR). The economic analysis incorporates production, price, and financial risks the farms will likely face over a 10-year period. Current technology for both cultivation systems is assumed with an emphasis on the differences in biomass production, lipid content, culture crashes, and dewatering and extraction costs. Results of the analysis indicated that with current prices and technology neither cultivation system offers a reasonable probability of economic success. The total costs of production for crude bio-oil is 109$gal-1±45 x-σ for an ORP and 77gal-1±25 x-σ for a PBR. Further analysis revealed that for every 1% increase in biomass production annual net cash income is increased 0.21% for an ORP and 0.10% for a PBR. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - A variety of researchers have constructed and presented lifecycle assessments of the microalgae-to-biofuel process, however, inconsistencies in system boundary definitions and high-level process modeling have led to a wide range of results. This study integrates engineering process models validated through experimental and modeling research to perform an environmental assessment of four microalgae-to-biofuel production scenarios leveraging the Argonne National Laboratory GREET model. The baseline scenario consists of a down flow open pond growth system, three phase de-watering step (settling, dissolved air flotation, and a centrifuge), hexane extraction and nutrient recovery using anaerobic digestion. The net energy ratio (NER), defined as energy consumed over the produced energy, and greenhouse gases (GHG) for the baseline scenario are 0.7MJMJ-1 and -41.7gCO2-eqMJ-1 respectively. Three alternative scenarios are also evaluated: 1) Improved microalgal productivity, 2) supercritical CO2 extraction, and 3) no nutrient recycle. This research shows that supercritical CO2 extraction is neither currently energetically- nor environmentally favorable and that nutrient recycle plays an integral role in achieving favorable NER and GHGs. The study highlights on the systems level, two findings related to the NER; 1) the NER is minimally impacted with increased productivity and 2) increasing microalgae lipid content detrimentally affects the NER which is attributed to the reduction in the total energy that can be captured by the anaerobic digester. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Successful algal biomass cultivation at scale is a key limiting step for the production of algal biofuels and other high-value products, and crop protection against undesirable biomass losses will be a critically important component of commercialization efforts. If algal biomass production occurs in large, open, outdoor ponds, then it can be expected that invasions of these production facilities by multiple species of algae, invertebrate herbivores, and pathogens will only be a matter of time. This review identifies and discusses key aspects of community and ecosystem ecology that have direct relevance to the successful cultivation of algal biomass. We use experiences and examples from commercial agriculture to illustrate core ecological principles of crop cultivation that we believe can successfully be transferred to large-scale algal biomass production. We then discuss the degree to which herbivores and disease can significantly reduce potential yields, and the concepts of biological control. We also discuss the effects of crop species diversity and composition on algal biomass production, and explore the potential benefits of algal polycultures in large-scale algal biomass cultivation systems. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper investigates the activities of strontium nanocatalysts supported on the ZSM-5 zeolite in transesterification of sunflower oil for production of biodiesel FAME (fatty acids methyl ester). The catalysts were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation method. The effects of different Sr/ZSM-5, Ba-Sr/ZSM-5 mass ratios and calcination conditions on the catalytic activity were investigated. The activity of yBa-xSr/ZSM-5 (where x=6wt.% strontium based on ZSM-5 weight and y=4wt.% Ba based on the Sr weight) was studied in different operational conditions such as methanol/oil molar ratio, mass ratio of catalyst to oil, reaction time and reaction temperature. It was found that the catalyst containing yBa-xSr/ZSM-5 (where x=6wt.% strontium based on ZSM-5 weight and y=4wt.% barium based on the strontium weight) is an optimal catalyst for biodiesel production. The results showed that the best operational conditions are the methanol/oil=9/1 at 60°C with mechanical stirring of 500rpm for 180min. The maximum biodiesel FAME yield of 87.7% was achieved by using the optimal catalyst. Characterization of the catalyst sample was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and N2 adsorption-desorption measurement methods. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Large-scale cultivation of microalgae for biofuels may avoid competing for agriculture, water, and fertilizer by using wastewater and avoid competing for land by using the Offshore Membrane Enclosures for Growing Algae (OMEGA) system. Some microalgae thrive in wastewater; however, wastewater also contains a complex mixture of organisms. An algae culture in wastewater from a San Francisco Treatment Facility in a 1600-L OMEGA culture system was monitored by standard methods. Prima facie evidence of a chytrid infection prompted a detailed investigation of the microbiome over a 13-day period using second generation sequencing of hypervariable regions of the small subunit rRNA genes. The observed bacteria, initially dominated by γ-proteobacteria, shifted to Cytophagia, Flavobacteriia, and Sphingobacteriia after addition of exogenous nutrients. The dominant algae genera introduced with the inoculum, Desmodesmus and Scenedesmus, remained over 70% of the sequence reads on day 13, although the optical density and fluorescence of the culture declined. Nonalgal eukarya, initially dominated by unclassified alveolates, chrysophytes, and heliozoan grazers, shifted to chytrid fungi on day 5 and continued to day 13. The results of this microbiome analysis can facilitate the development of probe or primer based surveillance systems for routine monitoring of large-scale microalgae cultures. © 2013.

AB  - Commercial technology is available for producing high quality fuels from algae-derived feedstocks, but questions persist about the environmental implications of producing and processing algae through a range of potential routes. In this study, a life-cycle assessment approach was used to investigate the impacts of combining different algae cultivation techniques (raceway vs. effluent cultivation) and fuel conversion pathways (whole cell pyrolysis vs. oil extraction and hydrotreatment). Material and energy input data for the cradle-to-grave study was compiled from peer-reviewed literature, government reports, and confidential commercial processing studies. Results indicated that a wide range of potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and life cycle fossil energy demand results are possible for different algal fuels produced with various unit operations combinations, highlighting the potential for substantial emissions reductions or increases compared to fossil petroleum fuels. The fuel conversion stage is not a large source of GHG emissions (15-20g CO2eq/MJ fuel), compared to algae cultivation (25-87g CO2eq/MJ) or dewatering (60-150g CO2eq/MJ) unit operations. Results indicate that in cases where a portion of the algae biomass is not available for internal heat and power generation, favorable environmental results can be obtained when algae cultivation operations are used to offset current nutrient management activities, such as biological nutrient removal at a wastewater treatment plant. Current estimates suggest that nutrient sources other than municipal wastewater treatment effluents will have to be explored in order for this style of algae cultivation to produce commercially significant quantities of biofuel. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Algae's high productivity provides potential resource advantages over other fuel crops. However, demand for land, water, and nutrients must be minimized to avoid impacts on food production. We apply our national-scale open-pond, growth, and resource models to assess several biomass to fuel technological pathways based on Chlorella sp. We compare resource demands between hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and lipid extraction (LE) to meet 1.89E+10 and 7.95E+10Lyr-1 renewable diesel targets. We estimate nutrient demands where post-fuel biomass is consumed as co-products and recycling by anaerobic digestion (AD) or catalytic hydrothermal gasification (CHG). Sites are prioritized based on fuel value relative to a set of site-specific resource costs. The highest priority sites are located along the Gulf of Mexico coast, but potential sites exist nationwide. Compared to LE, HTL reduces land requirements at least 50%, freshwater consumption at least 33%, and saline groundwater by 85%. Without recycling, nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) demand is reduced 44%, but remains significant relative to current U.S. agricultural consumption. The most nutrient-efficient pathways are LE+CHG for N and HTL+CHG for P (by 52%). Resource gains for HTL+CHG are offset by a 284% increase in N consumption relative to LE+CHG (with potential for further recycling). Nutrient recycling is essential to effective use of alternative nutrient sources. While modeling of availability and costs remains, for HTL+CHG at the 7.95E+10Lyr-1 production target, municipal sources can offset up to 20% of N and 49% of P demand and animal manure could potentially satisfy demands. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The paper reports the experimental results concerning emissions from 30. kWe commercial micro gas turbine feed with blends of straight vegetable oil with fossil fuel. Both gaseous and particulate emissions were measured at full and partial load for blends 10% v/v and 20% v/v of rapeseed and sunflower oils with JET A1 kerosene. The variations of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide emissions were taken into account to evaluate the combustor behavior at different loads and blends. The effects of the fuel composition on the variations, in terms of concentrations and dimensions, of ultrafine - particulate matter were also evaluated.NOx and CO emissions are practically insensitive to the composition of the fuel being the differences within the experimental uncertainty of the instrumentation. This demonstrates a similar overall combustion at both partial and full load for the five fuels used (Jet A1 and four SVO blends). On the contrary, particle matter emission is three times for blends of rapeseed oil and more than fifty times greater for blends of sunflower oil with respect to pure Jet A1. The differences are ascribed to the chemical structure of the vegetable oil tested. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - For the biofuel markets and related commodities, we study their price transmission, which is in fact equivalent to studying price cross-elasticities. Importantly, we focus on the price dependence of the non-linear price transmission mechanism. We discuss several methodological caveats. Specifically, we combine the memory robust feasible generalized least squares estimation with two-stage least squares to control for endogenity bias and inconsistency. We find that both ethanol and biodiesel prices are responsive to their production factors (ethanol to corn, and biodiesel to German diesel). The strength of transmission between both significant pairs increased remarkably during the food crisis of 2007/2008. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Effects of an algal hydrolyzate on the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocelluloses were examined using four bioenergy feedstocks (poplar, corn stover, switchgrass, and anaerobically digested manure fiber). Feedstocks were pretreated using dilute acid or alkali prior to hydrolysis. Hydrolysis reactions were conducted using the neutralized algal hydrolyzate, citrate buffer, or deioinized water as reaction media. Results demonstrated that algal hydrolyzate significantly improved the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis of lignin-rich or structurally recalcitrant biomass such as poplar and anaerobically digested manure fiber. This study showed that algal biomass can be used as not only a biofuel feedstock for direct diesel and ethanol production, but also a supplemental feedstock to enhance the performance of lignocellulosic biorefining. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, treatment of grease and oil (G&amp;O) and other impurities in waste glycerol from biodiesel production was performed by a two-step process, by acidification and the coaleser process. 1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) was used to acidify waste glycerol to destabilize the emulsion and remove the suspended solids (SS), soap and methyl ester. For acidification, a pH of 6 was selected, before testing with coalescer. The study was investigated with a wide range of factors and parameters including two media materials (polypropylene (PP) and polyethyleneterephthalate (PET)), two configure shapes (granular and fiber), pH (3-6), bed height (50-150 mm), and flow rate (5-18 dm3/h). The results of the study in the same experiment conditions showed, PP media material gave better results than PET media materials where the fiber sharp material performed better than the granular sharp material. G&amp;O concentration of treated waste glycerol reduced to 0.081 g/L under operating conditions with 120 mm bed height, 5 dm3/h flow rate and PP fiber media. © 2013 Balaban Desalination Publications.

AB  - A recently isolated thermotolerant microalga Desmodesmus sp. F2 has the traits of becoming potential biodiesel feedstock, such as high growth rate, high lipid content, and quick precipitation. Its overall lipid productivity was 113mg/L/d when grown under non-optimal conditions using batch cultivation. A two-step response surface methodology was adopted to optimize its cultivation conditions. The overall lipid productivity was increased to 263mg/L/d when the cells were grown under the optimized conditions of 6.6mM initial nitrogen level and 6days nitrogen depletion treatment in 700μmol/m2/s light intensity at 35°C using batch cultivation. Fed-batch and semi-continuous cultivations were employed to further increase its lipid productivity to 213 and 302mg/L/d, respectively. The 302mg/L/d is the highest overall lipid productivity of microalgae ever reported in the literature. This study provides the information required for the design and operation of photobioreactors for large scale outdoor cultivation of this species. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Due to their high productivity in both crops and algae, tropical countries are likely to be the future world suppliers of feedstocks as well as biofuels such as biodiesel. In this work five feedstocks: palm, jatropha, microalgae, tallow and waste cooking oil were analyzed and compared using techno-economic and environmental criteria. For each feedstock, technological configurations currently used in the industry were taken into account (acid catalysis, basic catalysis and cogeneration). In this work, it was found that productivities for the basic catalyzed process were comparatively higher (1.010kg biodiesel/kg crude oil), than those catalyzed by acid (0.85-0.95kg biodiesel/kg crude oil). After the simulation of the selected processes, the lowest production costs were obtained for jatropha (USD 0.15/L, basic catalysis) and for waste cooking oils (USD 0.23/L, acid catalysis). The PEI (Potential Environmental Impact) generated for basic catalyzed process ranged from-0.04 to-0.09, while the acid catalyzed case-0.020 and-0.06 PEI per kg of product. The jatropha and microalgae oil using basic catalyzed configuration with energy cogeneration were the best process alternative from the environmental and economical points of view. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work presents a detailed review and comparative analysis of the process design and economics of n-butanol production using corn grain and corn stover. This includes reviewing the most recent n-butanol technologies; demonstrating the impact of key parameters (e.g. plant capacity, raw material pricing, yield) on the overall n-butanol process economics; and comparing how cellulosic biomass conversion technologies and challenges differ from traditional sugar-based n-butanol conversion technology. A major challenge of n-butanol production is the low n-butanol yield (compared to ethanol), resulting in higher production costs. However, recent research efforts have achieved significant yield improvements using a combination of genetic engineering, fermentation techniques, and integrated process development using continuous fermentation with online stripping to remove n-butanol during fermentation. This study presents the advances in n-butanol research for both sugar-based (corn) and cellulosic (corn stover) feedstocks, and also provides a comparison of overall process technologies and process economics. In addition, the results of a sensitivity analysis comparing various technologies, sugar yields, and coproduct distributions are discussed in order to provide research guidance. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - To evaluate the feasibility of industrial biodiesel production, outdoor mass cultivation of the marine oleaginous diatom, Fistulifera sp. strain JPCC DA0580, was conducted in bench-scale photobioreactors (~200L, raceway- and column-types) and seasonal variation of biomass and oil content were monitored. Through three seasons (from spring to autumn), the microalgae showed steady growth and oil accumulation in both reactors in spite of fluctuating temperature and solar irradiation. When comparing the both reactors, the column-type bioreactor was better with regard to energy conversion efficiency compared to the raceway-type bioreactor. The areal oil productivity of 3.23g/m2/day is comparable or even higher level as compared with the one from other oleaginous microalgae prepared in outdoor mass cultivation. Furthermore, repeated batch culture experiments resulted in success at least 5 cycles. Through the experimental period, little bacterial contamination was observed while protozoal contamination was a fatal issue. The microalgal cell was robust enough to be handled by an automated pump system in inoculation and harvesting processes, and cell adhesion to the bioreactor wall was not observed. These beneficial features could realize ease of oil production and system maintenance. These findings ensure promising innovation by means of outdoor mass cultivation with this strain toward biodiesel production. © 2013 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

AB  - The present study was aimed to evaluate the soil carbon sequestration and reclamation potential of Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) growing in varying soil conditions. For this, a study was conducted during 2008-2012 at four different sites of Jatropha plantations (Banthara, Gajaria, Bakshi ka talab and NBRI) growing in central India. Periodic sampling was done for plant biomass, litter turn over, microbial biomass, soil enzymes and carbon and nutrients stock of JCL plantations. The analytical studies clearly indicate that irrespective of the soil sites, the Jatropha plantations significantly enhanced (α=5%; p≤0.05) the total organic carbon, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, available phosphorus and potassium content n the soil. During the fourth year of plantations, the total plant biomass (including the above and below ground biomass) of JCL growing in various plantation sites has been increased from 15.20±4.60 to 203.00±40.60tha-1year-1 with a subsequent total biomass carbon content of 7.60±2.30 to 101.50±13.52tha-1year-1, respectively. Similarly, the soil carbon stock of the plantation sites varied from 20.59 to 50.45Mgha-1year-1. Furthermore, the microbial biomass carbon content of the four different sites varied from 132.64±9.28 to 641.32±38.48μgg-1 soils. Therefore, the study clearly indicates that JCL plantations can significantly (p≤0.01) enhance the soil quality including the soil carbon pool and microbial biomass carbon and can be used for the concurrent initiatives on biofuel production, soil carbon sequestration and soil reclamation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Edible and non-edible oils are used for the production of biodiesel from the last so many years and these oils are extracted from their respective seeds. Jatropha oil is used as a feedstock to produce biodiesel for running the Compression Ignition engine. A statistical model is developed to interrelate the trans-esterification process variables for the biodiesel yield using design of experiment approach by selecting central composite design of a response surface methodology. Results shown in this paper indicate that the optimum observed yield of 95.5% has the following reaction conditions: Molar ratio 19.84 (% v/v), reaction time 3 h, reaction temperature 70°C, catalyst concentration 4.18 wt% and stirrer rpm 650. Also, the yield produced is higher when compared with 93.5% which was observed by Lee paper using the same methodology. Moreover, the fuel properties of Jatropha biodiesel are closer to the ASTM standard of biodiesel. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Jatropha curcas, a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, is an upcoming energy source, which promises to mitigate the energy crisis and environmental pollution. Jatropha curcas oil is looked up in terms of availability and cost and also has several applications and enormous economic benefits. The seed oils of five Jatropha curcas biotypes were screened and evaluated for their physiochemical parameters, viz. oil content (20-43%), biodiesel yield (48-66%), density (.866-.969 g/cm3), viscosity (50.12-93.79 mm3/s), iodine value (232.738-457.16 mg/g), free fatty acid (18.847-7.614 mg/g), saponification value (59.29-93.79 mg/g), flash point (125-220°C), fire point (155-260°C) and ash content (.19-.399%), which were estimated for selection of the elite Jatropha curcas biotype. The best shoot regeneration (60%) was observed in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with naphthalene acetic acid (0.5 ppm) and benzyl amino purine (2.0 ppm). Root induction (90%) was successfully obtained in plain MS. Acclimatisation and hardening was quite successful with survival rate of 70%. © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis.

AB  - Ignition delay time studies for tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 2-methylfuran (2MF) as well as optical investigations of combustion for 2MF have been carried out using two shock tubes. The experiments with undiluted THF/air mixtures were performed at 20 and 40bar in a high pressure shock tube (HPST) at an equivalence ratio of F=1 covering an overall temperature range of 780-1100K and 691-1006K, respectively. Undiluted 2MF/air mixtures (F=1) were also investigated in the HPST at 40bar in the temperature range of 820-1215K. The experimental data of 2MF obtained at 40bar were supported with kinetic simulations of existing models from literature. Additionally, sensitivity analyses of 2MF at several temperatures were performed for finding out the most sensitive reactions. Schlieren imaging was employed in a rectangular shock tube (RST) utilizing a high speed video camera through which the ignition process was captured for a stoichiometric 2MF/O2/Ar mixture at pressures of about 10bar and in the temperature range of 871-1098K.The pressure signals of THF and 2MF at 40. bar indicate two types of pre-ignition at low temperatures: a short two-stage ignition for THF and a relatively long and smooth increase in pressure before main ignition for 2MF. Furthermore, in case of 2MF at 40. bar, far-wall ignitions at low temperatures could be observed. The deviation between simulation and experiment as well as the presence of pre-ignitions in the low temperature regime were the main reasons for undertaking optical investigations of 2MF. The Schlieren images show that the ignition process at low temperatures (T≤. 940. K) begins as a deflagrative phase in the form of flame kernels and ends in a strong ignition (explosion in explosion).The current study analyzes the auto-ignition of THF and 2MF at engine relevant pressures and temperatures. The optical investigations have been conducted to analyze the ignition behavior of 2MF. © 2014 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - In the present work, wheat straw was hydroliquefied at a temperature of 300°C for 4h in ethanol or toluene in order to obtain bio-components which are useful for fuel purposes. The experiments were performed in a 100mL batch reactor under hydrogen pressure of 70bar. Typically, 2g of straw and 0.1g of catalyst (66%Ni/SiO2-Al2O3) were dispersed in 15g of solvent. The main compounds of the oil produced during the liquefaction of hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin of wheat straw in both solvents are: tetrahydrofuran-2-methanol, 1,2-butanediol and butyrolactone. Besides the mentioned compounds, ethanol favoured the decomposition of bigger molecules to short-chain alcohols such as 1-butanol, 1,2-propanediol and 1,2-ethanediol. Toluene contributes to the production of furans and other cyclic compounds. The light fractions distilled together with the solvent also contain the following: 1-propanol, 2-methyl-cyclopentanone, acetic acid and ethyl acetate. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study monetizes the environmental damage and human health risk externalities associated with the life-cycle production and use of ethanol biofuels from corn-based and cellulosic feedstocks. An integrated economic-environmental assessment framework couples the measured emission impacts from the fuels with individuals' preferences regarding each fuel's externalities. This framework allows the welfare values associated with gasoline and ethanol's externalities to be derived and compared. The results of the study reveal that the production and consumption of corn starch ethanol produce declines in environmental and health outcomes of $1.23 per gallon relative to gasoline for an 85% blend. Depending on the feedstock source, cellulosic based ethanol blends produce modest gains in environmental and health outcomes valued at between $0.04 and $0.06 per gallon relative to gasoline. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The biofuel programme was promoted around the globe with mandate of decreasing the dependency on petroleum oil, reducing green house gas emissions, increasing agricultural profitability and as option for rural employment and development. There existed acceptable and popular perception that biofuel production is more economical to reduce petroleum oil dependency and green house gas emission primarily. However, this scalar approach is not found to be uniformly applicable across the world. The exploration of political economy of different regions provides varying priorities for promotion of biofuel programme based on the context, type of feedstock under use, technologies employed and the health of the economy. The issue is not very different for India. Policy documents of government of India mentioned that local level institutions would be given responsibility for resources planning and development through the involvement of panchayat, providing first hand right of resources to local user and priority to local energy use and self-sufficiency. However, at the same time policy remained silen t on technology inputs, research and development and institutional support for achieving objectives set for the local level sustenance for resource use and design. Policy became biased toward transport sector with announcement of mixing of biodiesel with petroleum diesel. Based on the meta-analysis of the existing literature this study raised basic questions toward the policy aim and ambition of jatropha-based biodiesel programme in particular for India and biofuel programme across world in general.

AB  - A combined hydrolysis process, which first mixed dilute acid- and alkali-pretreated corn stover at a 1:1 (w/w) ratio, directly followed by enzymatic saccharification without pH adjustment, has been developed in this study in order to minimize the need of neutralization, detoxification, and washing during the process of lignocellulosic biofuel production. The oleaginous fungus Mortierella isabellina was selected and applied to the combined hydrolysate as well as a synthetic medium to compare fungal lipid accumulation and biodiesel production in both shake flask and 7.5. L fermentor. Fungal cultivation on combined hydrolysate exhibited comparable cell mass and lipid yield with those from synthetic medium, indicating that the integration of combined hydrolysis with oleaginous fungal lipid fermentation has great potential to improve performance of advanced lignocellulosic biofuel production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper describes the effect of a mixture of rapeseed methyl ester and diesel oil on emission production of tractor engine. The hydraulic dynamometer was used to load the engine of Zetor Forterra 8641 tractor over rear power take-off. The measured tractor is almost new with less than 100 h worked. The measurements were realized for several ratios of diesel oil and rapeseed methyl ester (from pure diesel to pure rapeseed methyl ester). The engine was loaded by the dynamometer in several working points which were predefined by engine speed and its torque. The production of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) were measured in each of these points. The comparison of different fuels was performed using the Non-Road Steady Cycle (NRSC) test procedure. Engine maps were also created for each emission component and for all of tested fuels.

AB  - The pyrolysis of 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) in a flow reactor was investigated at various pressures (30, 150 and 760Torr) by synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS). Dozens of pyrolysis products, especially a series of radicals and aromatics, were identified from the measurement of photoionization efficiency spectra; and their mole fraction profiles were measured at 780-1470K. Phenol, 1,3-cyclopentadiene, 2-methylfuran, vinylacetylene and 1,3-butadiene were observed with high concentrations in the decomposition of DMF. The pressure-dependent rate constants of the major unimolecular decomposition reactions of DMF were theoretically calculated, and was adopted in the pyrolysis model of DMF with 285 species and 1173 reactions developed in the present work. The model was validated against the species profiles measured in both the present work and the previous pyrolysis studies of DMF. Based on the rate of production and sensitivity analyses, main pathways in the decomposition of DMF and the growth of aromatics were determined. The unimolecular decomposition to produce CH3CHCCH and acetyl radicals, H-atom abstraction to produce 5-methyl-2-furanylmethyl radical, ipso substitution by H-atom to produce 2-methylfuran and H-atom attack to produce 1,3-butadiene and acetyl radical were concluded to dominate the primary decomposition of DMF. Further decomposition of 5-methyl-2-furanylmethyl radical leads to great production of phenol and 1,3-cyclopentadiene which can be readily converted to precursors of large aromatics such as cyclopentadienyl radical, phenyl radical and benzene. As a result, the formation of aromatics in the pyrolysis of DMF is promoted compared with the pyrolysis of cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane under very close conditions. This observation implies the potentially high sooting tendency of DMF, and emphasizes the necessity to investigate the sooting behavior and soot formation mechanism in DMF combustion for the potential application of DMF as an alternative engine fuel. © 2014 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - Beech sawdust particle conversion in a drop tube furnace was studied between 800 and 1,400 °C. Particular attention was paid to the influence of temperature and to the presence of oxygen on the gasification process. As temperature increases, light hydrocarbon production decreases and the CO + H2 production (gas of interest for biofuel production) increases. Presence of oxygen in the gasification atmosphere allows consuming a high part of light hydrocarbons and enhancing carbon conversion into gas. However, high yields of CO2 and H2O were observed and the total yield of CO + H2 was lower than in pyrolysis conditions. Copyright © 2014,AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - During recent years, in the United States (US) and European Union (EU) a large number of industrial initiatives on so-called "lignocellulosic advanced biofuels" have taken off. The second generation biofuels are today on the ambitious path from lab or pilot scale to demonstration scale in order to facilitate commercial production. In fact, lignocellulosic biomasses are among the most promising feedstocks to develop sustainable biofuels, either from residual (e.g. agricultural wastes like corn stover, wheat staw) or dedicated energy crops (eg.,perennial grasses, short rotation woody biomass). Different types of processing technologies have been investigated and are being demonstrated in pilot scale, namely, biochemical, thermochemical or hybrid: in the hybrid configuration, a combination of thermochemical and biochemical approaches are considered and integrated in a single plant. Various industrial plants have been designed and built in both the EU and US during the last few years: these state-of-art conversion systems represent the first cases of large scale industrial biorefineries. In the present work, a review of the most relevant ongoing initiatives in EU and US was carried out: the common element of all these projects is represented by the use of lignocellulosic biomass as input material. More than 80 industrial projects in the EU and US have been identified, classified and elaborated, according to location, process type, feedstock, plant scale (feedstock in, product out), type of products, technologies and investment cost (Balan et al, 2013). Processes aiming at gasoline-substituting biofuels versus diesellike biofuels were separately considered in the analysis, e.g. ethanol or biocrude from advanced thermochemical conversion, as well as the opportunities in terms of new biorefinery pathways. Projections on production costs were considered and discussed. The need for appropriate policy framework is also discussed, examining the most relevant differences between the US and the EU regulatory conditions. So far, biochemical based industrial initiatives seems to be leading the scenario, with the large commercial plants being constructed using these technologies. Nevertheless, a renewed effort has been recently allocated by various industries to implement thermochemical-based biofuel production projects. Some of these plants are expected to come into full commercial operation in2014. Copyright © 2014,AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative fuel that is renewable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly. Several different methods of biodiesel production have been studied and proposed by many researchers. However, the environmental impact and energy aspect of the methods need to be evaluated. In this article, a noncatalytic biodiesel production with the superheated methanol vapor (SMV) method was compared with the conventional alkali-catalyzed production method in terms of its environmental performance using a life cycle assessment (LCA) tool. This study used original data from several regions in Indonesia. Given that the plant utilized fossil fuel as an energy source, the assessment shows that the SMV method produces higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and acidification, and consumes more energy than the catalytic method. Utilization of biomass waste as a substitute of fossil fuel can reduce the environmental impact and total energy consumption for both methods. Implementation of a methane capture system in a palm oil mill also had a big influence on the GHG savings of biodiesel production. Implementation of methane capture system in a palm oil mill along with the use of biomass waste as an energy source in the biodiesel plant significantly affected the GHG reduction in the SMV method. Therefore, the SMV method can be made feasible from an environmental and energy point of view by the utilization of biomass waste along its production line. © 2014 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Biofuels are key products for the sustainability of the world energy consumption in the next years. Biodiesel in particular is a non-toxic, biodegradable, environmentally friendly alternative diesel fuel. Nowadays, the main problem for the commercialization of biodiesel is its final cost, that is strongly dependent (about 85 % of the total) by the feedstock used. A possible way to lower the biodiesel production costs is using raw oils, which contain a higher amount of Free Fatty Acids (FFA) that should be eliminated before the transesterification reaction to avoid soaps formation. In this work the deacidification of raw sunflower oil in both batch and PBR reactor was conducted. Heterogeneous catalyst Amberlyst 46 was used in its dry form and all the experiments were executed using an amount of methanol higher than the stoichiometric but preserving the mono-phasic liquid phase. Different operative conditions, i.e. different methanol/FFA ratios and temperatures in both the reactor configurations, were tested. The robust techniques for kinetic parameters estimation and simultaneous discrimination of rival models were adopted and combined with a dedicated differential-algebraic equation (DAE) model that characterizes the PBR reactor. The main kinetic parameters were regressed using kinetic models other than literature models (a pseudo-homogeneous and an adsorption based one) in considering the components molar fractions (ideal system). The kinetic parameters were obtained using equilibrated resins, i.e. using the catalyst after having let it to adsorb reactants and products at the operative conditions. From the regression results, it could be concluded that the pseudo-homogeneous model is slightly better for fitting the experimental data. Copyright © 2014,AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Consequent to the growing demand for alternative sources of energy, the seeds from Jatropha curcas remain to be the favorite for biodiesel production. However, a significant volume of the residual organic mass (seed cake) is produced during the extraction process, which raises concerns on safe waste disposal. In the present study, we assessed the toxicity of J. curcas seed cake using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryotoxicity test. Within 1-h post-fertilization (hpf), the fertilized eggs were exposed to five mass concentrations of J. curcas seed cake and were followed through 24, 48, and 72 hpf. Toxicity was evaluated based on lethal endpoints induced on zebrafish embryos namely egg coagulation, non-formation of somites, and non-detachment of tail. The lowest concentration tested, 1 g/L, was not able to elicit toxicity on embryos whereas 100 % mortality (based also on lethal endpoints) was recorded at the highest concentration at 2.15 g/L. The computed LC50 for the J. curcas seed cake was 1.61 g/L. No further increase in mortality was observed in the succeeding time points (48 and 72 hpf) indicating that J. curcas seed cake exerted acute toxicity on zebrafish embryos. Sublethal endpoints (yolk sac and pericardial edema) were noted at 72 hpf in zebrafish embryos exposed to higher concentrations. The observed lethal endpoints induced on zebrafish embryos were discussed in relation to the active principles, notably, phorbol esters that have remained in the seed cake even after extraction. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Microalgae are a very promising and appealing feedstock for biofuels production. In fact, it is reported that some algal strains have very high oil content, even exceeding the 50 % of the dry weight. After growing and harvesting, algae require to be dewatered and the lipid fraction has to be separated. The obtained algal oil can be converted into alkyl esters by means of transesterification with an alcohol to produce biodiesel or may be treated with hydrogenation/cracking processes for the production of hydrocarbons, whose chemical structure is close to that of diesel fuels. Second generation processes for the production of drop-in biofuels from vegetable oils are based on hydrogenation reactions, which lead to the production of green diesel, and selective cracking reactions that maximize the production of bio-jet fuels C10-C15 fractions. These catalytic processes involve the cracking of triglycerides, saturation of double bonds, heteroatoms rejection (especially deoxygenation) and isomerization. Moreover, while glycerol is the low added value co-product for oils transesterification, propane represents more than 30 % of the final product in the hydrotreatment of the lipid fraction. Propane can be upgraded by selective conversion to aromatics, as additives for jet-fuels and versatile feedstocks for the chemical industry. The low selectivity to aromatics is the drawback of this process, resulting in a large production of cracking gases. In general, zeolites with MFI pore structure are used due to their high resistance to deactivation with metal components, such as gallium, added to enhance the dehydrogenation function. Kinetic studies of propane aromatization over HZSM- 5 at 500 °C in a wide range of conversions are reported in the literature (Nguyen et al., 2006). Based on these and similar results (Bhan et al., 2005), a general kinetic model for propane aromatization has been developed. In this work the revised kinetic model is presented and embedded in a multi-scale simulation of a propane aromatization process, performed with the commercial code Invensys PRO/II (Kansha et al., 2009). Several technologies have been designed to directly convert LPG into aro. Copyright © 2014,AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - In times where the attention on alternative energy sources is continuously increasing, the study of biofuels is taking a primary role, as a possible replacement, or integration, of traditional transportation fuels. Among them, biodiesel fuels are typically a complex mixture of large fatty acids, obtained through transesterification of soybean and rapeseed oils with methanol. In this background, the pyrolysis and combustion kinetics of methyl esters is essential for a proper understanding of the combustion behavior and pollutant formation from biodiesel fuels. From a modeling point of view, when studying the combustion of large methyl esters a reliable kinetic mechanism is required. Nevertheless, the main problems of these molecules lie in their length and lack of symmetry in their structure, which results in the huge size of the related detailed kinetic mechanisms (thousands of species) with a consequent significant computational load, even when dealing with 0D and 1D models. In order to maintain the applicability of the kinetic mechanism also in multidimensional models, it should be useful someway to reduce its dimensions. For this reason, a reduced kinetic scheme for methyl esters was developed and is presented in this work. It is the result of the coupling of two different techniques: (i) an upstream lumping of species and reactions, through which several species are grouped into a single pseudo-species according to proper rules; (ii) a successive further reduction of the kinetic mechanism through a novel technique, based on the analysis of the reacting system in the desired range of operating conditions. The reduced mechanism was validated through comparison with experimental data in a wide range of conditions using shock tube, laminar flame speeds and ideal reactors. A satisfactory agreement with both experimental data and the original scheme was observed. Additionally, thanks to its limited dimensions, the kinetic model could be applied on more complex, multidimensional models. As an instance, its performances on a multi-zone model of an HCCI (Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition) engine are assessed: the obtained results show the great advantages of this mechanism, which can then be used in place of the original one without losing in accuracy, but with considerable savings in computational times.

AB  - Biodiesel was produced from high free fatty acid (FFA) Jatropha curcas oil (JCO) by two-stage process in which esterification was performed by Brønsted acidic ionic liquid 1-(1-butylsulfonic)-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BSMIM]Cl) followed by KOH catalyzed transesterification. Maximum FFA conversion of 93.9% was achieved and it reduced from 8.15 wt% to 0.49 wt% under the optimum reaction conditions of methanol oil molar ratio 12: 1 and 10 wt% of ionic liquid catalyst at 70°C in 6 h. The ionic liquid catalyst was reusable up to four times of consecutive runs under the optimum reaction conditions. At the second stage, the esterified JCO was transesterified by using 1.3 wt% KOH and methanol oil molar ratio of 6: 1 in 20 min at 64°C.

AB  - A pyrolysis study on a species of brown algae Saccharina japonica was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor. The yields of bio-oil and bio-char obtained at 450 oC were 47 % and 33 %, respectively. The raw S, japonica, ethanol and acid pretreated samples and the resulting pyrolysis products were also characterized with respect to proximate and ultimate analysis, and higher heating value. The crude bio-oil fractionation by distillation under reduced pressure followed by catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) over Pd/C could be employed to upgrade the bio-oil. The higher heating value (HHV) of HDO bio-oil product was close to those of conventional gasoline and diesel. Copyright © 2014,AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - In recent years, several strategies have been used to mitigate the impact of greenhouse gases, one of which is the production of liquid biofuels, where different processes have been employed such as pyrolysis, transesterification, and more recently the process of catalytic hydrotreatment. The latter was adopted to obtain a biofuel with better properties: higher heating value, lower density and better flow properties in cold than biodiesel. However also the catalytic hydrotreatment presents significant disadvantages: the use of hydrogen and the use of conventional catalysts composed of metal sulphides. On the basis of these considerations, our group is studying the deoxygenation of triglycerides through the innovative process of decarboxylation, in which the atoms of oxygen contained in the biomass are removed in the form of carbon dioxide which can then be captured. The decarboxylation process does not require the use of expensive reagents such as hydrogen or noble metal catalysts. For this work we selected the Jatropha Curcas oil as a model of non-edible oil. After our tests was possible to obtain a liquid biofuel with a high composition of hydrocarbons, around 81 %, formed mainly of C8-C15 hydrocarbons. This product also showed good properties as an heating value around 44 MJ/Kg, higher than biodiesel (39 MJ/Kg) and diesel (43 MJ/Kg), and a lower viscosity (4.2 cSt) compared to the biodiesel (4.4 cSt). The yields obtained for the overall process were greater than 80 %. Copyright © 2014,AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Aldehydes are involved in practically all the oxidation processes of solid and liquid fuels, and they are of concern as pollutants from different combustion systems such as conventional spark-ignition gasoline engines and compression-ignition diesel engines. In the case of biofuel combustion, aldehydes are not only pollutants whose emissions have to be controlled, but also, they are primary products of bio-oil, influencing the combustion properties. A similar statement can be applied to biomass combustion and/or gasification processes, where aldehydes (also including aromatic aldehydes) have been highlighted as products of biomass and coal gasification. With the rising interest in biofuels and biomasses for energy applications, there is a need to assess the combustion of aldehydes, in order to better understand the influence of the carbonyl group on the combustion properties of these species. While formaldehyde and acetaldehyde have been studied in detail in the recent and past literature, just a few works have focused on long chain aldehydes. A few recent combustion studies on C3-C5 aldehydes provide new fundamental data for a better understanding of their pyrolysis and combustion behaviour which in turn form the basis for a more reliable extension of the kinetic knowledge towards oxygenated biofuels. A detailed mechanism has been developed at the Combustion Chemistry Centre (NUI Galway, Ireland) and a lumped one developed within the research activity of the CRECK Modeling group (Politecnico di Milano, Italy). Both the models, validated over a wide range of new and previously published data (flame speeds, ignition delay time, pyrolysis speciations), showed good capability to reproduce the main experimental observations and the kinetic analysis highlighted key consumption channels, mainly related to the carbonyl moiety of the molecule. Only the results for the lumped mechanism referring to the auto-ignition behaviour of aldehydes are discussed in this paper. This work constitute a first step towards a better knowledge of the combustion behavior of oxygenated bio-oil and biofuels. Copyright © 2014,AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - This paper highlights the role of a national Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) in Indonesia as "pioneer" actor in the jatropha global production network, linking solutions for local problems with narratives concerning global concerns. Analysis of previous activities of the NGO positions their jatropha project as one period in a sequence of donor-funded appropriate technology programs. On the island of Flores in Eastern Indonesia the NGO aimed to establish community based jatropha cultivation exclusively on "degraded land", avoiding threats to food cultivation, and responding to local problems of land degradation and water resources depletion. In contrast with investors interested in jatropha based biofuel production for export, the NGO aimed at developing biofuel for local needs, including jatropha based electricity generation in the regional state-owned power plant. Anticipating progress in international and national regulations concerning the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) the 2008 project's design included carbon credit income as a main source of future project financing. Using methods of socio-legal studies and political ecology, this study indicates that when the economic feasibility of a project is based on the future financial value of a legally constructed commodity like carbon credits, the sustainability of the project outcome can be questionable. The author recommends precaution when it comes to including anticipated income from carbon credits in calculating the economic viability of a project, as price developments can fluctuate when political support and regulations change. © 2014 by the author.

AB  - A theoretical and empirical model is developed to analyze the effect of a biodiesel mandate, a tax exemption (tax credit) and an exogenous diesel price shock on world soybean and canola markets. The jointness in crushing oil and meal from the oilseed reduces the size of the link between biodiesel and oilseed prices. A diesel price shock with a mandate results in a smaller change in oilseed prices compared with a tax exemption. Higher diesel prices increase biodiesel prices under a tax exemption but lower them with a blend mandate. When both canola and soybeans are used to produce biodiesel, an increase in the diesel price leads to higher canola prices, but the effect on soybean prices is ambiguous and depends on relative elasticities of meal demand and canola supply because canola produces more oil than soybeans. © 2014.

AB  - To establish principal regularities of the hydrotreatment of rapeseed oil fatty acid triglycerides (FATs), the kinetics of this process has been studied at temperatures of 300-380°C, contact times of 0.38- 0.10 h, and a hydrogen pressure of 1.0 MPa in a flow fixed-bed reactor. The process is performed over non-sulfided nickel catalysts, which are of great practical interest for the production of green diesel. The kinetic scheme of the process with consideration for target products (alkanes) and all oxygen-containing by-products has been proposed. The quantitative estimate, which enables the prediction of the composition of products for other process conditions, has been obtained for the principal paths of the hydrotreatment of rapeseed oil FATs. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2014.

AB  - Microalgae have been promoted as the next frontier of green biotechnology and gained widespread attention as desirable feedstocks for biofuels. Using conservative assumptions for microalgal growth rates (15gm-2d-1) and total lipid content (25%), the entire "pond-to-pump" lifecycle of algal biofuels for 1000bbld-1 of crude algae oil production is modeled with approximately 4875ha of raceway ponds for solar collection and cultivation and 1463MLD (385MGD) of water handling capacity in the current analysis. Technoeconomic analysis based on an array of 6000 modular 0.8ha (2acre) paddlewheel-driven ponds in New Mexico identified several cost barriers and resources challenges (i.e., nutrient and water resources). For 10- and 20-year capital return scenarios, the cost of algal oil production - $4.10L-1 ($15.52gal-1) and $3.21L-1 ($12.14gal-1), respectively - requires substantial capital and facility maintenance investments with principal cost sensitivities attributed to extraction efficiency and lipid content. Baseline conditions result in an energy return on investment (EROI) of 2.73. Uncertainty in energy requirements for paddlewheels as well as water supply and circulation significantly affect the EROI and operating costs. Alternative strategies to address the major cost barriers are needed for algal biofuels to realize their full potential. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - This paper develops a system dynamics model of Iceland's energy sector (UniSyD_IS) that is based on the UniSyD_NZ model of New Zealand's energy economy. The model focuses on the energy supply sector with endogenous representation of road transport energy demand. Equilibrium interactions are performed across electricity, hydrogen, biofuels, and road transport sectors. Possible transition paths toward a low-carbon transport in Iceland are explored with implications for fuel demand, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and associated costs. The consumer sector simulates the long-term evolution of light and heavy-duty vehicles through a vehicle choice algorithm that accounts for social influences and consumer preferences. Through different scenarios, the influences of four fundamental driving factors are examined. The factors are oil price, carbon tax, fuel supply-push, and government incentives. The results show that changes in travel demand, vehicle technologies, fuel types, and efficiency improvements can support feasible transition paths to achieve sufficient reduction in GHG for both 4. °C and 2. °C climate scenarios of the Nordic Energy Technology Perspectives study. Initial investment in supply infrastructure for alternative fuels will not only mitigate GHG emissions, but also could provide long-term economic benefits through fuel cost saving for consumers and reduced fuel import costs for government. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sulfonic acid-functionalized platelet SBA-15 mesoporous silica with an acid capacity of 2.44mmol H+ g-cat-1 (shortly termed 15SA-SBA-15-p) was one-pot synthesized by co-condensation method. When applied as solid acid catalyst in synthesis of Jatropha biodiesel fuel (BDF), the 15SA-SBA-15-p catalyst showed higher activity and resistances to water and free fatty acid (FFA) than commercial sulfonic resins of Amberlyst-15 and SAC-13. For the continuous Jatropha BDF production, a steady 75-78wt% of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) content was obtained over 15SA-SBA-15-p catalyst at 150°C for 75h, whereas the Amberlyst-15 and SAC-13 catalysts were quickly deactivated due to the decomposition of thermally unstable framework and serious leaching of sulfonic acids. More importantly, the quality, stability and cold flow characteristic of Jatropha BDF synthesized by 15SA-SBA-15-p catalyst were better than those synthesized by Amberlyst-15 and SAC-13 catalysts, making the blending with petro-diesel an easy task. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The activities of several Lewis acid catalysts such SnCl2, FeCl3, ZnCl2, AlCl3, and NbCl5 for the in situ transesterification/esterification of lipid contained within a microalga (Chlorella pyrenoidosa) in ethanol at 350°C were examined to identify the most suitable catalyst in term of crude biodiesel (CBD) yield. Of those catalysts tested, ZnCl2 showed the highest performance toward the CBD production. Using ZnCl2 as catalyst, effects of reaction temperature (200-370°C), time (0-120min), ethanol to microalga ratio (EtOH:MA) (5/5-40/5), catalyst loading (0-30wt.%), and algae moisture (0-80wt.%) on the yields of product fractions and the properties of CBD were studied. The presence of ZnCl2 not only promoted the production of CBD but also showed activities toward the deoxygenation and denitrogenation of CBD. The moisture content in the starting material is the most influential factor affecting the yield and properties of CBD. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The scarcity of fossil fuel has recently been introduced as a major concern to energy policy. This crisis has prompted the search for alternative energy sources. Biodiesel can be considered as one of the potential candidates of energy sources in order to resolve this problem. Most of the fuel properties of biodiesel are very close to that of petroleum diesel. However, commercial use of biodiesel in the automobile engine is being limited because of its unstable fuel properties. Instability of the fuel properties appears to be more aggravated when biodiesel comes in metal contact. The present study is intended to investigate the stability of different fuel properties and chemical composition of palm biodiesel upon exposure to copper and mild steel. Static immersion tests were performed by exposing metallic coupons in palm biodiesel at room temperature for different periods viz., 20, 40, 60 days. Compositional analysis of biodiesel was conducted by gas chromatography. Investigated fuel properties include induction period, total acid value, water content, calorific value, viscosity, density, cloud point, pour point, etc. Effect of biodiesel on metal surfaces was examined by measuring the corrosion rate and conducting SEM/EDS analysis. It is found that copper has strong influence in changing fuel properties especially for viscosity, water content, calorific value, density, etc. Compositional analysis of biodiesel showed that principal unsaturated constituent of palm biodiesel, methyl oleate reduced more in copper exposed biodiesel than that in mild steel exposed biodiesel. Formation of poly unsaturated methyl linoleate was observed in both metal exposed palm biodiesel. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

During the first step, the free fatty acid content of CJCO was reduced to 1.12% in 1 hour at 60°C, using 9:1 methanol to oil molar ratio and 1%w/w of oil of H 2SO4. The second step was alkali catalyzed transesterification of pretreated CJCO to produce biodiesel and the factors affecting the biodiesel yield were optimized using response surface methodology. The effect of five level-three factors and their reciprocal interactions on biodiesel yield were studied. A total of 20 experiments were designed and conducted to study the effect of reaction temperature, catalyst amount, and oil to methanol ratio on biodiesel yield. A second-order polynomial regression model was fitted and found adequate with R2 of 0.9722. The model predicted that the highest yield of methyl ester would be 93.55% at the following optimized conditions: reaction temperature of 61.5°C, alkali catalyst of 0.58% w/w of oil and an oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:5.93. Using these optimal factors under experimental conditions in three independent replicates, an average of 92.5 ± 0.5% yield was achieved and the value was well within the range predicted by the model. © Copyright Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A biodiesel is a clean-burning alternative fuel. It has drawn attention of the energy researchers over the last two decades as a solution to problems of environmental concerns, rising fossil fuel price, increasing dependency on foreign energy sources. However, it is susceptible to oxidative degradation due to autoxidation in the presence of oxygen, which hinders its widespread use. The addition of an antioxidant to it reduces this phenomenon significantly. It is expected that antioxidants may affect the clean burning characteristic of a biodiesel. Coconut (Cocos nucifera) and Jatropha (Jatropha curcas) are two promising feedstock growing in the South-East Asian region. This paper presents an experimental investigation of the effect of addition of an antioxidant on the performance and emission characteristics of a four-cylinder diesel engine fueled with 20% blends of two biodiesels (CB20 and JB20). A biodiesel from coconut oil was produced by transesterification process using potassium hydroxide (KOH) as a catalyst. Jatropha biodiesel production was preceded by an esterification step, using sulfuric acid as a catalyst. To study the antioxidant effect, two low-cost synthetic antioxidants, 2(3)-tert-butyl-4-methoxyphenol (BHA) and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT), at a concentration of 2000. ppm, were used in this study. Addition of antioxidants increased their oxidation stability without causing any negative effect on other physicochemical properties. BHT and BHA were found to increase the stability of JB20 and CB20, respectively. Performance results indicate that JB20 and CB20 showed, respectively, 0.95% and 2.97% lower mean brake power (BP) and 5.02% and 4.76% higher mean brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) than to diesel. The addition of antioxidants increased BP and reduced BSFC slightly. Emission results show that untreated JB20 and untreated CB20 increased nitrogen monoxide (NO) emission by 5.52% and 8.02%, but reduced carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emission. Antioxidant-treated blends reduced NO emission by 2.6-5.0%, but increased CO emission by 4.9-20.8% and HC emission by 23.2-40.2% compared to B20 depending on feedstock. Thus, antioxidant-treated JB20 and CB20 blends can be used in diesel engines without any modification. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To produce quality jet biofuel with high amount of alkanes and low amount of aromatic hydrocarbons, two zeolites of HY and HZSM-5 supporting Ni and Mo were used as catalysts to convert soybean oil into jet fuel. Zeolite HY exhibited higher jet range alkane selectivity (40.3%) and lower jet range aromatic hydrocarbon selectivity (23.8%) than zeolite HZSM-5 (13.8% and 58.9%). When reaction temperature increased from 330 to 390. °C, yield of jet fuel over Ni-Mo/HY catalyst at 4. MPa hydrogen pressure increased from 0% to 49.1% due to the shift of reaction pathway from oligomerization to cracking reaction. Further increase of reaction temperature from 390 to 410. °C resulted in increased yield of jet range aromatic hydrocarbons from 18.7% to 30%, which decreased jet fuel quality. A high yield of jet fuel (48.2%) was obtained at 1. MPa low hydrogen pressure over Ni (8. wt.%)-Mo (12. wt.%)/HY catalyst. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The application of life cycle assessment (LCA) in a policy context highlights the need for a "consequential" LCA (CLCA), which differs from an "attributional" LCA (ALCA). Although CLCA offers some advantages over ALCA, such as a capacity to account for emissions resulting from both substitution and price effects, it entails additional assumptions and cost and may yield estimates that are more uncertain (e.g., estimates of impact of biofuel policies on greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions). We illustrate how a CLCA that relies on simple partial equilibrium models could provide important insights on the direction and magnitude of price effects while limiting the complexity of CLCA. We describe how such a CLCA, when applied early in the policy life cycle, could help identify policy formulations that reduce the magnitude of adverse price effects relative to the beneficial substitution effect on emissions because-as the experience with biofuel regulations indicates-regulating price effects is costly and controversial. We conclude that the salient contribution of CLCA in the policy process might lie in warning policy makers about the vulnerabilities in a policy with regard to environmental impact and to help modify potentially counterproductive formulations rather than in deriving the precise estimates for uncertain variables, such as the life cycle GHG intensity of product or average indirect emissions. © 2013 by Yale University.

AB  - Fermentation and advanced fermentation (AF) biofuel production technologies may offer a means to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of transportation by providing renewable drop-in alternatives to conventional middle distillate (MD) fuels, including diesel and jet fuel. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first peer-reviewed study of the environmental and economic feasibility of AF technologies. We find that the attributional lifecycle GHG footprint of AF MD from sugar cane, corn grain and switchgrass ranges from -27.0 to 19.7, 47.5 to 117.5, and 11.7 to 89.8 gCO 2e/MJMD, respectively, compared to 90.0 gCO 2e/MJMD for conventional MD. These results are most sensitive to the co-product allocation method used, the efficiency and utility requirements of feedstock-to-fuel conversion, and the co-generation technology employed. We also calculate the minimum selling price (MSP) of MD fuel produced from sugar cane, corn grain and switchgrass AF as a range from 0.61 to 2.63, 0.84 to 3.65, and 1.09 to 6.30 $ per literMD, respectively, compared to the current price of conventional MD in the United States of approximately 0.80 $ per literMD. The MSP results are most sensitive to feedstock-to-fuel conversion efficiency, feedstock costs, and capital costs. Finally, we demonstrate that emissions from land use change (LUC) directly attributable to the growth of biomass for AF fuel could dominate the GHG footprint of AF MD fuels.

AB  - Biodiesel is one of the potential global liquid transportation fuels that might replace diesel. Government of India had launched a national mission on Biofuels with the aim of achieving a target of 20% blending of biodiesel by 2012. For this purpose, economic and sustainable production of biodiesel is required. This paper studies the reactive extraction of biodiesel from two potential non-edible oil seeds (karanja and simarouba glauca). A statistical study was carried out to determine the influence of operating parameters on the biodiesel yield. The smallest seed size resulted in high biodiesel yield whereas the optimum methanol to oil ratio and catalyst concentration depended on the type of feed. Reaction temperature of 65°C was found to be optimum. The 1H-NMR and gas chromatographic analyses results were comparable. It was found from 1H-NMR analysis that biodiesel produced from reactive extraction of simarouba had better oxidation stability as compared to karanja.

AB  - The pyrolysis of Scenedesmus sp. and Jatropha seedshell cake (JSC) was investigated under similar operating condition in a fluidized bed reactor for comparison of pyrolytic behaviors from different species of lipids-containing biomass. Microalgae showed a narrower main peak in differential thermogravimetric curve compared to JSC due to different constituents. Pyrolysis liquid yields were similar; liquid's oil proportion of microalgae is higher than JSC. Microalgae bio-oil was characterized by similar carbon and hydrogen contents and higher H/C and O/C molar ratios compared to JSC due to compositional difference. The pyrolytic oils from microalgae and JSC contained more oxygen and nitrogen and less sulfur than petroleum and palm oils. The pyrolytic oils showed high yields of fatty oxygenates and nitrogenous compounds. The microalgae bio-oil features in high concentrations of aliphatic compounds, fatty acid alkyl ester, alcohols and nitriles. Microalgae showed potentials for alternative feedstock for green diesel, and commodity and valuable chemicals. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With the biofuel mandate and government incentives in different countries, there is a sharp rise in world biodiesel production that has created an excessively abundant supply of crude glycerin, which is a by-product of the transesterification process. Although pure glycerin has many valuable uses in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries, crude glycerin from biodiesel production cannot be directly used for these purposes. This study investigated an alternative use of crude glycerin in Canadian wood pellet industry. Crude glycerin is produced as a by-product of biodiesel production from canola oil, and is soaked in four different types of wood pellets available in Canadian market at different soak temperatures and times to test the rate of glycerin soaking by the wood pellets. Physical properties such as bulk density, durability, fines, etc. are tested according to the Pellets Fuel Institute standard specifications for residential/commercial densified fuel. Fuel properties are measured by ultimate and proximate analyses for wood pellet samples without and with glycerin-soaking. Finally, a wood pellet stove is tested to compare the emissions of CO, HC, NOx and CO2 between pure and glycerin-soaked wood pellets. © April 2014 IJENS.

AB  - Life cycle assessment of biodiesel produced from microalgae showed that the pure energy output was negative by the route of biodiesel (FAME), if the biodiesel was produced from high moisture content microalgae slurry by dry, cell disruption, solvent extraction of lipids, and transesterification. Therefore, passive choices are that mathane or bioethanol is obtained by anerobic digestion of microalgae slurry or their hydrolysate, or microalgae based bio-oils are obtained by fast pyrolysis and microwave assisted pyrolysis of dried microalgae biomass, or microalgae based bio-oils or syngas by hydrothermal treatment of microalgae slurry. Although the high heating value (HHV) of microalgae based bio-oils are much higher than lignocellulosic bio-oils, it can still not meet the demand of transportation liquid fuel due to its high nitrogen content, high oxygen content and instability. Possessing superiority of dehydration, oil extraction, protein and polysaccharide separation, or even in situ biodiesel production from high moisture content microalgae slurry, subcritical water treatment may become the prior research field of downstream processing technology for microalgae biofuels today. The most challenging research field is to know how to extract lipids, separate cytochrome, protein, polysaccharide from high moisture content microalgae slurry simultaneously under very mild reaction condition of enzymolysis, so that most of the functional components of the microalgae will be saved for value added comprehensive utilization. Last and key technology that may guide microalgae fuel to commercialization is how to manufacture renewable and high quality hydrocarbon diesel effectively from microalgae oil or its soap by microwave polarization decarboxylation.

AB  - The author analyses the state powers steering biofuel development in two European Union (EU) Member States: Finland and Sweden. The different biofuel developments of these countries are approached through the concept of assemblages, which allows analysis of how the spatiality of national development is constituted in relation to the increasingly global development of biofuels. The approach illustrates how national policies implemented by Finland and Sweden are multiscaled in their origins and mediated by the agents of these assemblages. Materials in the study consist of EU and national policy documents, and 16 interviews from the key biofuel agents in Finland and Sweden. The author explains the differentiation of national biofuel assemblages through their distinguishing topologies, advocacy groups, and the properties of national policy instruments. The results demonstrate how Finnish and Swedish policies have influenced national biofuel developments. The EU's biofuel policies have diverging impacts nationally as they are translated into the specific patterns of biofuel production, consumption, and trade. Consequently, the agents of biofuel assemblages affect the transference of biofuel policies that originate from multiple scales into the national policy frameworks of the Member States. © 2014 Norwegian Geographical Society.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. is a tropical tree grown on large scale as a potential biofuel seed crop. However, little information on the reproductive ecology of the species is available. This lack of knowledge makes it hard to predict yield. The higher number of male flowers than female flowers results in a very low yield. In this context, field experiments were conducted in mature (site 1) and young (site 2) plantations in Zambia and mature plantation (site 3) in Malawi to study flowering characteristics and the effect of pollination methods on the fruiting and seed yield of J. curcas. Pollination treatments were open pollination, autogamous pollination, self-pollination, cross-pollination and pollen supplemented open pollination. The result showed J. curcas is not only of protandrous nature as reported earlier. The male female flower sex ratio was 17: 1, 22: 1 and 10: 1, respectively, for site 1 and 2 in Zambia and site 3 in Malawi. The mean flower longevity periods were 1.80 ± 0.07 days for male and 4.5 ± 0.18 days for female. Fewer fruit set and seed yield were recorded from autogamous pollination in Zambia sites. In the case of Malawi, more matured fruits resulted from autogamous pollination but the fruits contained fewer seeds. High fruit and seed yield were recorded for open pollination similar to pollen-supplemented pollination at Zambia sites, which indicates there was no pollen limitation in these sites. In the Malawi site there was no seed yield difference between pollination treatments. The experiment showed that J. curcas can be both protandrous and protogynous and able to produce seeds through both self-and cross-pollination. The natural fruit set and seed yield indicates that stimulating natural pollination will improve J. curcas fruit set and seed yield. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Camelina and pennycress are two annual oil-producing plant species that have recently gained attention as biofuel feedstock crops. Prior to commercial production, information on their breeding and pollination system is essential to ensure sustainable management. We conducted pollination experiments and observed flower visitors in an experimental double-cropping system in southern Germany. We found that common camelina varieties were mainly self-pollinated and yield of one variety seemed to benefit from insect visitation, whereas pennycress was predominantly wind pollinated. Camelina showed higher overall visitation rates by insects than pennycress. Flies and wild bees visited both crop species, but honey bees visited camelina only. We conclude that both oil crop species produce yield without pollinators but offer foraging resources for different insect taxa at times when few other crops and native plants are flowering. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Synthesis of transportation fuel from lignocellulosic biomass is an attractive solution to the green alternative-energy problem. The production of biodiesel, in particular, involves the process of upgrading biomass-derived small molecules to diesel precursors containing a specific carbon range (C 11-C23). Herein, a carbon-upgrading process utilizing an acid-catalyzed condensation of furanic platform molecules from biomass is described. Various types of sulfonic acid catalysts have been evaluated for this process, including biphasic and solid supported catalysts. A silica-bound alkyl sulfonic acid catalyst has been developed for promoting carbon-carbon bond formation of biomass-derived carbonyl compounds with 2-methylfuran. This hydrophobic solid acid catalyst exhibits activity and selectivity that are comparable to those of a soluble acid catalyst. The catalyst can be readily recovered and recycled, possesses appreciable hydrolytic stability in the presence of water, and retains its acidity over multiple reaction cycles. Application of this catalyst to biomass-derived platform molecules led to the synthesis of a variety of furanic compounds, which are potential biodiesel precursors. Syntheses of biodiesel precursors: A silica-bound alkyl sulfonic acid catalyst has been developed for the process of upgrading biomass-derived furanic platform molecules to biodiesel precursors. The hydrophobic alkyl sulfonic acid functionality of this catalyst is responsible for the high activity in addition to the hydrolytic stability during the syntheses of biodiesel precursors. Various carbonyl compounds from biomass in combination with 2-methylfuran have been successfully upgraded to diesel-range compounds utilizing this catalyst. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

AB  - A one-pot catalytic hydrolysis-deoxygenation reaction for the conversion of unsaturated triglycerides and free fatty acids to linear paraffins and olefins is reported. The hydrothermal deoxygenation reactions are performed in hot compressed water at 250 °C over a Pd/C catalyst in the absence of external H2. We show that aqueous-phase reforming (APR) of glycerol and subsequent water-gas-shift reaction result in the in situ formation of H 2. While this has a significant positive effect on the deoxygenation activity, the product selectivity towards high-value, long-chain olefins remains high. With a little H2elp from my friends: A one-pot hydrolysis-deoxygenation reaction for triglycerides and free fatty acids, which is of particular interest for the production of biofuels and value-added chemicals from nonedible or waste fats and oils, is reported. The reaction is performed over palladium on carbon (Pd/C) at 250 °C without additional H2. Instead, in situ H2 production occurs through glycerol reforming and subsequent water-gas-shift reaction with a positive effect on the deoxygenation activity. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of medium composition and culture conditions on lipid content, fatty acid profile and biomass production by the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica QU21. Lipid production by the yeast growing on glycerol/(NH4)2SO4 (10%/0.1%) reached 1.48g/L (30.1% according to total cell dry weight). When glycerol was replaced by crude glycerol (industrial waste), the lipid yield was 1.27g/L, with no significant difference. Some particular fatty acids were found when crude glycerol was combined with fresh yeast extract (FYE, brewery waste), as linolenic acid (C18:3n3), eicosadienoic acid (C20:2), eicosatrienoic acid (C20:3n3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n3). In addition, the FYE promoted an increase of more than 300% on polyunsaturated fatty acid content (PUFA), which is an undesirable feature for biodiesel production. The fatty acid composition of the oil produced by Y. lipolytica QU21 growing on crude glycerol/(NH4)2SO4 presented a potential use as biodiesel feedstock, with low PUFA content. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This aim of this study was to use Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to assess the life cycle energy efficiency of six biofuels in China. DEA can differentiate efficient and non-efficient scenarios, and it can identify wasteful energy losses in biofuel production. More specifically, the study has examined the efficiency of six approaches for bioethanol production involving a sample of wheat, corn, cassava, and sweet potatoes as feedstocks and "old," "new," "wet," and "dry" processes. For each of these six bioethanol production pathways, the users can determine energy inputs such as the embodied energy for seed, machinery, fertilizer, diesel, chemicals and primary energy utilized for manufacturing, and outputs such as the energy content of the bioethanol and byproducts. The results indicate that DEA is a novel and feasible method for finding efficient bioethanol production scenarios and suggest that sweet potatoes may be the most energy-efficient form of ethanol production for China. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microwave effects have been quantified, comparing activation energies and pre-exponential factors to those obtained in a conventionally-heated reactor for biodiesel production from waste cooking oils via transesterification and esterification reactions. Several publications report an enhancement of biodiesel production using microwaves, however recent reviews highlight poor temperature measurements in microwave reactors give misleading reaction performances. Operating conditions have therefore been carefully chosen to investigate non-thermal microwave effects alone. Temperature is monitored by an optical fiber sensor, which is more accurate than infrared sensors. For the transesterification reaction, the activation energy is 37.1. kJ/mol (20.1-54.2. kJ/mol) in the microwave-heated reactor compared with 31.6. kJ/mol (14.6-48.7. kJ/mol) in the conventionally-heated reactor. For the esterification reaction, the activation energy is 45.4. kJ/mol (31.8-58.9. kJ/mol) for the microwave-heated reactor compared with 56.1. kJ/mol (55.7-56.4. kJ/mol) for conventionally-heated reactor. The results confirm the absence of non-thermal microwave effects for homogenous-catalyzed reactions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Growth of the hydrogen market has motivated increased study of hydrogen production. Understanding how biomass is converted to hydrogen gas can help in evaluating opportunities for reducing the environmental impact of petroleum-based fuels. The microwave power used in the reaction is found to be proportional to the rate of production of hydrogen gas, mass of hydrogen gas produced per gram of banyan leaves consumed, and amount of hydrogen gas formed with respect to the H-atom content of banyan leaves decomposed. Increase the microwave power levels results in an increase of H2 and decrease of CO2 concentrations in the gaseous products. This finding may possibly be ascribed to the water-gas shift reaction. These results will help to expand our knowledge concerning banyan leaves and hydrogen yield on the basis of microwave-assisted pyrolysis, which will improve the design of hydrogen production technologies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify the most significant uncertainties for bioenergy applications, in order to identify factors determining the success of introducing bioenergy into the current energy system. Design/methodology/approach: A framework is built for identifying the most significant uncertainties based on studies exploring the positive potentials as well as possible negative effects of bioenergy. The framework is applied to explore uncertainties of bioenergy-based transport fuels and heat and power generation through two real life case studies. Findings: The results indicate that the most significant uncertainties are environmental and economic. Bioenergy applications have potential to mitigate climate change, but also come with negative environmental effects. Case studies show that operations in developing nations contain higher political/institutional and social uncertainty than those in developed countries, due to weaker regulations and enforcement. Research limitations/implications: The paper is part of an on-going research project. Results will be verified with stakeholder interviews and analysis. Further institutional analysis of the country settings is necessary. Practical implications: The use of a feedstock with high environmental, social and institutional uncertainties will lower public acceptance. Acting in accordance to the law is not sufficient to ensure sustainability and additional, voluntary measures should be undertaken. Originality/value: The paper identifies the most significant uncertainties for bioenergy. Uncertainties from social acceptance and institutional settings are higher in developing countries and acceptability requires more than following regulations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper presents the results of an investigation into the effect of fuel composition on the emission characteristics of a four stroke, single cylinder, Viking super direct injection diesel engine run at different operating conditions using diesel fuel and soybean biodiesel blends (B15, B20 and B25). A PerkinElmer 2400 series CHNS/O elemental analyser was used in determining the fuel composition. Exhaust emission testing was conducted using Crowcon gas sensors to quantify the concentration of Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) from the exhaust gases. The relationships between the exhaust emissions, engine speed, torque, throttle position and elemental fuel composition have been reported. The predictive model equations were developed using multiple regression analysis to predict exhaust emissions. The results show that the engine that is run on B15 gives the lowest levels of Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions of 2.58 ppm, carbon monoxide (CO) emissions of 0.153 ppm and sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions of 6.5 ppm when compared to other fuel blends. This outcome signals the possibility of using B15 as an alternative fuel to diesel for a healthier environment. © 2014 WIT Press.

AB  - In the present study, super hard, hydrogen free amorphous diamond-like carbons with a high fraction of sp3 hybridised carbon were deposited by pulsed laser deposition. The tribological performance of DLC coatings was investigated by translatory oscillating relative motion of a 100Cr6 steel ball in diesel fuel or ambient air at 25°C or 150°C temperature. The structure of the coatings and the tribological worn surfaces were characterised by Raman spectroscopy and by scanning electron microscopy. Bio-fuel with a high fraction of unsaturated fatty acids has the potential to reduce friction in tribological systems with chemically inert DLC. Diesel blend with 10% bio-fuel reduces friction at 150°C. If there is no diesel fuel, pre-oxidation at 450°C for 8 h leads to the best wear resistance (↓ f &amp; wear rate) at room temperature. Without diesel fuel, enhancement of temperature up to 150°C during wear testing causes an increase of the coefficient of friction. Again the 450°C pre-oxidised sample revealed the lowest friction. For this coating, Raman spectroscopy points to a small increase of the sp2 CC bonds. Diesel fuel seems to promote coherent coating failure under 150°C wear, while pre-oxidation at 450°C support adhesive coating ablation under higher loads or cyclic loading. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work investigates the influence of compression ratio on the performance and emissions of a diesel engine using biodiesel (10, 20, 30, and 50 %) blended-diesel fuel. Test was carried out using four different compression ratios (17.5, 17.7, 17.9 and 18.1). The experiments were designed using a statistical tool known as design of experiments based on response surface methodology. The resultant models of the response surface methodology were helpful to predict the response parameters such as brake specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxides. The results showed that best results for brake thermal efficiency and brake specific fuel consumption were observed at increased compression ratio. For all test fuels, an increase in compression ratio leads to decrease in the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions while nitrogen oxide emissions increase. Optimization of parameters was performed using the desirability approach of the response surface methodology for better performance and lower emission. A compression ratio 17.9, 10 % of fuel blend and 3.81 kW of power could be considered as the optimum parameters for the test engine. © 2013 Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Brazil is expected to increase its sugarcane production in the coming years. Almost 60% of the Brazilian sugarcane production in 2012 was situated in the state of São Paulo, where production is expected to increase further. This paper reports estimated direct land use changes and greenhouse gas balances (including soil carbon stock changes) associated with expanding production of sugarcane-based ethanol in São Paulo state. Geographic information about the location of existing and planned sugarcane mills and existing land use in these locations is used. Almost all of the sugarcane expansion in 2004-2008 took place on roughly equal shares of cropland or pasture land. The locations of the planned mills indicate that most new sugarcane might be planted on cropland unless the sugarcane is sourced from longer distances than has typically been the case. These results confirm that sugarcane expansion does not cause much direct deforestation but contrast with the view that direct competition for prime cropland is generally avoided since sugarcane is mostly planted on extensively used pasture lands. Analyses of greenhouse gas emissions and savings support the view that expansion of sugarcane ethanol in Brazil will likely bring about substantial savings - unless the expansion causes significant emissions associated with indirect land use change. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is an environmental-friendly substitute for fossil fuel. Research on the production of biodiesel from vegetable oils has concentrated on Jatropha, soybean, palm kernel, sunflower and rapeseed oils with scarce information on groundnut oils. This study focussed on the production of biodiesel from groundnut oil. Oil was mechanically extracted from groundnut seeds that were bought from Sabo market in Ogbomoso, Nigeria. The extracted oil was trans-esterized with ethanol using potassium hydroxide as catalyst in a two-step trans-esterification process to yield ethyl esters and glycerol. The fuel properties of groundnut oil and its ethyl ester were determined according to American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) standard methods and compared with that of Automotive Gas Oil (AGO). The results showed that groundnut seeds gave oil yield of 45.3%, while trans-esterification yielded 86.8% groundnut oil ethyl ester on a volume basis. At 40°C, higher viscosity of 39.2 mm2/s was obtained for raw groundnut oil than 7.60 mm2/s obtained for groundnut oil ethyl ester. At 15°C, specific gravity of raw groundnut oil and its ethyl ester were 0.9 (1.047 times that of AGO) and 0.85 (1.012 times that of AGO) respectively and are within limit specified by international standards. The biofuels contained lower amounts of sulphur (9.73% for groundnut oil ethyl ester and 12.8% for raw groundnut oil) than the reference AGO which was 61.8%. Higher pour (4°C and 3°C) points, cloud (7°C and 8°C) points and flash (200°C and &gt;280°C) points were obtained for groundnut oil ethyl ester and the raw groundnut oil respectively compared to -16°C, -12°C and 74°C respectively obtained for AGO. The fatty acid profile of the groundnut oil reveals 75.03% unsaturated fatty acids in the oil composition. Groundnut oil ethyl ester was found to have better fuel quality than raw groundnut oil and it has potentials to fuel a diesel engine.

AB  - The motivation for this research was to determine the influence of public policies on economic feasibility of producing algal biodiesel in a system that produced all its energy needs internally. To achieve this, a steady-state mass balance/unit operation system was modeled first. Open raceway technology was assumed for the production of algal feedstock, and the residual biomass after oil extraction was assumed fermented to produce ethanol for the transesterification process. The project assumed the production of 50 million gallons of biodiesel per year and using about 14% of the diesel output to supplement internal energy requirements. It sold the remainder biodiesel and ethanol as pure biofuels to maximize the rents from the renewable fuel standards quota system. Assuming a peak daily yield of 500kg algal biomass (dry basis)/ha, the results show that production of algal biodiesel under the foregoing constraints is only economically feasible with direct and indirect public policy intervention. For example, the renewable fuel standards' tracking RIN (Renewable fuel Identification Number) system provides a treasury-neutral value for biofuel producers as does the reinstatement of the renewable fuel tax credit. Additionally, the capital costs of an integrated system are such that some form of capital cost grant from the government would support the economic feasibility of the algal biodiesel production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A partial solution to problems associated with anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could be the development and deployment of carbon-negative technologies, i.e., producing energy while reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Biofuels have been considered a possibility but have faced limitations due to competition with food production and GHG emissions through indirect land-use change (ILUC). In this article, we show how emissions from ILUC can potentially be reduced by producing food and bioenergy from biochar amended soils. The possibility of yield improvements from biochar would reduce the land requirement for crop production and thus, lead to a reduction in emissions from ILUC. In our application, biochar and bio-oil are produced via fast pyrolysis of corn stover. Bio-oil is subsequently upgraded into a fuel suitable for use in internal combustion engines. Applying the U.S. regulatory method used to determine biofuel life cycle emissions, our results show that a biochar-induced yield improvement in the U.S. Midwest ranging from 1% to 8% above trend can lead to an ILUC credit between 1.65 and 14.79tCO2-equivalentha-1year-1 when future emissions are assessed over the next 30 years. The model is generalizable to other feedstocks and locations and illustrates the relationship between biochar and crop production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work showed that microalgae having low lipid content has high potential for energy recovery via thermo-chemical processes. As an example, Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) was considered and tested. Specifically, this work verified that the growth rate of M. aeruginosa was extremely fast compared to other microalgae (as a factor of ~10). Moreover, this work investigated the CO2 co-feed impact on thermo-chemical processes (pyrolysis/gasification) using M. aeruginosa. Introducing CO2 in the thermo-chemical process as reaction media or feedstock can enhance the efficiency of thermo-chemical processes by expediting the cracking capability of condensable hydrocarbons (tar). The generation of CO was enhanced as a factor of ~2. Further generation of H2 could be achieved in the presence of CO2. Thus, utilizing CO2 as reaction media or chemical feedstock can modify the end products into environmentally benign and desirable ones. The CO2 co-feed impact on thermo-chemical processes with lingo-cellulosic biomass can be universally applied. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the carbon footprint of renewable diesel (RD) production from palm oil, jatropha oil and rapeseed oil. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land use change (LUC), feedstock cultivation processes, and RD production and delivery are studied from a life-cycle assessment perspective. The goal of the paper is to calculate the carbon footprint of RD and recommend ways of decreasing it. Our findings indicate that the key contributors to the carbon footprint of RD are found in the GHG emissions of LUC, feedstock cultivation and oil extraction processes. In the case of palm oil, methane collection from palm oil mill effluent (POME) is one of the main contributors to the carbon footprint. Our calculations demonstrate that the RD production and distribution stages generate relatively low GHG emissions compared to the other life-cycle stages; therefore, attention should be focused on the contributing role of LUC and cultivation processes to the RD carbon footprint. If cultivation requires a land use conversion from forest to cultivated land, the resultant GHG emissions exceed emission levels from fossil fuels. If feedstock cultivation is done with no LUC or if grasslands are the feedstock cultivation site, then cultivation GHG emission reductions are achieved. In some cases, RD production may even act as a sink for GHGs. Due to its quality RD can be used without blend-wall limitations in vehicles; therefore, it offers a higher biofuel potential for the diesel sector than does traditional biodiesel. The article concludes by discussing the implications of the findings for RD in light of GHG emission reductions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, the quality of biodiesel produced by basic transesterification from several vegetable oils (soybean, rapeseed, sunflower, high oleic sunflower, Cynara Cardunculus L., Brassica Carinata and Jatropha Curca) cultivated in Extremadura has been studied in detail. The influence of raw material composition on properties such as density, viscosity, cetane number, higher heating value, iodine and saponification values and cold filter plugging point has been verified. Other biodiesel properties such as acid value, water content and flash and combustion points were more dependent on characteristics of production process. Biodiesel produced by rapeseed, sunflower and high oleic sunflower oils transesterification have been biofuels with better properties according to Norm EN 14214. Finally, it has been tested that it is possible to use oils mixtures in biodiesel production in order to improve the biodiesel quality. In addition, with the same process conditions and knowing properties of biodiesel from pure oils; for biodiesel from oils mixtures, its methyl esters content, and therefore properties dependent this content can be predicted from a simple mathematical equation proposed in this work. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The etherification of furanyl alcohols produced from biomass-derived glucose and fructose has been a growing area of research for production of alternative diesel additives. We have determined that the Brønsted acidic resin catalyst, Amberlyst-15, is highly active and selective for the etherification of furanyl alcohols by both ethanol and butanol. The mechanism and kinetics of this reaction were investigated using 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol (MFA) as a probe molecule. Etherification of MFA was found to be first order in both the concentrations of furanyl alcohol and the acid sites. The mechanism of MFA etherification also holds for the etherification of 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl) furan (BHMF) and 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF). In the case of HMF, we find that acetalization of HMF precedes etherification in alcohol solutions. The apparent activation energy of furanyl alcohol etherification in ethanol and butanol solutions ranged from 17.0 to 26.3 kcal/mol. Electron donation/withdrawal at the 2 or 5 position of the furan ring in addition to solvent polarity was found to have significant effects on the rate of furanyl alcohol etherification. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Environmental, availability and financial problems associated with fossil fuels encourage the manufacture and use of biodiesel. In this study, vegetable oil was extracted from Jatropha curcas seeds sourced from Kenya and Tanzania. A two-step acid-base catalytic transesterification process was used to produce biodiesel because of the amount of free fatty acids present in the oil. The test rig used in the experiments was an Audi, 1.9-litre, turbocharged direct injection, compression ignition engine. Emissions were measured using an Horiba emission analyser system while combustion data was collected by a data acquisition system, from which cylinder pressure and rate of heat release of the test engine in every crank angle were calculated. The two biodiesels showed better emission characteristics than the fossil diesel included in the tests for comparison purposes. Cylinder pressure and heat release of the biodiesel were also within acceptable ranges. However, the emission and combustion characteristics differed between the two biodiesels - a result likely related to their different origins. These findings prove that the source of biodiesel is an important factor to consider. © 2014. The Authors. The Authors.

AB  - Jatropha seed yield prediction is one of the most important influencing factors for developing a supply chain modelling of Jatropha seed. The oil from this Jatropha seed is used to blend with diesel to obtain biofuel (Hiromi, Yamamoto, Junichi Fujino, and Kenji Yamaji. 2001. "Evaluation of Bioenergy Potential with a Multi-regional Global-Land-Use-and-Energy Model." Biomass and Bioenergy 21: 185-203). The Jatropha plant is easy to cultivate and produces high yield if properly maintained. The main focus of this study is to utilize uncultivable wastelands for cultivating Jatropha seeds. As suggested by Liu et al. (Liu, Xiaohong, David B. Grant, Alan C. McKinnon, and Yuanhua Feng. 2010. "An Empirical Examination of the Contribution of Capabilities to the Competitiveness of Logistics Service Providers: A Perspective from China." International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management 40 (10): 847-866), the effectiveness of prediction affects the functional characteristics of a supply chain network design. The yield prediction of Jatropha seeds has two important roles which include (i) the identification of external parameters that affects the yield and (ii) the detection of internal attributes that changes the growth characteristics of the Jatropha plant. The development of the fuzzy inference system is characterized by a large number of input variables (Dobrila Petrovic. 2001. International Journal of Production Economics 71: 429-438). A Matlab programming software was used to integrate an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. This approach gave the numerical as well as graphical output that was used to interpret the final result. The root mean square error values were identified for the given inputs which were then compared with the trained input variables to select the best input among the given alternative variables. © 2014 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study of HidroBioDiésel (HBD) was carried out. This partly renewable diesel fuel is obtained from the co-processing of soybean vegetable oil with conventional fossil fuel in hydrotreating facilities of crude oil refineries. The environmental profile of HBD was assessed for the fossil energy use and climate change impact categories. The production systems of equivalent fuels -blends of Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME, a biofuel obtained by means of transesterification of vegetable oil) and mineral diesel with sulphur content below 10ppm were also assessed for comparison purposes. The environmental performance of HBD systems compares favourably to those of FAME and diesel blends for the selected impact categories. The estimated environmental benefits of HBD (assuming a 13% renewable blend) include reductions of up to 2% in fossil energy use and 9% in climate change impacts. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lipid production is an important indicator for assessing microalgal species for biodiesel production. In this work, the effects of medium composition on lipid production by Scenedesmus sp. were investigated using the response surface methodology. The results of a Plackett-Burman design experiment revealed that NaHCO3, NaH2PO4 ·2H2O and NaNO3 were three factors significantly influencing lipid production, which were further optimized by a Box-Behnken design. The optimal medium was found to contain 3.07 g L-1 NaHCO3, 15.49 mg L -1 NaH2PO4·2H2O and 803.21 mg L-1 NaNO3. Using the optimal conditions previously determined, the lipid production (304.02 mg·L-1) increased 54.64% more than that using the initial medium, which agreed well with the predicted value 309.50 mg L-1. Additionally, lipid analysis found that palmitic acid (C16:0) and oleic acid (C18:1) dominantly constituted the algal fatty acids (about 60% of the total fatty acids) and a much higher content of neutral lipid accounted for 82.32% of total lipids, which strongly proved that Scenedesmus sp. is a very promising feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI.

AB  - When developing various technologies designed for biomass conversion into biofuels, it is important to establish the suitability of raw material of lignocellulotic, non-food plants such as Miscanthus, whose biomass has a good energy potential. Biomass productivity, quality and its suitability for processing under more northern climatic conditions are important factors to be considered. Experiments were aimed to estimate quality and technological parameters of Miscanthus growing, harvesting and processing into synthetic diesel, to evaluate chemical, physical and mechanical properties of biomass and to determine energy consumption necessary for biomass preparation for conversion into synthetic diesel. The study object was biomass of Miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus Greef et Deu) produced under Lithuanian and German climate conditions. Miscanthus harvested in the autumn produced up to 9.42 t ha-1 dry matter (DM) yield, which was significantly higher in the treatments fertilised with a higher nitrogen rate. The content of cellulose (413-456 g kg-1 DM) and hemicellulose (204-236 g kg-1 DM) was very similar at all fertilisation levels. The highest content of lignin (117 g kg-1 DM) was established in the treatments fertilised with 120 kg ha-1 N. The spring-harvested Miscanthus biomass had significantly lower moisture content and the yield was significantly lower, too. While preparing the biomass as feedstock for synthetic diesel the greatest reduction in moisture content (to 8.59 ± 1.38%) occurred when Miscanthus biomass was chopped, pre-dried and milled, and particles larger than 2 mm accounted for the largest share. The energy use for chopping of autumn-harvested biomass was lower and chopping efficiency was higher compared with the spring-harvested biomass. The composition of major components of synthetic fuel from Miscanthus biomass was very similar to that of mineral diesel.

AB  - This work aims to investigate biofuels for diesel engines produced on a lab-scale from the fresh water microalgae Chlorella vulgaris (FWM-CV). The impact of growing conditions on the properties of biodiesel produced from FWM-CV was evaluated. The properties of FWM-CV biodiesel were found to be within the ASTM standards for biodiesel. Due to the limited amount of biodiesel produced on the lab-scale, the biomass of dry cells of FWM-CV was used to yield emulsified water fuel. The preparation of emulsion fuel with and without FWM-CV cells was conducted using ultrasound to overcome the problems of large size microalgae colonies and to form homogenized emulsions. The emulsified water fuels, prepared using ultrasound, were found to be stable and the size of FWM-CV colonies were effectively reduced to pass through the engine nozzle safely. Engine tests at 3670 rpm were conducted using three fuels: cottonseed biodiesel CS-B100, emulsified cottonseed biodiesel water fuel, water and emulsifier (CS-E20) and emulsified water containing FWM-CV cells CS-ME20. The results showed that the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) was increased by about 41% when the engine was fueled with emulsified water fuels compared to CS-B100. The engine power, exhaust gas temperature, NOx and CO2 were significantly lower than that produced by CS-B100. The CS-ME20 produced higher power than CS-E20 due to the heating value improvement as a result of adding FWM-CV cells to the fuel. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - The acid-catalyzed reaction of 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furfural with ethanol is a promising route to produce biofuels or fuel additives within the carbohydrate platform; specifically, this reaction may give 5-ethoxymethylfurfural, 5-(ethoxymethyl)furfural diethylacetal, and/or ethyl levulinate (bioEs). It is shown that sulfonated, partially reduced graphene oxide (S-RGO) exhibits a more superior catalytic performance for the production of bioEs than several other acid catalysts, which include sulfonated carbons and the commercial acid resin Amberlyst-15, which has a much higher sulfonic acid content and stronger acidity. This was attributed to the cooperative effects of the sulfonic acid groups and other types of acid sites (e.g., carboxylic acids), and to the enhanced accessibility to the active sites as a result of the 2D structure. Moreover, the acidic functionalities bonded to the S-RGO surface were more stable under the catalytic reaction conditions than those of the other solids tested, which allowed its efficient reuse. Graphene on the scene: Sulfonated, partially reduced graphene oxide (S-RGO) exhibits a superior catalytic performance than other carbocatalysts and Amberlyst-15 in the acid-catalyzed conversion of 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furfural to products for biofuels. The beneficial effects are associated with the 2D structure of S-RGO and its acidic surface enriched with sulfur and oxygen functionalities. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - The castor oil is one of the world's most useful and economically important natural plant oils. The castor oil extraction from the pressing of castor seeds is responsible for the daily generation of half a ton of a solid residue, called castor seed cake, for every ton of seed used in this process. The aim of this work was to use slow pyrolysis to obtain, from castor seed cakes, pyrolysis oil and determine its chemical composition. The bio-oil composition was investigated using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) coupled to time of flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS), and 408 compounds were tentatively identified. Among the compounds identified were: hydrocarbon (13.2%), nitrogen (9.5%), oxygen (8.4%) and sulphur (0.2%) compounds. The calorific value of the pyrolysis oils (37.5 MJ kg-1) was similar to petroleum fuels used commercially (43-46 MJ kg-1) and greater than typical wood-derived crude bio-oils (17 MJ kg-1). Thus, this oil may be potentially useful for production of chemicals and energy, after upgrading, proving to be a great choice destination of this waste. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Several animal (lamb, poultry and swine) fatty wastes were pyrolyzed under nitrogen, in a laboratory scale fixed-bed reactor and the main products (liquid bio-oil, solid bio-char and syngas) were obtained. The purpose of this study is to produce and characterize bio-oil and bio-char obtained from pyrolysis of animal fatty wastes. The maximum production of bio-oil was achieved at a pyrolysis temperature of 500. °C and a heating rate of 5. °C/min. The chemical (GC-MS analyses) and spectroscopic analyses (FTIR analyses) of bio-oil showed that it is a complex mixture consisting of different classes of organic compounds, i.e., hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, cyclic compounds...etc.), carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, esters,...etc. According to fuel properties, produced bio-oils showed good properties, suitable for its use as an engine fuel or as a potential source for synthetic fuels and chemical feedstock. Obtained bio-chars had low carbon content and high ash content which make them unattractive for as renewable source energy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Rape straw from China rural area was treated by vacuum pyrolysis for bio-oil preparation. The orthogonal design method was employed to minimize the number of experiments. The effects of the factors including pyrolysis temperature, reactor pressure, heating rate and holding time on bio-oil yield were analyzed. The optimal conditions were obtained by using SPSS Statistics 20.0 (IBM, USA) and Matlab 7.12.0 (MathWorks, USA). Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of the bio-oil obtained at optimal conditions were evaluated. The composition was examined using gas chromatograph/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS). The thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) of the bio-oil was investigated within N2 and O2, respectively. The results showed that the order of the effects of the factors on bio-oil yield was heating rate &gt; pyrolysis temperature &gt; reactor pressure &gt; holding time. Heating rate and pyrolysis temperature had a significant interaction. Optimal conditions were obtained at pyrolysis temperature of 495.5 C, heating rate of 19.4 C/min, reactor pressure of 5.0 kPa and holding time of 50 min. Confirmation runs gave 43.15% and 43.44% of bio-oil yield compared to 43.62% of predicted value. The water content, carbon residue, density, pH value, dynamic viscosity and higher heat value of bio-oil were 34.20%, 4.03, 1.14 g/cm3, 2.22, 4.28 mm2/s and 18.72 MJ/kg, respectively. Polymerization in the condensation process contributed to the higher average molecular weight distribution than pyrolysis vapors. Light aromatics (mainly including light phenols) were the dominant component for the bio-oil, which contributed to the relatively low polydispersity with a value of 1.25. The direct liquefaction bio-oil was unstable and corrosive due to the high reactivity of carbonyl extensively existing in acids, aldehydes and ketones. High oxygen content made the behavior of decomposition in O2 be similar to that in N 2 before 450 C. Further study on upgrading of the bio-oil should be performed to make it become an alternative fuel. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The dramatic growth in the production and use of liquid biofuels has led to concerns about associated impacts on human health. To date however, there has been no attempt to comprehensively synthesize the literature on this topic, despite a wealth of new research published over the past few years. We searched the Medline and Embase databases, as well as Google Scholar, in order to review the state of evidence linking liquid biofuels to human health, to characterize the magnitude of potential impacts, and to identify areas in need of more empirical research. The search results indicate that the key pathways to health associated with liquid biofuels consist of four sets of exposures: occupational hazards; water/soil pollution; air pollution relating both to the production and use of the fuel; and the price of food (affecting nutrition). Of these, only air pollution and food price seem likely to meaningfully influence health at the population level: liquid biofuels may improve air quality - at least in urban environments - but could have serious adverse effects on nutrition in food-insecure populations. However, much more work is needed in both areas. Very few studies have explored more indirect pathways to health, such as those relating to land-use change, climate change and economic factors. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Algae offer a multiple-benefit opportunity as the products that can result from algal cultivation are numerous and diverse. However, commercial production of algal-derived materials is scarce and in Queensland Australia is virtually non-existent, partly due to challenges around readily available resources. In this work, the potential to regionally recycle waste nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and CO2 to support algal production is considered. A feature of the work is mapping the availability of the three resources for algal cultivation (N, P and CO2) together with climatic and land use considerations. Mapping resolution is defined by the boundaries of Queensland's (Australia) regional authorities. Layering the maps enables identification of regional hotspots for growing algae. Waste resources are shown to be most abundant in Mackay, Burdekin, Toowoomba, Cassowary and Bundaberg; regions which also have favourable eco-climatic conditions. Waste nitrogen is the limiting waste stream, in these and most other regions however additional requirements can be fixed atmospherically, whereas waste CO2 is shown to be abundant relative to waste nutrients. It is found that, based on the availability of waste phosphorus, the top 5 most suitable regions have sufficient resources to produce around 1.1 million t/y of algal biomass. This could potentially produce 309 ML of biodiesel which is 5% of Queensland's 2011 diesel oil sales. The outcomes of this work highlight new opportunities for industrial ecology in non-urban regions. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rhazya stricta Decne (R. stricta) is a hardy, drought-resistant, and arid land plant that is widely distributed from the Middle East to South Asia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of R. stricta seed oil as an alternative source of triacylglycerols that may be suitable for the synthesis of biodiesel. The oil content of the seeds was approximately 14% and was mainly composed of the fatty acids linoleic (60.95%) and oleic (25.48%) acid. R. stricta methyl esters (RSME) were prepared by a base-catalyzed transesterification reaction. The conversion rate of the triacylglycerols to the corresponding methyl esters was determined by 1H-NMR to be approximately 97%. This study showed that the fuel properties of the RSMEs are comparable to other vegetable oil methyl esters that are commonly used as biodiesels. R. stricta plantations will therefore be suitable for promoting sustainable agriculture and for producing biodiesel with viable prices in arid and semi-arid regions throughout the world. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the environmental consequences and energy requirements of a biogas production system and its further conversion into bioenergy by means of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. To do so, an Italian biogas plant operating with pig slurry and two energy crops (maize and triticale silages) as feedstock was assessed in detail in order to identify the environmental hotspots. The environmental profile was estimated through six impact categories: abiotic depletion potential (ADP), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP), global warming potential (GWP), ozone layer depletion potential (ODP) and photochemical oxidation potential (POFP). An energy analysis related to the cumulative non-renewable fossil and nuclear energy demand (CED) was also performed, considering this indicator as an additional impact category. According to the results, the biomass production subsystem was identified as the main environmental key issue in terms of ADP, AP, EP, ODP and CED, with contributions ranging from 26% to 61% of the total impact. Regarding ADP, ODP and CED, these results are mainly related with diesel requirements in agricultural machinery, derived combustion emissions and mineral fertilizers production. Concerning AP and EP the production field emissions derived from fertilizers application was observed as the main contributor. Concerning GWP, this step presents an environmental credit due to the uptake of CO2 during crop growth, which contributes to offset the GHG emissions. The bioenergy production plant significantly contributes to the environmental impact in categories such as GWP (43%) and POFP (59%), mostly related with emissions produced in the gas engine and biogas losses. Emissions derived from digestate storage contribute to AP (52%) and EP (41%). The use of the digestate as an organic fertilizer has a beneficial role because this action avoids the production and use of mineral fertilizers.A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to assess the influence of variations in important parameters of biogas systems. The environmental profile of the biogas system turned out to be highly dependent on the selection of system boundaries and the allocation method.To sum up, this study aims to assess the environmental performance of a biogas technology available not only in Italy but also in other European countries. The environmental analysis of the process under study highlights the environmental benefits of the co-digestion processes, which not only produces biofuel but also reduces the disposal of solid wastes and produces digestate, with special value in the fertilization of agricultural soil. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Initially hailed as a miracle crop for biofuel production, Jatropha has recently attracted criticism for competing with food production, causing adverse biodiversity impacts, and jeopardizing land access by rural populations in tropical countries. This article analyzes the contested development of Jatropha biofuel sector in Tanzania by anchoring two new concepts of "organizational models" and "institutional arrangements" to the sectoral systems of innovation perspective. The notion of "organizational models" brings into relief the heterogeneity of actors in an innovation system and the ways in which the actors form networks, within and across national borders, to organize innovative activities. The concept of "institutional arrangements" refers to the ensemble of formal and informal institutions assembled during Tanzania's colonial and postcolonial eras, which directly govern innovative activities in specific organizational models. Based on a location-specific and historically grounded institutional analysis within the innovation system framework, implications are drawn for the future development of Tanzania's Jatropha sector including its links with European markets and for the regulation of "next-generation" biofuels. © The Author 2013.

AB  - In this study, performance of a diesel engine operated with Jatropha and Palm biodiesel blends at high idling conditions has been evaluated. The result obtained from experiment elucidate that, at all idling modes HC and CO emissions of both blends decreases, however, NOx emissions increases compared to pure diesel fuel. Jatropha biodiesel has higher viscosity compared to Palm biodiesel, which might have degraded the spray characteristics and caused slightly improper mixing which might have led to slightly incomplete combustion, thus at both idling conditions, Jatropha blends emitted higher CO and HC compared to Palm biodiesels. Compared to diesel fuel, CO emissions were 5.9-9.7%, 17.6-22.6%, 23.5-29%, 2.9-6.4%, 5.9-14.5% and 11.8-17.74% less, HC emissions were 10.3-11.5%, 24.13-30.76%, 34.5-39%, 6.9-7.7%, 26-27% and 31-35% less and NOx emissions were 8.3-9.5%, 14-15%, 22-25%, 5-7.14%, 10-11.3% and 17-18% more respectively for 5, 10 and 20% blends of Palm and Jatropha biodiesel. Compared to diesel fuel, at high idling conditions brake specific fuel consumption all Palm and Jatropha biodiesel-diesel blends increased. Compared to diesel fuel, BSFC were 1.14-1.35%, 2.28-2.96%, 7.1-8.35%, 2.28-2.69%, 3.98-5.39% and 8.83-9.29% more respectively for 5, 10 and 20% blends of Palm and Jatropha biodiesel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study deals with the production of biodiesel using waste fish oil. The research assesses the effect of the transesterification parameters on the biodiesel yield and its properties, including temperature (40-60°C), molar ratio methanol to oil (3:1-9:1) and reaction time (30-90min). The experimental results were fitted to complete quadratic models and optimized by response surface methodology. All the biodiesel samples presented a FAME content higher than 93wt.% with a maximum, 95.39wt.%, at 60°C, 9:1 of methanol to oil ratio and 90min. On the other hand, a maximum biodiesel yield was found at the same methanol to oil ratio and reaction time conditions but at lower temperature, 40°C, which reduced the saponification of triglycerides by the alkaline catalyst employed. Adequate values of kinematic viscosity (measured at 30°C) were obtained, with a minimum of 6.30mm2/s obtained at 60°C, 5.15:1 of methanol to oil ratio and 55.52min. However, the oxidative stability of the biodiesels produced must be further improved by adding antioxidants because low values of IP, below 2.22h, were obtained. Finally, satisfactory values of completion of melt onset temperature, ranging from 3.31°C to 3.83°C, were measured. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Blends of conventional fuels such as Jet-A1 (aviation kerosene) and diesel with bio-derived components, referred to as biofuels, are gradually replacing the conventional fuels in aircraft and automobile engines. There is a lack of understanding on the interaction of spray drops of such biofuels with solid surfaces. The present study is an experimental investigation on the impact of biofuel drops onto a smooth stainless steel surface. The biofuel is a mixture of 90% commercially available camelina-derived biofuel and 10% aromatics. Biofuel drops were generated using a syringe-hypodermic needle arrangement. On demand, the needle delivers an almost spherical drop with drop diameter in the range 2.05-2.15mm. Static wetting experiments show that the biofuel drop completely wets the stainless steel surface and exhibits an equilibrium contact angle of 5.6°. High speed video camera was used to capture the impact dynamics of biofuel drops with Weber number ranging from 20 to 570. The spreading dynamics and maximum spreading diameter of impacting biofuel drops on the target surface were analyzed. For the impact of high Weber number biofuel drops, the spreading law suggests β~τ0.5 where β is the spread factor and τ, the nondimensionalized time. The experimentally observed trend of maximum spread factor, βmax of camelina biofuel drop on the target surface with We compares well with the theoretically predicted trend from Ukiwe-Kwok model. After reaching βmax, the impacting biofuel drop undergoes a prolonged sluggish spreading due to the high wetting nature of the camelina biofuel-stainless steel system. As a result, the final spread factor is found to be a little more than βmax. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In the present research, effect of biodiesel content on homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine combustion, performance and emission characteristics has been investigated experimentally. Experiments were performed in a modified two cylinder engine, in which, one cylinder was operated in HCCI mode while other was operated in conventional CI mode. HCCI engine can be operated with a wide variety of fuels starting from mineral diesel to various blends of biodiesel (B20 and B40). The basic requirement of the HCCI engines is homogeneous mixing of fuel and air, which is done by using port fuel injection strategy in this study. An external device was used for fuel vaporization and mixture formation. For controlling HCCI combustion, different EGR conditions (0%, 15% and 30%) were also applied. In the experiments, combustion results were found to be more stable for biodiesel HCCI compared to diesel HCCI due to lower rate of heat release (RoHR) for biodiesel. A reduction in power output and an increase in ISFC were observed upon increasing the biodiesel content in the test fuel. A small increase in CO, HC and smoke emissions was observed with increasing biodiesel content due to slower evaporation rate of biodiesel. A significant reduction in NOx emissions was also observed with for biodiesel blends. © 2014.

AB  - There are many examples of small-scale initiatives, based on exploitation of the jatropha-crude oil chain, to provide energy at local level, especially in the rural areas of a developing country, where mechanical pressing is currently the most widely used process to extract oil from seed. This study is a comparative analysis of the extraction performance parameters and the quality of the cold pressed oil obtained utilizing a commercial single screw extruder at the farm level for the extraction of Jatropha curcas, sunflower and rapeseed oil. In the case of J. curcas, the best operating results were obtained at a seed feed rate of 25.7. kg/h yielding about 8. kg/h of oil. This result, although satisfactory, was much lower than that of the rape and sunflower seeds. The levels of the main mineral contents (phosphorus, calcium and magnesium) in the jatropha oil, are significantly higher than those specified in the DIN V 51605 standard. Moreover jatropha oil showed high K and Na content (>. 2. ppm), the elements that promote deposit formations in engines, while these were not detectable in rapeseed and sunflower oil. Preventive measures (optimizing harvest and storage condition) and avoiding an excessive rise in oil temperature (<. 50. °C) during the extraction process are necessary to improve the quality of the jatropha crude oil. In order to meet the quality standards of the new DIN 51506, in order to reduce the mineral elements content in the jatropha oil (especially P, Ca. +. Mg) inert additives may be mixed with the oil during the seed processing, but these additives can lower the oxidation stability of the oil, so a stabilizer also needs to be added. Moreover these steps complicate the technological process and lower the commercial value of the oil, clearly demonstrating the advantage of producing oil with low concentration of P, Ca. +. Mg and K. +. Na in the first place. © 2013.

AB  - Microalgal biodiesel production has been investigated for decades, yet it is not commercially available. Part of the problem is that the production process is energy and chemical intensive due, in part, to the high portion of microalgal biomass left as residues. This study investigated cradle-to-gate life-cycle environmental impacts from six different scenarios of microalgal biodiesel and its co-products. Ozone depletion, global warming, photochemical smog formation, acidification and eutrophication potentials were assessed using the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other environmental Impacts (TRACI). Monte Carlo Analysis was conducted to investigate the processes with major contribution in each impact category. The market opportunity for each co-product was examined based on supply, demand and prices of the products that could potentially be substituted by the co-products. The results indicated that the scenario with the least life-cycle environmental impacts in all the five impact categories with the highest net energy ratio was the scenario utilizing a multitude of co-products including bioethanol from lipid-extracted microalgae (LEA), biomethane (to produce electricity and heat) from simultaneous saccharification-fermentation (SSF) residues, land-applied material from SSF residue anaerobic digestion (AD) solid digestate, recycling nutrients from SSF residue AD liquid digestate and CO2 recovered from SSF process contributed. Decreasing the energy consumption of the centrifuge in the land-applied material production process and increasing the lipid content of microalgae can reduce environmental footprints of the co-products. The same scenario also had the highest total income indicating their potential as co-products in the market. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Methanol was replaced by dimethyl carbonate for biodiesel production. In the process, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) was produced through transesterification of soybean oil with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) using potassium methoxide as a catalyst. This method produced a more attractive by-product, glycerol carbonate (GC). Factors affecting the reaction such as vegetable oil to DMC molar ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction time and reaction temperature were optimized. Triglyceride conversion of 95.8% was obtained at the optimized condition. This process provided an insight into the reactivity of DMC at different temperature. Co-production of FAME and glycerol carbonate (GC) proceeded through carboxymethylation reaction because methoxyl group and carbonyl group are generated which subsequently attacked the carbonyl moiety in glyceride molecules to form the required products. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Rapeseed meal (RSM) hydrolysate was evaluated as substitute for commercial nutrient supplements in 1,3-propanediol (PDO) fermentation using the strain Clostridium butyricum VPI 1718. RSM was enzymatically converted into a generic fermentation feedstock, enriched in amino acids, peptides and various micro-nutrients, using crude enzyme consortia produced via solid state fermentation by a fungal strain of Aspergillus oryzae. Initial free amino nitrogen concentration influenced PDO production in batch cultures. RSM hydrolysates were compared with commercial nutrient supplements regarding PDO production in fed-batch cultures carried out in a bench-scale bioreactor. The utilization of RSM hydrolysates in repeated batch cultivation resulted in a PDO concentration of 65.5. g/L with an overall productivity of 1.15. g/L/h that was almost 2 times higher than the productivity achieved when yeast extract was used as nutrient supplement. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, Pomolion Stearin wax oil biodiesel with zinc oxide additive was studied in a single-cylinder, stationary, air cooled and direct injection compression ignition engines as well as its effects on engine performance and exhaust emissions were studied. The Pomolion Stearin Wax oil Methyl Ester (PSWME) is mixed with the zinc oxide nanoparticles in the mass fractions of 50 ppm and 100 ppm with the aid of an ultrasonicator. The average diameter of the zinc oxide nanoparticles is less than 100nm. The properties such as flash point, kinematic viscosity, cetane number, cloud point, sulphated ash and calorific value of all blends were determined and compared with ASTM (D7467) standards. The experiments were conducted at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. The acquired data were studied for various parameters such as brake mean effective pressure (bmep), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake thermal efficiency (BTE), exhaust temperature and exhaust gases of Carbon monoxide (CO), hydro carbon (HC) and Nitrogen oxide (NOx) gases for 80% Diesel + 20% PSWME (B20), 80% Diesel + 20% PSWME + 50 ppm Zinc Oxide (D80B20ZnO50) and 80% Diesel + 20% PSWME + 100ppm Zinc Oxide (D80B20ZnO100) fuel blends at different loads, i.e., 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% were tested.

AB  - The United States Navy (USN) is currently demonstrating the viability of environmentally sustainable alternative fuels to power its fleet comprised of aircraft and ships. As with any fuel used in a maritime setting, there is potential for introduction into the environment through transport, storage, and spills. However, while alternative fuels are often presumed to be eco-friendly relative to conventional petroleum-based fuels, their environmental fate and effects on marine environments are essentially unknown. Here, standard laboratory-based toxicity experiments were conducted for two alternative fuels, jet fuel derived from Camelina sativa (wild flax) seeds (HRJ5) and diesel fuel derived from algae (HRD76), and two conventional counterparts, jet fuel (JP5) and ship diesel (F76). Initial toxicity tests performed on water-accommodated fractions (WAF) from neat fuels partitioned into seawater, using four standard marine species in acute and chronic/sublethal tests, indicate that the alternative fuels are significantly less toxic to marine organisms. © 2013.

AB  - This study demonstrates a direct transesterification (DT) method for reliable quantification of microalgal lipid. Primary screening of various transesterification methods and the types of biomass (wet, oven dried and lyophilized) were performed with heterotrophically grown Chlorella sp. FC2 IITG which revealed two stage DT with lyophilized biomass using NaOH in first stage and H2SO4 in second stage as the best combination with fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield of 39.17% (w/w, dry cell weight). Further optimization of transesterification parameters for selected method using response surface methodology, predicted the optimum values for catalyst to biomass ratio 0.67 (w/w) and 2.07 (v/w), methanol to biomass ratio 49.51 (v/w) and 61.07 (v/w) and reaction time 19.33 (min) and 10 (min) for first and second stages respectively. The optimum conditions showed 462.6% and 445.4% increment in FAME yield when compared with Bligh and Dyer method for Chlorella sp. FC2 IITG and Chlorella sorokiniana FC6 IITG respectively with highest transesterification efficiency of 98.96%. Improved transesterification efficiency of two stage DT was attributed to efficient destabilization of cell wall as confirmed by scanning electron microscopic imaging. FAME produced via DT of Chlorella sp. FC2 IITG satisfied most of the biodiesel properties as per ASTM D6751 and hence, could be an alternative to petro-diesel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Combustion emissions from diesel engines emit particulate matter which deposits within the lungs. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) encounter the particles and attempt to engulf the particles. Emissions particles from diesel combustion engines have been found to contain diverse biologically active components including metals and polyaromatic hydrocarbons which cause adverse health effects. However little is known about AM response to particles from the incorporation of biodiesel. The objective of this study was to examine the toxicity in Wistar Kyoto rat AM of biodiesel blend (B20) and low sulfur petroleum diesel (PDEP) exhaust particles. Particles were independently suspended in media at a range of 1-500μgmL-1. Results indicated B20 and PDEP initiated a dose dependent increase of inflammatory signals from AM after exposure. After 24h exposure to B20 and PDEP gene expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2) increased. B20 exposure resulted in elevated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release at lower particle concentrations compared to PDEP. B20 and PDEP demonstrated similar affinity for sequestration of PGE2 at high concentrations, suggesting detection is not impaired. Our data suggests PGE2 release from AM is dependent on the chemical composition of the particles. Particle analysis including measurements of metals and ions indicate B20 contains more of select metals than PDEP. Other particle components generally reduced by 20% with 20% incorporation of biodiesel into original diesel. This study shows AM exposure to B20 results in increased production of PGE2 in vitro relative to diesel. © 2013.

AB  - Although nitrogen starvation is frequently used to increase lipid contents in microalgae, it has a negative effect on cellular growth. Since light supply is essential for photosynthetic organisms, the effects of cultivation under monochromatic illumination on the growth and lipid contents of Nannochloropsis gaditana were assessed. Continuous cultivation under blue and red light conditions improved the productivity and physical properties for biodiesel from this microalga. FAME yield was twofold higher under red light than under normal white light (21.12% vs 11.35%), with no significant difference in growth rates. Blue and red light increased photosynthetic oxygen evolution, carbon fixation and nutrient uptake. In total, more significant physiological changes were observed under red than under blue light. These results show that red light illumination may be useful for enhancing lipid production by N. gaditana, with the increased photosynthetic reducing equivalents induced by red light which could be deposited as lipids and carbohydrates. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fuel characteristics of biodiesel derived from kernel oils of Sclerocarya birrea, Tylosema esculentum, Schiziophyton rautanenii and Jatropha curcas plants were investigated in comparison with petroleum diesel. The fuel properties under review include flash point, cloud point, kinematic viscosity, density, calorific value, acid value, and free fatty acids. These were determined and discussed in light of major biodiesel standards such as ASTM D 6751 (American Society for Testing and Materials) and EN 14214 (European standards). The best biofuel in terms of cold flow properties was S. rautanenii, with a cloud point of 0°C and a pour point of-5°C. The good cold flow properties demonstrate operational viability during the cold season. The heating values of S. birrea and S. rautanenii biodiesel fuels were found to be 9.2% and 10.3% lower than that of petroleum diesel while those of T. esculentum and J. curcas were both 9.7% lower. Other fuel properties analysed demonstrate that biodiesel fuels produced from kernel oils of S. birrea, T. esculentum, S. rautanenii and J. curcas plants have properties that are comparable to, and in some cases better than, those of petroleum diesel. The results of this study indicate the feasibility of producing quality biodiesel fuel from indigenous seed oils found in Botswana. A balanced allocation of resources however needs to be established to ensure that the cultivation of these oil-bearing plants does not compete with the cultivation of food crops. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Two coastal seawaters (Key West, FL, USA and the Persian Gulf, Bahrain, representing oligotrophic and eutrophic environments, respectively) were used to evaluate potential biodegradation and corrosion problems during exposure to alternative and conventional fuels. Uncoated carbon steel was exposed at the fuel/seawater interface and polarization resistance was monitored. Under typical marine storage conditions, dioxygen in natural seawater exposed to fuel and carbon steel was reduced to <. 0.1. parts-per-million within 2. d due to consumption by corrosion reactions and aerobic microbial respiration. Sulfides, produced by anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria, and chlorides were co-located in corrosion products. Transient dioxygen influenced both metabolic degradation pathways and resulting metabolites. Catechols, indicative of aerobic biodegradation, persisted after 90. d exposures. Detection of catechols suggested that initial exposure to dioxygen resulted in the formation of aerobic metabolites that exacerbated subsequent corrosion processes. © 2013.

AB  - Diesel engine emissions are an important source of ultrafine particulate matter (PM) in both ambient air and many occupational settings. Biodiesel is a popular 'green' alternative to petroleum diesel fuel, but little is known about the impact of 'real-world' biodiesel combustion on workplace PM concentrations and particle characteristics including size, morphology, and composition; or on biological responses. The objectives of the present work were to characterize PM workplace concentrations and tailpipe emissions produced by the combustion of commercially purchased low sulfur petrodiesel and a waste grease B20 blend (20 % biodiesel/80 % petrodiesel by volume) in heavy duty diesel (HDD) nonroad equipment operating in a 'real-world' rural recycling center. Furthermore, we assessed the in vitro responses of cell lines representing human lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and macrophages (THP-1) after 24 h of exposure to these real-world particles. Compared to petroleum diesel, use of B20 in HDD equipment resulted in lower mass concentrations of PM2.5, PM&lt;0.25 (particle diameter less than 2.5 and 0.25 μm, respectively), and elemental carbon. Transmission electron analysis of PM showed that primary particle size and morphology were similar between fuel types. Metals composition analysis revealed differences between fuels, with higher Fe, Al, V, and Se measured during B20 use, and higher As, Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Pb concentrations measured during petrodiesel use. In vitro responses varied between fuels but data supported that waste grease B20 particles elicited inflammatory responses in human macrophages and lung epithelial cells comparable to petrodiesel particles. However, the effects were more pronounced with B20 than petrodiesel at the same mass concentration. Since the primary particle size and morphology were similar between fuels, it is likely that the differential results seen in the in vitro assays points to differences in the composition of the PM. Future research should focus on the organic carbon and metals speciation and potential impact of real-world particles on reactive oxygen species generation and mechanisms for differences in the cellular inflammatory responses. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Jatropha curcas is a promissory species for biodiesel production. Chilling and freezing stress are major environmental constraints for its establishment as a result of the injury provoked on leaf photosynthetic apparatus. This study is aimed at evaluating the impact of chilling (40h at 4°C) and freezing (2h at -1, -2 and -3°C) on maximum leaf photosynthesis (Amax), in relation to stomatal conductance (gs) and photochemical activity. Two similar experiments were conducted in pots outdoors; treatments were performed in climate chambers at the stage of four expanded leaves per plant, and then returned outdoors. Leaf gas exchange, water status and fluorescence variables were measured at 1 and 30 days after the end of the treatments (DAT). At 1 DAT, Amax and gs were reduced up to 75% and 100% in chilling and freezing treatments, respectively. However, the intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) showed an inverse pattern, discarding a determinant role in Amax reductions. A lower efficiency electron use for photosynthesis was detected for plants subjected to chilling and freezing stress. The potential efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm), chlorophyll content (Chl) and relative water content (RWC) were only affected by the lowest freezing treatments, while chilling and intermediate freezing plants showed an increase of the non photochemical quenching (NPQ). Leaf death occurred in the lowest freezing treatments, while several residual effects on Amax, gs and electron transport rate (ETR) were also observed at 30 DAT in the survival plants. This work sheds light on the determinant processes involved in the depletion of photosynthesis by chilling and freezing injuries, revealing that low temperatures have persistent and detrimental effects on J. curcas crop establishment. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ketones are potential biofuel candidates and are also formed as intermediate products during the oxidation of large hydrocarbons or oxygenated fuels, such as alcohols and esters. This paper presents shock tube ignition delay times and OH reaction rates of 2-butanone (C2H5COCH3) and 3-buten-2-one (C2H3COCH3). Ignition delay measurements were carried out over temperatures of 1100-1400K, pressures of 3-6.5atm, and at equivalence ratios (F{cyrillic}) of 0.5 and 1. Ignition delay times were monitored using two different techniques: pressure time history and OH absorption near 306nm. The reaction rates of hydroxyl radicals (OH) with these two ketones were measured over the temperature range of 950-1400K near 1.5atm. The OH profiles were monitored by the narrow-line-width ring-dye laser absorption of the well-characterized R1(5) line in the OH A-X (0, 0) band near 306.69nm. We found that the ignition delay times of 2-butanone and 3-buten-2-one mixtures scale with pressure as P-0.42 and P-0.52, respectively. The ignition delay times of 3-buten-2-one were longer than that of 2-butanone for stoichiometric mixtures, however, for lean mixtures (F{cyrillic}=0.5), 2-butanone had longer ignition delay times. The chemical kinetic mechanism of Serinyel et al. [1] over-predicted the ignition delay times of 2-butanone at all tested conditions, however, the discrepancies were smaller at higher pressures. The mechanism was updated with recent rate measurements to decrease discrepancy with the experimental data. A detailed chemistry for the oxidation of 3-buten-2-one was developed using rate estimation method and reasonable agreements were obtained with the measured ignition delay data. The measured reaction rate of 2-butanone with OH agreed well with the literature data, while we present the first high-temperature measurements for the reaction of OH with 3-buten-2-one. The following Arrhenius expressions are suggested over the temperature range of 950-1450K: kC2H5COCH3+OH=6.78×1013exp(-2534/T)cm3mol-1s-1kC2H3COCH3+OH=4.17×1013exp(-2350/T)cm3mol-1s-1. © 2013 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF) is considered to be an attractive biomass based platform chemical with high potential as a biofuel compound and as a green solvent. 2-MTHF can be synthesised from bio-based levulinic acid (LA) and γ-valerolactone (GVL). Herein the optimum reaction conditions for the hydrogenation of GVL over Ru/C have been studied. A full conversion of GVL has been obtained under solvent free conditions with a maximum yield of 2-MTHF of 43%. The optimized conditions have been employed in a mechanistic study of the synthesis of 2-MTHF. Several side reactions have been investigated to explore the full reaction network of this heterogeneously catalysed system and to elucidate the factors influencing product selectivity. Additionally an efficient solvent-free hydrogenation reaction of LA into 2-MTHF could be achieved delivering 90% conversion of LA with a yield of 2-MTHF of 61% by removing water from the system in a two-step approach. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - After three years' monitoring of the concentration of Al, Fe, Zn, Ni, Pb, As, Cd, Cr and Se in soil, Fe, Pb and As in Pittsburgh's vacant lots were found sometimes to exceed the residential maximum soil contaminant concentrations set by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. Heavy metal uptake by sunflowers was insignificant at the soil metal concentrations observed in Pittsburgh, indicating that sunflowers produced on marginal urban land could be a safe biofuel feedstock. However, there was a risk that sunflowers grown on more contaminated spoils could be unsafe. Calculations of the energy balance of the total biofuel production system suggested that lots in Pittsburgh of over 0.2. ha would be able to produce an energy gain, particularly if community volunteers were involved in the process. Using marginal urban land for biofuel production can be a worthwhile strategy to replace costly traditional vacant lot management methods. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalytic hydrotreating of palm oil (refined palm olein type) to produce bio-hydrogenated diesel (BHD) was carried out in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor over NiMoS2/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Effects of dominant hydrotreating parameters: temperature: 270-420°C; H2 pressure: 15-80bar; LHSV: 0.25-5.0h-1; and H2/oil ratio: 250-2000N(cm3/cm3) on the conversion, product yield, and a contribution of hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and decarbonylation/decarboxylation (DCO/DCO2) were investigated to find the optimal hydrotreating conditions. All calculations including product yield and the contribution of HDO and DCO/DCO2 were extremely estimated based on mole balance corresponding to the fatty acid composition in feed to fully understand deoxygenation behaviors at different conditions. These analyses demonstrated that HDO, DCO, and DCO2 reactions competitively occurred at each condition, and had different optimal and limiting conditions. The differences in the hydrotreating reactions, liquid product compositions, and gas product composition were also discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this work was to study the conversion of inedible, low cost lipid feedstocks to renewable hydrocarbons using a two stage thermal hydrolysis-pyrolysis method. Beef tallow, yellow grease, brown grease and cold pressed camelina oil were first hydrolyzed and the fatty acids produced were recovered and pyrolyzed in batch reactors. The pyrolysis products were identified and quantified using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The pyrolysis product yields were similar for all the feedstock used with the organic liquid fraction (OLF) accounting for 76-80% of the product. The OLF consisted predominantly of n-alkanes. Approximately 30% OLF constituted a gasoline-equivalent fraction and 50% a diesel fraction. Other fuel property test showed that the OLF met the specifications set out by the Canadian general standards board. This research demonstrated a novel two-stage thermal hydrolysis-pyrolysis conversion method for producing OLF from inedible and low-value lipids. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cunninghamella blakesleeana- JSK2, a gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) producing tropical fungal isolate, was utilized as a tool to evaluate the influence of various plant seed oils on biomass, oleagenicity and bio-fuel production. The fungus accumulated 26 % total lipid of their dry biomass (2 g/l) and 13 % of GLA in its total fatty acid. Among the various plant seed oils tested as carbon sources for biotransformation studies, watermelon oil had an effect on biomass and total lipid increasing up to 9.24 g/l and 34 % respectively. Sunflower, pumpkin, and onion oil increased GLA content between 15-18 %. Interestingly, an indigenous biodiesel commodity, Pongamia pinnata oil showed tremendous effect on fatty acid profile in C. blakesleeana- JSK2, when used as a sole source of carbon. There was complete inhibition of GLA from 13 to 0 % and increase in oleic acid content, one of the key components of biodiesel to 70 % (from 20 % in control). Our results suggest the potential application of indigenous plant seed oils, particularly P. pinnata oil, for the production of economically valuable bio-fuel in oleaginous fungi in general, and C. blakesleeana- JSK2, in particular. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The biodiesel obtained from the seeds of Callophyllum innophyllum has been analyzed for its physico chemical properties. The oil yield potential of Callophyllum seed and the biodiesel properties of the oil were studied in order to know the feasibility of the oil as a biofuel. The physico-chemical properties of the biodiesel produced by blending with the conventional diesel were evaluated and compared with that of diesel. The physico-chemical properties assessed includes, specific gravity, density, viscosity, flash point, fire point, cloud point, pour point, smoke point, pH, carbon residue, ultrasonic parameters, average molecular weight, saponification value, acid value, and iodine value. The results revealed that there is a significant difference between the physico-chemical properties of biodiesel and petro diesel.

AB  - Biodiesel is usually produced by the transesterification of vegetable oils and animal fats with methanol, catalyzed by strong acids or bases. This study introduces a novel biodiesel production method that features direct base-catalyzed methanolysis of the cellular biomass of oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides Y4. NaOH was used as catalyst for transesterification reactions and the variables affecting the esterification level including catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, reaction time, solvent loading (methanol) and moisture content were investigated using the oleaginous yeast biomass. The most suitable pretreatment condition was found to be 4gL-1 NaOH and 1:20 (w/v) dried biomass to methanol ratio for 10h at 50°C and under ambient pressure. Under these conditions, the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield was 97.7%. Therefore, the novel method of direct base-catalyzed methanolysis of R. toruloides is a much simpler, less tedious and time-consuming, process than the conventional processes with higher FAME (biodiesel) conversion yield. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study was to produce microbial oil from Lipomyces starkeyi DSM 70296 grown in hemicellulose hydrolysate (H-H). Glucose and xylose were used for batch, fed-batch, repeated fed-batch, and continuous cultures, and H-H was tested at continuous culture. The highest cell and lipid concentrations of 85.4 and 41.8g/L, respectively, were obtained using repeated fed-batch strategy. Continuous culture with dilution rate of 0.03h-1 presented the highest overall cell (0.443g/g) and lipid yields (0.236g/g). At 0.06h-1 were obtained the highest cell and lipid productivities. Continuous cultivation using H-H at 0.03h-1 resulted in higher cell productivity than that obtained using glucose:xylose. Gas chromatography analysis of the esterified lipids indicated that the major constituents of this complex are palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid with an estimated cetane number (approximately 61) similar to that of palm biodiesel, which is important for biofuel production. © 2014.

AB  - In present study a turbocharged, medium duty compression ignition engine was alternatively fuelled with biodiesel to investigate the changes in particulate matter composition, relative to that taken with diesel fuel. The engine was operated on an AC electrical dynamometer in accordance with an 8-mode, steady-state cycle. The numbers of particles were estimated through electrical low pressure impactor, while sulfates and trace metals were analyzed by ion chromatography and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy, respectively. Nitric oxides and nitrogen dioxides were measured separately using SEMTECH-DS. Experimental results revealed that, on account of elevated ratios of nitrogen dioxide to nitrogen oxides, mean accumulation mode particles were 42 % lower with biodiesel. On the other hand, nuclei mode particles were higher with biodiesel, owing to heterogeneous nucleation and accounting for an increase in sulfate emissions up to 8 % with biodiesel as compared to diesel. On the average, trace metal emissions were significantly reduced showing 65-85.4 % reduction rates with biodiesel, relative to its counterpart. Further to this, individual congeners such as iron, calcium, and sodium were the predominant elements of the trace metals emitted from engine. The mean relative decrease in iron and calcium was 89-97.8 and 77.6-87 %, respectively, while the relative rise in sodium was in the range of 29-46 % with biodiesel. Further, elements such as zinc, chromium, and aluminum showed substantial abatement, whereas potassium, magnesium, and manganese exhibited irregular trends on account of variable engine loads and speeds during the various modes of cycle. © 2013 Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Certain lipases such as Candida antarctica lipase A (CAL-A) are known to possess acyltransferase activity, which allows ester synthesis even in the presence of water. Discovery of novel lipases and identification of lipase variants with improved acyltransferase activity is laborious using standard methods such as gas chromatography. To overcome this limitation, an enzyme cascade was established based on quantification of the alcohol consumed in fatty acid ester synthesis from plant oils. For this, an alcohol oxidase converts the remaining alcohol to the corresponding aldehyde with concomitant formation of hydrogen peroxide. This is then quantified by the action of horseradish peroxidase leading to the oxidation of the co-substrate ABTS, which is determined spectrophotometrically at 695nm. The conversions thus determined correspond well to data measured by off-line gas chromatography analysis and the assay could be adapted to the microtiterplate format. Practical applications: Fatty acid esters are valuable compounds in various industrial applications, i.e., fatty acid methyl esters are used as biofuels and ethyl esters can serve as fragrance or flavoring compounds in the cosmetic industry. The enzymatic synthesis of these compounds is possible, but often enzymes need to be adapted to meet process requirements. This assay simplifies the identification of suitable enzymes. Moreover, substrate specificities of a lipase for a certain alcohol or acyl acceptor can also be easily studied with this assay. The formation of fatty acid ethyl esters from plant oil with ethanol catalyzed by lipase CAL-A can now be easily monitored spectrophotometrically with this assay. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Background: Residual oils were characterized according to their physicochemical properties, i.e. acidity, iodine value, peroxide value and saponification number, to evaluate the degradation level and viability for biodiesel production. Results: The methyl esters of fatty acids (FAME) from samples of residual bovine, chicken and soybean oils were quantified by using four transesterification methods, using acidic and basic catalysis and, gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Methods that used acidic catalysis at a lower temperature were the most efficient. Methyl biodiesel samples were synthesized by basic catalysis (KOH) for all quantified oils and the physicochemical properties of the biofuel were evaluated, i.e. viscosity, flash and fire points, density, water content, iodine and acidity numbers. Conclusions: The obtained results suggesting that it is possible to take advantage of these residues for biodiesel production as the obtained products were approved according to the rules established by the National Association of Petroleum (ANP); the bovine samples were the exception regarding moisture and acidity. © 2014 Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso.

AB  - The performance of a 118-kW tractor fuelled by pure biodiesel was monitored during a long-term field experiment with approximately 800 h of engine function. The objective was to demonstrate that B100, a pure biodiesel fuel, is a viable alternative to traditional diesel oil in terms of long-term mechanical reliability. A bench test on the new engine, performed by attaching a test stand to the power take-off of the tractor, showed an expected reduction in power (-9%) and torque (-7%) and an increase in specific consumption (+13%) when biodiesel was used as a complete substitute to diesel oil. Furthermore, with the same setup, the exhaust gas had a Bosch smoke index equal to 50% of the value for the same engine fuelled with diesel oil. After these initial tests, the tractor was set up for normal field operations, in which both the engine curves and lubricant quality were periodically monitored. These surveys indicated no significant reduction in engine performance; however, the lubricant was consequently diluted and contaminated by biodiesel, which caused the lubricant properties to considerably worsen. However, on the basis of the chemical-physical analysis, reducing the oil change interval from 200 h (manufacturer's indications for the engine when operating with diesel oil) to 100 h would compensate for this progressive quality decline. At the end of the trials, the engine was disassembled to check the condition of its components; wear and lacquer-like coating phenomena were observed, and their levels were acceptable. The obtained results demonstrated that B100 can effectively substitute for diesel oil in a standard compression-ignition engine: the power change is not perceptible during normal operation of a tractor, and no particular problem will arise in the engine during its life if the lubricant is changed every 100 h. © TÜBİTAK.

AB  - In this study, impacts of different element absence (nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus and magnesium) and supplementation (nitrogen and zinc) on element uptake and triacylglycerol production was followed in wild type Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CC-124 strain. Macro- and microelement composition of C. reinhardtii greatly differed under element regimes studied. In particular, heavy metal quotas of the microalgae increased strikingly under zinc supplementation. Growth was suppressed, cell biovolume, carbohydrate, total neutral lipid and triacylglycerol levels increased when microalgae were incubated under these element regimes. Most of the intracellular space was occupied by lipid bodies under all nutrient starvations, as observed by confocal microscopy and transmission electron micrographs. Results suggest that sulfur, magnesium and phosphorus deprivations are superior to nitrogen deprivation for the induction triacylglycerol production in C. reinhardtii. On the other hand, FAME profiles of the nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus deprived cells were found to meet the requirements of international standards for biodiesel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper investigated a novel hydrothermal liquefaction process of Chlorella pyrenoidosa catalyzed by Ce/HZSM-5. The chemical groups and components of the residues of C. pyrenoidosa were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer. The crystal structure and micro surface topography of C. pyrenoidosa before and after catalytic liquefaction were characterized by X-ray diffraction and Scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The experimental results showed that the catalytic cracking effects of Ce/HZSM-5 were superior to that of HZSM-5 as a liquefaction catalyst of C. pyrenoidosa. Compared with HZSM-5, Ce/HZSM-5 has a significantly enhanced Lewis acid active center, smaller particle size, larger specific surface, and highly dispersed Ce4O7 with trivalent and tetravalent cerium in the zeolite skeleton channel that accelerate the catalytic liquefaction of C. pyrenoidosa. The rare earth modified zeolite Ce/HZSM-5 exhibits good potential and a beneficial nature for the preparation of bio-oil from microalgae with high efficiency. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Identification of novel microalgal strains with high lipid productivity is one of the most important research topics in renewable biofuel research. However, the major bottleneck in the strain screening process is that currently known methods for the estimation of microalgal lipid are laborious and time-consuming. The present study successfully employed sulpho-phospho-vanillin (SPV) colorimetric method for direct quantitative measurement of lipids within liquid microalgal culture. The SPV reacts with lipids to produce a distinct pink color, and its intensity can be quantified using spectrophotometric methods by measuring absorbance at 530nm. This method was employed for a rapid quantification of intracellular lipid contents within Chlorella sp., Monoraphidium sp., Ettlia sp. and Nannochloropsis sp., all of which were found to have lipid contents ranging in between 10% and 30%. Subsequent analysis of the biomass using gas chromatography confirmed that our protocol is highly accurate (R2=0.99). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper studies methane production using a marine microalga, Nannochloropsis sp. residue from biodiesel production. Residue cake from Nannochloropsis, oils wet-extracted, had a methane potential of 482LCH4kg-1 volatile solids (VS) in batch assays. However, when dry-extracted, the methane potential of residue cake was only 194LCH4kg-1 VS. In semi-continuous reactor trials with dry-extracted residue cake, a thermophilic reactor produced 48% higher methane yield (220LCH4kg-1VS) than a mesophilic reactor (149LCH4kg-1VS). The thermophilic reactor was apparently inhibited due to ammonia with organic loading rate (OLR) of 2kgVSm-3d-1 (hydraulic retention time (HRT) 46d), whereas the mesophilic reactor performed with OLR of 3kgVSm-3d-1 (HRT 30d). Algal salt content did not inhibit digestion. Additional methane (18-33% of primary digester yield) was produced during 100d post-digestion. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Six species of marine and freshwater green macroalgae were cultivated in outdoor tanks and subsequently converted to biocrude through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) in a batch reactor. The influence of the biochemical composition of biomass on biocrude yield and composition was assessed. The freshwater macroalgae Oedogonium afforded the highest biocrude yield of all six species at 26.2%, dry weight (dw). Derbesia (19.7%dw) produced the highest biocrude yield for the marine species followed by Ulva (18.7%dw). In contrast to significantly different yields across species, the biocrudes elemental profiles were remarkably similar with higher heating values of 33-34MJkg-1. Biocrude productivity was highest for marine Derbesia (2.4gm-2d-1) and Ulva (2.1gm-2d-1), and for freshwater Oedogonium (1.3gm-2d-1). These species were therefore identified as suitable feedstocks for scale-up and further HTL studies based on biocrude productivity, as a function of biomass productivity and the yield of biomass conversion to biocrude. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The common industrial process of biodiesel production is a sequence of particular unit operations starting with raw material preparation, followed by transesterification reaction stage and ending with reaction mixture separation and treatment. The main product is biodiesel of prescribed quality while the treatment of glycerol and salt containing phase is carried out so that the by-products obtained maximize profitability of the entire undertaking. The biodiesel production process is often analysed by people of various profiles without proper engineering backgrounds, so that qualitative descriptions are prevailing in the literature. Opposite to that approach, promoted in this paper are the chemical engineering aspects of biodiesel production technology. That approach has not attracted adequate attention so far despite the eminently chemical engineering nature rather than the chemical nature of that process. This will be elaborated in a three-part series. In this, the first one, the necessity of replacing fossil fules with renewable fuels is explained and the biodiesel production put into that context. In particular, the characteristics of industrial biodiesel production are delineated along with the physical and chemical characteristics of homogeneously catalysed transesterification. The systematic approach to the scale-up procedure is described as well.

AB  - This study proposes a novel alternative for the utilization of whey permeate, a by-product stream from the dairy industry, as the feedstock for the biomass and lipid production of the microalgae Chlorella protothecoides. Glucose and galactose from the pre-hydrolyzed whey permeate were used as main carbon sources in a base mineral media for establishing batch and fed batch cultures. Batch cultures reached a biomass production of 9.1. ±. 0.2. g/L with a total lipid accumulation of 42.0. ±. 6.6% (dry weight basis), while in the fed batch cultures 17.2. ±. 1.3. g/L of biomass with 20.5. ±. 0.3% lipid accumulation (dry weight basis) were obtained. A third strategy for the direct utilization of whey permeate was investigated by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), wherein, 7.3. ±. 1.3. g/L of biomass with 49.9. ±. 3.3% lipid accumulation (dry weight basis) was obtained in batch mode using immobilized enzyme. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - EN 14103 is generally used for quantification of ester content in biodiesel free of heptadecanoate ester (C17:0) or methyl nonadecanoate (C19:0), which are employed as internal standards. It was observed that ester content obtained by EN 14103 method did not match with theoretical value of biodiesel, as the method did not take care of response factors of each component to compensate for changes in detector sensitivities. In this study, the whole range of fatty acid (C6-C24:1) methyl esters have been taken into consideration for the calculation of the ester content. Methyl nonadecanoate (C19:0) was used as an internal standard. The response factors of both the saturated and unsaturated methyl esters in the range C6-C 24:1 were estimated and found in the range 0.97-1.16. The ester content was calculated after applying the response factors of each methyl ester. The results obtained by this method agreed well with the theoretical value as compared to estimated value using EN14103 method. The results obtained from this method also show good correlation (R 2 = 0.98) with 1H-NMR method. Further, this method does not depend on nature of biodiesel feed stock and is applicable to all methyl biodiesel samples obtained from different raw materials. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In the recent years, the studies concerning the cultivation of Neochloris oleoabundans for biofuel purposes have increased, in relation to its capability to accumulate lipids when grown under nutrient starvation. Unfortunately, this cultivation mode does not allow to reach high biomass densities, which are required to improve the feasibility of the process. Increasing knowledge of the microalgal physiology is necessary to obtain new useful information for the improvement of culture performance in the perspective of large-scale cultivation. In this work, the mixotrophic cultivation of N. oleoabundans in a brackish medium added with different glucose concentrations has been tested under shaking, with the aim of stimulating growth alongside lipid accumulation inside cells. Cell morphology, glucose consumption, photosynthetic pigment content and photosynthetic efficiency were also investigated. Among all tested glucose concentrations (0-30 g L-1), it was observed that 2.5 g L-1 was the optimal concentration, allowing to obtain the best compromise between glucose supplement, biomass production and lipid accumulation. Growth was highly enhanced in mixotrophic cultures, linked to the release of cells from sporocysts. A unique feature characterising mixotrophy in N. oleoabundans was the promotion of the maximum quantum yield of Photosystem II. Moreover, when mixotrophic cells entered the stationary phase, high lipid accumulation was induced. This study shows that the addition of glucose to N. oleoabundans remarkably increases the production of biomass enriched in lipids and represents an advancement for the cultivation of this microalga for applied purposes. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - To date, researchers have expressed increasing interest in the potential of using microalgae as a biofuel feedstock and technological solution for CO2 sequestration. Microalgae-derived biodiesel production is one of the best choices for biofuels production, since microalgae have substantial amounts of lipids which can be used for biodiesel conversion. Nonetheless, after the production of algal biodiesel, large quantities of residuals or post-extracts are left over, threatening environmental hygiene if not disposed of appropriately. In this respect, it is critical that the utilization of these remnants is taken into account in an effort to make microalgal biodiesel sustainable. This paper evaluates the theoretical biodiesel, ethanol, and methane yields and the relative calorific values in the production chain of algal biofuels. It is found that fermentation and anaerobic digestion of microalgae residuals are two steps which could assist in dealing with the problem of algal waste, as well as the economic and energetic balance of such a promising technology. It also discusses in detail the potential of the continuous conversion of algal residuals into ethanol and methane, with particular focus on the energetic interest, and nitrogen and phosphorus recycling. Key technical issues related to fermentation and anaerobic digestion are indentified, the strategies to improve their production highlighted, and the necessity of producing algal biodiesel and/or ethanol discussed. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Catalytic transformation of bio-oil into higher olefins can provide valuable bio-fuels and chemicals used in the manufacture of high-octane gasoline, detergents, plasticizers and other petrochemicals. This work explores the production of higher olefins from bio-oil through catalytic cracking of bio-oil along with light olefins oligomerization. RESULTS: For bio-oil catalytic cracking, the olefins yield reached 43.8 C-mol% with near-complete bio-oil conversion. The oxygenated organic compounds in bio-oil go through deoxygenation, cracking and hydrogen transfer reactions and form light olefins over the zeolite acid sites. For the oligomerization of light olefins, the highest selectivity and yield of C5+ olefins over the LTGO catalyst reached 85.4 C-mol% and 326.7 g kg-1cata h-1, respectively. Main products below 300°C were C6=-C12= olefins, originating from light olefin oligomerization. The influences of the reaction conditions were investigated in detail, and the reaction mechanism was addressed. CONCLUSION: Bio-oil can be catalytically converted to C2=-C4= light olefins over HZSM-5, and further selectively transformed to C5+ high olefins via the oligomerization of light olefins over LTGO. The transformation of bio-oil to higher olefins may be useful for the production of bio-fuels and high value chemicals using renewable biomass. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Jerusalem artichoke was investigated as a cheap substrate for the heterotrophic production using a lab yeast strain Cryptococcus sp. Using Response Surface Method, 54.0% of fructose yield was achieved at 12% of dried Jerusalem artichoke powder, 0.57% of nitric acid concentration, 117. °C of reaction temperature, and 49. min of reaction time. At this optimal condition, nitric acid showed the best catalytic activity toward inulin hydrolysis and also the resulting fructose hydrolyte supported the highest microbial growth compared with other acids. In addition, lipid productivity of 1.73. g/L/d was achieved, which is higher than a defined medium using pure fructose as a substrate. Lipid quality was also found to be generally satisfactory as a feedstock for fuel, demonstrating Jerusalem artichoke could indeed be a good and cheap option for the purpose of biodiesel production. © 2013.

AB  - Wastes produced by oil/water separation at the wastewater treatment plant of Bari West (Southern Italy) were taken, characterized and converted. About 12% of this material was composed of greases, mainly made of free fatty acids (50%) and soaps (34%), and was easily separable by the aqueous phase through a hot centrifugation. After chemical activation of this fatty fraction, a direct esterification was carried out under very mild conditions (320K and atmospheric pressure), converting more than 90% of the original free fatty acids into the respective methyl esters in less than 4h, by using AlCl3·6H2O. The activation energy correlated to the use of this catalyst was also calculated (Eaest=43.9kJmol-1). The very low cost of the biodiesel produced (0.45€L-1) and the associated relevant specific energy (5.02MJ kgFAMEs-1) make such a process a really sustainable and effective example of valorization of a waste. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Major efforts in bioenergy research have focused on producing fuels that can directly replace petroleum-derived gasoline and diesel fuel through metabolic engineering of microbial fatty acid biosynthetic pathways. Typically, growth and pathway induction are conducted under aerobic conditions, but for operational efficiency in an industrial context, anaerobic culture conditions would be preferred to obviate the need to maintain specific dissolved oxygen concentrations and to maximize the proportion of reducing equivalents directed to biofuel biosynthesis rather than ATP production. A major concern with fermentative growth conditions is elevated NADH levels, which can adversely affect cell physiology. The purpose of this study was to identify homologs of Escherichia coli FabG, an essential reductase involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, that display a higher preference for NADH than for NADPH as a cofactor. Four potential NADH-dependent FabG variants were identified through bioinformatic analyses supported by crystallographic structure determination (1.3- to 2.0-Å resolution). In vitro assays of cofactor (NADH/ NADPH) preference in the four variants showed up to~35-fold preference for NADH, which was observed with the Cupriavidus taiwanensis FabG variant. In addition, FabG homologs were overexpressed in fatty acid- and methyl ketone-overproducing E. coli host strains under anaerobic conditions, and the C. taiwanensis variant led to a 60% higher free fatty acid titer and 75% higher methyl ketone titer relative to the titers of the control strains. With further engineering, this work could serve as a starting point for establishing a microbial host strain for production of fatty acid-derived biofuels (e.g., methyl ketones) under anaerobic conditions. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Between 2004 and 2007, NGOs, community based organisations and private investors promoted jatropha in Kenya with the aim of generating additional income and producing biofuel for rural development. By 2008 it became gradually evident that jatropha plantations (both mono- and intercropping) are uneconomical and risky due to competition for land and labour with food crops. Cultivation of jatropha hedges was found to have better chances of economic success and to present only little risks for the adopting farmers. Still, after 2008 a number of farmers went on adopting jatropha in plots rather than as hedges. It is hypothesised that lack of awareness about the low economic prospects of jatropha plantations was the main reason for continued adoption, and that smallholder farmers with higher resource endowments mainly ventured into its cultivation.In this study we provide an empirical basis for understanding the role of households' capital assets in taking up new livelihood strategies by smallholder farmers in three rural districts in Kenya. For that purpose, we assess the motivation and enabling factors that led to the adoption of jatropha as a new livelihood strategy, as well as the context in which promotion and adoption took place. A household survey was conducted in 2010, using a structured questionnaire, to collect information on household characteristics and capital asset endowment. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and non-parametric statistical tests.We established that access to additional income and own energy supply were the main motivation for adoption of jatropha, and that financial capital assets do not necessarily have a positive influence on adoption as hypothesised. Further, we found that the main challenges that adopting farmers faced were lack of access to information on good management practices and lack of a reliable market. We conclude that continued adoption of on-farm jatropha after 2008 is a result of lacking awareness about the low economic value of this production type. We recommend abandoning on-farm production of jatropha until improved seed material and locally adapted agronomic knowledge about jatropha cultivation becomes available and its production becomes economically competitive. © 2013 .

AB  - A techno-economic analysis of mild catalytic pyrolysis (CP) of woody biomass followed by upgrading of the partially deoxygenated pyrolysis liquid is performed to assess this pathway's economic feasibility for the production of hydrocarbon-based biofuels. The process achieves a fuel yield of 17.7 wt% and an energy conversion of 39%. Deoxygenation of the pyrolysis liquid requires 2.7 wt% hydrogen while saturation of aromatic rings in the pyrolysis liquid increases total hydrogen consumption to 6.4 wt%. Total project investment is $457 million with annual operating costs of $142 million for a 2000 metric ton per day facility. A minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of $3.69 per gal is estimated assuming 10% internal rate of return. Twenty-nine percent of the capital outlay is the result of including a co-generation system to consume heat generated from burning part of the off-gases from pyrolysis and upgrading and all of the coke during regeneration of catalysts. Forty-five percent of the MFSP arises from the cost of biomass feedstock. Hydrogen required for the upgrading process is generated using the balance of the process off-gases. The analysis reveals that an optimum design would include a cogeneration unit; however using natural gas for hydrogen generation is more favorable than using process off-gases as the feed. An uncertainty analysis indicates a probable fuel price of $3.03 per gal, demonstrating the potential of the CP pathway as an alternative to petroleum-derived transportation fuels. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The authors discuss occurrence of heterotrophic microbes, specifically bacteria, yeast, and molds, in biodiesel production is well discussed. Besides, these oleaginous microorganisms are reported to accumulate triacylglycerols (TAGs) that contain long-chain fatty acids. Most of the evidence suggests that TAGs accumulated are suitable for biodiesel production. Lipid accumulation (de novo or ex novo) required a set of enzymes and expression of various genes that are under complex regulatory system. The authors take a step in this direction and provides a summary of the actual knowledge on heterotrophic oleaginous species, their fatty acids, TAGs, and sterol biosynthesis with a biochemical and genetic approaches to better understand their regulation. Likewise, the impact of abiotic factors that can contribute to higher lipid accumulation is summarized. This review also highlights various issues concerning genetic engineering that may contribute to an advanced path forward for microbial feedstock-based biodiesel. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - 1,3-Propanediol (1,3-PDO) was produced from glycerol in three parallel Expanded Granular Sludge Blanket (EGSB) reactors inoculated with granular sludge (control reactor-R1), heat-treated granular sludge (R2) and disrupted granular sludge (R3) at hydraulic retention times (HRT) between 3 and 24h. Maximum 1,3-PDO yield (0.52molmol-1) and productivity (57gL-1d-1) were achieved in R1 at HRTs of 12 and 3h, respectively. DGGE profiling of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments showed that variations in the HRT had a critical impact in the dominant community of microorganisms. However, no appreciable differences in the bacterial population were observed between R2 and R3 at low HRTs. Production of H2 was observed at the beginning of the operation, but no methane production was observed. This study proves the feasibility of 1,3-PDO production in EGSB reactors and represents a novel strategy to valorise glycerol generated in the biodiesel industry. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising source of renewable energy and valuable chemicals. It is abundant in several forms which may be pyrolyzed to give gases, condensates and char. The condensed liquid obtained through pyrolysis is popularly called bio-oil from which valuable chemicals may be derived in a well defined manner. Chemically, this liquid is a complex mixture of simple organic, inorganic and macromolecular compounds formed through thermo-chemical breakdown of lignocellulosic biomass. High oxygen content is responsible for its low gross calorific value which renders it useless for fuel applications however; upgrading processes aimed at reducing oxygenates potentially increase its usage at par with fossil fuels. Fast and efficient analytical methods have revealed huge amount of informations from biomass and pyrolysis liquids hence a key component in organizing research in this area. Owing to the high compositional complexity and diversity in bio-oils originating from different sources, generalized analytical procedures are very difficult to formulate. However, tools of analytical chemistry have helped in understanding the underlying mechanisms involved in production and upgrading of bio-oils at molecular levels. With the possibility of commercial large scale production plants coming up in Europe, concerns with bio-oil quality, stability and upgrading rely strongly on analytical approaches. With this review we have tried to present outcomes of important research related to chemical analysis of bio-oils. The discussion is intended to summarize role of prominent analytical techniques in the chemical characterization of bio-oils. On this basis, optimum sample preparation strategies have also been proposed along with the rationale behind analysis with conclusions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The potential of microwave-assisted pyrolysis of rapeseed oil was evaluated in this study, based on understanding the fundamental interactions of oils with microwaves and evaluation of the product yield and composition. The pyrolysis of unused rapeseed oil (virgin oil) and simulated waste oil (SWO) was carried out using conventional and microwave-assisted heating in batch reactors. Temperatures of 500, 550 and 600 C and 300-500 W microwave power were used for conventional and microwave heating respectively. Addition of 10% (w/w) HSZM-5 catalyst was also studied. The dielectric loss factor of both oil and catalyst are low, between 0.001 and 0.12, however it is possible to heat the material without the aid of microwave absorbers and this represents a key step change compared with previous studies. High conversions (70-97%) of virgin oil and SWO into gas and liquid products were achieved in conventional heating. Organic liquid products (OLP) and light bio-oil are favoured at the intermediate temperature of 550 C. Addition of catalyst did not significantly increase the conversion but increased OLP and light bio-oil yields, although there is little difference between the two oils studied. The OLP produced is within the diesel fuel range with both fractions (light and heavy bio-oils) comprising of alkanes, alkenes (between C9 and C26) and medium to long-chain fatty acids. Addition of catalyst produced an appreciable quantity of aromatic compounds and fewer acids. The condensate from microwave pyrolysis consists of aromatics, C7-C29 alkanes, cyclo-alkanes, alkenes and cyclo-alkenes; dienes, acids and other heavy oxygenated products. Interestingly, significant numbers of aromatic compounds relative to conventional treatment were detected in the microwave pyrolysis treatment. The aromatics were also found in the residual oil after microwave treatment, whereas none were found with conventional pyrolysis. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigates the thermal decomposition behavior of cottonseed via TGA/FT-IR/MS and the quantification/characterization of liquid products from fast pyrolysis. Thermal degradation of the biomass sample has occurred in four steps, corresponding to the removal of moisture, decomposition of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin and it was completed at about 700 C. The main gaseous products evolved were CO2, light hydrocarbons and H2O. For the fast pyrolysis experiments, particular investigated process variables were temperature (400-700 C), heating rate (5-700 C min-1) and nitrogen gas flow rate (100-800 cm3 min-1). Maximum oil yield was attained at 500 C with a yield of 49.5% under 200 cm3 min -1 nitrogen flow rate and at a heating rate of 300 C min -1. Bio-oil obtained at optimum conditions are separated into its fractions by column chromatography. The oil and its sub-fractions were characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, and GC/MS. The char was characterized with elemental analysis and FT-IR techniques. The aliphatic sub-fraction of the obtained bio-oil contains predominantly straight chain of n-alkanes and alkenes. According to the chemical characterization, the bio-oil can be utilized as conventional liquid fuels. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study integrates material based Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) with welfare economic Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) to evaluate resource and environmental consequences as well as welfare consequences for society of introducing biofuels in the Danish road transport sector. The integrated method focus on fossil energy consumption, CO2 emissions and total welfare economic changes within the whole LCA flow chain comprising both production of biomass and subsequent conversion into biofuel and combustion in vehicles. With regard to consequences for fossil energy consumption a global delimitation is used whereas only CO2 emissions and welfare economic consequences within Danish borders are included in the analysis. Consequently, calculated emission and welfare economic consequences can be interpreted as the consequences for Denmark of producing and using biofuels from biomass grown on Danish farm land. The method is applied with regard to production of rape diesel (rape methyl ester, RME), 1st generation ethanol from wheat and 2nd generation ethanol based on straw. Advantages and disadvantages of the LCA based material flow approach and the welfare economic based CBA approach are discussed. The influence of uncertainties on the results is evaluated illustrating the importance of paying attention to assumptions with regard to substitution of other products and resources and with regard to their relative prices. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The understanding of the genetic diversity and structure of populations of Jatropha curcas in their postulated centre of origin will permit to identify genetic material useful for future improvement of the species. Although it is estimated that Mexico is the likely centre of origin and domestication of J. curcas, so far the "true" centre of origin still has to be found. A representative set of 175 accessions of J. curcas from nine central and southeastern Mexican states (Chiapas, Veracruz, Oaxaca, Michoacán, Morelos, Yucatán, Guerrero, Hidalgo and Puebla), including toxic, non-toxic, and contrasting protein and oil content genotypes was used for diversity analysis by AFLP markers. The results indicate that Mexico has a high genetic diversity of J. curcas; molecular analysis suggests population structuring in the different states where this species is spread. The germplasm from Chiapas, where contrasting protein and oil content genotypes were detected, showed the highest genetic diversity and clearly varies from the accessions from the other states. This is probably the most comprehensive study of diversity of germplasm of J. curcas from Mexico, and together with previous reports on the genetic diversity, biochemistry, morphology and germplasm agronomics of J. curcas from Chiapas, suggest the likelihood that this area is the centre of origin for this species and that domestication took place in the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico, such as Veracruz, Hidalgo, Puebla and Yucatán, where genotypes with low or no phorbol ester content exist. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study is focused on the use of biodiesel in a liquid fuel heating boiler of 26.7kW. The influence of biodiesel/diesel mixtures, air flow rate, and input pressure on a combustion process for heating purposes was analyzed. The study is divided into two parts. The first one deals with the characteristics of biodiesel as a heating fuel and the analysis of its properties and preparation method. The biodiesel was produced from sunflower oil in a pilot plant of 250L/charge and was characterized according to standard norms. It was found that biodiesel is not acceptable as fuel for internal combustion engines (ester content of 92%). The second one deals with the effect of the operating variables on the combustion parameters in the boiler. The tests were conducted on experimental facilities and the generated emissions were analyzed. It was found that increasing the input burner pressure involves a decrease in CO and O2 and an increase of CO2 in the fumes, as well as an increase in the combustion process yield. Likewise, a greater air flow rate gives rise to a decrease in the latter parameter. Moreover, CO emissions were slightly higher when biodiesel content was increased in the mixture, and therefore the combustion yield decreased. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fuel blends that contain biodiesel are known to produce greater NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions in diesel engine exhaust than regular diesel, and this is one of the key barriers to the wider adoption of biodiesel as an alternative fuel. In this study, a water-containing ABE (acetone-butanol-ethanol) solution, which simulates products that are produced from biomass fermentation without dehydration processing, was tested as a biodiesel-diesel blend additive to lower NOx emissions from diesel engines. The energy efficiency and the PM (particulate matter) and PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) emissions were investigated and compared under various operating conditions. Although biodiesel had greater NOx emissions, the blends that contained 25% of the water-containing ABE solution had significantly lower NOx (4.30-30.7%), PM (10.9-63.1%), and PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) emissions (26.7-67.6%) than the biodiesel-diesel blends and regular diesel, respectively. In addition, the energy efficiency of this new blend was 0.372-7.88% higher with respect to both the biodiesel-diesel blends and regular diesel. Because dehydration and surfactant addition are not necessary, the application of ABE-biodiesel-diesel blends can simplify fuel production processes, reduce energy consumption, and lower pollutant emissions, meaning that the ABE-biodiesel-diesel blend is a promising green fuel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study compares a traditional agricultural approach to minimise N pollution of groundwater (incorporation of crop residues) with applications of small amounts of biodiesel co-product (BCP) to arable soils. Loss of N from soil to the aqueous phase was shown to be greatly reduced in the laboratory, mainly by decreasing concentrations of dissolved nitrate-N. Increases in soil microbial biomass occurred within 4 days of BCP application - indicating rapid adaptation of the soil microbial community. Increases in biomass-N suggest that microbes were partly mechanistic in the immobilisation of N in soil. Straw, meadow-grass and BCP were subsequently incorporated into experimental soil mesocosms of depth equal to plough layer (23 cm), and placed in an exposed netted tunnel to simulate field conditions. Leachate was collected after rainfall between the autumn of 2009 and spring of 2010. Treatment with BCP resulted in less total-N transferred from soil to water over the entire period, with 32.1, 18.9, 13.2 and 4.2 mg N kg-1 soil leached cumulatively from the control, grass, straw and BCP treatments, respectively. More than 99 % of nitrate leaching was prevented using BCP. Accordingly, soils provided with crop residues or BCP showed statistically significant increases in soil N and C compared to the control (no incorporation). Microbial biomass, indicated by soil ATP concentration, was also highest for soils given BCP (p &lt; 0.05). These results indicate that field-scale incorporation of BCP may be an effective method to reduce nitrogen loss from agricultural soils, prevent nitrate pollution of groundwater and augment the soil microbial biomass. © 2014 The Author(s).

AB  - A batch composting study was performed to evaluate effects of biochar addition on dynamics of microbial community and changes of key physic-chemical properties during composting of tomato stalk and chicken manure. As a comparison, two amendments of peat bog and zeolite were selected. The results indicated that biochar addition for composting showed a shorter time to enter thermophilic phase (3 d) and a higher temperature (56. °C) and longer duration of thermophilic phase compared to that of peat bog addition, zeolite addition and raw composts. The highest C/N ratio and volatile fatty acids' concentration with biochar addition were obtained. Biochar addition also showed more influence on bacterial community changes than that of peat bog and zeolite. Thus, biochar addition could significantly affect physic-chemical process and microbial community diversity on tomato stalk and chicken manure composting. This study provides valuable information for improving composting and a better understanding of biodegradation processes. © 2013.

AB  - Sr-Al mixed oxides nanocomposite as Sr3Al2O6 was prepared by sol-gel method and used as a basic heterogeneous catalyst for transesterification of soybean oil to methyl esters (biodiesel) by methanol. The prepared catalyst was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission electron microscope (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA/DTA), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and nitrogen adsorption-desorption techniques. The response surface methodology (RSM) based on the Box-Behnken design was employed to investigate the effects of methanol to oil molar ratio, reaction time, catalyst amount and specifically the effect of interaction between process variables on the conversion of oil to biodiesel. Results from this study revealed that individual as well as bilateral variables interactions significantly affect the yield of biodiesel. With this information, it was found that utilization of methanol to oil molar ratio of 25 and 1.3wt.% of catalyst within reaction time of 61min and gave the biodiesel yield of 95.7±0.5%. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A green technology of biodiesel production focuses on the use of enzymes as the catalyst. In enzymatic biodiesel synthesis, suitable solvent system is very essential to reduce the inhibition effects of the solvent to the enzymes. This study produced ethanol-based biodiesel from a low-cost sludge palm oil (SPO) using locally-produced Candida cylindracea lipase from fermentation of palm oil mill effluent (POME) based medium. The optimum levels of ethanol-to-SPO molar ratio and enzyme loading were found to be 4:1 and 10. U/25. g of SPO respectively with 54.4% w/w SPO yield of biodiesel and 21.7% conversion of free fatty acid (FFA) into biodiesel. Addition of tert-butanol at 2:1 tert-butanol-to-SPO molar ratio into the ethanol-solvent system increased the yield of biodiesel to 71.6% w/w SPO and conversion of FFA into biodiesel to 28.8%. The SPO and ethanol have promising potential for the production of renewable biodiesel using enzymatic-catalyzed esterification and transesterification. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work addresses a reliable in situ transesterification process which integrates lipid extraction from wet microalgae, and its conversion to biodiesel, with a yield higher than 90. wt.%. This process enables single-step production of biodiesel from microalgae by mixing wet microalgal cells with solvent, methanol, and acid catalyst; and then heating them in one pot. The effects of reaction parameters such as reaction temperature, wet cell weight, reaction time, and catalyst volume on the conversion yield are investigated. This simultaneous extraction and transesterification of wet microalgae may enable a significant reduction in energy consumption by eliminating the drying process of algal cells and realize the economic production of biodiesel using wet microalgae. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Lipids are an increasingly important chemical feedstock for the manufacture of biofuels, bioplastics, care products and as a food source. Developing sustainable sources of lipids, derived from oleaginous microbes, is therefore a key scientific challenge. Methodology: Design of Experiments was used to optimize the lipid production and lipid profile. Results: Here we successfully apply Design of Experiments to optimize the lipid profile in Rhodotorula glutinis to tailor the fatty acid profile. A high culture temperature and high nitrogen ratio yielded a mainly monounsaturated oil, while low temperatures and high glucose loadings gave a more saturated profile. Conclusions: On transesterification, the oil high in monounsaturated esters yielded biodiesel with fuel properties akin to rapeseed methyl ester, whereas the oil high in saturates was found to be suitable as a substitute for palm oil. © 2014 Future Science Ltd.

AB  - The performance of oil expression from Jatropha curcas L. (Jatropha) seeds using a pilot scale continuous screw press was studied. The influence of seed pre-treatment, i.e. whole, crushed and deshelled seeds, screw-press operational settings (shaft rotational speed and press cake outlet section) was investigated. For each experiment, the material flows (seeds, press cake and crude oil) were measured and analysed for their oil, water and solids contents. The behaviour of oil expression was very sensitive to seeds preparation. It was shown that for whole seeds, a good reproducibility was obtained, whereas for crushed or deshelled seeds, heterogeneity of the feed led to unsteady pressing conditions and important discrepancies in the performance. The presence of seed shells contributes to build a porous solid matrix which favours oil flow through the press cake. For whole seeds, a correlation between oil recovery and seed throughput was proposed. The mass balance consistency was carefully analysed and oil yield was determined using a direct and an indirect method. A good linear correlation between seed and press cake throughputs was observed: the seed throughput is always divided in a stream of crude oil and a stream of press cake in the same proportion. This important result shows that the residual oil in press cake and the amount of solids carried by the oil are directly related and determine the efficacy of the separation. Thus, for a given screw press and feed material, the oil sediment content can be predicted knowing the oil recovery. The energy consumption during pressing was measured and modelled as a function of oil recovery and seeds oil content. The specific mechanical energy for oil expression was less than 5% of the energy content of the oil and a minimum mechanical energy requirement was generally observed at oil recoveries between 70% and 80%. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Crude glycerol, also known as glycerin, is the main byproduct of the biodiesel industry. It has been estimated that up to 40,000. tons of glycerin will be produced each year by 2020. This study evaluated the value-added use of crude glycerol derived from soybean biodiesel preparation as a carbon source for heterologous protein production using the yeast Pichia pastoris. Eleven glycerin samples were obtained by methanolysis of soybean oil using different acids or bases as catalysts. Cell growth experiments showed that crude glycerol containing either potassium or sodium hydroxide resulted in 1.5-2 times higher final cell densities when compared to glycerol P.A. Finally, crude glycerol containing sodium hydroxide was successfully utilized for constitutive heterologous α-amylase production in P. pastoris. This study demonstrated that crude glycerol without any purification steps may be directly used as carbon source for protein production in P. pastoris. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Crude glycerol (CG) from biodiesel production is often contaminated with several compounds, including saponified fatty acids (SFAs). Photofermentative growth of Rhodopseudomonas palustris on glycerol leads to hydrogen production; however, R. palustris is inhibited by SFAs. This study examines inhibition of R. palustris by SFAs, finding that, with increasing concentration of SFA, growth rate falls, reaching zero at an SFA concentration of 0.2. mM. Methods for purifying CG were examined, namely (i) treatment with ethanol and activated carbon, (ii) pH adjustment, (iii) solvent extraction, and (iv) precipitation of the fatty acids with calcium. The rates of growth and production of hydrogen were investigated using CG treated by these methods. It was found that treatment with activated carbon, pH reduction, and calcium precipitation reduced inhibition, while solvent extraction was effective only when used in conjunction with pH adjustment. These treatments allow crude glycerol to be used for hydrogen production by R. palustris. © 2013.

AB  - Bio-oils derived from lignocellulosic materials have poor properties for use as fuels and cannot be blended with transportation fuels. Hydrotreating is an effective method for eliminating contaminants and saturating double bonds. This article is one of the few that report the hydrotreatment of a biomass-derived oil over a sulfided NiMo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and the deactivation of the catalyst. The results confirm that hydrotreatment is an effective technology for improving the quality of bio-oil. The total acid number of the upgraded bio-oil decreased from 23 mg KOH g -1 (raw bio-oil) to 2 mg KOH g-1. Oxygenated functional groups are removed, light liquid products are generated and carbon double bonds are saturated. The catalyst can become deactivated at a high operating temperature due to severe coke deposition. The deactivated catalyst was studied by using multiple analytical methods such as TEM, XRD, BET and TPO to study the deactivation pathways. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - A systematic approach for heat integration into an eco-industrial park through an integrated trigeneration system is presented. The approach is based on a new superstructure formulated as a multiobjective mixed-integer nonlinear programming model, where intraplant and interplant heat exchange for the process streams is allowed, in addition to the energy integration into the utility system that is constituted by a steam Rankine cycle (to produce electric power and hot utility), an organic Rankine cycle (to recover waste heat and produce electric power), and an absorption refrigeration cycle (to recover waste heat and provide refrigeration). To run the utility system, several external heat sources (solar, fossil fuels, and biofuels) are considered, which impact the economic, environmental, and social objectives considered in the model. A systematic approach to tradeoff the objectives considered is presented. Two examples are presented, where the advantages of the integrated eco-industrial park are shown. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Higher alcohols such as n-butanol and n-hexanol have higher energy density than ethanol, are more compatible with current fuel infrastructure, and can be upgraded to jet and diesel fuels. Several organisms are known to convert syngas to ethanol, but very few can produce higher alcohols alone. As a potential solution, mixed culture fermentation between the syngas fermenting Alkalibaculum bacchi strain CP15 and propionic acid producer Clostridium propionicum was studied. The monoculture of CP15 produced only ethanol from syngas without initial addition of organic acids to the fermentation medium. However, the mixed culture produced ethanol, n-propanol and n-butanol from syngas. The addition of propionic acid, butyric acid and hexanoic acid to the mixed culture resulted in a 50% higher conversion efficiency of these acids to their respective alcohols compared to CP15 monoculture. These findings illustrate the great potential of mixed culture syngas fermentation in production of higher alcohols. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This analysis quantifies the economic feasibility of cellulosic biofuel pathways under fossil fuel price uncertainty. Eight pathway scenarios are developed on the basis of existing techno-economic analyses and projected fossil fuel commodity prices from the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) 2010 Annual Energy Outlook (AEO). A 20-year net present value (NPV) is then calculated for each pathway scenario. Uncertainty distributions are developed for each pathway scenario by fitting historical monthly price variance distribution curves for each fossil fuel commodity to their projected annual prices. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is completed by replacing the EIA's AEO 2010 projected prices with those from its AEO 2013, the latter incorporating recent exploitation of U.S. shale gas reserves into its projections. The results of this analysis indicate that fast pyrolysis scenarios see the greatest increase in estimated NPV value followed by gasification and acetic acid synthesis scenarios. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis scenarios remain largely unaffected by the updated EIA projections. Methanol-to-gasoline and enzymatic hydrolysis NPVs decrease as a result of lower projections for fossil fuel prices. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Industrial attention on the seeds of Ricinus communis plant is mainly due to its hydroxylated fatty acid content. With use of Novozym 435 the methanolysis of castor oil for biolubricant synthesis was studied. Modeling of this production was performed using artificial neural network (ANN), where the architecture of the neural net was built by incorporating the four test factors as the input layer, methyl ester yield as the response variable, and one hidden layer with different numbers of the constructed neurons. The final selected model (4-11-1) with considering appropriate transfer function and learning rule, exhibited a good prediction capability with a high linear correlation coefficient of 0.9964 and a low mean squared error for the data testing. NMR analysis on the extracted castor oil and its methyl ester derivative were used to characterize the progress of the reaction. Methyl ester yield around 98% was obtained for methanol to the oil molar ratio of 6 using 5% of the enzyme at 42. °C after 39. h of the reaction. The Novozym 435 was reusable and performed effectively in castor oil conversion as shown in the repeated batch experiments. The produced biolubricant was evaluated based on the standardized physicochemical properties. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The growth improvement of microalgal strains in municipal secondary-treated wastewater by addition of nutrient-rich activated sludge centrate liquor was examined. Two strains (Chlorella luteoviridis and Parachlorella hussii) were tolerant to liquor, with addition of 25% liquor providing the best growth, biomass productivity and nutrient removal values. The capability of C. luteoviridis and P. hussii for full seasonal cultivation in a 150. L open pond in a temperate climate was studied, using the optimised secondary wastewater +25% liquor medium. Each strain was capable of growth all year including in autumn and winter but with strongest growth, productivity and remediation characteristics in the summer and spring. Both strains could maintain monoculture growth with no significant contamination or culture crash, demonstrating the robustness of these strains for wastewater cultivation in a northern European climate. Each strain could also be efficiently cultivated in a semi-continuous system for steady production of biomass and nutrient removal. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper investigates the anti-knock properties of biofuels that can be produced from microorganism metabolic processes. The biofuels are rated using Research Octane Number (RON) and Blending Research Octane Number (BRON), which determine their potential as additives for fuel in spark ignition (SI) engines. Tests were conducted using a single-cylinder Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine and performance of the biofuels was compared to primary reference fuels (PRFs). The investigated fuels include 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol, 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol, 2-methylpropan-1-ol (isobutanol), and limonene. Results show that 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol, 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol, and 2-methylpropan-1-ol (isobutanol) sufficiently improve the anti-knock properties of gasoline. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Diesohol fuel is a mixture of diesel and bioethanol fuels in which the ratio of bioethanol is less than 15%. In this research work, performance of a tractor engine (Massey Ferguson 399) using diesohol fuel was investigated. In these circumstances, the concentration of UHC and CO2 emissions in the exhaust pipe were measured and analyzed. The engine was run at several speeds (1600-2000rpm). The obtained results reveal that, when using diesohol fuels, the power and torque of the MF-399 tractor engine are increased by 3.17-8.50% and 1.75-10.28% respectively when compared to diesel fuel. This is due to a relatively more complete combustion of ethanol because of its high oxygen content. The fuel consumption and specific fuel consumption are also increased by 7.32-15.81% and 4.37-7.44% respectively due to low calorific value of ethanol compared to diesel fuel. The analysis showed that when diesohol is used, the rate of UHC is decreased but CO2 emission is increased. In brief, by using diesohol fuels, especially E6 blend in comparison to diesel fuel, engine performance and emissions are improved without any changes in engine structure for diesohol application. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Three potential future scenarios of expanded global biofuel production are presented here utilizing the GCAM integrated assessment model. These scenarios span a range that encompasses on the low end a continuation of existing biofuel production policies to two scenarios that would require an expansion of current targets as well as an extension of biofuels targets to other regions of the world. Conventional oil use is reduced by 4-8% in the expanded biofuel scenarios, which results in a decrease of in CO2 emissions on the order of 1-2 GtCO2/year by mid-century from the global transportation sector. The regional distribution of crop production is relatively unaffected, but the biofuels targets do result in a marked increase in the production of conventional crops used for energy. Producer prices of sugar and corn reach levels about 12% and 7% above year 2005 levels, while the increased competition for land causes the price of food crops such as wheat, although not used for bioenergy in this study, to increase by 1-2%. The amount of land devoted to growing all food crops and dedicated bioenergy crops is increased by about 10% by 2050 in the High biofuel case, with concurrent decreases in other uses of land such as forest and pasture. In both of the expanded biofuels cases studied, there is an increase in net cumulative carbon emissions for the first couple of decades due to these induced land use changes. However, the difference in net cumulative emissions from the biofuels expansion decline by about 2035 as the reductions in energy system emissions exceed further increases in emissions from land use change. Even in the absence of a policy that would limit emissions from land use change, the differences in net cumulative emissions from the biofuels scenarios reach zero by 2050, and are decreasing further over time in both cases. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The esterification of oleic acid in the presence of magnetic ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroferrate ([BMIM][FeCl4]) at reaction temperature of 65°C has been investigated. Artificial neural network-genetic algorithm (ANN-GA) was used to simultaneously optimized methyl oleate yield and oleic acid conversion for the reaction. It was found that optimum responses for both yield and conversion were 83.4%, which can be achieved using molar ratio methanol-oleic acid of 22:1, catalyst loading of 0.003mol and reaction time at 3.6h. Esterification of oleic acid at optimum condition using recycled [BMIM][FeCl4] registered not much loss in catalytic activity after six successive runs. Kinetic study indicated that the reaction followed a pseudo-first order reaction, with activation energy and pre-activation energy of 17.97kJ/mol and 181.62min-1, respectively. These values were relatively low compared to homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts for esterification of oleic acid. Thus, [BMIM][FeCl4] is a promising new type of catalyst for conversion of high free fatty acid (FFA) feeds to biodiesel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - For the first time, an efficient simultaneous trans/esterification process for biodiesel synthesis from waste goat tallow with considerable free fatty acids (FFAs) content has been explored employing an infrared radiation assisted reactor (IRAR). The impacts of methanol to tallow molar ratio, IRAR temperature and H2SO4 concentration on goat tallow conversion were evaluated by response surface methodology (RSM). Under optimal conditions, 96.7% FFA conversion was achieved within 2.5h at 59.93wt.% H2SO4, 69.97°C IRAR temperature and 31.88:1 methanol to tallow molar ratio. The experimental results were also modeled using artificial neural network (ANN) and marginal improvement in modeling efficiency was observed in comparison with RSM. The infrared radiation strategy could significantly accelerate the conversion process as demonstrated through a substantial reduction in reaction time compared to conventionally heated reactor while providing appreciably high biodiesel yield. Moreover, the in situ water removal using silica-gel adsorbent could also facilitate achieving higher FFA conversion to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). Owing to the occurrence of simultaneous transesterification of triglycerides present in goat tallow, overall 98.5wt.% FAME content was determined at optimal conditions in the product biodiesel which conformed to ASTM and EN biodiesel specifications. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel has been a lucrative commodity in the current global economic trade as there is mounting concern for issues relating to the environment and oil depletion. Biodiesel has been proven to be the next alternative renewable fuel as it is environmentally friendly, sustainable and possesses similar combustion characteristics to petroleum diesel. However, due to the higher density and viscosity of biodiesel, pure biodiesel is not widely used in diesel engines. Therefore, the purpose of alcohol as a fuel additive is to improve the viscosity and density in the biodiesel blend. The focus of this study is to evaluate the performance and emissions of a small proportion of methanol (5% by volume) in a B20 blend and mineral diesel separately. A compression ignition (CI) Mitsubishi 4D68 multi-cylinder DI diesel engine was used in this work. Engine performance, combustion and exhaust emission characteristics were evaluated at two specific conditions. The first condition was an increase in engine speed from 1500rpm to 3500rpm at partial engine load and the second condition involved maintaining a constant speed of 2500rpm at three different engine loads (0.05MPa, 0.4MPa and 0.7MPa). Lower brake power was noticed when operating with B20 and B20 M5 blend. However, an increase in brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of 4-6% was observed when the engine was fueled with B20 and B20 M5. The results indicate that NOx emissions increase (up to 13%) while lower carbon monoxide (CO) and Carbon dioxide (CO2) (up to 17-18%) are observed in contrast with the mineral diesel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomethane produced through anaerobic digestion of residues is classified as a second generation gaseous biofuel. A technique employed in Spain to deal with pig slurry is drying, using the heat from natural gas combined heat and power (CHP) systems. This paper examines production of biomethane from pig slurry. Two scenarios are investigated: co-digestion of pig slurry with glycerine (a by-product of biodiesel production) and co-digestion of pig slurry with the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). Both scenarios include for ca. 10Mt of pig slurry each year. A combination of the two scenarios is sufficient to provide for 1.4% of energy in transport by 2020. The EU Renewable Energy Directive allows a double weighting to biofuels produced from residues when assessing renewable energy supply in transport (RES-T) targets for 2020. Thus the scenarios allow for 2.8% RES-T. The biomethane is sufficient to run 15,300 city buses or substitute for natural gas in 632,000 houses (8.7% of houses connected to the gas grid). The proposed biomethane industry would generate a fuel of similar sale price as diesel, allow for savings in the range 1046-1272kt CO2eq in transport fuel emissions and create more than 6000 jobs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article presents an assessment of the environmental performance of rapeseed-based biodiesel, addressing alternative geographical locations and cultivation systems for rapeseed (in Spain, France, Germany and Canada). Four environmental impact categories have been assessed using the CML 2001 life-cycle impact assessment method: abiotic depletion; global warming; acidification; and eutrophication. Results show that rapeseed cultivation has the highest contribution to all the environmental impact categories evaluated, with a share between 40% (abiotic depletion, Germany) and 98% (eutrophication, Spain). The use of fertilizers and associated soil emissions are the main contributions to the environmental impacts of cultivation. Soil carbon changes due to different agricultural practices are particularly important in terms of the global warming impact of rapeseed-based biodiesel. The use of fossil methanol in biodiesel production has significant impacts in terms of abiotic depletion and the consumption of heavy fuel oil in transoceanic transportation is an important contributor to acidification. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The degradation properties and combustion performance of raw bio-oil, aged bio-oil, and bio-oil from torrefied wood were investigated through thermogravimetric analysis. A three-stage process was observed for the degradation of bio-oils, including devolatilization of the aqueous fraction and light compounds, transition of the heavy faction to solid, and combustion of carbonaceous residues. Pyrolysis kinetics parameters were calculated via the reaction order model and 3D-diffusion model, and combustion indexes were used to qualitatively evaluate the thermal profiles of tested bio-oils for comparison with commercial oils such as fuel oils. It was found that aged bio-oil was more thermally instable and produced more combustion-detrimental carbonaceous solid. Raw bio-oil and bio-oil from torrefied wood had comparable combustion performance to fuel oils. It was considered that bio-oil has a potential to be mixed with or totally replace the fuel oils in boilers. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, Annona diversifolia seed oil (ADO) is evaluated for the first time as potential biodiesel feedstock. ADO was found to contain 21% oil (w/w) after extraction, and the low acid value of the oil was 0.666. mg KOH/g. Therefore, ADO was considered suitable for alkali-catalyzed transesterification. A. diversifolia biodiesel (ADB) was obtained from ADO by a standard transesterification procedure with methanol, and alkali catalyst. ADO has a high content of oleic acid (70%) and palmitic acid (16%). The fuel properties of the oil and biodiesel made from ADO were evaluated, including density, iodine value, kinematic viscosity, cetane number, flash point, pour point, cloud point, acid value, and gross heating value. The ADB properties were compared with several limits prescribed in the ASTM D6751 standards. The comparison shows that the biodiesel obtained from A. diversifolia oil could be used as an alternative fuel in conventional diesel engines. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We assessed and compared the production-ecological sustainability of first and second generation biofuel production systems in the state of Brandenburg, Germany. Production ecological sustainability was defined by a limited set of sustainability indicators including net energy yield per hectare, GHG emissions, N leaching, soil organic carbon and soil erosion, and several resource use efficiencies. The assessed first generation fuels are biodiesel and bioethanol produced from rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) and sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.) feedstock, respectively. Assessed second generation systems are based on feedstock from Miscanthus (Miscanthus×. giganteus Greef et. Deu. ex Hodkinson et Renvoize) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.); for both crops conversion into cellulosic ethanol and Fischer Tropsch Diesel was assessed. In the assessment, computer models were used for simulating crop growth, soil organic carbon dynamics and several other relevant biophysical processes. Second generation biofuel production systems based on Miscanthus and black locust perform substantially better than first generation systems based on rapeseed and sugarbeet. They contribute much more to GHG emission reduction, had much higher net energy yields and better resource use efficiencies; soil erosion and N leaching were also lower. Miscanthus performed better than black locust, except for its N use efficiency; it is the most water-efficient species, which is important in a region with declining groundwater tables. However, in Brandenburg, low temperatures during winter and early spring are often threatening to survival of first-year Miscanthus plantings; there have been disastrous experiences in the past. The drawback of black locust is that it has invasive characteristics; this risk may be controllable however (cf. Motta et al., 2009). Of the first generation systems, rapeseed has low net energy yields and large N requirements per unit of energy produced; it also performed poorly for N leaching. Erosion hazard in rapeseed is especially present after the seedbed has been prepared at the end of summer. Greatest erosion risk was calculated for sugarbeet however, due to its late canopy closure. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa L. Crantz) has shown potential as an alternative and biofuel crop in cereal-based cropping systems. Our study investigated the adaption, performance, and yield stability among camelina genotypes across diverse US Pacific Northwest (PNW) environments. Seven named camelina genotypes and 11 experimental numbered genotypes were evaluated for seed and oil yield in trials at 18 location/year environments that spanned four annual precipitation zones. Locations were rainfed with long-term mean annual precipitation ranging from 242 to 1085mm. Thirteen trials were spring-planted and five were fall-planted. Oil content was determined on seed from seven trials, seed weight from five trials, plant height and grain density from four trials, and plant lodging from two trials. Yield stability index was determined and related to seed yield across trials and within each of four annual precipitation zones. Seed yields varied from a trial mean of 127kg/ha at Lind WA during a year of extreme drought to 3302kg/ha at Pullman WA with the grand mean 1213kg/ha. Seed yields among genotypes were significantly different (P&lt;0.05) in 10 environments and ranged across environments from 913kg/ha for 'GP07' to 1349kg/ha for 'Celine'. Spring planting produced higher yields than fall planting and named genotypes out-performed numbered genotypes overall. Between the two highest yielding genotypes, 'Calena' was more stable for yield than Celine. Stability index values varied among genotypes within each annual precipitation zone evaluated indicating adaptation differences among genotypes. Oil content varied from 29.6% to 36.8% across environments but varied less among genotypes - 30.8-32.9%. Oil content was negatively correlated to seed yield. Grand means for camelina performance characteristics in four trials were 1.25g/1000 seed weight, 92.4cm plant height, and 652kg/m3 seed density. Named genotypes were more productive than numbered genotypes across environments and can be grown is diversified environments when selected based on anticipated precipitation, seed yield, oil content, and other agronomic characteristics. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, the production of biodiesel from Xylocarpus moluccensis seed oil by esterification followed directly by transesterfication without employing a separation step was investigated. The composition of X. moluccensis seed oil was triacylglycerols (81.23%), diacylglycerols (3.70%), monoacylglycerols (2.26%), free fatty acids (10.5%), and wax esters and gums (1.23%). Our results suggest that FAME yield (97%) was obtained under the following operation conditions: methanol to rice bran ratio of 2. ml/g, sulfuric acid concentration in methanol of 1% (v/v) and reaction time of 20. min, an esterification operated on X. moluccensis seed oils could reduce FFA contents from 10% to 1.5%. Then, it was subjected to a second step reaction by adding potassium hydroxide of 0.3% and allowing to react for another 15. min. It was found that the content of saturated fatty acids in this study were 22%. This means that the biodiesel produced from X. moluccensis seed oil has better cold flow properties, compared to that obtained while using palm oil. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The potential of Jatropha curcas L. seed cake after oil extraction (expelling of seeds followed by hexane extraction) as a raw material for binderless boards was investigated. The composition of the de-oiled seed cake was investigated using a range of techniques (proximate-, ultimate analyses, TG/DG, SEM). The effects of pressing conditions like the water content of the feed material (5-20. wt%), pressing temperature (120-200. °C), pressure (5-15. MPa), and heating time (30-60. min) on the physico-mechanical properties of the resulting fiberboards were determined. The optimum conditions were 8. wt% moisture content, a pressing temperature at 135. °C, 10. MPa pressure, and heating and cooling times of 30 and 15. min, respectively. The mechanical properties of the binderless boards are comparable with typical commercial particle boards. The effect of the addition of hemp woody core particles on the board properties was evaluated and small, though clear synergistic effects were observed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - PVA supported catalytic membranes have been synthesized by mutual γ-irradiation method using adipic acid (AA) and succinic acid (SA) as crosslinkers and a commercial ion exchange resin as catalyst.These membranes were tested as catalyst under batch conditions in esterification reaction of lauric acid to methyl laurate aiming biodiesel production. The effect of different synthesis parameters such as crosslinker, crosslinker's concentration and absorbed dose on membranes' physical-chemical properties and catalytic activity was studied. Results demonstrated that PVA supported resin membranes are effective catalysts in the lauric acid esterification reaction. Also showed that PVA-SA membranes exhibit the better catalytic properties and, within the range of conditions studied, an increase in the γ-radiation dose leads to a slight increase of membranes' catalytic activity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, two diesel fuels, an animal-fat biodiesel and two diesel blends with the animal-fat biodiesel (50. vol.%) and with a tire pyrolysis liquid (TPL) fuel (5. vol.%) have been tested in a 4-cylinder, 4-stroke, turbocharged, intercooled, 2.0. L Nissan diesel automotive engine (model M1D) with common-rail injection system and diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC). Carbonyl emissions have been analyzed both before and after DOC and specific reactivity of carbonyl profile has been calculated. Carbonyl sampling was carried out by means of a heated line, trapping the gas in 2,4-DNPH cartridges. The eluted content was then analyzed in an HPLC system, with UV-VIS detection. Results showed, on the one hand, an increase in carbonyl emissions with the biodiesel fraction in the fuel. On the other hand, the addition of TPL to diesel also increased carbonyl emissions. These trends were occasionally different if the emissions were studied after the DOC, as it seems to be selectivity during the oxidation process. The specific reactivity was also studied, finding a decrease with the oxygen content within the fuel molecule, although the equivalent ozone emissions slightly increased with the oxygen content. Finally, the emissions toxicity was also studied, comparing them to different parameters defined by different organizations. Depending on the point of study, emissions were above or below the established limits, although acrolein exceeded them as it has the least permissive values. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The catalytic activities of calcium oxide obtained from natural sources (crab shell and eggshell) were characterized and evaluated in the transesterification of vegetable oil. These catalysts are mainly composed of calcium carbonate, which is partially converted into CaO after calcination (900°C for 2h). The catalysts have some advantages, such as abundant occurrence, low cost, porous structure, and nontoxic. The materials were characterized by XRD, FTIR, TG/DTG, CO2-TPD, XPS, SEM, and BET methods. The thermal treatment produces small particles of CaCO3 and CaO that are responsible for the catalytic activity. The conversion from triglycerides to methyl ester was not observed in transesterification carried out using natural crab shell and eggshell. Under optimized reaction conditions, the conversions to YFAME using the calcined catalysts were: crab shell (83.10±0.27wt.%) and eggshell (97.75±0.02wt.%). These results, showed that these materials have promising viability in transesterification for biodiesel production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In-situ monitoring of chemical species emitted from the combustion of Jatropha oil in a practical Semawar burner were performed by means of several spectroscopic diagnostics. A practical burner commonly used in Indonesia having a built-in preheating system, called semawar, used for illumination purposes with the combustion of Jatropha oil. Non-intrusive two-dimensional (2-D) distributions of flame temperature were obtained using a thermal video camera. The experimental results showed the flame temperatures to range from 500 to 1400°C. Chemical species generated from within the combustion zone were also determined in the Ultraviolet-visible (Uv-Vis) range from the spontaneous emission spectra of the flame. Spatial distribution of NO, C2 and OH were identified from the spectra. The 2-D distribution emission intensity visualized and recorded for NO, C2 and OH revealed high temperatures close to the root of the flame that rapidly dispersed radially outwards to provide very high temperatures over much larger volume at downstream locations. The radial stretch of the reaction zone is important for improved performance of the burner with light emission form a much wider zone. In addition, in-situ monitoring of CO2 emission of Jatropha oil was performed by using infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The presence of CO, H2O and NO were also investigated in this research. Moreover, 2D distribution of CO2 emission intensity was also visualized using an IR camera. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, two different perennial tree species were studied as triacylglyceride sources for producing biofuels. These species grow wild in the Amazon and along the Brazilian coast and may be a good solution for oil production that does not rely on food sources or fossil fuels while encouraging preservation of the rain forest and seashore vegetation. Consequently, we studied the oils obtained from Terminalia catappa L. (TC) and Carapa guianensis (CG) to evaluate their characteristics and chemical composition. Furthermore, we produced biofuels from these oils and analyzed their physical-chemical properties. The physical-chemical properties of the TC and CG biodiesels make them acceptable for use in diesel engines showing a promising economic exploitation of these raw materials. The bio-oils obtained from TC and CG were not completely deoxygenated; however, their physical-chemical properties demonstrated the potential of these oils as acceptable renewable fuels for diesel engines. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study is focused on the evaluation of Crambe abyssinica as a source of biofuels and biomass. The vegetable oil (VO) from the seeds and the bio-oil (BO) from the pyrolysis of the residual cakes were characterized by one-dimensional and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography GC/qMS and GC. ×. GC/TOFMS, and many oxygenated compounds were found in both (VO and BO). The VOs were extracted by mechanical pressing as well as Soxhlet extraction and compressed propane extraction procedures, and the compressed propane procedure presented the best results. While the VOs are basically composed of fatty acids (from the glycerides), with a high concentration of erucic and oleic acid, the BO showed a more complex constitution, with phenols, ketones, acids, ethers, esters, hydrocarbons, alcohols and nitrogenated compounds. The large amounts of alkyl phenols, guaiacols, pyridines, indoles and anilines in the bio-oil are interesting to the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. In addition, the presence of a reasonable amount of hydrocarbons also indicated the possible use of BO as an alternative fuel. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Two freshwater and two marine microalgae species were grown under nitrogen replete and deplete conditions evaluating the impact on total biomass yield and biomolecular fractions (i.e. starch, protein, and lipid). A life cycle assessment was performed to evaluate varying species/growth conditions considering each biomass fraction and final product substitution based on energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), and eutrophication potential. Lipid for biodiesel was assumed as the primary product. Protein and carbohydrate fractions were processed as co-products. Composition of the non-lipid fraction presented significant trade-offs among biogas production, animal feed substitution, nutrient recycling, and carbon sequestration. Maximizing total lipid productivity rather than lipid content yielded the least GHG emissions. A marine, N-deplete case with relatively low lipid productivity but effective nutrient recycling had the lowest eutrophication impacts. Tailoring algal species/growth conditions to optimize the mix of biomolecular fractions matched to desired products and co-products can enable a sustainable integrated microalgal biorefinery. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Several land-based policy options are discussed within the current quest for feasible climate change mitigation options, among them the creation and conservation of forest carbon sinks through mechanisms such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation also called REDD+ and the substitution of fossil fuels through biofuels, as legislated in the EU Renewable Energy Directive. While those two policy processes face several methodological challenges, there is one issue that both processes encounter: the displacement of land use and the related emissions, which is referred to as carbon leakage in the context of emissions accounting, and indirect land-use change also called ILUC within the bioenergy realm. The debates surrounding carbon leakage and indirect land-use change issues run in parallel but are rather isolated from each other, without much interaction. This paper analyzes the similarities and differences as well as common challenges within these parallel debates by the use of peer-reviewed articles and reports, with a focus on approaches to address and methods to quantify emissions at national and international scale. The aim is to assess the potential to use synergies and learn from the two debates to optimize climate benefits. The results show that the similarities are many, while the differences between carbon leakage and ILUC are found in the actual commodity at stake and to some degree in the policy forum in which the debate is taken. The geographical scale, actors and parties involved also play a role. Both processes operate under the same theoretical assumption and face the same problem of lacking methods to quantify the emissions caused by international displacement. The approach to international displacement is one of the main differences; while US and EU biofuel policymakers acknowledge uncertainties in ILUC accounting but strive to reduce them, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change excludes accounting for international carbon leakage. Potential explanations behind these differences lie in the liability issue and the underlying accounting principles of producer responsibility for carbon leakage and consumer responsibility for ILUC. This is also reflected on the level of lobby activities, where ILUC has reached greater public and policy interest than carbon leakage. Finally, a possible way forward for international leakage accounting in future climate treaties could be the adoption of accounting methods taking a consumer perspective, to be used alongside the existing set-up, which could improve climate integrity of land-based policies. © 2013 .

AB  - Calcined sodium silicate was used to rapidly catalyze the transesterification of rapeseed and Jatropha oils to biodiesel under microwave irradiation. Biodiesel yields of 95.8% and 92.8% were achieved from rapeseed and Jatropha oils, respectively (microwave power of 400W, methanol/oil molar ratio of 11/1, catalyst amount of 4wt.% and reaction time of 5min). The catalyst was recycled, and biodiesel yield reduced to 83.6% at the fourth cycle. Fresh and reused sodium silicate catalysts were charaterized by BET (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller) surface area, XRD (X-ray diffraction), SEM (scanning electron microscope) and CO2-TPD (temperature programmed desorption), and it was found that the agglomeration and leaching of basic species resulted in the loss of catalytic activity. The reused catalyst was collected and utilized for hydrothermal gasification of glycerol to hydrogen. A maximum H2 yield of 82.8% with a concentration of 73.6% was obtained in the presence of the fourth-cycled sodium silicate and Ni catalysts at 350°C. Sodium silicate was an effective catalyst for the microwave-irradiated production of biodiesel and hydrothermal production of hydrogen from by-product glycerol combined with Ni catalyst. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Amid the prevalence of some plant based biofuels, we have targeted on optimizing the use of a new biofuel, pine oil, in a diesel engine without resorting to any engine modifications. Pine oil, extracted from the resins of pine tree, has some remarkable fuel properties such as lower viscosity, flash point and boiling point than diesel, while its calorific value is comparable to diesel. However, the cetane number of pine oil is lower and hence when being used as blends with diesel, it exhibits prolonged ignition delay and higher peak heat release rate, paving way for more NOX emission. Compared to fossil diesel, experimental investigation of 50D:50B (50% diesel and 50% pine oil) in a diesel engine showed significant decrease in CO (carbon monoxide), HC (hydrocarbon) and smoke emission by 45.9%, 32.4% and 41.5%, respectively, whereas the NOX (nitrogen oxides) emission was noted to be increased. To help reduce the negative impact of pine oil on NOX emission and ignition delay, this work intends to add two ignition promoters, IAN (iso-amyl nitrate) and DTBP (di-tertiary butyl peroxide), with 50D:50B. After the addition of ignition promoters, the NOX emission for 50D:50B-IAN and 50D:50B-DTBP is decreased by 12.8% and 19.2%, respectively, compared to 50D:50B. Among the two ignition promoters, DTBP is more effective in reducing NO X emission, adding to the other benefits of reduced CO and HC emission by 40% and 34%, respectively, than 50D:50B. In addition, the performance of the engine was also noted to be improved for 50D:50B-DTBP, suggesting that DTBP is a pertinent ignition improver for pine oil-diesel blends. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Twelve potential biofuel compounds were tested in mixtures with three diesel fuels and one jet fuel to determine the effects of different functional groups on low temperature properties. Functional groups evaluated include diesters, esters, ketones, and ethers; alkanes were used for comparison. The length of the hydrocarbon chains on either side of the oxygen-containing functional groups and branching were varied. Some test compounds are not anticipated to be commercial biofuels, but were compared to understand the effect of functional groups on cold flow behavior. Trends were observed relating to the compound class or oxygen-containing functional group present in the compound. Generally, alkanes, ethers, esters, and ketones with a low melting point temperature decreased the cloud point temperature of a fuel. Adding diesters resulted in low temperature liquid-liquid immiscibility. Multiple methods were used to confirm the presence of two liquid phases with diesters, including cold filter plugging point measurements. These general behaviors are independent of chain length and branching, as long as the melting point temperature of the compound is not significantly higher than the cloud point temperature of the fuel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of the study is to evaluate the influence of the animal fat based biodiesel/diesel fuel blends in comparison with pure diesel and soybean biodiesel blends over the engine performance, the specific fuel consumption and emissions, especially on particle emissions in size (5.6-560 nm) and number distribution of a diesel engine. Tests were conducted in engine test bench with 6 animals fat based blends of animal fat based biodiesel/diesel and soybean biodiesel/diesel in different proportions B10 (10% biodiesel and 90% pure diesel fuel), B20, B25, B30, B40, B50 and D100 (pure diesel). Tests were performed on a Euro 4 diesel engine, following an Urban Driving Cycle and 5 stationary operating conditions (15, 30, 50, 70 and 100 km/h). Experimental results show that the ratio of the blend biodiesel/diesel, followed by the saturation level of biodiesel, is the parameter that most influence has on the emission of pollutants. The nitrogen oxides emission increases compared to pure diesel and particle number emission decreases significantly, especially when the concentration of biodiesel is greater than 25%. The geometric mean diameter of the particles from biodiesel presents trends consistent with the load and speed variation and has no dependence on the type of biofuel used and is always less than those measured for mineral diesels. In all engine operating conditions, it was observed that particle emissions from the combustion of animal fat based biodiesel with a percentage higher than 40%, are emitted in smaller quantities than with the same proportions of soybeans. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Solid acid catalysts are of interests for various organic reactions. Among the solid acids, heteropoly acids (HPA) show strong and Brønsted acidity. Especially, 12-tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) (H3PW12O 40) possesses super acidity (Brønsted acidity) and higher thermal stability compared to other HPAs. The major disadvantages of using this heteropoly acid are lower surface area (1-10 m2/g) and solubility in polar media. These problems can be avoided by supporting TPA on various carriers. In this work, tungsten oxide (WO3) and TPA was supported on H-Y, H-β and H-ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts. The catalysts were characterized extensively using BET, XRD, FTIR, Raman, XPS and NH3-TPD. Their catalytic activity was tested by esterification of the free fatty acid (FFA) present in the green seed canola (GSC) oil, and transesterification of the GSC oil, using a stirred tank reactor for biodiesel production. In this study, TPA impregnated H-Y zeolite showed higher catalytic activity for esterification, and TPA impregnated H-β zeolite showed higher catalytic activity for the transesterification reaction compared to other catalysts. A 55% TPA/H-β showed optimum catalytic activity for both esterification and transesterification. It yielded 99.3 wt% ester, when 3.3 wt% catalyst (based on green seed canola oil) and 21.3:1 methanol to green seed canola oil molar ratio were used at 200 C, reaction pressure of 4.14 MPa and reaction time of 6.5 h. Glycerol is the major by-product during transesterification reaction of vegetable oils. This catalyst (55% TPA/H-β) was experimented for etherification of pure glycerol, and maximum conversion of glycerol (100%) was achieved in 5 h at 120 C, 1 MPa, 1:5 molar ratio (glycerol:TBA), 2.5% (w/v) catalyst loading. Later, these conditions were used to produce glycerol ether successfully from the glycerol derived after transesterification of green seed canola oil. A mixture of GSC derived biodiesel and glycerol ether was defined as biofuels. The properties of biofuels were evaluated and compared to those reported with ASTM standard for pure biodiesel. The reaction kinetics and reaction mechanism of the esterification-transesterification and etherification reactions were also analyzed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Jatropha curcas, an oilseed shrub, raised hopes that it could produce biofuel in a 'sustainable' manner, though early results fell short of these expectations. Drawing on field research from 2009, this paper examines the political economy of jatropha in Kenya using Tsing's 'economy of appearances' concept. Tsing's observation that start-up enterprises perpetuate 'myth' and 'spectacle' to build momentum fits patterns observed in this case. Jatropha's promoters reinforced an optimistic discourse, defended it against dissent and linked jatropha to global, national and local goals. However, the emergence of stronger critiques raises questions about how long its positive appearances can be maintained. © 2014 © 2014 ROAPE Publications Ltd.

AB  - Ethyl acetoacetate was investigated as a potential bio-based diluent for improving the cold flow properties of biodiesel from waste cooking oil. Waste cooking oil generally has relatively high saturated fatty acid content, meaning that the cold flow properties of the converted biodiesel are more challenging than the properties of biodiesel from conventional vegetable oils. The cold filter plugging point (CFPP) and pour point (PP) of biodiesel decreased after adding ethyl acetoacetate at 0%, 2.5%, 5%, 10% and 20% (vol). Both PP and CFPP decreased by 4. °C at 20. vol% ethyl acetoacetate. The effect of ethyl acetoacetate on kinematic viscosity, acid value and flash point was determined. Every sample satisfied ASTM D6751 except for the flash point (≥10. vol% ethyl acetoacetate), but the 5. vol% blends were all acceptable. Oxidative stability was improved with the addition of ethyl acetoacetate. Overall, ethyl acetoacetate appears acceptable as a bio-based diluent for improving the cold flow properties of biodiesel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrotreating of vegetable oils to hydrocarbon is one of the processes presently being considered for obtaining biofuel that can be blended with petroleum fuel as it provides chemically similar products i.e. hydrocarbons. In the present study hydrotreatment of jatropha oil and its mixture with straight run diesel fraction (DHDS feed) has been studied over commercial and a lab made hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysts. Jatropha oil has been co-processed with straight run diesel fraction in 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50% jatropha oil and its effect on the product and catalyst was examined. Both feeds and products are well characterized by SIMDIST analysis (D2887), distillation (D86), gas chromatography, density, viscosity, pour point and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Products contain only hydrocarbons and are found to be in diesel range and no significant effect on sulfur content of the products was observed. But pour point of the product is higher when higher content of jatropha oil is processed. Catalyst was found to be stable as it didn't get deactivated for more than 150 h of operation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Studies were made to determine the influence of different reaction temperatures and residence times on biodiesel yield by transesterification of karanja oil (Pongamia pinnata) in the presence of methanol using a solid acid heterogeneous catalyst in a continuous process. Recycle runs were conducted by further transesterification of the organic phases (first run mixture of methyl ester and unconverted oil) in the presence of methanol under similar conditions. High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) reveals poor biodiesel yield even with an increase in the reaction temperature and residence time in the first run. Biodiesel yield obtained from the recycle runs, however, was greatly increased over that of the first-run biodiesel yield. Recycle transesterification at a reaction temperature of 240°C and residence time of 50 min gives a maximum yield value of 97.74%. Consequently, irrespective of the presence of high free fatty acids and other impurities in karanja oil, recycling the organic phase of the first run significantly enhances the biodiesel yield. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Oil extraction from crushed Crotalaria Juncea seeds is done by standard solvent extraction method using a modified Soxhlet apparatus. Parameters such as size fractions of the crushed seeds, extraction time, aging of seeds, choice of solvents and use of co-solvents along with the primary solvent are optimized in order to enhance the yield of bio oil production. The bio-oil is characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry. Further, some tests for the elemental analysis for Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen and Sulphur, moisture content, residual carbon and dynamic viscosity are executed. Some of the basic fuel properties such as specific gravity, iodine number, saponification value, calorific value, flash point, fire point and kinematic viscosity are investigated to characterize fuel quality of the bio-oil. Though the energy content of the Sunn Hemp oil (34.128 MJ/kg) is slightly lower than that of gasoline (47 MJ/kg) and diesel fuel (44.8 MJ/kg), other fuel properties indicate that there is a great prospect for using this bio oil as a fuel for a diesel engine after some modifications. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bio-oils obtained from liquefaction/pyrolysis of biomass have undesired properties such as high water content (15-25 wt.%), high oxygen content (low heating value), high corrosiveness (acidity) and instability. Therefore, they cannot be directly adopted for fuel applications. Solubilizing bio-oil in diesel by microemulsion technology is one of the most convenient approaches for further upgrading bio-oil. In this work, a synthetic bio-oil was prepared to overcome the limitation posed by complex nature and instability of crude bio-oil. Effects of several microemulsion parameters on the solubilization capacity of bio-oil in diesel were evaluated, including initial bio-oil/diesel volume ratio (B/D ratio), surfactant concentration (Span80), cosurfactant type (n-butanol, n-pentanol, n-hexanol, n-heptanol and n-octanol) and the mass ratio of cosurfactant/surfactant (C/S ratio). The optimum bio-oil/diesel volume ratio was 5:5. The proper concentration of Span80 was 0.36 M. N-octanol was certified as an ideal cosurfactant. A proper C/S ratio of 0.40 was suggested. Meanwhile, fuel properties of bio-oil/diesel microemulsion were examined, including heating value, density, kinematic viscosity, cloud point, pour point, water content, corrosivity and stability. Elemental analysis and thermogravimetric analysis of bio-oil/diesel microemulsion were conducted. Compared with the original synthetic bio-oil, the bio-oil/diesel microemulsion had more desirable fuel properties close to diesel. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The health external costs of the electricity generation alternatives associated to a sugar ethanol factory are investigated. Two scenarios of power generation facilities have been analyzed in this study: the first scenario (existing) combines a bagasse cogeneration unit with a diesel combustion engines and the second scenario (future) the diesel engines are substituted by a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) fed with ethanol and integrated into the sugar factory. The health impacts referred as Years of Life Loss (YOLL) for the two proposed scenarios are estimated applying the Uniform World Model (UWM). Monetary values of damage costs related to human health per kWh of generated electricity are determined, as well as its influence on the total production cost. Therefore, the results of the external costs evaluation, shows that the use of a SOFC technology involves a reduction of health impacts in 25.76 YOLLyear-1 (12%) and external costs of 52,175 US$year-1 (12%), as well as a reduction of the electricity cost of 0.05 US$ cent per kWh in comparison with the existing scenario (bagasse cogeneration and diesel combustion engines). The internalization of this external cost would increase the production cost and the electricity price by more than 30% and 10%, respectively. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Commercial-scale liquid-biofuel production utilizing forest-based biomass would require feedstock supply from a large geographical area. Feedstock composition, supply chains' arrangements, and the resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are location dependent, and case-specific assessments are needed if one is to guarantee the fulfillment of GHG reduction requirements by a specific biofuel product. This work assessed GHG emissions derived from the feedstock supply and transportation chain to three possible commercial-scale biodiesel plant locations in Finland (Rauma, Porvoo, and Kemi) at site-specific level. The supply of 7.2 PJ yr-1 (approximately 1 million m3solid) of forest biomass (harvesting residues, stumps, and small-diameter energy wood) was assessed for each location, including four distinct scenarios for truck and railway transportation and two scenarios for biomass availability. Biomass availability and transportation-network assessments were conducted through utilization of geographical information system methods, and the GHG emissions were assessed by means of life-cycle assessment. The results showed that the GHG emissions of the supply chains can be effectively reduced through use of railway transportation from distant supply areas. Furthermore, even though the supply-chain GHG emissions differed by up to 30% between the case-study locations, the GHG emissions of the feedstock supply chain, from roadside stores of uncomminuted biomass to comminuted biomass delivered to the plants, were relatively low (2-4%) when compared with the GHG emissions of fossil diesel. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Developing new and renewable biofuels for ultra-low emission gas turbine combustors is much desired to secure future power needs. Several fuels are being developed to replace fossil fuels with minimal carbon footprint and pollutants emission. Ease of transition between fossil fuels and biofuels is also desired for fuel flexibility in engine operation. In this paper, the performance of Butyl Nonanoate biofuel is evaluated and compared to both Hydrogenated Renewable Jet (HRJ) fuel and JP-8. The atomization characteristics are examined using Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA) for favorable condition of fuel introduction to the combustor. The Biofuel provided 10-15% larger size droplets compared to JP-8 for a given atomizer and operational pressure. The combustion behavior of biofuel was also examined in a swirling colorless distributed combustor with focus on pollutants emission under high intensity simulated gas turbine conditions. The liquid fuels were directly fed into the path of the air stream prior to combustion without using any atomizer or spray device. The biofuel provided 6 PPM of NO and 35 PPM of CO at an energy release intensity of 27 MW/m3-atm at 0.6 equivalence ratio. The recorded emissions are about 15% lower as compared to JP-8 for equivalence ratio higher than 0.65. For lower equivalence ratios, NO emissions were identical. The Butyl Nonanoate biofuel also exhibited lower NO emissions than HRJ biofuel. The CO emissions were lower with Butyl Nonanoate as compared to JP-8 (this is in contrast to HRJ biofuel which showed an increase in CO compared to JP-8). The examined biofuel did not show any instability with smooth transition between different fuels. These results provide promising behavior of Butyl Nonanoate biofuel for use in future energy needs without any modifications to the combustor injectors, while maintaining high performance. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The endocarp in the chañar (Geoffroea decorticans) fruit, the pericarp in the white palm (Copernicia alba Morong) fruit and the exhausted white palm seeds from the extraction of oil are all residual lignocellulosic biomasses from the food processing of these fruits. The pyrolysis was performed at 550 C in a fixed bed reactor during 30 min under N2 flow with a 15 C/min heating ramp from room temperature. In all the cases a liquid product (bio-oil and tar) with yields from 35 to 50 wt.%, a gas product and a solid product (char), were produced. The tar represented from 5 to 20 wt.% of the liquid product. The highest bio-oil yield (47 wt.%) was obtained with the chañar fruit endocarp and the highest tar yield (8.8 wt.%) was obtained with the white palm seeds. The bio-oils contained mainly acids (from 6 to 18 wt.%), aldehydes and ketones (from 2 to 10 wt.%) and phenols (from 4 to 13 wt.%), with a high water content (from 44 to 81 wt.%). Their pH was acidic and the densities ranged from 0.97 to 1.24 kg/dm3. The tars had mainly phenols and oxygenated compounds of high molecular weight. After these results, these residual biomasses can be considered as a potential source for energy or fuels and valuable chemical products. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vegetable oils are of considerable interest for potential diesel fuel replacement applications, as a result of their non-toxic nature and the fact that they can be produced from renewable sources. However, vegetable oils cannot be used directly for diesel replacement because of their high viscosities and resulting potential to cause engine problems. A number of different methods have been developed to reduce the viscosity of vegetable oils for diesel replacement. The work described here focuses on a promising, but less-studied approach: the use of surfactants to stabilize reverse microemulsions in fuels containing vegetable oils. The objective of the work was to explore the ability of one of the more widely used viscosity prediction models, the Chevron model, coupled with temperature dependent viscosity relationships for the individual fuel components, to predict the viscosities of reverse microemulsion fuels. Experiments were conducted with canola, algae or palm kernel oil, combined with No. 2 diesel and ethyl alcohol. Oleylamine surfactant and octyl alcohol cosurfactant were used to stabilize the reverse microemulsions. Measurements were conducted at 5, 10, 25 and 40 C. Selected experiments also explored the effects of added water. Results of the work show that the model provides very good prediction of viscosities across nearly all systems and temperatures studied. Only in systems with very high water content (4%) were viscosities underpredicted. This result suggests that the presence of microemulsion droplets has a minimal impact on viscosity of reverse microemulsion fuels in the absence of significant water, while the composition of the fluid continuum largely dictates the viscosity of the resulting fuel. The prediction approach used here could be valuable for formulation of reverse microemulsion fuels for optimal viscosity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - 2-Methylfuran (MF) has become very attractive due to the recent breakthrough in its production method using the process of dehydration and hydrogenolysis of fructose. MF-gasoline blended fuel has been considered as a potential choice of alternative fuel pathway for spark ignition (SI) engines, as have other biofuel blends. Isooctane is used to represent gasoline in fundamental studies of gasoline blended fuels, however, little is known about the laminar burning characteristics of MF-isooctane blended fuels. In this study, high-speed schlieren photography is used to investigate the laminar burning characteristics of gaseous MF-isooctane at varying temperatures and equivalence ratios with an initial pressure of 0.1 MPa in a constant-volume vessel. The outwardly spherical flame method is used to determine the stretched flame speeds. The un-stretched flame speeds, Markstein lengths, Markstein number, laminar burning velocities and laminar burning flux of MF20 (20% MF and 80% isooctane) and MF50 (50% MF and 50% isooctane) under different equivalence ratios and temperatures are then deduced and compared to MF and isooctane. The results show that the un-stretched flame speeds and laminar burning velocities of MF20 and MF50 are between those of MF and isooctane under all conditions. The peak un-stretched flame speeds of the blends occur in an equivalence ratio range of 1.1-1.2 at all temperatures, closer to the case of MF at higher temperatures. Both blended fuels have Markstein lengths closer to isooctane at an equivalence ratio lower than 1.2 at all temperatures. The burning velocities of MF50 are very close to the average values for MF and isooctane, particularly at 393 K. MF in the blended fuel presents larger effects on burning velocities at higher temperatures. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper reports a study on the performance assessment of di-functional magnetic Fe-Ca oxide catalyst in biodiesel production using hemp oil. In situ co-precipitation procedure was used for synthesis of di-functional magnetic solid base catalyst. The resultant catalyst had good magnetic property with relatively high saturation magnetism (45.6. emu/g) and the reused catalyst status is quite functional. The catalyst was characterized using various techniques including XRD, TG-DTA, SEM and VSM. The produced biodiesel was characterized and conformed by GC/MS, NMR and FT/IR. The synthesis of biodiesel was carried out at constant temperature (60. °C), reaction time (2. h) oil alcohol molar ratio (1:6), agitation (600. rpm) and catalyst concentration (2.25%) w/w. The maximum biodiesel yield was achieved 92.16% using di-functional magnetic Fe-Ca oxide catalyst. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study describes a method for reducing the emissions of toxic organic pollutants from heavy duty diesel engines fueled by biodiesel produced from waste cooking oil (WCO). An analytical method was developed to simultaneously measure five pollutants from one exhaust sample, namely polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorined dibenzo-. p-dixins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated dibenzo-. p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). As yet, no data regarding PBDD/F emissions from mobile sources has been reported in the literature. The mass concentrations in the exhaust, in order, were PAHs. ≫. PBDEs. ≫. PBDD/Fs. >. PCBs. >. PCDD/Fs, while for the pollutants having dioxin-like toxicity, their toxicity concentrations, in order, were PCDD/Fs. >. PBDD/Fs. >. PCBs. These concentrations were two to four orders higher than those in the atmosphere. Even though the chlorine content in the WCO-based biodiesel was five times higher than that of fossil diesel, the reduction in the emission factors of the aforesaid pollutants increased along with the percentage of biodiesel. For example, B20 achieved a 49-73% and 61-83% reduction in mass and toxicity, respectively. In conclusion, the use of WCO-based biodiesel not only solves the problem of waste oil disposal, but also reduces the toxic organic pollutant emissions from diesel engines. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Gasoline may contain additives which can minimize the amount of pollutants emitted to the atmosphere. Detergents and dispersants added to gasoline can reduce gas emissions towards atmosphere and the formation of deposits in engines. The Brazilian Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuel (ANP) has established that Brazilian commercial gasoline must contain detergent and dispersant additives, thus requiring the development of methods for their identification in commercial gasoline. This work proposes a methodology which uses infrared spectra in the medium and near region (MIR and NIR) of the residue of distillation for classification of gasoline samples into two groups: with or without detergent/dispersant additives. The performances of three types of classification methods were compared: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Different algorithms for selection of spectral variables for LDA were evaluated: stepwise (SW), genetic algorithm (GA) and successive projections algorithm (SPA). The best results were obtained using LDA/GA or SPA/LDA for MIR region. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The variety of biofuels, which was put on the market in recent years, requires a great improvement of existing thermodynamic characterization methods and, eventually, the development of new ones. A deep understanding of the chemico-physical properties of biofuels will help to identify appropriate utilization areas, to improve the efficiency, to reduce the impact on climatic changes through greenhouse gas emission control, and to reduce the dependency on fossil energy. This work focuses on accurate experimental speed-of-sound measurements of first-generation liquid biofuels, made from renewable sources, which are commonly utilized in existing compression ignition engines, of mineral diesel, and of blends. The fluids under test were rapeseed oil methyl ester (in the following referred as B100-RME), soybean oil methyl ester (B100-SME), blends with 5% of rapeseed oil methyl ester (B5-RME) or 5% of soybean oil methyl ester (B5-SME), blends with 10% of biofuels (B10-RME and B10-SME) in mineral diesel and pure mineral diesel. Accurate speed-of-sound results were obtained by means of a double reflector pulse-echo technique, in the temperature range from 273.15 K to 353.15 K and over a wide pressure range (from atmospheric pressure up to 300 MPa). The overall uncertainty for speed-of-sound values was estimated to be less than 0.3% over the whole investigated thermodynamical range. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An experimental campaign has been devoted to characterize the engine fuelled by the ethanol based blend highlighting the advantages and issues related to the bio-ethanol use. The effects of the most important injection settings on the engine performance have been detailed, applying a Design of Experiment (DoE) method, to identify the most important parameters affecting emissions and the potentiality offered by a proper engine calibration to optimize the ethanol blend use. The tests were performed on a 2.0. L Euro 5 diesel engine, in steady-state at partial and full-load conditions, burning two fuel blends: a Rapeseed Methyl Ester (RME)/diesel blend with 10% of biodiesel by volume, assumed as reference fuel, and a bio-ethanol/RME/Diesel with 20% of bio-ethanol and 10% of biodiesel by volume. Emission measurements with standard Euro 5 calibration showed the well-know effects of ethanol blending to diesel fuel: a strong smoke emissions reduction in all tested conditions, together with a decrease of NOx exhaust concentration. An increment of CO and HCs emissions for bio-ethanol blends were also found, mainly at low load conditions. This issue has been investigated performing a specific test campaign inspired to the DoE method. Such activity identified in the calibration of the pilot injection quantity and rail pressure values the most influential factors in the gaseous unburned reduction. By the adoption of an optimized calibration, identified by DoE results, gaseous emissions on NEDC cycle were significantly reduced with respect to the reference calibration, matching the HCs and CO Euro 5 limits and approaching both PM and NOx Euro 6 emission levels. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A country level spatially explicit mixed integer linear programming model has been applied to identify the optimal Fischer Tropsch biodiesel production plants locations in Finland. The optimal plant locations with least cost options are identified by minimizing the complete costs of the supply chain with respect to feedstock supply (energywood, pulpwood, sawmill residuals, wood imports), industrial competition (pulp mill, sawmill, combined heat and power plants, pellet industries) and energy demand (biodiesel, heat, biofuel import). Model results show that five biodiesel production plants of 390MWfeedstock are needed to be built to meet the 2020 renewable energy target in transport (25.2PJ). Given current market conditions, the Fischer Tropsch biodiesel can be produced at a cost around 18€/GJ including by-products income. Furthermore, the parameter sensitivity analysis shows that the production plant parameters such as investment costs and conversion efficiency are found to have profound influence on the biodiesel cost, and then followed by feedstock cost and plant size. In addition, the variations in feedstock costs and industrial competition determine the proportion of feedstock resource allocation to the production plants. The results of this study could help decision makers to strategically locate the FT-biodiesel production plants in Finland. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is one of alternative energies that have been extensively discussed and studied. This research investigates the characteristics of particulate matter (PM), particulate carbon, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emitted from a generator fueled by waste-edible-oil-biodiesel with acetone and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) addition. The tested biodieselhols consisted of pure diesel oil (D100) with 1-3vol.% pure acetone (denoted as A), 1-70vol.% waste-edible-oil-biodiesel (denoted as W), and 1vol.% pure isopropyl alcohol (the stabilizer, denoted as P). The results show that in comparison to W1D99, W3D97, W5D95, W10D90, and W20D80, the use of biodieselhols achieved additional reduction of PM and particulate organic carbon (OC) emission, and such reduction increased as the addition percentage of pure acetone increased. Regardless of the percentages of added waste-edible-oil-biodiesel, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, the use of biodieselhol in place of D100 could reduce the emissions of Total-PAHs (by 6.13-42.5% (average=24.1%)) and Total-BaPeq (by 16.6-74.8% (average=53.2%)) from the diesel engine generator. Accordingly, the W/D blended fuels (W&lt;20vol.%) containing acetone (1-3vol.%) and isopropyl alcohol (1vol.%) are a potential alternative fuel for diesel engine generators because they substantially reduce emissions of PM, particulate OC, Total-PAHs, and Total-BaPeq. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Ignition delay times were measured behind reflected shock waves under highly dilute conditions (99% Ar) for 10 ternary blends of methyl octanoate, n-nonane, and methylcyclohexane (MCH), using a Design of Experiments approach, namely an L9 array. Measurements were obtained over a wide range of temperature (1258 < T (K) < 1630), pressure (1.5 < P (atm) < 9.5), and equivalence ratio (0.5, 1.0, 2.0). The series of experiments focused on the effects of variation in relative fuel volume fractions to assess respective influence of hydrocarbon class (i.e. methyl ester, n-alkane, cycloalkane) on ignition delay times of blended fuel. The L9 array utilized for the design of the experimental test matrix led to the development of an empirical ignition delay time correlation which was then employed for a broad series of calculations examining the effects of fuel-ratio variation. Results of the calculations show that addition of methyl octanoate to blends of n-nonane and MCH lowers the power-law pressure dependence of ignition delay times of such blends (the latter two species share similar dependence on pressure). The correlation also shows MCH as the most dominant of the three fuels in the blends studied with respect to controlling ignition delay time, a finding supported by ignition delay time-sensitivity calculations. Calculation of blending effects, defined herein as deviation from neat-fuel behavior, using the correlation indicated several key features of the studied blends. First, for fixed MCH concentration in a ternary blend, correlation calculations revealed an insensitivity of ignition delay time to variation in the ratio of methyl octanoate to n-nonane for all conditions. Second, blending effects on ignition delay times depend strongly on blend composition and on experimental conditions (pressure, equivalence ratio, temperature), indicating fuel- and condition-specific complexities, although were generally more pronounced at lower temperature. Third, of the three experimental conditions varied, ignition delay times of fuel blends exhibited the most sensitivity to equivalence ratio. To support experimental results, the study also involved compilation of a detailed chemical kinetics mechanism (4815 reactions, 1082 species) by integrating pertinent reaction chemistry from two independently validated mechanisms into a base model for n-nonane oxidation from a previous study by the authors. Model-based calculations indicate that under stoichiometric conditions near 10 atm, blending effects are negligible above 1350 K yet become increasingly significant towards lower temperature. Lastly, to assess the importance of blending effects, ignition delay times of fuel blends measured experimentally were compared against times calculated using a linear combination method (i.e. superposition of constituent-fuel ignition delay times). In general, superposition of neat-fuel trends cannot be utilized to reproduce ignition trends of the fuel blends herein, highlighting the importance of and continued need for blended-fuel studies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Exhaust particle numbers from a light-duty vehicle diesel engine for transient-state operating conditions were studied. The test fuels were petroleum diesel, pure Jatropha biodiesel (B100), 20% and 50% biodiesel blends with diesel fuel (B20 and B50). The results show that the number of accumulation-mode particles decreases with the biodiesel blend ratio, but the number of nucleation-mode particles increases. The accumulation-mode particle size at peak value decreases with increasing biodiesel blend ratio. The total particle number concentration increases with the biodiesel blend ratio, and the total particle numbers for B20, B50 and B100 biodiesel fuels are approximately 3-4. times that of pure diesel, with the nucleation-mode particle concentration dominating the total particle number. The number of nucleation-mode particles increases when using petroleum diesel during transient operating conditions (increasing torque at constant speeds). The mass of the accumulation-mode particles of the engine with the four kinds of fuels are larger than the nucleation-mode particles under the six operating conditions. The number of accumulation-mode particles increases at the initial stage of transient process and then decreases with increasing torque. The total particle number increases steadily with torque during transient operating conditions, and the accumulation-mode particles dominate the total particle number in the beginning, while nucleation-mode particles dominate the latter stages of transient operating conditions. The change characteristics in particle number during the transient process for lower biodiesel blends are similar to those of petroleum diesel, whereas higher biodiesel blends show distinct differences, and the total particle number and nucleation-mode particle number for B50 and B100 fuels are obviously larger from beginning to end than those for pure diesel, while the accumulation-mode particle number remains smaller. For B100 fuel, the nucleation-mode particle number increases rapidly until the end of the transient process, and the accumulation-mode particle number decreases steadily. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work provides a systematic and comprehensible lineshape analysis of the Raman spectra from (i) the main esters that compose the soybean biodiesel, namely Palmitate, Stearate, Oleate, Linoleate and Linolenate, (ii) mixtures of these esters, (iii) a soybean biodiesel reference material. Using theoretical spectral simulation as a guide, the experimental spectra are fit considering all the 3N-6 vibrational modes, where N is the number of atoms in the molecule. We demonstrate that while intensity analysis may lead to uncertainty in the definition of the relative ester contents in a mixture, a complete spectral analysis involving all parameters, including peak frequencies, allows spectral determination of esters composition. Finally we define a protocol that can be used for defining the specific composition of unknown, including adulterated biodiesels, important for quality control. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel is a kind of clean energy which has good application prospects in diesel engines. The cavitation behaviors inside injector nozzle of diesel engine of biofuel and diesel fuel are numerically simulated and compared using homogeneous mixture flow model and full cavitation model. The dimensionless numbers such as cavitation number and discharge coefficient are introduced to analyze the internal flow characteristics of various fuels. The results show that the change pattern of mass flow rate and dimensionless numbers of injection nozzle are variable before and after transition cavitation. The dynamic viscosity was the primary property for the development of cavitation compared with surface tension and saturated vapor pressure.

AB  - Microwave-assisted transesterification of vegetable oil is emerging as an alternative process for the production of biodiesel. Microwave energy offers a number of advantages over conventional heating methods, including faster reaction rates, reduced processing times, and reduced catalyst consumption. This article describes the result of a pilot-scale continuous microwave-assisted transesterification process in focusing cavities with an analysis of the effect of temperature and time on the transesterification reaction for soybean oil. Experiments were performed in a continuous pilotscale microwave reactor at temperatures of 60°C and 75°C and total processing times ranging from 1 to 16 min. Ethanol was used as a solvent with NaOH as a catalyst (<0.2% by weight of oil). The conversion obtained was >99% for all experimental conditions, compared to 84% in conventional methods, and the energy balance yielded a positive value for this process. The results of the scaled-up microwave heating process are encouraging for the development of an industrial-scale, continuous microwave system for production of biodiesel. © 2013 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Two federal government witnesses suggested that continued support of developing next-generation transportation biofuels could create alternatives that existing engines and distribution systems can safely handle. This would eliminate the blend wall that the US has hit with growing amounts of corn-based ethanol required under the Renewable Fuel Standard amid reduced gasoline demand, they told the US Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and its Clean Air and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee. The DOE and the bioenergy community are using cellulosic ethanol research, development, and demonstration successes to accelerate cellulosic and algal drop-in biofuel technologies that can be used to displace petroleum-based gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Five biorefineries are in the early stages to commercially produce cellulosic ethanol. The focus on advanced biofuel and the 30 million gal/yr cellulosic facility in Iowa are presented.

AB  - The production of synthetic fuels from alternative sources has increased in recent years as a cleaner, more sustainable source of transport fuel is now required. The European Commission has outlined renewable energy targets pertaining to transport fuel which must be met by 2020. In response to these targets Ireland has committed, through the Biofuels Obligation Scheme of 2008, to producing 3% of transport fuels from biofuels by 2010 and 10% by 2020. In order to be suitable for sale in Europe, diesel fuels and biodiesels must meet certain European fuel specifications outlined in the EN 590:2009 standard. The aim of this paper was to prepare blends of varying proportions of synthetic diesel (Cyn-diesel) fuel, produced from the pyrolysis of plastic, vs regular fossil diesel. The flash point (°C) and cold filter plugging point (°C) of these blends as well as of the conventional petroleum diesel fuel were analysed in relation to compliance with the European fuel standard EN 590. The results confirmed that blending of Cyn-diesel with conventional petroleum diesel has a highly significant effect on the properties of the resulting fuel blend. The results show that by increasing the Cyn-diesel content of the blend, the flash point of the blend decreases and the cold filter plugging point increases. Furthermore, comparing the fuel blends to EN 590 specifications has highlighted significant trends. The cold filter plugging points of all of the fuel blends are in compliance with EN 590 specifications. However, only blends of up to, and including, 40% Cyn-diesel are in compliance with EN 590 specifications for flash point. This analysis shows that a blend of 40% Cyn-diesel is in compliance with all of the EN 590 specifications examined, and as such could be placed on the European fuel market (provided that the blend meets the requirements for the other properties in the EN 590 specification). This finding highlights the potential for Cyn-diesel blends to be incorporated into the European and national renewable energy targets. © Murphy et al.

AB  - This study investigates the evolution of fuel properties and aging of a series of bioslurry fuels prepared from fast pyrolysis bio-oil and biochar at different biochar loading levels (up to 20 wt %) for a storage period of 29 days. The results demonstrate that, at room temperature, the storage of bioslurry results in a reduction in the acidity [total acid number (TAN)], a reduction in the viscosity, and an increase in the water content of the bio-oil phase. In comparison to the blank bio-oil samples, the presence of biochar leads to more severe changes in the fuel properties of bioslurry. After 29 days of storage, the bioslurry fuels are still acidic. An increase in the biochar loading level further decreases the TAN and viscosity of bio-oil phases and increases the water content of bio-oil phases. The storage of bioslurry also results in undesired redistribution of alkali and alkaline earth metallic species between the biochar and bio-oil phase in bioslurry, via the leaching of these inorganic species from the biochar into the acidic bio-oil by two-step kinetics. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The fatty acid methyl esters of vegetable oils and animal fats, more commonly known as biodiesel, represent a renewable, biodegradable, noninflammable, and low toxicity alternative to diesel. In this study, the Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs) and the interaction radius of the solute sphere (R0) were determined for the biodiesel derived from soybean oil, coconut oil, palm oil, and castor oil, using 45 solvents and solvent mixtures. The values for the HSPs and R0 obtained for the different biodiesels were soybean (15.03, 3.69, 8.92, and 11.33; MPa(1/2)); coconut (15.12, 3.99, 9.25, and 10.92; MPa(1/2)); palm (15.43, 5.28, 6.61, and 10.54; MPa(1/2)); and castor (16.10, 6.72, 9.11, and 11.78; MPa(1/2)). The HSPs of four biofuels were also determined using the average values of the fatty esters of each oil, calculated using group contribution. Subsequently, the solubilities of the biofuels were predicted using the van Krevelen-Hoftyzer, Greenhalgh, and Bagley approaches. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Consequence of diesel hydrocarbon on growth and metabolism as well as degradation potential of oil by algae Ectocarpus sp. was assessed. Ectocarpus sp. is Phaeophycean algae having ribbon shaped chloroplasts, on which both inhibitory and stimulatory effects of oil on growth and macromolecular synthesis were observed. With respect to capability of algae for degradation, it was found to degrade 30% and 40% of a crude oil and water soluble fractions, respectively, when tested under appropriate and optimized conditions. Oil degradation by potential algae was examined by monitoring the formation of carbon dioxide and water soluble compounds through sequential reactions. The study revealed the impact of oil and its fractions on growth and different rate and degree of oil degradation at 1% concentration of crude oil and varying concentration of water soluble fractions.

AB  - The formation and development process of fuel spray has a great influence on fuel atomization, fuel evaporation, fuel-air mixing, and combustion, which can further influence the properties of a diesel engine. The atomization process and its quality are affected not only by the mutual friction between the fuel spray and ambient air, but also by the flow behavior in the nozzle orifice such as the cavitation effect and the turbulent flow among which the flow disturbance induced by the cavitation is the first important factor effecting the atomization of fuel spray. A lot of research studies on an alternative fuel, Jatropha curcas oil (JCO), for diesel fuel have been carried out by both domestic and international scholars with the focus mainly on the preparation methods, and physical and chemical properties as well as the performance and the pollutant emissions of a diesel engine fueled with JCO. Nevertheless, the issues related to a systematic study of the cavitation flow and the spray outflow characteristics, which have a great influence on the injection and atomization of JCO, are seldom reported. In the present paper, a three-dimensional gas-liquid two-phase model of cavitation flow was developed, which took the influence of injection conditions on fuel viscosity, fuel density, and bubble number density into consideration. After the validity of the model was verified, a three-dimensional numerical simulation that was about the influences of injection pressure, injection back pressure and fuel temperature on the cavitation flow of JCO in a diesel nozzle was carried out. The results showed that: the mean flow velocity at outlet (MFVO) and the mass flow rate is enhanced gradually with the increment of injection pressure, and the discharge coefficient decreases simultaneously. However, the cavitation effect does not change significantly. The injection backpressure has little influence on the flow characteristics of JCO in the diesel nozzle. MFVO, mass flow rate, and discharge coefficient raise remarkably with the increment of JCO temperature, and at the same time, the cavitation effect is significantly enhanced. The cavitation effect and MFVO of JCO are lower than those of diesel fuel under the same injection condition, but whether the mass flow rate and the discharge coefficient of JCO are higher than those of diesel fuel also depends on the fuel temperature. The results obtained indicate that the increment of JCO temperature will remarkably enhance the cavitation effect, strengthen the flow disturbance, and improve MFVO and the cycle fuel injection quantity, which are beneficial for the fuel injection, atomization, and the performance of a diesel engine. The research can provide references for in-depth analysis on the working process of diesel engine fueled with JCO.

AB  - Bio-oil is easy to extract, transport and storage. It is a kind of potential clean and renewable energy and can be used as fuel in oil burning boiler and turbine engine directly. Furthermore, Bio-oil can be blended with gasoline, diesel in certain percentage through using advanced emulsion process to produce clean, environment-friendly bio-oil/disel mixed emulsification fuel. It not only improves the calorific value of fuel and the combustion performance, the emulsified oil also can be directly applied to ordinary diesel engine with or without modification. Bio-oil is a mixture with high percentage of water and acid, the stability of the emulsion products is an important factor for its large-scale application. Meanwhile, the choice of emulsifier and auxiliary emulsifier is important for the stability of bio-oil. In this paper, the impact of emulsifier types, HLB value, dosage of emulsifier, types of auxiliary emulsifier and dosage of auxiliary emulsifier on the stability of the emulsified bio-oil/diesel oil were studied using non-ionic compound surfactants. The stability of the emulsified oil and absorbance ratio K was used as observation object at the macroscopic level. the average particle size of emulsified oil and the distribution of emulsified oil droplets were used as observation objects at the micro level. The experimental results showed that the stabilization time of the emulsified oil reached up to 17 days using Tween80 and Span80 as mixed emulsifier when B-oil content was blended with 5%, 90% of diesel fuel, and 5% of emulsifier. The absorbance ratio K was 1.11, which means the stability is best with the particle size of 1.56 um in the microscopic observation. The best HLB value range was 5.0-5.8, the peak curve is higher on the particle size distribution, and there was more number of small oil droplets. The highest peak and the most number of droplets were reached when the HLB value was set as 5.4.As the HLB value increase, the oil droplets number was reduced and the particle size become bigger. Within a certain range, the stability time is proportional to the content of emulsifier. Since the price of emulsifier is higher than Bio-oil, we recommend that the suitable amount of emulsifier is 5% during the emulsified oil production. The stability time of the emulsified oil increased 7 or 8 days using n-octanol and methanol as co-emulsifier. The stability time of emulsified oil can be increased using co-emulsifier. Adding methanol as auxiliary emulsifier is more economically effective. The best emulsified oil stability was reached when the methanol content was set as 20%. The stability of the emulsified oil was decreased with increased Bio-oil content. The emulsified oil is experienced with stratification, flocculation, coalescence and demulsification process. It is our expectation that this study will assist in support of industrial development and application of the bio-oil.

AB  - In this study biomass-based energy production was introduced to an urban city area of Helsinki, Finland. The study compared two cases in integration with a municipality: (1) biomass fuelled small-scale CHP (combined heat and power)-plant and (2) a biorefinery. The comparison was made according to primary energy consumption, primary energy factors, CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions and the price of produced biowax. It was also studied how results are influenced by different assumptions. The results showed that the primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions were higher in the biorefinery case in absolute amounts as more products i.e. biowax was produced. The results indicated the primary energy factors were almost the same for both cases. Additionally, the primary energy use was very low for district heat and electricity produced in the biorefinery, when the primary energy use of the biorefinery was allocated only to the biowax. The sensitivity analysis of biowax pricing showed that a biorefinery is a competitive alternative for a CHP-plant if the prices of biomass and market electricity are low and the price of CO2 allowance is high. In terms of overall energy efficiency comparison, the comparison cannot be properly completed, because of the different end-products of the plants. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The one-step synthesis of biodiesel from waste oil with high FFAs (free fatty acids) content was developed under mild condition (70°C, 1atm) using novel acidic ionic liquid immobilization on PDVB (poly divinylbenzene) as catalyst. The solid acid owns high activities for both the esterification of FFAs and transesterification of triglyceride with total yield over 99.0%. The novel solid acid combined the high activities of acidic ionic liquids and the easy separation of solid catalysts. The mild reaction conditions, high catalytic activities, high total yield, reusability and high stability were the key properties of the novel methodology, which would greatly reduce the production cost for the industrial application. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Coal, natural gas and petroleum-based liquid fuels are still the most widely used energy sources in modern society. The current scenario contrasts with the foreseen shortage of petroleum that was spread out in the beginning of the XXI century, when the concept of "energy security" emerged as an urgent agenda to ensure a good balance between energy supply and demand. Much beyond protecting refineries and oil ducts from terrorist attacks, these issues soon developed to a portfolio of measures related to process sustainability, involving at least three fundamental dimensions: (a) the need for technological breakthroughs to improve energy production worldwide; (b) the improvement of energy efficiency in all sectors of modern society; and (c) the increase of the social perception that education is a key-word towards a better use of our energy resources. Together with these technological, economic or social issues, "energy security" is also strongly influenced by environmental issues involving greenhouse gas emissions, loss of biodiversity in environmentally sensitive areas, pollution and poor solid waste management. For these and other reasons, the implementation of more sustainable practices in our currently available industrial facilities and the search for alternative energy sources that could partly replace the fossil fuels became a major priority throughout the world. Regarding fossil fuels, the main technological bottlenecks are related to the exploitation of less accessible petroleum resources such as those in the pre-salt layer, ranging from the proper characterization of these deep-water oil reservoirs, the development of lighter and more efficient equipment for both exploration and exploitation, the optimization of the drilling techniques, the achievement of further improvements in production yields and the establishment of specialized training programs for the technical staff. The production of natural gas from shale is also emerging in several countries but its production in large scale has several problems ranging from the unavoidable environmental impact of shale mining as well as to the bad consequences of its large scale exploitation in the past. The large scale use of coal has similar environmental problems, which are aggravated by difficulties in its proper characterization. Also, the mitigation of harmful gases and particulate matter that are released as a result of combustion is still depending on the development of new gas cleaning technologies including more efficient catalysts to improve its emission profile. On the other hand, biofuels are still struggling to fulfill their role in reducing our high dependence on fossil fuels. Fatty acid alkyl esters (biodiesel) from vegetable oils and ethanol from cane sucrose and corn starch are mature technologies whose market share is partially limited by the availability of their raw materials. For this reason, there has been a great effort to develop "second-generation" technologies to produce methanol, ethanol, butanol, biodiesel, biogas (methane), bio-oils, syngas and synthetic fuels from lower grade renewable feedstocks such as lignocellulosic materials whose consumption would not interfere with the rather sensitive issues of food security. Advanced fermentation processes are envisaged as "third generation" technologies and these are primarily linked to the use of algae feedstocks as well as other organisms that could produce biofuels or simply provide microbial biomass for the processes listed above. Due to the complexity and cost of their production chain, "third generation" technologies usually aim at high value added biofuels such as biojet fuel, biohydrogen and hydrocarbons with a fuel performance similar to diesel or gasoline, situations in which the use of genetically modified organisms is usually required. In general, the main challenges in this field could be summarized as follows: (a) the need for prospecting alternative sources of biomass that are not linked to the food chain; (b) the intensive use of green chemistry principles in our current industrial activities; (c) the development of mature technologies for the production of second and third generation biofuels; (d) the development of safe bioprocesses that are based on environmentally benign microorganisms; (e) the scale-up of potential technologies to a suitable demonstration scale; and (f) the full understanding of the technological and environmental implications of the food vs. fuel debate. On the basis of these, the main objective of this article is to stimulate the discussion and help the decision making regarding "energy security" issues and their challenges for modern society, in such a way to encourage the participation of the Brazilian Chemistry community in the design of a road map for a safer, sustainable and prosper future for our nation.

AB  - This contribution discusses the state of the art and the challenges in producing biofuels, as well as the need to develop chemical conversion processes of CO2 in Brazil. Biofuels are sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels for providing energy, whilst minimizing the effects of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Ethanol from fermentation of simple sugars and biodiesel produced from oils and fats are the first-generation of biofuels available in the country. However, they are preferentially produced from edible feedstocks (sugar cane and vegetable oils), which limits the expansion of national production. In addition, environmental issues, as well as political and societal pressures, have promoted the development of 2nd and 3 rd generation biofuels. These biofuels are based on lignocellulosic biomass from agricultural waste and wood processing, and on algae, respectively. Cellulosic ethanol, from fermentation of cellulose-derived sugars, and hydrocarbons in the range of liquid fuels (gasoline, jet, and diesel fuels) produced through thermochemical conversion processes are considered biofuels of the new generation. Nevertheless, the available 2nd and 3 rd generation biofuels, and those under development, have to be subsidized for inclusion in the consumer market. Therefore, one of the greatest challenges in the biofuels area is their competitive large-scale production in relation to fossil fuels. Owing to this, fossil fuels, based on petroleum, coal and natural gas, will be around for many years to come. Thus, it is necessary to utilize the inevitable CO2 released by the combustion processes in a rational and economical way. Chemical transformation processes of CO 2 into methanol, hydrocarbons and organic carbonates are attractive and relatively easy to implement in the short-to-medium terms. However, the low reactivity of CO2 and the thermodynamic limitations in terms of conversion and yield of products remain challenges to be overcome in the development of sustainable CO2 conversion processes.

AB  - A hybrid adsorbent-catalytic nanostructured material consisting of aminopropyl groups and nickel nanoparticles immobilized in mesoporous silica nanoparticles (AP-Ni-MSN) was employed to selectively capture free fatty acids (FFAs) and convert them into saturated hydrocarbons. The working principle of these sorbent-catalytic particles was initially tested in the hydrogenation of oleic acid. Besides providing selectivity for the capture of FFAs, the adsorbent groups also affected the selectivity of the hydrogenation reaction, shifting the chemistry from hydrocracking-based (Ni) to hydrotreating-based and improving the carbon economy of the process. This approach was ultimately evaluated by the selective sequestration of FFAs from crude microalgal oil and their subsequent conversion into liquid hydrocarbons, demonstrating the suitability of this design for the refinery of renewable feedstocks. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - As aquaculture continues to expand, protein sources have become more costly and less available. Simultaneously, lipid-extracted algae (LEA) meals, which areco-products of bio-diesel production are becoming increasingly available. By integrating LEA into aquaculture diets, feed prices could possibly be lowered and bio-diesel production would have an additional revenue stream. Three separate feeding trials of either 7 or 8. week duration were conducted to evaluate four different algal meals as partial replacements for fishmeal and soy protein concentrate in diets for juvenile red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) initially weighing 1.9, 5.2 and 13.0. g/fish. In the first trial, whole algae meal and LEA derived from Navicula sp. replaced 5 or 10% of the crude protein (CP) in the reference diet based on equal contributions from fishmeal and soy protein concentrate. Weight gain, feed efficiency (FE), survival, condition indices including hepatosomatic index, intraperitoneal fat ratio and muscle ratio as well as whole-body proximate composition were not significantly (P>. 0.05) affected by substituting any of the algal products for fishmeal and soy protein concentrate in the reference diet. However, protein and energy retention values were significantly reduced in fish fed the diet with LEA meal included at 10% of dietary protein compared to fish fed the reference diet. Algal inclusion reduced the apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) for CP by an average of 3%, while ADC for energy increased by an average of 8%. A second feeding trial evaluated incrementally higher levels of LEA derived from Chlorella sp., by replacing 5, 10, 20, and 25% of the CP in the reference diet. Weight gain, FE, and protein efficiency ratio (PER) were significantly reduced at substitution levels of 20 and 25% but there were no differences in condition indices or whole-body proximate composition. The third feeding trial evaluated smaller incremental levels of LEA derived from Nannochloropsis salina, replacing 5, 7.5, 10, and 15% of the CP in the reference diet. Weight gain, FE, survival, and PER as well as intraperitoneal fat ratio and whole-body lipid were significantly reduced in fish fed the diet with 15% substitution. Based on the results of these experiments, replacement of up to 10% of CP from fishmeal and soy protein concentrate with LEA was possible without causing significant reductions in fish performance. Overall, the whole algae product proved a more nutritious product than LEA meals when fed to juvenile red drum. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Oils produced by microalgae are precursors to biodiesel. To achieve a profitable production of biodiesel from microalgae, identification of factors governing oil synthesis and turnover is desirable. The green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is amenable to genetic analyses and has recently emerged as a model to study oil metabolism. However, a detailed method to isolate various types of oil mutants that is adapted to Chlamydomonas has not been reported. Results: We describe here a forward genetic approach to isolate mutants altered in oil synthesis and turnover from C. reinhardtii. It consists of a three-step screening procedure: a primary screen by flow cytometry of Nile red stained transformants grown in 96-deep-well plates under three sequential conditions (presence of nitrogen, then absence of nitrogen, followed by oil remobilization); a confirmation step using Nile red stained biological triplicates; and a validation step consisting of the quantification by thin layer chromatography of oil content of selected strains. Thirty-one mutants were isolated by screening 1,800 transformants generated by random insertional mutagenesis (1.7%). Five showed increased oil accumulation under the nitrogen-replete condition and 13 had altered oil content under nitrogen-depletion. All mutants were affected in oil remobilization. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that various types of oil mutants can be isolated in Chlamydomonas based on the method set-up here, including mutants accumulating oil under optimal biomass growth. The strategy conceived and the protocol set-up should be applicable to other microalgal species such as Nannochloropsis and Chlorella, thus serving as a useful tool in Chlamydomonas oil research and algal biotechnology. © 2013 Cagnon et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas is a Euphorbiaceae shrub widely distributed in many tropical countries. Its seeds are rich in oil that can be used as biofuel in modified diesel engines. Several insect species, mainly belonging to Hemiptera, Coleoptera and Orthoptera, have been referenced as insect pests of /. curcas. These insects attack the plant and cause damage to fruits, inforescences and leaves. The most frequently observed pests belong to the genus Pachycoris (Heteroptera: Scutelleridae), which are widely distributed in Mexico, Australia, United States of America, Brazil and Nicaragua. Pachycoris spp. cause signifcant damage to the fruits, leading to the malformation of seeds and a reduction in their oil content. Although Jatropha shrubs are subjected to insect infestations, the oil has been shown to demonstrate biocidal activity, including insecticidal effects against several insect pests, including Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Sesamia calamistis Hampson (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Aphis gossypii Glover (Homoptera: Aphididae) and Callosobruchus chinensis L. (Coleoptera: Bruchidae). In the present paper, we summarize the work carried out on inventories of J. curcas insect pests as well as on the biocidal activity of its oil.

AB  - Waste-cooking-oil biodiesel has a great potential to be widely used as an alternative, renewable fuel for diesel engines in the near future. The aim of this investigation was to experimentally study the effect of using different blends of waste-cooking-oil biodiesel and diesel fuel on the diesel-engine performance, combustion characteristics, and emissions. It was found that increasing the percentage of biodiesel in the fuel blend from 0 to 50 % decreased engine torque and thermal efficiency by 9 and 11 %, respectively, for an engine speed of 1500 rpm. On the other hand, the engine fuel consumption increased by 17 %. In addition, the CO and HC emissions decreased by 31 and 40 %, respectively, whereas CO2 and NOx emissions increased by 17 and 40 %, respectively. It was also found that the ignition delay period decreased and the total combustion duration increased with increasing percentage of biodiesel in the fuel blend.

AB  - Fossil fuels (oil, natural gas and coal) presently represent about 90% of the world's total commercial primary energy demand. Yet, they are depletable sources of energy. Growth in the production of easily accessible oil, the main source of high energy liquid transportation fuels, will not match the projected rate of demand growth, especially in developing countries. In the transport sector, today, the only alternative to non-sustainable fossil fuels is biofuels that are produced from biomass, a stored environmentally neutral solar energy. These fuels are compatible with current vehicles and blendable with conventional fuels. Moreover, they share the long-established distribution infrastructure with little, if any, modification of equipment. The main biofuels presently in commercial production are bioethanol and biodiesel. Industrial countries started production of the 1st generation bioethanol and biodiesel from food products (grains and edible oil) since a few decades and these fuels are currently available at petrol stations. Second generation bioethanol from ligno-cellulosic materials is on the research, pilot and/or demonstration stage. This paper discusses the current situation regarding liquid fuels in Egypt which are experiencing imbalance between total production and demand for gasoline and diesel fuels. The quantified need for nonconventional sources is presented. Based on a thorough assessment of current and prospective generated agriculture residues as distributed over the political areas, mapping of the number and capacity of plants to be installed for production of bioethanol from available residues namely rice straw, sugar cane residues and cotton stalks has been developed. Annual capacities of 3000, 10,000 and 20,000 tons ethanol/year until year 2021 have been proposed. Capital and operating requirements and economic indicators have been estimated. It has been concluded that at current price of ethanol of about $0.6/kg, the simple rate of return on investments is about 2.8%, 11% and 16% for the 3000, 10,000 and 20,000 tons annual capacity ethanol respectively. © 2013

AB  - In this study, char, bio-oil and gases were synthesized with a continuous pyrolysis process from residual plants consisting of Cogongrass and Manilagrass at temperatures in the range of 400-550°C, with a feed rate of 150, 350, and 550 rpm (r min-1). The product yield calculation showed that the liquid yield was highest at 53.56%, at 350 rpm. After separation of the bio-oil from liquid phase, the bio-oil was found to have components of approximately 33.38%, of which the solid yield (char) was highest at 27.35%, at 350 rpm, and the gas yield was highest at 43.60%, at 150 rpm. This indicates that biomass from residual plants materials produced good yields because of low solid and gas yields while having high liquid yield. © 2013 Allerton Press, Inc.

AB  - Waste frying oil, which not only harms people's health but also causes environmental pollution, can be a good alternative to partially substitute petroleum diesel through transesterification reaction. This oil contained 8.8 % of free fatty acids, which cause a problem in a base-catalyzed process. In this study, synthesis of biodiesel was efficiently catalyzed by the covalently immobilized Talaromyces thermophilus lipase and allowed bioconversion yield up to 92 % after 24 h of reaction time. The optimal molar ratio was four to six parts of methanol to one part of oil with a biocatalyst loaded of 25 wt.% of oil. Further, experiments revealed that T. thermophilus lipase, immobilized by a multipoint covalent liaison onto activated chitosan via a short spacer (glutaraldehyde), was sufficiently tolerant to methanol. In fact, using the stepwise addition of methanol, no significant difference was observed from the one-step whole addition at the start of reaction. The batch biodiesel synthesis was performed in a fixed bed reactor with a lipase loaded of 10 g. The bioconversion yield of 98 % was attained after a 5-h reaction time. The bioreactor was operated successfully for almost 150 h without any changes in the initial conversion yield. Most of the chemical and physical properties of the produced biodiesel meet the European and USA standard specifications of biodiesel fuels. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

AB  - Pongamia seed oil as a bio- fuel has physical properties very similar to conventional diesel. Emission properties, however, are cleaner for Biofuel than for conventional diesel. It has no polyaromatic compounds and reduced toxic smoke and soot emissions. A drastic reduction in sulphur content (<350ppm) and higher cetane number (>51) will be required in the petroleum diesel produced by Indian refineries. However, bio-fuel meets these two important specifications and would help in improving the lubricity of low sulphur (0.13-0.16%) diesel. The present specification of flash point for petroleum diesel is 350 C which is lower than all the countries in the world (>550C). Bio-fuel will help in raising the flash point, a requirement of safety. Bio-fuel is a fuel comprising of mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids of vegetable oils or animal fats, which is derived either from plant or animal. Use of bio-fuel requires very little or no modification of engine when blended with diesel up to 20% (B20). Use of biofuel results in substantial reduction of un-burnt hydrocarbons by 30%, carbon monoxide by 20% and particulate matters by 25%. It has almost no sulphur. Besides, it has nearly 10% in-built oxygen, which facilitates combustion and also favorable Cetane number (51). The lower limit for the Cetane number is 46 for good combustion. © Research India Publications.

AB  - Depletion of conventional fuel resources has promoted research in alternative fuels for Internal Combustion Engines. Fuels derived from triglycerides (vegetable oils/animal fats) have the probability of accepting it as a substitute for diesel. They contain characteristics such as like durability, high viscosity and low volatility compared to diesel. This paper deals with the production of bio diesel obtained from Mahua oil and its blends with diesel from 20%, 40% and 60% by volume for running a single cylinder DI engine at constant speed of 1500 rpm. The objective of this study was to analyze and compare the suitability of each of these fuels for engine application from the point of view of normal combustion systems. The properties of these blends were found to be comparable to diesel and confirming to international standards.These problems are attributed to high viscosity, low volatility and polyunsaturated character of vegetable oils. Hence, process of transesterification is found to be effective method of reducing viscosity and eliminating operational and durability problems. The performance parameters evaluation include thermal efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake specific energy consumption (BSEC), and exhaust gas temperature whereas exhaust emissions include mass emissions smoke Injection pressure and fuel temperature were found to have significant effects on engine performance parameters. The power output depends on concentration of mahua methyl ester in diesel and injection pressure and fuel temperature. The present analysis reveals that the biofuel from mahua is quite suitable as an alternate fuel to diesel. © Research India Publications.

AB  - This study was focused on a comparison of growth and production properties of seven red yeast strains of the genus Rhodotorula, Sporobolomyces and Cystofilobasidium cultivated on glycerol substrate. Production of enriched yeast biomas and specific yeast metabolites (carotenoids, ergosterol, lipids) was evaluated on medium with glucose, pure technical glycerol and/or waste glycerol from biofuel production (40 g/L) and mixture of glycerol and glucose (1:3, 1:1, 3:1; C/N ratio 57 in all cultivations). All tested strains were able to utilize glycerol as the only carbon source. Production of biomass on waste glycerol was in most strains higher than in control as well as in medium with pure technical glycerol and reached 15.97- 21.76 g/L. Production of carotenoids and ergosterol was better in glucose medium than in medium with glycerol only. Nevertheless, using glycerol medium with addition of glucose, higher yields of total carotenoids, beta-carotene and ergosterol were obtained than in control. The highest yields of total pigments were reached by Sporobolomyces roseus (3.60 mg/g cell dry weight (CDW); glycerol:glucose 1:3), Sporobolomyces salmonicolor (2.85 mg/g CDW; glycerol:glucose 1:3) and Rhodotorula glutinis (2.80 mg/g CDW; glycerol:glucose 3:1) In glucose medium, most tested strains except Cystofilobasidium capitatum (22.6 %) produced neutral lipids in the range of 11-15 %. Production of triacylglycerols in all strains was in 10-30 % better in glycerol medium, in which Rhodotorula aurantiaca and Sporobolomyces shibatanus also reached intracellular triacylglycerol concentrations up to 20 % of biomass. This study has shown that oleaginous red yeasts could have great potential for converting crude glycerol to valuable lipids and carotenoids in respect of efficient bioresources utilization. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and the University of Milan 2013.

AB  - The energy budgets in crop production could be used as a key indicator that helps to assess the productivity and profitability that are dependent on energy use. Therefore, it is essential to conduct an energy assessment of crop varieties, as they are a major component of production. Tests were carried out in three consecutive years (2010-2012) under standard technology for late field production in order to determine the energy costs involved in the production of two varieties of broccoli as well as to assess the energy parameters. Standard fertilization and plant protection with pesticide chemical origin were applied. The total energy consumption in Coronado F1 and IZK Iskra varieties productions was 3570.31 MJ.da-1 and 3511.68 MJ.da-1, respectively. Variety IZK Iskra is more energy efficient because of reduced energy costs for diesel oil, machinery, some insecticides, human power and higher energy output. The higher energy output in IZK Iskra variety leads to a 22.50% increase in energy productivity and energy use efficiency in comparison with Coronado F1 variety. The shares of non-renewable energy for Coronado F1 and IZK Iskra varieties production were almost equal and were up to 89.30%. There is a heavy reliance on the use of chemical fertilizers, diesel oil and machinery. Consumption of these non-renewable energies can be reduced using bioproducts for fertilization and plant protection, and biofuel. It is essential for the creation and use of modern energy efficient varieties and hybrids.

AB  - Jatropha curcas is a perennial crop that stands out as a promising species for biofuel production because their grains have the potential to generate around 50% of oil. Like this culture is still little explored scientifically, the knowledge of aspects of the association of microorganisms with seeds is still incipient. The aim of this research was to evaluate the sanity and identify microorganisms associated with five ecotypes of Jatropha seeds. The treatments were different ecotypes of Jatropha seeds from different regions of the state of Minas Gerais (ecotype Uberlandia 1, ecotypeUberlandia 2, ecotype Janaúba 1,ecotype Janaúba 2 and ecotype Janaúba 3) with and without disinfection. For the evaluation of seeds were carried blotter test, test germination and seedling. It can be observed that the seeds of Jatropha analyzed showed high frequency of fungal species independent of surface disinfection. The five ecotypes of Jatropha curcas from different regions of the state of Minas Gerais showed high levels of germination, which showed no disease transmission to seedlings from the germination study.

AB  - Lipids in wastewaters are potential raw material for renewable diesel, but may complicate biological treatment of wastewaters. The lipid composition of palm oil mill effluent (POME), chemithermomechanical pulp mill (CTMP) wastewater and municipal wastewater (MWW) was studied with a combination of thin-layer chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance. Gravimetrically determined content of extracted lipids from the solids of POME and CTMP wastewater were 8.4 ± 1.2 g/L (19.6 ± 0.8% of dry weight) and 0.17-0.23 g/L (12.4-18.5%), respectively, while MWW contained 0.021 ± 0.002 g/L (9.3 ± 1.4%) of lipids. All lipid extracts contained mono-, di- and triacylglycerols (TAGs) and free fatty acids (FFAs). In POME, lipids were mostly TAGs (11.5 ± 0.2 ìmol/10 mg of lipid extract). In CTMP and MWW lipid composition was more diverse than in POME containing also sterol derivatives and fatty acid methyl esters and the main lipids were FFAs. © IWA Publishing 2013.

AB  - The paper discusses the issues concerning the methyl ester mixtures of various origins in terms of using these mixtures as self-contained biofuels or components of a fuel intended for use in compression-ignition engines used in the means of transport. The selected physical and chemical parameters of the chosen mixtures have been compared to the requirements of the EN 14214 standard specified for the rape oil acid methyl ester (RME). The tests have been carried out at an engine test bed with 1104C-44 PERKINS engine and allowed for determining the influence of methyl esters on the most important parameters characterising the combustion processes as well as the emission of the toxic components of the exhaust gas. The combustion process was assessed on the basis of the experimentally measured pressure in the combustion chamber. Increase in pressure and heat release characteristics are determined. Also share of the kinetic (premixed) and diffusion phases in the entire combustion process for all tested fuels are determined. The results for various mixtures are obtained under the same engine operating conditions and are referenced to the results for the standard hydrocarbon diesel fuel. The emission of toxic gases are determined in accordance with ISO 8178, based on the concentration of the exhaust gas components measured with AVL CEB II and smokemeter AVL DIGAS.

AB  - Living in the world that petroleum is depleting and environmental issue is concerned, alternative energy has become interesting for everyone. This paper, hence, proposes a new alternative called "biodiesohol". The fuel can be produced easily using microemulsion technique, when crude vegetable oil's viscosity can be reduced by mean of mixing the oil with proper amounts of surfactants and co-surfactants and then mixing with conventional diesel. In this study, jatropha oil was blended with different ratio of surfactant and co-surfactant first in order to find the suitable composition when the homogeneous microemulsion phase was allowed to form. After that, the blend was again mixed with diesel at the concentrations of 5%, 10% and 20% by volume. Finally, a single cylinder engine was used to evaluate the fuel in terms of performance and emission quality. It can be concluded that the biodiesohol can be comparable to normal diesel with better emission quality. © 2013 CAFET-INNOVA TECHNICAL SOCIETY.

AB  - Waste oils are potentially advantageous over petroleum and virgin vegetable oil based fuels due to waste utilization, and an overall lowering of gases and most other emissions over the life cycle of fuel production, use, and disposal. Waste generated from fish processing plants varies from 10-50 wt% of landed fish depending on the type of fish, product and processing techniques. A portion of this waste contains fish oil and varies significantly depending on the species. The oil recovery process must maximize extraction of oil and at the same time be able to integrate into the existing infrastructure at fish plants. In this study, we have optimized the recovery process developed in our lab (based on a fishmeal processing) and tested with the waste of a variety of fish species. The oil had low impurities (<0.5 wt% moisture) and degradation products, and physical properties suitable for substitution of No. 6 fuel oils and marine distillate/residual fuels. Based on this, pilot scale experiments were performed to determine scale-up challenges and design specifications for eventual costs analysis (e.g. size, residence time, etc.), energy required and waste emissions. © 2013 AOCS.

AB  - Scarcity and non-renewable nature of petroleum based liquid fuels have made them an un-reliable source of energy. Excessive greenhouse gas emissions and the associated effects on global warming have become noteworthy environmental, economic and social threats. In this milieu, the development of renewable, carbonneutral and sustainable alternative energy sources has become inevitable. Biofuels have been found a promising alternative and a driving force for modern world. Different feed-stocks have been evaluated for biofuels production to date but microalgae have been found the most attractive due to their higher growth productivity, higher lipid contents, non-competitive nature with human food and their ability to grow on non-arable land using brackish or waste water. However, there are a number of technological barriers that are still questioning the economic feasibility and competitiveness of such biofuels. On the other hand, there are also a number of trade opportunities if we pay attention to the use of integrated system following the bio-refinery concept. Bio-refinery concept reflects the production of value added by-products along with the biofuels, contributing to an overall escalation of the economic feasibility of the whole system. These types of systems may help to progress the competitiveness of biodiesel production using microalgae as a potential feedstock. This paper reviews the most recent and relevant information on such integrated systems. Several aspects related to the treatment of municipal and animal wastewater with simultaneous recovery of microalgae and the potential of biodiesel production are discussed. Bio-refinery concept also presenting new opportunities for the cost-effective production of biodiesel coupled with valuable non-fuel by-products.

AB  - The use of energy-efficient technologies and renewable energy sources in transportation could reduce petroleum use and greenhouse gas emissions, but these approaches may face challenges in consumer adoption, infrastructure requirements, and resource constraints. The Transportation Energy Futures project of the U.S. Department of Energy reviewed opportunities for significant reductions in petroleum use and greenhouse gas emissions. On the basis of that review, a diverse set of strategies is explored: reduced energy intensity of transportation modes, lower use intensity of motorized transport, and reduced carbon or petroleum intensity through the use of electricity and hydrogen from renewable energy as well as the use of biofuels. Energy efficiency and demand-side approaches could stop the growth in total transportation energy. In the light-duty vehicle sector, growth in energy use already is projected to flatten; the deployment of technologies for energy efficiency could limit growth in the non-light-duty sector. Travel reduction and built environment changes could moderate personal transportation demand. Freight mass reductions and mode switching could slow or stabilize freight demand. Vehicles using electricity or hydrogen could enable access to renewable energy resources other than biomass. Challenges in fueling infrastructure expansion and market uptake of advanced vehicles are considered. Competition for biomass also is explored, considering markets for electricity, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and bunker fuel. The potential for the implementation of these strategies to displace U.S. petroleum use and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector is discussed along with the barriers to realizing this potential in the market.

AB  - Non-food-based biofuel feedstocks are in high demand worldwide. Among the various feedstocks, microalgae are the most promising feedstock for mitigating atmospheric CO2 and producing biodiesel. In this study, various concentrations of CO2, from 0.03 to 12%, were used to investigate their effect on the cell growth, biomass and lipid production and fatty acid composition of Dunaliella sp. in a closed photobioreactor. The results showed that the highest biomass and total lipids, 521 mg/L/d and 40 mg/L/d, respectively, were produced with 5% CO2 aeration during the logarithmic growth phase. The oleic acid (18:1n9c) and elaidic acid (18:1n9t) contents were increased approximately two fold. The physiological responses of Dunaliella sp. at 10% CO2 were similar to those at 5% CO2. Therefore, the present results suggest that 5-10% is a suitable CO2 concentration range for Dunaliella sp. growth to mitigate atmospheric CO2 and increase biofuel production. © 2013 The Microbiological Society of Korea and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - To assess the potential of energy crops to provide a stock material for biofuel production three crops (rapeseed, sunflower and sweet sorghum) were studied in field experiments in Thessaly, Central Greece in 2007 and 2008. The cropping activities were recorded. Energy analysis was carried out to assess benefits from the crops. Power requirements and energy consumption during field operations were measured directly using instrumented tractors. Literature data was used for the energy sequestered to the inputs of the system (indirect energy). Energy budgets were produced taking into account as output either the seed or including the stalks for the two oil seed crops. The results showed that in all cases positive energy balances were achieved. Analysis of the inputs showed that energy for fertilizer was the most important for the rain fed rapeseed but irrigation for sunflower and sweet sorghum. Pumping depth of the irrigation water had a high impact on the energy inputs of the irrigated crops. The overall results gave maximum energy efficiency coefficients of 4.62 for rapeseed without the stalks and 10.68 with stalks, of 2.89 for sunflower without the stalks and 6.16 with stalks and 8.92 for sweet sorghum. An analysis of data from the literature was carried out to assess the effect of new technological developments to the energy sequestered to different inputs. Several developments are expected to improve energy efficiency coefficient, such as variable rate application of inputs, as well as properly designed crop rotations and use of cover crops.

AB  - Palm oil is a potential alternative energy source, since it has long hydrocarbon chains which is quite similar to the hydrocarbon chains in fossil oil. Thus, palm oil can be processed to produce biofuel which may replace the non-renewable fossil fuels, such as gasoline, kerosene and diesel oil. During utilization, biofuel produces fewer pollutants than fossil fuel. Therefore, biofuel is safer and environmentally friendly. The research was conducted through a catalyst synthesis and the catalytic cracking process. HZSM-5 was synthesized using an Absorption Atomic Spectroscopy (AAS) which produced a synthesized HZSM-5 Si/Al 198. Brunauer Emmet Teller (BET) analysis showed that surface area of synthesized catalysts was 21.3524 m2.g-1 and the average pore size of the catalysts was 13 °A. This process confirmed that the synthesized catalysts meet the requirement as a catalyst used in the catalytic cracking process. The catalytic cracking was carried out in a fixed bed micro reactor at temperatures between 350 - 500 °C and N2 flow rates between 100-160 ml.min-1 for 120 min. It was found that at 450°C and N2 flow rate of 100ml.min-1resulted in the highest yield of gasoline fraction of 28.87%, 16.70% kerosene and 1.20%. diesel oil. The synthesized HZSM-5 catalysts meet the standard of a catalyst used in the catalytic cracking of vegetable oil to produce biofuel. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.

AB  - A rapid method for the simultaneous determination of free glycerol (FG) and total glycerol (TG) in biodiesel by CE using a short-end multiple injection (SE/MI) configuration system is described. The sample preparation for FG involves the extraction of glycerol with water and for TG a saponification reaction is carried out followed by extraction as in the case of FG. The glycerol extracted in both cases is submitted to periodate oxidation and the iodate ions formed are measured on a CE-SE/MI system. The relevance of this study lies in the fact that no analytical procedure has been previously reported for the determination of TG (or of FG and TG simultaneously) by CE. The optimum conditions for the saponification/extraction process were 1.25% KOH and 25°C, with a time of only 5 min, and biodiesel mass in the range of 50.0-200.0 mg can be used. Multiple injections were performed hydrodynamically with negative pressure as follows: 50 mbar/3s (FG sample); 50 mbar/6s (electrolyte spacer); 50 mbar/3s (TG sample). The linear range obtained was 1.55-46.5 mg/L with R2&gt; 0.99. The LOD and LOQ were 0.16 mg/L and 0.47 mg/L, respectively for TG. The method provides acceptable throughput for application in quality control and monitoring biodiesel synthesis process. In addition, it offers simple sample preparation (saponification process), it can be applied to a variety biodiesel samples (soybean, castor, and waste cooking oils) and it can be used for the determination of two key parameters related to the biodiesel quality with a fast separation (less than 30 s) using an optimized CE-SE/MI system. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

AB  - Global attention on biofuels and the potential for Jatropha curcas to produce biodiesel from marginal land with low inputs has recently created world-wide interest in this species. This paper reports on the water dynamics and productivity of J. curcas in a silvopastoral experiment with Pennisetum clandestinum at the Ukulinga research farm of the University of KwaZulu-Natal near Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. Measurements of daily total evaporation rates during December-February (summer) on clear hot days ranged between 3 and 4mmd-1. However, due to the deciduous nature of the species, water use was negligible (&lt;1mmd-1) during winter (May-August). The results have shown that two- to four-year-old J. curcas trees were conservative water users. High oil yields are unlikely due to the low seed production. The best seed yield was in 2009 (348.8kgha-1) in the J. curcas only plots. The other treatments (where pasture competition was a factor) ranged between 77.8 and 166kgha-1. Data collected on the time taken by labourers to harvest and dehusk the seeds, showed that 1kg of seed took approximately 3h to process, suggesting that mechanical harvesting would be necessary to make seed production economically viable. J. curcas showed a low tolerance to pests and was prone to diseases. This significantly increased the input costs for insecticides and fungicides. The South African results are so unequivocal that J. curcas under the experimental conditions does not fulfil the claims that it is a wonder biodiesel plant. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Different economic and environmental theories and approaches have been used to date to evaluate effectiveness of biofuels policies, efficiency of biofuels production or sustainability of different biofuels technologies. The most commonly known approaches include, e.g., Life Cycle Analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, contingent valuation, GIS-based models, and market and price related analysis. This paper is focused on a multi-objective decision analysis that, although well established in economic and environmental evaluation theory, has not been widely used yet to assess biofuels production or policies.The paper presents a fuzzy set theory based multi-objective framework for evaluating conventional and advanced biofuels feedstocks in the US; considering uncertainties of decision-making processes. It incorporates fuzzy set theory, expert elicitation and the PROMETHEE approach to determine the sustainability potential of the feedstocks in terms of multiple economic, environmental and social policy objectives. The study shows algae and switchgrass to be the most sustainable feedstocks, while corn that is currently the most important feedstock for ethanol production in the US, has the lowest sustainability potential among the analyzed feedstocks.The study presents an example of a participatory approach and recommends its application for designing policy measures in an interactive process with policymakers. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. (Jatropha) has emerged as a biodiesel crop of great contemporary importance. The global hype surrounding this crop, the relatively poor understanding of its agronomy and the unpredictability of its yields, generates the potential for unsustainable practice of biodiesel production. The aim of this research is to ascertain if Jatropha production could be an appropriate driver for rural development in India, South Africa and Zambia, especially if yields prove to be lower than original predictions. A spreadsheet based financial model has been developed from life-cycle economic analysis of the Jatropha-biodiesel production chain to determine if steady-state income can support labour wages in India and southern Africa, under local wage legislation, at different yield, production cost and fuel price scenarios. The analyses are conducted with many common variables, but the model uses country specific parameters to contextualize local scenarios. The main assumption of the model is that the biodiesel sales price is proportional to the prevailing petro-diesel price. Results suggest that minimum wage rates in South Africa are too high to support production at the current fuel price. India and Zambia have the potential to generate profits under specific circumstances, which are dominated by yield, labour wages, prevailing petro-diesel prices and market opportunities for by-products. The validity of assumptions used in the model needs to be verified with primary data. However, the model provides a powerful framework for investigating alternative scenarios and identifying important system vulnerabilities and sensitivities, all of which are discussed in this article. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We developed a method to reduce the acid value of crude Zanthoxylum bungeanum seed oil (ZSO) with high free fatty acids. The acid value of ZSO was reduced from 56.23 mg KOH/g to 1.56 mg KOH/g by using one-step, acid-catalyzed esterification under the following optimum conditions: methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 30:1; 1.5% H2SO4; temperature of 60°C; and a reaction time of 120 min. The variation analysis of the orthogonal tests reveals the following sequence of different factors that contribute to esterification: mole ratio of methanol to ZSO&gt; w (catalyst)&gt;reaction temperature &gt; reaction time. Results show that the mole ratio of methanol to ZSO has a significant influence on esterification and deacidification. The esterification kinetics reveals that the acid-catalyzed esterification of ZSO to methanol is a two-step reaction. The dynamics equation is obtained and the activation energy (Ea) is 9542 J/mol at 60°C. The work laid a good foundation for subsequent biodiesel preparation.

AB  - Future fuel stocks for spark-ignition engines are expected to include a significant portion of bio-derived components with quite different chemical and physical properties to those of liquid hydrocarbons. State-of-the-art high-pressure multi-hole injectors for latest design direct-injection spark-ignition engines offer some great benefits in terms of fuel atomisation, as well as flexibility in in-cylinder fuel targeting by selection of the exact number and angle of the nozzle's holes. However, in order to maximise such benefits for future spark-ignition engines and minimise any deteriorating effects with regards to exhaust emissions, it is important to avoid liquid fuel impingement onto the cylinder walls and take into consideration various types of biofuels. This paper presents results from the use of heat flux sensors to characterise the locations and levels of liquid fuel impingement onto the engine's liner walls when injected from a centrally located multi-hole injector with an asymmetric pattern of spray plumes. Ethanol, butanol, iso-octane, gasoline and a blend of 10% ethanol with 90% gasoline (E10) were tested and compared. The tests were performed in the cylinder of a direct-injection spark-ignition engine at static conditions (i.e. quiescent chamber at 1.0. bar) and motoring conditions (at full load with inlet plenum pressure of 1.0. bar) with different engine temperatures in order to decouple competing effects. The collected data were analysed to extract time-resolved signals, as well as mean and standard deviation levels of peak heat flux. The results were interpreted with reference to in-cylinder spray formation characteristics, as well as fuel evaporation rates obtained by modelling. In addition, high-speed images of single droplets of fuel impinging onto the array of the heat flux sensor were acquired with simultaneous sampling of the heat flux signal in an attempt to provide further interpretation. The single droplet tests showed ability of the signals to quantify droplet mass impinged on the sensor. Analysis of the peak heat flux at static engine conditions quantified values of fuel temperature at impingement in agreement with the wet bulb temperatures predicted by the droplet evaporation model. Comparison of the static and motoring engine heat flux signals around the bore showed the effect of the intake flow on the spray's pattern at impingement and demonstrated fuel presence on the liner that survived at exhaust valve open timing. The general behaviour was different for the alcohols to that of the hydrocarbons, with ethanol exhibiting the effect of its high latent heat on the signals and butanol exhibiting effects related to poor atomization and slow evaporation. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Transport is essential for the control of future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and thus a target for active policy intervention in the future. Yet, social preferences for policies are likely to play an important role. In this paper we first review the existing literature on preferences regarding low-GHG car fuels, but also covering policy instruments and strategies in this area. We then present the results of a survey of Spanish households aimed at measuring preferences for climate change policies. We find a positive willingness to pay (WTP) (in the form of higher car fuel prices) for a policy to reduce GHG emissions through biofuels. There is, however, significant heterogeneity in public preferences due to personal motivations (accounted for via factor analysis of responses to attitudinal questions) and to socio-demographic variables. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The liquid product (biofuel) obtained from biomass pyrolysis has a very complex composition that consists of a mixture of different organic compounds. This mixture presents a high content of oxygenated groups (aldehydes, acids, esters, etc.) that reduce the quality of the biofuel. The deoxygenation of these biofuels improves their quality, reducing the viscosity, increasing the calorific value and improving their thermal stability. In this sense, the deoxygenation of methyl octanoate was carried out over different catalysts with basic properties such as FAU zeolites, SBA-15 ordered mesoporous silicate and clays like sepiolite and hydrolacite. Enhancement of its basic properties was carried out by ion-exchange and/or by impregnation with CsOH. Among these catalysts only over X zeolite was obtained good activity and selectivities to the desired products (C6, C7 and C8 hydrocarbons), especially over the ones with low silicon/aluminum molar ratio. The decrease of the electronegativity of the exchangeable cation in the X zeolite (KNaX1 and CsNaX1) allowed to improve the selectivity to C6 and C7 hydrocarbons (60%). Furthermore, the presence of cesium hydroxide (10 wt%) on the zeolite (CsI-NaX1) produced significant conversion of methyl octanoate (70%) with high selectivity to alkenes (53%) reaching a desired/undesired product ratio of 7.3. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study introduces and analyzes a novel system for algal biofuel production that synergistically integrates algal wastewater treatment with hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of wastewater biosolids and algae into bio-crude oil. This system maximizes the biofuel potential of wastewater inputs by internally capturing and recycling carbon and nutrients-a powerful concept referred to as multi-cycle nutrient reuse, which amplifies waste nutrients into multiple cycles of algal biomass and bioenergy production. We call this system "Environment-Enhancing Energy" (E2-Energy) because it can simultaneously improve conventional wastewater treatment by nutrient removal and production of a large amount of biofuel co-products. Moreover, E 2-Energy resolves several key bottlenecks commonly associated with large-scale algal biofuel production including: contamination of target high-oil algal cultures, high nutrient costs/usage, unsustainable fresh water usage, and large energy inputs for dewatering/extraction. A series of algal cultivation and HTL experiments were conducted to confirm the primary steps and performance characteristics of the E2-Energy system. These experiments showed: (1) low-oil, mixed algal-bacterial biomass can be successfully cultured with the recycled HTL aqueous product; (2) both organics and nutrients are removed from wastewater during algal-bacterial biomass production (63-95% reduction); (3) this low-oil, algal-bacterial biomass can be converted into bio-crude oil via HTL with a high yield (∼50%) and a net positive energy balance; and (4) the HTL step re-releases nutrients to an aqueous phase product that can be recycled back to step (1). This repeating loop of steps 1-4 facilitates multi-cycle reuse of nutrients and thus provides biomass amplification. A mathematical model was also developed using STELLA® to simulate mass balances for long-term E 2-Energy operations with internal recycling of nutrients and carbon. The model results showed that E2-Energy can amplify the biomass and biofuel production from wastewater by up to 10 times, which gives it the potential to replace all US petroleum imports using only current wastewater feedstocks and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or point sources. Thus, E 2-Energy represents a major paradigm shift - where wastewater treatment systems become optimized biofuel producers with enhanced effluent quality, which provides a viable and advantageous pathway to sustainable, carbon-neutral energy independence. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This paper focuses on the classified separation of flash pyrolysis oil by united extraction and distillation. Flash pyrolysis oil was effectively separated into four types of substances, including water-soluble fraction (low-boiling organic acids, alcohols, ketones, etc.), crude saccharide (mainly levoglucosan), phenolic compounds (guaiacol, 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol, etc.), and residue. The separation process was discussed in detail. The optimal separation condition was temperature 50 °C, 1:1 of water-to-oil ratio, and 20 min of contacting time. At this optimal separation condition, external standard method was employed to quantify levoglucosan, 4.1 wt% of levoglucosan accounted for the bio-oil could be obtained. Moreover, the potential applications of these four types of separated substances were discussed and proposed. Considering it is a kind of simple and effective process for the bio-oil, as well as the promising application prospects of the classified separation substances, this separation method will bring a new and highly efficient application of the bio-oil. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - There is world-wide interest in the search for alternatives to petroleum derived fuels for diesel engines. Key driving factors are depleting fossil-fuel reserves all over the globe as well as the environmental impact of burning fossil fuels that cause pollution and global warming. Bio-diesel derived from edible oils, non-edible oils and animal fats can be used in diesel engines with little or no modification. Non-land-based renewable sources are becoming important for the production of biodiesel due to limited availability of land. Under these circumstances, fish oil extracted from wastes of processed marine fish and refined through transesterification becomes an attractive alternative for the production of biodiesel. In this work, performance and emission characteristics of FOME (fish oil methyl ester) and its blends are evaluated in a direct-injection single-cylinder constant-speed diesel engine primarily used in the agricultural sector. It is seen that 20% FOME blend gives almost the same brake thermal efficiency with lower unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and soot emissions but higher NOx (nitrogen oxides) emissions compared to diesel fuel. EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) is used to control NOxemissions. Percentage of EGR is varied to determine optimum EGR for 20% FOME blend. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper studies the characteristics of blends of biodiesel and a new type of SSPO (sewage sludge derived intermediate pyrolysis oil) in various ratios, and evaluates the application of such blends in an unmodified Lister diesel engine. The engine performance and exhaust emissions were investigated and compared to those of diesel and biodiesel. The engine injectors were inspected and tested after the experiment. The SSPO-biodiesel blends were found to have comparable heating values to biodiesel, but relatively high acidity and carbon residue. The diesel engine has operated with a 30/70 SSPO-biodiesel blend and a 50/50 blend for up to 10h and there was no apparent deterioration in operation observed. It is concluded that with 30% SSPO, the engine gives better overall performance and fuel consumption than with 50% SSPO. The exhaust temperatures of 30% SSPO and 50% SSPO are similar, but 30% SSPO gives relatively lower NOx emission than 50% SSPO. The CO and smoke emissions are lower with 50% SSPO than with 30% SSPO. The injectors of the engine operated with SSPO blends were found to have heavy carbon deposition and noticeably reduced opening pressure, which may lead to deteriorated engine performance and exhaust emissions in extended operation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae are a promising biofuels feedstock, theoretically yielding concentrations of triacylglycerides (TAGs) per unit area that are far higher than traditional feedstocks due to their rapid growth. Dunaliella is particularly advantageous as a feedstock because it is currently commercially mass cultured, thrives in salt water, and has no cell wall. Fourteen strains of Dunaliella have been investigated for growth rates and lipid production in mass culture and tested for enhanced lipid production under a range of environmental stressors including salinity, pH, nitrogen and phosphorus limitation, and light regime. The nuclear genome has been sequenced for four of these strains, with the objective of increasing carbon flux through genetic engineering. Electroflocculation followed by osmotic membrane rupturing may be a very energy and cost efficient means of harvesting the lipid bodies from Dunaliella. A technically feasible and scalable thermo-catalytic process to convert the lipids into replacements for liquid transportation fuels has been developed. The lipids were converted into long-chain alkanes through continuous thermal hydrolysis followed by fed-batch thermo-catalytic decarboxylation. These alkanes can be reformed into renewable diesel via conventional catalytic hydrocarbon isomerization reactions to improve cold flow properties, if desired. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 32: 916-925, 2013 Copyright © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog.

AB  - The high fertilizer demand for biodiesel production from microalgae is a significant challenge facing the commercialization of this promising technology. We investigated a processing strategy called hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) to convert wet algal biomass into a lipid-rich hydrochar and aqueous phase (AP) co-product. By reacting biomass at 200°C for 15 min, about 50% of the algae biomass became a solid hydrochar and roughly 40-70% of the C, N, and P in the reactant material dissolved into the AP. For the first time, an AP co-product of this nature was analyzed by HPLC, GC-MS and FT-ICR-MS to identify and characterize the dissolved organic matter. Using a unique marine bi-culture suspected to contain a green algae (Nannochloris) and a cyanobacteria (Synechocystis), we demonstrated that this AP co-product can support biomass growth better than a medium containing only inorganic nutrients. To manage unwanted contamination and optimize AP utilization, we employed a two-stage growth process and fed-batch additions of the AP co-product. The effect of media recycling and nutrient supplementation, as well as a production model for a large-scale facility, are discussed. Our work suggests that HTC can play a critical role in making algal biorefineries more sustainable by obviating biomass drying for fuel processing and recycling nutrients. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 32: 962-975, 2013 Copyright © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog.

AB  - Holistic evaluation via a life cycle based approach is critical for guiding the environmentally conscious development of emerging microalgal biofuel pathways. This study models the energy return on investment (EROI) and life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for producing algal derived biodiesel and renewable diesel under different production pathways - consisting of a combination of algal cultivation, harvesting, extraction, and coproduct utilization scenarios. The results indicate that in the base-case scenario(s) the EROI for microalgae fuels range from 0.26 to 1.20 with GHG emissions ranging from 50 to 240 gCO2 equivalent/MJ-fuel depending on the choice of cultivation variables, coproduct utilization options, and processing technologies. In the improved scenario(s), algal fuels have an EROI ranging from 0.81 to 2.01 and GHG emissions ranging from 30 to 90 gCO2 eq./MJ-fuel. Furthermore, improved scenarios with favorable EROI and GHG emissions profile for microalgal biofuels are plagued with high technological uncertainty. This suggests that broad advances in algal technologies are required if algal fuels are to be competitive with other leading second generation and advanced biofuels. The choice of fuel conversion technology was found to have a comparatively small impact on overall life-cycle energy use and GHG emissions. Therefore, the choice of fuel product may be based on other criteria such as fuel storage stability and compatibility with transportation fuel infrastructure. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 32: 926-936, 2013 Copyright © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog.

AB  - In Brazil, and mainly in the State of Bahia, crude vegetable oils are widely used in the preparation of food. Street stalls, restaurants and canteens make a great use of palm oil and soybean oil. There is also some use of castor oil, which is widely cultivated in the Sertão Region (within the State of Bahia), and widely applied in industry. This massive use in food preparation leads to a huge amount of waste oil of different types, which needs either to be properly disposed of, or recovered. At the Laboratorio Energia e Gas-LEN (Energy & Gas lab.) of the Universidade Federal da Bahia, a cycle of experiments were carried out to evaluate the recovery of waste oils for biodiesel production. The experiences were carried out on a laboratory scale and, in a semi-industrial pilot plant using waste oils of different qualities. In the transesterification process, applied waste vegetable oils were reacted with methanol with the support of a basic catalyst, such as NaOH or KOH. The conversion rate settled at between 81% and 85% (in weight). The most suitable molar ratio of waste oils to alcohol was 1:6, and the amount of catalyst required was 0.5% (of the weight of the incoming oil), in the case of NaOH, and 1%, in case of KOH. The quality of the biodiesel produced was tested to determine the final product quality. The parameters analyzed were the acid value, kinematic viscosity, monoglycerides, diglycerides, triglycerides, free glycerine, total glycerine, clearness; the conversion yield of the process was also evaluated. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The oxidation of n-butyl formate, a potential biofuel candidate, is studied using three different experimental approaches. Ignition delay times have been measured for stoichiometric mixtures of fuel and air for pressures of about 20 and 90. bar at temperatures from 846 up to 1205. K in a high-pressure shock tube. A rapid compression machine has been used to determine the low-temperature ignition delay times for stoichiometric mixtures at pressures close to 20. bar over the temperature range from 646. K up to 861. K. Laminar burning velocities have been determined for stoichiometric ratios ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 using the high-pressure chamber method combined with an optical Schlieren cinematography setup in order to acquire experimental data at elevated pressures of about 10. bar and a temperature of 373. K. A detailed kinetic model has been constructed including high-temperature and low-temperature reaction pathways. The enthalpies of formation, entropies, and specific heats at constant pressure for the fuel, its primary radicals, and several combustion intermediates have been computed with the CBS-QB3 methods and included in the mechanism. This model was validated successfully against the presented data and used to elucidate the combustion of this interesting ester. The importance of accurate inclusion of the low-temperature peroxy chemistry has been highlighted through sensitivity and reaction path analysis. This study presents the first combustion study of n-butyl formate and leads to an improved understanding of the chemical kinetics of alkyl ester oxidation. © 2013 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - Alternative fuels are increasingly combusted in diesel- and gasoline engines and the contribution of such exhausts to the overall air pollution is on the rise. Recent findings on the possible adverse effects of biodiesel exhaust are contradictive, at least partly resulting from the various fuel qualities, engine types and different operation conditions that were tested. However, most of the studies are biased by undesired interactions between the exhaust samples and biological culture media. We here report how complete, freshly produced exhausts from fossil diesel (B0), from a blend of 20% rapeseed-methyl ester (RME) and 80% fossil diesel (B20) and from pure rapeseed methyl ester (B100) affect a complex 3D cellular model of the human airway epithelium invitro by exposing the cells at the air-liquid interface. The induction of pro-apoptotic and necrotic cell death, cellular morphology, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory responses were assessed. Compared to B0 exhaust, B20 exhaust decreased oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory responses, whereas B100 exhaust, depending on exposure duration, decreased oxidative stress but increased pro-inflammatory responses. The effects are only very weak and given the compared to fossil diesel higher ecological sustainability of biodiesel, it appears that - at least RME - can be considered a valuable alternative to pure fossil diesel. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - In this work, we propose pine oil biofuel, a renewable fuel obtained from the resins of pine tree, as a potential substitute fuel for a diesel engine. Pine oil is endowed with enhanced physical and thermal properties such as lower viscosity and boiling point, which enhances the atomization and fuel/air mixing process. However, the lower cetane number of the pine oil hinders its direct use in diesel engine and hence, it is blended in suitable proportions with diesel so that the ignition assistance could be provided by higher cetane diesel. Since lower cetane fuels are prone to more NOX formation, SCR (selective catalyst reduction), using urea as reducing agent, along with a CC (catalytic converter) has been implemented in the exhaust pipe. From the experimental study, the BTE (brake thermal efficiency) was observed to be increased as the composition of pine oil increases in the blend, with B50 (50% pine oil and 50% diesel) showing 7.5% increase over diesel at full load condition. The major emissions such as smoke, CO, HC and NOX were reduced by 70.1%, 67.5%, 58.6% and 15.2%, respectively, than diesel. Further, the average emissions of B50 with SCR and CC assembly were observed to be reduced, signifying the positive impact of pine oil biofuel on atmospheric environment. In the combustion characteristics front, peak heat release rate and maximum in-cylinder pressure were observed to be higher with longer ignition delay. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, hybrid fuels consisting of rapeseed oil/diesel blend, 1% aqueous ethanol and a surfactant (oleic acid/1-butanol mixture) were prepared and tested as a fuel in a direct injection (DI) diesel engine. The main fuel properties such as the density, viscosity and lower heating value (LHV) of these fuels were measured, and the engine performance, combustion and exhaust emissions were investigated and compared with that of diesel fuel. The experimental results showed that the viscosity and density of the hybrid fuels were decreased and close to that of diesel fuel with the increase of ethanol volume fraction up to 30%. The start of combustion was later than that of diesel fuel and the peak cylinder pressure, peak pressure rise rate and peak heat release rate were higher than those of diesel fuel. The brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of hybrid fuels was increased with the volume fraction of ethanol and higher than that of diesel. The brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) was almost identical for all test fuels. The smoke emissions were lower than those for diesel fuel at high engine loads, the NOx emissions were almost similar to those of diesel fuel, but CO and HC emissions were higher, especially at low engine loads. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Park Falls mill under Flambeau River Papers, Wisconsin, US, has succeeded in starting a new era of papermaking. The mill also has managed to set new production records almost every year. At purchase, it was producing about 135,000 tly of paper, a figure that has reached roughly 155,000 tly. Once buoyed by the buzz of a new and developing biofuel project intended to extract fuel from papermaking waste to power its plant and produce diesel fuel to sell, the mill had its sights set on leading the way on a new model for papermaking. Through a specialized extraction process, the mill produces more than 50,000 gallons of lignin each day, and the uses for lignosulfonate products range from sweeteners to animal feed additives to road dust control, opening the doors to a variety of new market segments.

AB  - Based on the observation, the analysis and the comparison of four smallholder based jatropha projects developed by Eco-Carbone, located in distinct climatic and socio-economical conditions, this paper aims at drawing on the operator's experience to show what are the social, technical and economical prerequisites and the necessary management strategies, for such projects to be a success, both for the project operator and the farmers. Beyond the climatic and soil conditions which need to be present, the existing dynamics of the farming system should be assessed in order to establish whether and how, jatropha can be integrated in the existing farming system. Jatropha shall represent only a complementary income to farmers' existing agriculture income; therefore, the time, capital and land that farmers will be ready to dedicate to this crop will be proportionate to the revenue they yield. It is also necessary to assess the government's energy policy in terms of subsidies and tax. The sale price of the oil and fertiliser will define the purchasing price of the grain from the farmers and therefore, the profitability of establishing jatropha plantations for the farmers and developing the whole project for the operator. A jatropha project will thrive if the mass of grains purchased from the farmers reaches the expected targets. Adapted cultivation practices and improved genetics shall be introduced to optimise the technical potential of jatropha. However, once the trees start producing, the purchasing price is a fundamental variable in the success of a jatropha project. It needs to be interesting enough for farmers to harvest, shell, dry and sell their grains. However, this level of price can be maintained as long as the project developer can ensure or anticipate sufficient value extraction from both oil and seedcake commercialization on the market. Until the trees reach full production, short-term revenue strategies need to be devised for the farmers and for the project operator. These include the production of annual cash crops intercropped with the jatropha which provide an income for the farmers and in some cases, they would also benefit from a share on the sale in advance of sequestration carbon credits generated by jatropha plantations that the project developer will conduct in order to finance the first years of the project. © Author(s) 2012.

AB  - The use of biofuels in the aviation sector has economic and environmental benefits. Among the options for the production of renewable jet fuels, hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) have received predominant attention in comparison with fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), which are not approved as additives for jet fuels. However, the presence of oxygen in methyl esters tends to reduce soot emissions and therefore particulate matter emissions. This sooting tendency is quantified in this work with an oxygen-extended sooting index, based on smoke point measurements. Results have shown considerable reduction in the sooting tendency for all biokerosenes (produced by transesterification and eventually distillation) with respect to fossil kerosenes. Among the tested biokerosenes, that made from palm kernel oil was the most effective one, and nondistilled methyl esters (from camelina and linseed oils) showed lower effectiveness than distilled biokerosenes to reduce the sooting tendency. These results may constitute an additional argument for the use of FAME's as blend components of jet fuels. Other arguments were pointed out in previous publications, but some controversy has aroused over the use of these components. Some of the criticism was based on the fact that the methods used in our previous work are not approved for jet fuels in the standard methods and concluded that the use of FAME in any amount is, thus, inappropriate. However, some of the standard methods are not updated for considering oxygenated components (like the method for obtaining the lower heating value), and others are not precise enough (like the methods for measuring the freezing point), whereas some alternative methods may provide better reproducibility for oxygenated fuels. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is an alternative raw material for the production of biofuels. The conversion of biomass to biofuels begins with pretreatment to produce amorphous cellulose which can be hydrolysed to sugars. The use of ionic liquids has been described as a new potentially viable development in this area. Nevertheless, phase equilibria with biomass-derived compounds and also sugars, is still lacking in the literature. To overcome the lack of experimental data on phase equilibria of biomass carbohydrates in ionic liquids, the solubility of fructose, sucrose and lactose in ionic liquids was measured within a temperature range from 280 K to 390 K. Solubility data were successfully correlated using NRTL and UNIQUAC thermodynamic models. In this work, the possibility of extracting carbohydrates from ionic liquids using ethanol has also been evaluated. Results indicate that ethanol could be used as an antisolvent to separate sugars from ionic liquids. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

AB  - Regulatory requirements for renewable content in diesel fuel have been adopted in Canada. Fatty acid alkyl esters, that is, biodiesel, will likely be used to meet the regulations. However, the impacts on ambient atmospheric pollutant concentrations and human health outcomes associated with the use of biodiesel fuel blends in heavy duty diesel vehicles across Canada have not been evaluated. The objective of this study was to assess the potential human health implications of the widespread use of biodiesel in Canada compared to those from ultralow sulfur diesel (ULSD). The health impacts/benefits resulting from biodiesel use were determined with the Air Quality Benefits Assessment Tool, based on output from the AURAMS air quality modeling system and the MOBILE6.2C on-road vehicle emissions model. Scenarios included runs for ULSD and biodiesel blends with 5 and 20% of biodiesel by volume, and compared their use in 2006 and 2020. Although modeling and data limitations exist, the results of this study suggested that the use of biodiesel fuel blends compared to ULSD was expected to result in very minimal changes in air quality and health benefits/costs across Canada, and these were likely to diminish over time. © Published 2013 by the American Chemical Society.

AB  - The application of atomic force microscopy (AFM) for characterization of electrospun microporous membranes was assessed. The surface roughness, pore size and its distribution, nodule size as well as fiber diameter were analyzed for an electrospun polystyrene membrane before (M1) and after surface modification via contact-heating (CH) method (M2). It was found that thermal modification has improved the overall surface morphology and topography, exhibiting a decrease in mean pore size and nodule size, lowering roughness parameters, which led to more uniform and circular pore geometry, and higher hydrophobicity. As a result, separation performance was improved when the membranes were used for the treatment of biodiesel's wash water effluent. It was also observed that both membranes were effective in treating the highly polluting saponified wastewater. In particular, the application of M1 resulted in the reduction rates of 58, 26, 92, 95 and 50%, respectively, for COD, BOD, TS, TDS and TSS. More promising reduction rates were achieved with M2, where those of COD, BOD, TS, TDS and TSS were at 75%, 55%, 92%, 96% and 30%, respectively. The multi-objective separation mechanism of electrospun membranes (screening, depth filtration and adsorption), could be the cause of their superior separation performance.© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Maximizing the efficiency and economic benefits of bio-oil is a major challenge for the emerging bio-refining industry. This research has developed a promising route to produce clean-fuel hydrogen with high value carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a by-product of the process via evaporation/pyrolysis-reforming of crude bio-oil. Since the waste catalyst coke is replaced by high-value CNTs, a potential significant increase of additional economic benefit could be contributed to the bio-refining process. Moreover, CO2 emission to the environment from the current practice of coke oxidation during catalyst regeneration would be reduced. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Valorization of oilseed processing wastes is thwarted due to the presence of several antinutritional factors such as phenolics, tannins, glucosinolates, allyl isothiocyanates, and phytates; moreover, literature reporting on their simultaneous extraction and subsequent practical application is scanty. Different solvent mixtures containing acetone or methanol pure or combined with water or an acid (hydrochloric, acetic, perchloric, trichloroacetic, phosphoric) were tested for their efficiency for extraction of these antinutritive compounds from rapeseed press-cake. Acidified extraction mixtures (nonaqueous) were found to be superior to the nonacidified ones. The characteristic differences in the efficacy of these wide varieties of solvents were studied by principal component analysis, on the basis of which the mixture 0.2% perchloric acid in methanol/acetone (1:1 v/v) was deemed as "the best" for detoxification of rapeseed meal. Despite its high reductive potential, hemolytic activity of the extract from this solvent mixture clearly indicated the toxicity of the above-mentioned compounds on mammalian erythrocytes. Because of the presence of a high amount of antinutritive antioxidants, the study was further extended to examine the influence of this solvent extract on the stability of waste cooking oil-derived biodiesel. Treatment with the extract harbored significant improvement (p < 0.05) in the induction periods and pronounced reduction in microbial load of stored biodiesel investigated herein. Thus, a suitable solvent system was devised for removing the major antinutrients from rapeseed press-cake, and the solvent extract can, thereafter, be used as an effective exogenous antioxidant for biodiesel. In other words, integrated valorization of two different industrial wastes was successfully achieved. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Highly polluting fuels based on non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels need to be replaced with potentially less polluting renewable fuels derived from vegetable or animal biomass, these so-called biofuels, are a reality nowadays and many countries have started the challenge of increasing the use of different types of biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel (fatty acid alkyl esters), often mixed with petroleum derivatives, such as gasoline and diesel, respectively. The quantitative determination of these fuel blends using simple, fast and low cost methods based on near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometric methods has been reported. However, advanced biofuels based on a mixture of hydrocarbons or a single hydrocarbon molecule, such as farnesane (2,6,10-trimethyldodecane), a hydrocarbon renewable diesel, can also be used in mixtures with biodiesel and petroleum diesel fuel and the use of NIR spectroscopy for the quantitative determination of a ternary fuel blend of these two hydrocarbon-based fuels and biodiesel can be a useful tool for quality control. This work presents a development of an analytical method for the quantitative determination of hydrocarbon renewable diesel (farnesane), biodiesel and petroleum diesel fuel blends using NIR spectroscopy combined with chemometric methods, such as partial least squares (PLS) and support vector machines (SVM). This development leads to a more accurate, simpler, faster and cheaper method when compared to the standard reference method ASTM D6866 and with the main advantage of providing the individual quantification of two different biofuels in a mixture with petroleum diesel fuel. Using the developed PLS model the three fuel blend components were determined simultaneously with values of root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.25%, 0.19% and 0.38% for hydrocarbon renewable diesel, biodiesel and petroleum diesel, respectively, the values obtained were in agreement with those suggested by reference methods for the determination of renewable fuels. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Purpose: Second-generation biofuel is regarded as a sustainable alternatives to fossil energy in transportation where electricity is not feasible. The main purpose of this study is to analyze how large-scale second-generation biofuel based on wood may affect the competitiveness of more mature bioenergy technologies such as bioheat through competition in the biomass market. The impacts on forest industries are also included. Design/methodology/approach: An economic model for the energy and forest sectors based on partial equilibrium modeling is used to quantify the impacts of four different locations of biofuel production in Norway. Findings: The results show that there are regional variations in biomass price effects depending on local raw material availability and costs of transport and import. Technologies allowing for a larger variety of wood biomass qualities will face lower biomass prices than technologies using only one species as raw material, causing less reduction in the production of bioheat and forest industrial products. For Norway specifically, the paper concludes that even if there is a potential for both increased bioheat generation and large-scale biofuel production, the production of second-generation biofuels based on domestic wood resources will cause a 5-20 percent reduction in bioheat generation depending on the scale of biofuel production. Research limitations/implications: This study demonstrates how impacts on biomass markets from establishment of biofuel production vary quite substantially with location, production level and choice of feedstock. One main finding is the quite large biomass cost impact that is seen in the model runs when introducing large-scale biofuel production. Increased biomass costs reduce the profitability and this must be taken into account when establishing a biofuel installation. Originality/value: The originality of the paper is the analyses of biofuel impacts with a detailed model for biomass supply as the bioenergy and forest sectors. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Middle distillate (MD) transportation fuels, including diesel and jet fuel, make up almost 30% of liquid fuel consumption in the United States. Alternative drop-in MD and biodiesel could potentially reduce dependence on crude oil and the greenhouse gas intensity of transportation. However, the water and land resource requirements of these novel fuel production technologies must be better understood. This analysis quantifies the lifecycle green and blue water consumption footprints of producing: MD from conventional crude oil; Fischer-Tropsch MD from natural gas and coal; fermentation and advanced fermentation MD from biomass; and hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids MD and biodiesel from oilseed crops, throughout the contiguous United States. We find that FT MD and alternative MD derived from rainfed biomass have lifecycle blue water consumption footprints of 1.6 to 20.1 Lwater/LMD, comparable to conventional MD, which ranges between 4.1 and 7.4 L water/LMD. Alternative MD derived from irrigated biomass has a lifecycle blue water consumption footprint potentially several orders of magnitude larger, between 2.7 and 22 600 Lwater/LMD. Alternative MD derived from biomass has a lifecycle green water consumption footprint between 1.1 and 19 200 Lwater/LMD. Results are disaggregated to characterize the relationship between geo-spatial location and lifecycle water consumption footprint. We also quantify the trade-offs between blue water consumption footprint and areal MD productivity, which ranges from 490 to 4200 LMD/ha, under assumptions of rainfed and irrigated biomass cultivation. Finally, we show that if biomass cultivation for alternative MD is irrigated, the ratio of the increase in areal MD productivity to the increase in blue water consumption footprint is a function of geo-spatial location and feedstock-to-fuel production pathway. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Debate about the biological effects of biodiesel exhaust emissions exists due to variation in methods of exhaust generation and biological models used to assess responses. Because studies in cells do not necessarily reflect the integrated response of a whole animal, experiments were conducted in two human cell lines representing bronchial epithelial cells and macrophages and female mice using identical particle suspensions of raw exhaust generated by a Volkswagen light-duty diesel engine using petrodiesel (B0) and a biodiesel blend (B20: 20% soy biodiesel/80% B0 by volume). Tailpipe particle emissions measurement showed B0 generated two times more particle mass, larger ultrafine particle number distribution modes, and particles of more nonpolar organic composition than the B20 fuel. Biological assays (inflammatory mediators, oxidative stress biomarkers) demonstrated that particulate matter (PM) generated by combustion of the two fuels induced different responses in in vitro and in vivo models. Concentrations of inflammatory mediators (Interleukin-6, IL-6; Interferon-gamma-induced Protein 10, IP-10; Granulocyte-stimulating factor, G-CSF) in the medium of B20-treated cells and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of mice exposed to B20 were ∼20-30% higher than control or B0 PM, suggesting that addition of biodiesel to diesel fuels will reduce PM emissions but not necessarily adverse health outcomes. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Autotrophic microalgae represent a potential feedstock for transportation fuels, but life cycle assessment (LCA) studies based on laboratory-scale or theoretical data have shown mixed results. We attempt to bridge the gap between laboratory-scale and larger scale biodiesel production by using cultivation and harvesting data from a commercial algae producer with ~1000m2 production area (the base case), and compare that with a hypothetical scaled up facility of 101,000m2 (the future case). Extraction and separation data are from Solution Recovery Services, Inc. Conversion and combustion data are from the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation Model (GREET). The LCA boundaries are defined as "pond-to-wheels". Environmental impacts are quantified as NER (energy in/energy out), global warming potential, photochemical oxidation potential, water depletion, particulate matter, and total NOx and SOx. The functional unit is 1MJ of energy produced in a passenger car. Results for the base case and the future case show an NER of 33.4 and 1.37, respectively and GWP of 2.9 and 0.18kg CO2-equivalent, respectively. In comparison, petroleum diesel and soy diesel show an NER of 0.18 and 0.80, respectively and GWP of 0.12 and 0.025, respectively. A critical feature in this work is the low algal productivity (3g/m2/day) reported by the commercial producer, relative to the much higher productivities (20-30g/m2/day) reported by other sources. Notable results include a sensitivity analysis showing that algae with an oil yield of 0.75kg oil/kg dry biomass in the future case can bring the NER down to 0.64, more comparable with petroleum diesel and soy biodiesel. An important assumption in this work is that all processes are fully co-located and that no transport of intermediate or final products from processing stage to stage is required. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Atmospheric aerosol samples of PM2.5 and PM10 were collected at a rural site in Tanzania, East Africa, in 2011 during wet and dry seasons and were analysed for carbonaceous components, levoglucosan, mannosan and water-soluble inorganic ions. The contributions of biomass/biofuel burning to the organic carbon (OC) and particulate matter (PM) mass were estimated to be 46-52% and 87-13%, respectively. The mean mass concentrations of PM 2.5 and PM10 were 28 ± 6 μg m-3 and 47 ± 8 μg m-3 in wet season, and 39 ±6 10 μg m-3 and 61 ± 19 μg m-3 in dry season, respectively. Total carbon (TC) accounted for 16-19% of the PM2.5 mass and 13-15% of the PM10 mass. On average, 86 to 89% of TC in PM2.5 and 87 to 90% of TC in PM10 was OC, of which 67-72% and 63% was found to be water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) in PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. We found that concentrations of levoglucosan and mannosan (specific organic tracers of pyrolysis of cellulose) well correlated with non-sea-salt potassium (nss-K+) (r2 Combining double low line 0.56-0.75), OC (r2 Combining double low line 0.75-0.96) and WSOC (i2 Combining double low line 0.52-0.78). The K+ OC ratios varied from 0.06 to 0.36 in PM2.5 and from 0.03 to 0.36 in PM10 with slightly higher ratios in dry season. Mean percent ratios of levoglucosan and mannosan to OC were found to be 3-4% for PM2.5 and PM10 in both seasons. We found lower levoglucosan K+ ratios and higher K+ EC (elemental carbon) ratios in the biomass-burning aerosols from Tanzania than those reported from other regions. This feature is consistent with the high levels of potassium reported in the soils of Morogoro, Tanzania, suggesting an importance of direct emission of potassium by soil resuspension although K+ is present mostly in fine particles. It is also likely that biomass burning of vegetation of Tanzania emits high levels of potassium that may be enriched in plant tissues. The present study demonstrates that emissions from mixed biomass- and biofuel-burning activities largely influence the air quality in Tanzania. © Author(s) 2013.

AB  - The friction and wear behaviors of different oils (micro-emulsified bio-oil and diesel fuel) under reciprocating sliding condition by a tribometer of piston ring-cylinder liner were investigated. The morphology of worn surface and the content of elements on worn surface were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The chemical states of several typical elements on the worn surface were examined by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The mechanisms of friction and wear was explored. The results show that the friction coefficient and wear of piston ring and cylinder liner increased with the reciprocating frequency under lubrication of micro-emulsified bio-oil. The friction reduction of micro-emulsified bio-oil was better than that of diesel fuel while wear resistance of piston ring and cylinder liner in micro-emulsified bio-oil was worse than that in diesel fuel. The mechanism of friction and wear was attributed to polar group in the micro-emulsified bio-oil which easily adsorbed on the rubbing surface and led to better lubrication. However, the corrosion role on the rubbing surface was enhanced and intensified the debris abrasion. Fe2O3 acted as abrasive particle and increased the wear.

AB  - This study compares the thermo-oxidative stability and cold flow properties of waste cooking oil (WCO) and castor oil (CO) as inexhaustible potential raw materials to replace the conventional diesel fuels. The thermo-oxidative stability and high viscosity are the limitations of the vegetable oils to use directly as fuel in diesel engines. Therefore, proper investigation on these physical properties of WCO and CO could help to develop high energy efficient biofuels which could act as an alternative to fossil fuels. This study proposes modern and advanced analytical techniques, i.e., thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) which consumes less time, energy, and requires less quantity of sample to evaluate aforementioned physical properties. For comparison purpose, properties were also found out using conventional ASTM standard methods. Obtained results by TGA and DSC were very much close to the conventional standard methods. WCO used in this study was found to be thermally more stable, but displays less oxidative stability than CO. Similarly, CO demonstrates improved cold flow properties, i.e., pour point (PP) than WCO. Higher oxidative stability and PP of CO attributed due to the presence of more mono-unsaturated fatty acids in its composition. Finally, from this communication, it can be concluded that the TGA and DSC studies proved as a reliable and efficient analytical techniques to determine thermo-oxidative stability and cold flow properties of virgin oils. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB  - Pyrolysis of soybean oil was carried out in a ZnCl2-KCl molten salt. The effects of feed rate, flow rate of carrier gas, pyrolysis temperature and input quantity were studied. And the compositions of the bio-oil were analyzed by GC-MS. The results show that the feed rate and carrier gas flow rate have great influences on the pyrolysis by changing the reaction residence time of soybean oil. When the feed rate is 1.2 g/min and without the carrier gas, the soybean oil can be fully cracked with the longer residence time. The gasification of the primary pyrolysis products is enhanced with the increasing of temperature, which leads to the yield, the content of oxygenated compounds and the acid value of bio-oil increase. With the increasing of input quantity, the yield of bio-oil is near 70% and keeps stable, but the decarboxylation effect decreases. The properties of bio-oil are improved and its component distribution is similar to the 0# diesel after catalytic hydrogenation.

AB  - Esterification of pyrolytic rubber seed oil with SO42-/ZrO2 soild acid as catalyst was investigated; the effects of zirconium sources, calcination time and temperature on the catalytic performance were considered. The acidic properties of the SO42-/ZrO2 catalyst were characterized by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) and pyridine adsorption infrared spectroscopy (Py-IR). The results indicated that the SO42-/ZrO2 solid acid prepared by using ZrOCl2 as zirconium source and calcined at 550°C for 4 h exhibits high catalytic activity and stability in the esterification of the pyrolytic rubber seed oil. The esterification product obtained as a bio-oil was superior to those prepared via conventional methods; its properties are similar to those of 0# diesel oil.

AB  - The increasing demand of petroleum based fuels and their use in internal combustion engines have adverse effect on air quality and climate change. Production of biofuels promises substantial improvement in air quality through reducing emission from biofuel operated vehicles. In this study the influence of the fuel mixture on EURO 5 vehicle exhaust emissions operating under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and in hot operating conditions was analysed. Distinct diesel/biodiesel ratios (B0 (100%/0%), B7 (93%/7%) and B20 (80%/20%), volume basis) were considered. Experiments were conducted on a chassis dynamometer examining several pollutants, namely: carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and total volatile organic compounds (VOC). Moreover, a VOC speciation analysis by gas chromatography was performed to explore the emission variations regarding a set of seventeen VOC.The biodiesel fuel blends showed significant differences in combustion efficiency. An increasing amount of biodiesel in the fuel results in decreasing trends regarding NO, and particulate matter emissions. However, nitrogen dioxide and total VOC emissions increase with the biofuel content in the fuel. Moreover, the VOC speciation analysis suggests that the set of VOC present in exhausted gases is clearly fuel dependent. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The tree legume Pongamia {Pongamia pinnata (L.) Pierre [syn. Millettia pinnata (L.) Panigrahi]} is emerging as an important biofuels feedstock. It produces about 30 kg per tree per year of seeds, containing up to 55% oil (w/v), of which approximately 50% is oleic acid (C18:1). The capacity for biological N fixation places Pongamia in a more sustainable position than current nonlegume biofuel feedstocks. Also due to its drought and salinity tolerance, Pongamia can grow on marginal land not destined for production of food. As part of the effort to domesticate Pongamia our research group at The University of Queensland has started to develop specific genetic and genomic tools. Much of the preliminary work to date has focused on characterizing the genetic diversity of wild populations. This diversity is reflective of the outcrossing reproductive biology of Pongamia and necessitates the requirement to develop clonal propagation protocols. Both the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of Pongamia have been sequenced and annotated (152,968 and 425,718 bp, respectively), with similarities to previously characterized legume organelle genomes. Many nuclear genes associated with oil biosynthesis and nodulation in Pongamia have been characterized. The continued application of genetic and genomic tools will support the deployment of Pongamia as a sustainable biofuel feedstock. © Crop Science Society of America.

AB  - Jatropha curcas has drawn the attention of researchers in recent times as a high potential substrate for production of biodiesel. However, like many other substrates, fuel properties of its biodiesel vary with such factors as growing and climatic conditions. This paper presents experimental results for jatropha methyl ester of Botswana's semiarid climatic conditions. Physicochemical properties, performance and emissions characteristics of jatropha methyl ester and its blends with petroleum diesel were investigated experimentally. The results showed that viscosity values for all fuels fall within specifications of American Standard Test Methods (ASTM), with a maximum variation of 21% observed between B0 and B100. Cold flow properties of cloud and pour points indicate that jatropha methyl ester and its blends can power the diesel engine without much difficulty in cold weather. The flash points of jatropha methyl ester and its blends were found to be lower than the ASTM specification of a minimum of 130°C, implying that the fuels are highly flammable and need extreme handling precaution during transportation. Biofuels depicted better engine performance when compared to petroleum diesel in terms of brake power, specific fuel consumption (SFC) and brake thermal efficiency (BTE). This is largely attributed to higher combustion efficiency due to extra inbound oxygen. Higher combustion efficiency of biofuels led to reduced production of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions when compared with petroleum diesel. Petroleum diesel was also observed to produce the highest proportion of soot during combustion in the magnitude of approximately 3% per 3ml of fuel. © 2006-2013 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. (Euphorbiaceae) oil has emerged as a potential candidate for the production of biodiesel across the world as well as in India. The present study was conducted on seeds sample of J. curcas collected from 14 different geographical location of India to assess the variability in its biochemical parameters (oil content and fatty acids) and K-SC ratio (ratio of dry mass of seed kernel to seed coat). Apart from descriptive statistical parameters, Pearson correlation analysis was done to study the association between various biochemical parameters and K-SC ratio. Effect of geographical parameters such as altitude and soil type was also studied. The oil content ranged from 11.68% to 42.08% and found affected by soil type. A significant (p&lt;0.01) positive correlation was observed between oil content and linoleic acid, total unsaturation and K-SC ratio. The data was analyzed for establishing a linear regression relation with the SPSS software. Statistical significant results (p=0) were obtained with the R2 value calculated as 0.179 for seed oil versus linoleic acid and 0.502 for seed oil versus K-SC ratio. The paired 't' test at 95% confidence interval showed no significant difference in the mean value calculated with regression equation and oil content calculated with soxtherm extraction. Hence, the established relation could be very well used for the preliminary screening of the J. curcas seeds sample. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper evaluates GHG emissions and energy balances (i.e. net energy value (NEV), net renewable energy value (NREV) and net energy ratio (NER)) of jatropha biodiesel as an alternative fuel in Tanzania by using life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. The functional unit (FU) was defined as 1tonne (t) of combusted jatropha biodiesel. The findings of the study provewrong the notion that biofuels are carbon neutral, thus can mitigate climate change. A net GHG equivalent emission of about 848kgt-1 was observed. The processes which accountsignificantly to GHG emissions are the end use of biodiesel (about 82%) followed by farming of jatropha for about 13%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that replacing diesel with biodiesel in irrigation of jatropha farms decreases the net GHG emissions by 7.7% while avoiding irrigation may reduce net GHG emissions by 12%. About 22.0GJ of energy is consumed to produce 1t of biodiesel. Biodiesel conversion found to be a major energy consuming process (about 64.7%) followed by jatropha farming for about 30.4% of total energy. The NEV is 19.2GJt-1, indicating significant energy gain of jatropha biodiesel. The NREV is 23.1GJt-1 while NER is 2.3; the two values indicate that large amount of fossil energy is used to produce biodiesel. The results of the study are meant to inform stakeholders and policy makers in the bioenergy sector.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel, the mono-alkyl esters of vegetable oils, animal fats or other triacylglycerol-containing materials and an alternative to conventional petroleum-based diesel fuel, has been derived from a variety of feedstocks. Numerous feedstocks have been investigated as potential biodiesel sources, including commodity oils, however, the methyl esters of avocado and olive oil would likely be suitable as biodiesel fuel. In order to expand the database and comprehensive evaluation of the properties of vegetable oil esters, in this work the fuel-related properties of avocado and olive oil methyl esters, which exhibit similar fatty acid profiles including high oleic acid content, are determined. The cetane numbers of avocado oil methyl esters and olive oil methyl esters are relatively high, determined as 59.2 and 62.5, respectively, due to their elevated content of methyl oleate. Other properties are well within the ranges specified in biodiesel standards. The cloud points of both esters are slightly above 0°C due to their content of saturated esters, especially methyl palmitate. Overall, avocado and olive oil yield methyl esters with fuel properties comparable to methyl esters from other commodity vegetable oils.© 2013 .

AB  - Chlorella pyrenoidosa was grown in mixotrophic condition in presence of sodium acetate and glycerol. Nearly, six fold enhancement in biomass productivity and a remarkable 32 fold increment in lipid productivity were recorded in cultures grown with sodium acetate (10gm-3) in comparison to autotrophic culture. With glycerol (0.5% by volume fraction), the biomass productivity and lipid productivity were three times and twenty times higher as compared to control. Glycerol proved to be more beneficial in lipid accumulation produces lipid content of 17.3%, which is about seven times higher to that of the control. While, lipid content with sodium acetate was 13.5%, more than five times of control. Oil samples collected from C. pyrenoidosa were converted into fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) through acid based transesterification and characterised by GC-MS. The fatty acid profiles of mixotrophic cultures showed its suitability for biofuel production than autotrophic cultures. The content of palmitic acid (C-16) and oleic acid (C-18) (indicator of biodiesel quality) is much higher in mixotrophic cultures than autotrophic cultures. C. pyrenoidosa, has shown significant improvement in growth and quantity as well as quality of lipid with acetate and glycerol. This provides a better way to produce biofuel at reduced overall cost since these substrates can be obtained as waste byproducts of some processes like biohydrogen production and biodiesel production.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Renewable fuel is playing an increasingly important role as a substitute for fossil based energy. The US Department of Energy (DOE) has identified pyrolysis based platforms as promising biofuel production pathways. In this paper, we present a general biofuel supply chain model with a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) methodology to investigate the biofuel supply chain facility location, facility capacity at strategic levels, and biofuel production decisions at operational levels. In the model, we accommodate different biomass supplies and biofuel demands with biofuel supply shortage penalty and storage cost. The model is then applied to corn stover fast pyrolysis pathway with upgrading to hydrocarbon fuel since corn stover is the main feedstock for second generation biofuel production in the US Midwestern states. Numerical results illustrate unit cost for biofuel production, biomass, and biofuel allocation. The case study demonstrates the economic feasibility of producing biofuel from biomass at a commercial scale in Iowa.© 2013.

AB  - Biofuels are considered as a climate-friendly energy alternative. However, their environmental sustainability is increasingly debated because of land competition with food production, negative carbon balances and impacts on biodiversity. Arid and semi-arid lands have been proposed as a more sustainable alternative without such impacts. In that context this paper evaluates the carbon balance of potential land conversion to Jatropha cultivation, biofuel production and use in arid and semi-arid areas. This evaluation includes the calculation of carbon debt created by these land conversions and calculation of the minimum Jatropha yield necessary to repay the respective carbon debts within 15 or 30 years.The carbon debts caused by conversion of arid and semi-arid lands to Jatropha vary largely as a function of the biomass carbon stocks of the land use types in these regions. Based on global ecosystem carbon mapping, cultivated lands and marginal areas (sparse shrubs, herbaceous and bare areas) show to have similar biomass carbon stocks (on average 4-8tCha-1) and together cover a total of 1.79billionha. Conversion of these lands might not cause a carbon debt, but still might have a negative impact on other sustainability dimensions (e.g. biodiversity or socio-economics). Jatropha establishment in shrubland (0.75 billion ha) would cause a carbon debt of 24-28tCha-1 on average (repayable within 30year with yield of 3.5-3.9tseed ha-1yr-1). Land use change in the 1.15 billion ha of forested area under arid and semi-arid climates could cause a carbon debt between 70 and 118t Cha-1. This debt requires 8.6-13.9tseed production ha-1yr-1 for repayment within 30 years. If repayment is required within 15 years, the necessary minimum yields almost double. Considering that 5tseedha-1yr-1 is the current maximum Jatropha yield, conversion of forests cannot be repaid within one human generation. Repayment of carbon debt from shrubland conversions in 30 years is challenging, but feasible. Repayment in 15 year is currently not attainable.Based on this analysis the paper discusses the carbon mitigation potential of biofuels in arid and semi-arid environments. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Second-generation biofuel production facilities have been slower to reach large-scale production than was anticipated a few years ago even though in Europe, the Renewable Energy Directive provides incentives; in the United States there are also financial incentives and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 has targets for second-generation biofuels. But starting in 2013 it appears that significant quantities of second-generation biofuels will be produced. A variety of conversion processes, thermochemical and biological, as well as hybrids of the two is being utilized. There will be a variety of fuels - ethanol, drop-in fuels (e.g. gasoline, diesel), biodiesel, steam, electricity, bio-oil, sugars, and chemicals; and a variety of feedstocks - crop residues, wood, wood wastes, energy crops, waste oils and municipal solid waste (MSW). One approach to reducing the risk of moving from first- to second-generation biofuel production has been to take incremental steps such as converting the cellulosic part of grains into ethanol in addition to the starch portion. Many of the second-generation biofuel facilities are co-located with first-generation biofuel production facilities to share infrastructure as well as trade by-products (e.g. excess steam). One of the challenges has been financing, but both private and government sources are being utilized. Private sources include internal corporate funds and debt offerings, and venture capital. Government sources include the US federal government, the European Union, European national governments, and state and local governments. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Conventional petroleum-based jet fuels, including Jet A-1, are not renewable and generate a considerable amount of particulate and gaseous pollutants. Non-edible low cost vegetable oil such as waste vegetable oil (WVO) and Jatropha curcas can be used as feedstock for jet biofuel production with positive influence on the world climate change. In this work, an aviation biofuel was produced through blending of the methyl esters of waste vegetable and jatropha oils with Jet A-1 aviation fuel. A process was designed and fabricated to pretreat the waste vegetable oil obtained from local restaurant by means of dewatering and filtration to remove water and solid contaminants, respectively. Waste oil and J. curcas oil were converted to their methyl esters through a two-step catalytic reaction. Several blends of the produced methyl esters with Jet A-1 were prepared and characterized to determine the most suitable ratio based on the jet fuel specifications. The characterizations confirm that the jet biofuel with 10 and 20% methyl ester contents have comparable properties with the commercial available aviation fuel. Production of jet biofuel from waste vegetable and jatropha oil can be an alternative to reduce the amount of waste oil being disposed, to address the problems of energy and food self-sufficiency and to produce a clean fuel. © 2013 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

Economic indexes related to biodiesel production features, as well as the competitiveness between selling prices of biodiesel and petrodiesel were considered. It was found that all of the 8 simulated scenarios were potentially profitable, but only 2 of them presented competitive biodiesel selling prices, being considered as worthwhile projects. These were seed-oil plants with alkaline transesterification. Results also indicated that the success of biodiesel production still requires additional revenues beyond that derived from biodiesel itself, including income from the feedstock coproducts and glycerol. Macauba showed to be a potential crop to be used in biodiesel production. However, the domestication and improvement on processing of this species are indispensable to ensure its availability of long-term use. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents application of biodiesel produced from bael (Aegle marmelos) seed oil in a single cylinder diesel engine and compares biodiesel performance and emissions characteristics with petro diesel. Performance parameters of B20 (Brake thermal efficiency and Brake Specific Energy Consumption) were quite close to petroleum diesel. B20 emits lesser emissions (CO, HC, NOx, andCO2) than petro diesel except smoke level. Thus, B20 (20% biodiesel + 80% diesel, by volume) can be effectively used as diesel fuel substitute in existing diesel engine without any engine modification.

AB  - Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz in the last few years is garnering a lot of attention as a biofuel and as raw material for the chemical industry due to its high oil productivity. However the high percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids of camelina oil (over 50%), which is rich in linolenic acid (37-40%) limits its commercial value and large-scale production. To improve the oil quality and its oxidative stability the methyl esters have been selectively hydrogenated using a non-toxic and non-pyrophoric heterogeneous copper catalyst (Cu/SiO2 or Cu/Al2O3). Our results showed that both catalysts are able to reduce the linolenic acid content below 1% while selectively increasing the monounsaturated one. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biodiesel production is not economically competitive with petroleum diesel particularly when using virgin and refined vegetable oils. Rich-in-oil miscella obtained from the extraction of soybean oil with ethanol may be a promising feedstock for taking off the refining process, simultaneously introducing an environmental friendly step by replacing hexane by ethanol as a renewable solvent in the oil extraction process. The aim of this study was to investigate the production of biodiesel from the oil-ethanol miscella by direct transesterification using Novozym®435 as catalyst and ethanol as acyl acceptor; simultaneously optimizing the process by response surface methodology and enzyme reuse. RESULTS: The best experimental conditions indicated by the empirical model were temperature 40°C, oil:ethanol molar ratio 1:4.5 and catalyst concentration 9.5% for 24h, reaching 85.4% fatty acid ethylic esters (FAEE) yield. Tert-butanol used as co-solvent increased the ethyl esters yield from 18%, keeping a high FAEE yield (over 70%) for more than 3cycles of enzyme reuse. CONCLUSIONS: Rich miscella has great potential as a low cost feedstock for biodiesel production when Novozym®435 is used as catalyst, simultaneously introducing an environmentally friendly step by using the renewable solvent ethanol in the extraction and transesterification. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - This paper addresses B5 biodiesel programs in Malaysia, global challenges on the production of palm oil. Protective measures for future efficiency as well as continued viability of this renewable energy sector are also discussed. Crude palm oil (CPO) prices are currently suppressed because of high palm oil inventory. Malaysian government has taken a pro-active step in implementing the B5 biodiesel for transportation and industrial sectors through the introduction of B5 biodiesel. The B5 Biodiesel Program which was initially targeted at selected government agencies has been fully implemented for subsidized sectors in the Central Region. The promotion of B5 development is highly attractive due to its potential local feedstock from palm oil industry and the availability of production technologies that offer opportunities for the sustainable development in energy entrepreneurships. Nationally, produced B5 will improve the access to alternative energy services and is expected to help in improving productivity and sustainability. Despite successful local B5 implementation, Malaysia is recently facing global challenges on the biodiesel production which currently remains stagnant due to weak domestic demand and uncompetitive export tax structure. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper evaluates next generation biomass derived fuels for the transport sector, employing the Analytic Hierarchy Process. Eight different alternatives of fuels are considered in this paper: bio-hydrogen, bio-synthetic natural gas, bio-dimethyl ether, bio-methanol, hydro thermal upgrading diesel, bio-ethanol, algal biofuel and electricity from biomass incineration. The evaluation of alternative fuels is performed according to various criteria that include economic, technical, social and policy aspects. In order to evaluate each alternative fuel, one base scenario and five alternative scenarios with different weight factors selection per criterion are presented. After deciding the alternative fuels' scoring against each criterion and the criteria weights, their synthesis gives the overall score and ranking for all alternative scenarios. It is concluded that synthetic natural gas and electricity from biomass incineration are the most suitable next generation biomass derived fuels for the transport sector. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper uses a new approach of retro-analysis. Typically policy is informed by forward-looking analysis of potential for alternative energy technologies. But historical knowledge of energy and processing requirements and greenhouse effects is more reliable for engineering evaluation of biofuel production systems. This study calculates energy inputs and greenhouse gas emissions for the most efficient biomass feedstocks in New Zealand if the policy had been implemented to maximize liquid biofuel production in the year 2004/2005. The study uses existing processing technologies and agricultural statistics. Bioethanol production is calculated from putrescible wastes and starch crops, and biodiesel production from rapeseed, tallow, wood and waste paper. Each production system is further evaluated using measures of land use, energy input, crop production related to the energy product, plus relative measures of efficiency and renewability. The research findings are that maximum biofuel production in 2004/2005 would have provided only a few per cent of demand, and would not have reduced dependence on foreign imported oil or exposure to fuel price rise. Finally, we conclude that demand management and efficiency are more effective means of meeting policy objectives. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The methodology described in this paper, based on reaction, adsorption and environmental variables, lead to the identification of dimethyl sulfoxide as the solvent that best fitted the specifications of such reactive-adsorptive processes. Furthermore, a detailed study of the acetalization of glycerol in the presence of this solvent and using Amberlyst-15 as catalyst, allowed the determination of its reaction activation energy, 77.7kJmol-1. The reaction rate was described by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson model, and was obtained from batch experiments with a complete model considering diffusion inside the catalyst particles. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - For the first time, we apply the wavelet coherence methodology on biofuels (ethanol and biodiesel) and a wide range of related commodities (gasoline, diesel, crude oil, corn, wheat, soybeans, sugarcane and rapeseed oil). This way, we are able to investigate dynamics of correlations in time and across scales (frequencies) with a model-free approach. We show that correlations indeed vary in time and across frequencies. We find two highly correlated pairs which are strongly connected at low frequencies - ethanol with corn and biodiesel with German diesel - during almost the whole analyzed period (2003-2011). Structure of correlations remarkably changes during the food crisis - higher frequencies become important for both mentioned pairs. This implies that during stable periods, ethanol is correlated with corn and biodiesel is correlated with German diesel mainly at low frequencies so that they follow a common long-term trend. However, in the crisis periods, ethanol (biodiesel) is led by corn (German diesel) even at high frequencies (low scales), which implies that the biofuels prices react more rapidly to the changes in their producing factors. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article addresses the life-cycle assessment of an energy conversion system for the coproduction of fuels and electricity from a gasification-based biosyngas feedstock via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis coupled with a combined-cycle process. Inventory data obtained mainly through process simulation are used to evaluate the environmental performance of the system in terms of abiotic depletion, global warming, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, land competition, acidification, and eutrophication. Furthermore, the cumulative non-renewable energy demand of the system is quantified and used in the calculation of the life-cycle energy balance of the system, which is found to be positive.Biosyngas generation arises as the main source of impact, with a much higher contribution than the rest of processes (production of catalysts, waste treatment, etc.). Electricity, diesel, gasoline and surplus hydrogen are the products of the system. The environmental profiles of these bioproducts are calculated and compared with those of fossil diesel, rapeseed biodiesel, soybean biodiesel, fossil gasoline, corn bioethanol, steam-methane reforming hydrogen, and the EU electrical grid. Overall, the bioproducts from the evaluated system are found to be promising alternatives to current energy products from a life-cycle environmental perspective. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A one-step process was applied to directly converting wet oil-bearing microalgae biomass of Chlorella pyrenoidosa containing about 90% of water into biodiesel. In order to investigate the effects of water content on biodiesel production, distilled water was added to dried microalgae biomass to form wet biomass used to produce biodiesel. The results showed that at lower temperature of 90°C, water had a negative effect on biodiesel production. The biodiesel yield decreased from 91.4% to 10.3% as water content increased from 0% to 90%. Higher temperature could compensate the negative effect. When temperature reached 150°C, there was no negative effect, and biodiesel yield was over 100%. Based on the above research, wet microalgae biomass was directly applied to biodiesel production, and the optimal conditions were investigated. Under the optimal conditions of 100 mg dry weight equivalent wet microalgae biomass, 4 mL methanol, 8 mL n-hexane, 0.5 M H2SO4, 120°C, and 180 min reaction time, the biodiesel yield reached as high as 92.5% and the FAME content was 93.2%. The results suggested that biodiesel could be effectively produced directly from wet microalgae biomass and this effort may offer the benefits of energy requirements for biodiesel production. © 2013 Hechun Cao et al.

AB  - Microbial fatty acid-derived fuels have emerged as promising alternatives to petroleum-based transportation fuels. Here we report a modular engineering approach that systematically removed metabolic pathway bottlenecks and led to significant titre improvements in a multi-gene fatty acid metabolic pathway. On the basis of central pathway architecture, E. coli fatty acid biosynthesis was re-cast into three modules: the upstream acetyl coenzyme A formation module; the intermediary acetyl-CoA activation module; and the downstream fatty acid synthase module. Combinatorial optimization of transcriptional levels of these three modules led to the identification of conditions that balance the supply of acetyl-CoA and consumption of malonyl-CoA/ACP. Refining protein translation efficiency by customizing ribosome binding sites for both the upstream acetyl coenzyme A formation and fatty acid synthase modules enabled further production improvement. Fed-batch cultivation of the engineered strain resulted in a final fatty acid production of 8.6 g l-1. The modular engineering strategies demonstrate a generalized approach to engineering cell factories for valuable metabolites production. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative to the diesel fuel that can be produced from different kinds of vegetable oils. It is an oxygenated, non-toxic, sulphur-free, biodegradable, and renewable fuel and can be used in diesel engines without any hardware modifications. In the present work, the cottonseed oil methyl ester was prepared by a method of transesterification process. The experiment was conducted in a direct injection (DI) marine diesel engine with diesel and biodiesel blends of 20 % and 100% in volume with different load conditions. The effects of biodiesel addition to diesel fuel on the performance, emissions and combustion characteristics in a diesel engine were examined. A small increase in specific fuel consumption (SFC) and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) for biodiesel and its blends were observed when compared with diesel fuel. The significant reduction of hydro carbon (HC) and smoke emission were found for biodiesel and its blends at full loads. Nitrogen oxide (NO) was slightly higher for biodiesel and its blends. The significant reduction of NO and a marginal increase in CO2 were found when selective catalytic reduction (SCR) method was used. The use of transesterified cottonseed oil can be partially substituted for the diesel fuel at most operating conditions in terms of the performance parameters and emissions without any engine modification. © Research India Publications.

AB  - Five regions of Ethiopia were identified as potential sites for the algal biomass cultivation considering both sunlight and local climatic conditions. The meteorological data, sunlight and air temperature information for the identified potential sites were used as a basis to estimate annual biomass production, lipid production and carbon sequestration potential. An average upper biomass, oil yield and carbon fixation potential were calculated to be 291.6 ton/ha/yr, 101,249.2 L/ha/yr. and 82.7 tonCO2/ha/yr. This study provides a baseline data for theoretical estimates of open pond microalgae production systems in Ethiopia. This study will support the Ethiopian government in its Energy and Food Security policy to promote the use of indigenous and renewable sources of energy for transportation fuels and income generation.

AB  - Climate change and global public health is a growing concern among the pulmonary care community. The Turkish Thoracic Society and the American Thoracic Society held special sessions during their 2013 annual conferences to discuss the impact of climate change on the environment and public health. These sessions are summarized in this review to illustrate the global consequences of climate change. Climate and its impact on air pollution and the relative incidence, timing and length of allergens in the atmosphere (pollen and allergen season) are presented. The influence of climate change on housing, indoor air quality and public health is discussed, along with how climate change is uniquely affecting low resource countries due to the process of desertification and its impact on water and food. The European and Caribbean perspectives of climate change on human vulnerability and adaption strategies are discussed, along with how federal and global policies might be implemented to mitigate the effects of climate change. © 2013 by Turkish Thoracic Society.

AB  - The aim of this research work is to investigate the possibility of using methyl esters from animal fats as an alternative fuel for diesel. Biodiesel is an alternative fuel produced from different kinds of vegetable oils and animal fats. It is an oxygenated, non-toxic, sulfur free, biodegradable, and renewable fuel which can be used in diesel engines without any significant modification. In this research work, waste pork lard methyl ester (WPLME) is obtained from inedible animal tallow, namely, waste pork lard by base-catalyzed transesterification with methanol in the presence of potassium hydroxide (KOH) as catalyst. Properties of pure diesel, pure biodiesel (B100), and its blends of 25%, 50%, and 75% by volume called B25, B50, and B75 are determined. The effects of waste pork lard methyl ester (biodiesel) addition to pure diesel on the performance, emission, and combustion characteristics of naturally aspirated, direct injection, diesel engine have been experimentally investigated at the maximum torque and constant engine speed of 1500 rpm. The experimental test results showed that the addition of WPLME to diesel slightly decreases the brake thermal efficiency of the engine and increases specific fuel consumption when compared to pure diesel. This is due to lower calorific value of WPLME. The brake thermal efficiency is decreased by 6.2% and specific fuel consumption is increased by 23.5% for pure WPLME (B100) when compared to pure diesel at full load of the engine. However for B25 biodiesel blend, the brake thermal efficiency is very close to pure diesel at full load of the engine. The significant improvement in reduction of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and smoke emission is found for WPLME and its blends during higher loading conditions. For pure WPLME, CO, HC, NOx, and smoke emission are decreased by 23.1%, 31.5%, 5.15%, and 64%, respectively, when compared to pure diesel at full load of the engine. WPLME exhibited lower heat release rate and shorter ignition delay when compared to pure diesel at full load conditions. On the whole, methyl esters of waste pork lard and its blends can be used as an alternative fuel for diesel in direct injection diesel engine without any significant engine modification. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The present work is concerned with the performance, emission, and combustion characteristics of vegetable oil esters with varying saturated and unsaturated fatty acid composition tested in a stationary direct injection compression ignition engine. Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) are long-chain carboxylic acids that usually have between 12 and 24 carbon atoms and have no double bonds. Unsaturated fatty acids resemble SFAs, except that the chain has one or more double bonds. SFAs have all the hydrogen that the carbon atom can hold and therefore have no double bond between the carbon atoms. The biodiesels were derived from Pongamia, Ricebran, Sunflower, and Palm oil, respectively. The results show that Pongamia biodiesel gives a higher brake thermal efficiency (33.36% when compared to diesel, which has 32.57%) slightly higher Oxides of Nitrogen [NOX] and reduced carbon monoxide (CO), unburnt hydrocarbon (UHC), and smoke emissions when compared to diesel and other biodiesels. The cetane number for Pongamia oil, Ricebran oil, Sunflower oil, Palm oil, and diesel are 52, 50, 51, 56, and 48, respectively. The higher cetane number reduces ignition delay and also reduces NOX emissions when compared to other esters that have a greater unsaturated fatty acid composition. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The economic feasibility and the technical consistency of a system to produce biofuels were analyzed in Central Chile in the year 2010. In this study, the biodiesel, ethanol, and biogas platforms were integrated to assess the internal rate of return (IRR) and net present value (NPV) indexes. The analysis included the influence of the type of alcohol used in the manufacture of biodiesel (ethanol versus methanol), the effect of the relative size of the platform of ethanol with respect to biodiesel, and the impact of the value of main agricultural feedstocks. The study used combinations of plant sizes of 10 000-20 000 m3 y-1 for ethanol, and 20 000-40 000 m3 y-1 for biodiesel, and in all the cases the biogas platform was projected with a generating capacity of 1 MW of electricity. The mass and energy flows were obtained through the balance of mass and energy of the integrated system. All cases studied showed that the impact of the price of grain was greater for ethanol than for biodiesel. According to the economic approach based on the NPV, the system presents negative economical indexes. Sensitivity analysis showed that for production of biodiesel with both methanol and ethanol the monetary flows are negative. There was a minimal change in NPV values with different interest rates of 10, 12 and 15 %. The analysis showed that no capital increase is generated as a result of the project, for any of the three scenarios.

AB  - The use of biodiesel (BD) or its blends with petroleum diesel (D) is considered to be a viable approach to reduce occupational and environmental exposures to particulate matter (PM). Due to its lower particulate mass emissions compared to D, use of BD is thought to alleviate adverse health effects. Considering BD fuel is mainly composed of unsaturated fatty acids, we hypothesize that BD exhaust particles could induce pronounced adverse outcomes, due to their ability to readily oxidize. The main objective of this study was to compare the effects of particles generated by engine fueled with neat BD and neat petroleum-based D. Biomarkers of tissue damage and inflammation were significantly elevated in lungs of mice exposed to BD particulates. Additionally, BD particulates caused a significant accumulation of oxidatively modified proteins and an increase in 4-hydroxynonenal. The up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines/growth factors was higher in lungs upon BD particulate exposure. Histological evaluation of lung sections indicated presence of lymphocytic infiltrate and impaired clearance with prolonged retention of BD particulate in pigment laden macrophages. Taken together, these results clearly indicate that BD exhaust particles could exert more toxic effects compared to D. © 2013.

AB  - Compositions of deposits forming on engines parts operated with landfill gas (LFG) were analyzed. The deposit compositions were compared before and after the installation of activated carbon system for treatment of LFG. Deposits forming on the spark plugs had significantly higher levels of calcium, chromium, and nickel in comparison to those forming on the engine heads. The LFG contained about 9.5±0.4mg/m3 total siloxanes, majority of which were octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) (5.0±0.2mg/m3), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) (2.9±0.1mg/m3) and hexamethyldisiloxane (L2) (1.6±0.1mg/m3). The samples collected from the engine heads before the activated carbon treatment of LFG had significantly high levels of silicon (149,400±89,900mg/kg) as well as calcium (70,840±17,750mg/kg), sulfur (42,500±11,500mg/kg), and zinc (22,300±7200mg/kg). After the activated carbon treatment, silicon levels decreased significantly; however, deposits had higher sulfur content (104,560±68,100mg/kg) indicating that the activated carbon released some sulfur during treatment. The analyses indicate that zinc and calcium originated from the additives in the lube oil while lead, aluminum, copper, nickel, iron, chromium were due to the engine wear. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel is an important business opportunity in the green economy and it was supported by European energy policy. The patterns of investments in this industry are analyzed considering a number of criteria. Some of the risk factors identified are economic risk factors, political risk factors, and social and environmental factors. Investments could be financed using investment funds, loans or governmental programs. Central to increasing the return on investments is the supply activity, which has direct effect on the competitiveness of biofuels. Perfecting the structure of supply is likely to occur for oilseeds purchase at a great price in the market. Meanwhile, high export and low yield seeds of these crops in our country hinders the achievement of significant managerial performance.

AB  - A series of experiments were carried out with three native strains of microalgae to measure growth rates, biomass, and lipid productivities. Scenedesmus sp. IMMTCC-6 had better biomass growth rate and higher lipid production. The growth, lipid accumulation, and carbon dioxide (CO2) consumption rate of Scenedesmus sp. IMMTCC-6 were tested under different NaOH concentrations in modified BBM. The algal strain showed the maximum specific growth rate (0.474/day), biomass productivity (110.9 mg l-1d-1), and CO2 consumption rate (208.4 mg l-1d-1) with an NaOH concentration of 0.005 M on the 8th day of cultivation. These values were 2.03-, 6.89-, and 6.88-fold more than the algal cultures grown in control conditions (having no NaOH and CO2). The CO2 fixing efficiency of the microalga with other alternative carbon sources like Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 was also investigated and compared. The optimized experimental parameters at shake-flask scale were implemented for scaling up the process in a self-engineered photobioreactor. A significant increase in lipid accumulation (14.23% to 31.74%) by the algal strain from the logarithmic to stationary phases was obtained. The algal lipids were mainly composed of C16/C118 fatty acids, and are desirable for biodiesel production. The study suggests that microalga Scenedesmus sp. IMMTCC-6 is an efficient strain for biodiesel production and CO2 biofixation using stripping solution of NaOH in a cyclic process. © 2013 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - The effect of nutrient production on life cycle analysis (LCA) of energy use and greenhouse gas emissions for algal biofuels can be significant, yet recent algal biofuel LCAs vary significantly in their estimates for contributions from fertilizer production. Given the uncertainty in emissions associated with fertilizer manufacturing and the possibility that they play a significant role in algae LCA, this report examined nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer production in the U.S. by way of a detailed examination and analysis of published data. We found that the energy use and emissions of algae fertilizers derive from the manufacturing of just a few key reagents, namely ammonia and phosphoric acid. Under the assumption that large-scale algae growth will utilize commodity chemicals, the life cycle inventory centers on a few processes. We report relatively consistent values in the literature for these processes, suggest representative values to use in future LCA work, and discuss proper handling of fossil carbon in urea. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With the use of the Engine Exhaust Particle Sizer (EEPS), a study on the characteristics of particle emissions was carried out on a China-IV diesel bus fueled with blends of 5%, 10%, 20%, 50% bio-diesel transformed from restaurant waste oil and China-IV diesel (marked separately by BD5, BD10, BD20, BD50), pure bio-diesel (BD100) and pure diesel (BD0). The results indicated that particulate number (PN) and mass (PM) emissions of bio-diesel blends increased with the increase in bus speed and acceleration; with increasing bio-diesel content, particulate emissions displayed a relevant declining trend. In different speed ranges, the size distribution of particulate number emissions (PNSD) was bimodal; in different acceleration ranges, PNSD showed a gradual transition from bimodal shape to unimodal when bus operation was switched from decelerating to accelerating status. Bio-diesel blends with higher mixture ratios showed significant reduction in PN emissions for accumulated modes, and the particulate number emission peaks moved towards smaller sizes; but little change was obtained in PN emissions for nuclei modes; reduction also occurred in particle geometric diameter (Dg).

AB  - The renewable energy sector (RES) often receives financial, institutional or educational support from the government. A significant challenge for the actors in the RES field is policy consistency. When investments are carried out, a prognosis for future policies must be made. If the future is uncertain, larger risk margins should be included in the investment appraisals. Sudden, unexpected policy changes are one type of uncertainty that makes it more difficult to attract capital. In this article, we discuss the consequences of discontinuities in policy support using a case study approach. In Ontario, feed-in tariffs were introduced in 2009 and resulted in a large uptake in the programme. In 2010, the subsidies were drastically cut, resulting in the RES community losing confidence that the government would offer consistent support to the sector. In Norway, a large new biodiesel plant was opened by the Minister of the Environment only a few weeks before the government announced a major change in the bioenergy policy. As a result, the new plant was closed and restructured, and the investors lost nearly all of their investments. The government lost political credibility, making it difficult to raise private capital for new investments in this sector in Norway. We do not argue that policies should not be changed, but the manner in which policies are changed plays an important role. Our study shows that large, unexpected changes in policies increase uncertainty and may have a negative impact on investments. This topic should be further researched. © 2013.

AB  - Due to the scarcity of fossil fuels and the future stringent emission limits, there is an increasing interest for the use of renewable biofuels in compression ignition engines. However, these fuels have different physical, chemical and thermodynamic properties affecting atomization, spray development and combustion processes. The results reported in this paper have been obtained by experimentation with a constant volume combustion chamber. The influences of physical fuel properties on injections under non-evaporating conditions are studied, using a pump-line-nozzle system from a medium speed diesel engine with injection pressures up to 1200bar, by changing the fuel type and temperature. Experiments were conducted for diesel, biodiesel, straight vegetable oils and animal fats. Injection pressure and needle lift measurements were analyzed. A high speed camera was used to visualize the spray, which enabled us to study the spray penetration and spray angle. Our results show that the fuel temperature is an important parameter to control because it significantly affects the fuel properties. Both the injection timing and injection duration are affected by the fuel properties. The influences of these properties on the spray development were less pronounced. At low temperatures, a strongly deteriorated atomization of oils and fats was observed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the framework of the European CIVITAS project in the Belgian City Ghent, the initiative was taken to introduce B30 biodiesel in the city car fleet. Yet, implementation turned out to be difficult due to a combination of reasons which will be discussed in detail in the manuscript. First of all, there is no consistent policy on the taxation of high-blend biofuels in Belgium. Furthermore, questions and misconceptions on technical aspects lead to distrust by the consumers and retailers, often resulting in the needless withdrawal of the vehicle warranty. Finally, the lack of a good monitoring program to measure emissions, impact on car maintenance and B30 economics during the project is seen as a missed opportunity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effect of salinity on Jatropha curcas (J. curcas), native to nonsaline humid areas, and Jatropha cinerea (J. cinerea), native to saline dry areas, was compared to assess the potential of cultivating J. curcas for biodiesel production in saline soils that are not suitable for food production. Growth parameters, water relations, chlorophyll content, and stomatal conductance of both species under salinity were measured. Dry weight of both species decreased with increasing concentrations of salt; however, both species can grow at salinities up to ∼100 mM sodium chloride (NaCl). Decline of stomatal conductance was one of the main factors causing reduction in growth of Jatropha spp. Growth of J. curcas was inhibited more than that of J. cinerea by decline in growth parameters and chlorophyll content, but J. curcas shows sufficient hardiness to be cultivated in moderately saline soils with more favorable water relations. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This greenhouse study tested the effect of smoke-water and the smoke-isolated biologically active compound karrikinolide (KAR1) on growth and photosynthetic pigments of Jatropha curcas L. seedlings. Fifteen-day-old seedlings were sprayed once weekly for 5 weeks with three dilutions of smoke-water (1:250, 1:500, and 1:1000 v/v) or KAR1 (10-7, 10-8, and 10-9 M). Growth parameters and photosynthetic pigment concentrations of 75-d-old seedlings were measured. Foliar application of both smoke-water and KAR1 on J. curcas seedlings showed significant increases in stem width, shoot length, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll, and total carotenoid concentrations compared to the untreated control. KAR1 significantly improved leaf area, shoot and root dry mass, seedling-vigor index, and photosynthetic pigments as compared to control treatments. These results suggest the possible use of smoke-water and KAR1 to achieve a vigorous and well established crop of J. curcas. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Biodiesel was synthesized from different commercially available oils while in-line Raman and near-infrared (NIR) spectra were obtained simultaneously, and the spectral changes that occurred during the reaction were evaluated with principal component analysis (PCA). Raman and NIR spectra were acquired every 30 s with fiber optic probes inserted into the reaction vessel. The reaction was performed at 60-70 8C using magnetic stirring. The time of reaction was 90 min, and during this time, 180 Raman and NIR spectra were collected. NIR spectra were collected using a transflectance probe and an optical path length of 1 mm at 8 cm1 spectral resolution and averaging 32 scans; for Raman spectra a 3 s exposure time and three accumulations were adequate for the analysis. Raman spectroscopy showed the ester conversion as evidenced by the displacement of the C=O band from 1747 to 1744 cm1 and the decrease in the intensity of the 1000-1050 cm1 band and the 1405 cm1 band as methanol was consumed in the reaction. NIR spectra also showed the decrease in methanol concentration with the band in the 4750-5000 cm1 region; this signal is present in the spectra of the transesterification reaction but not in the neat oils. The variations in the intensity of the methanol band were a main factor in the in-line monitoring of the transesterification reaction using Raman and NIR spectroscopy. The score plot of the first principal component showed the progress of the reaction. The final product was analyzed using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy and using mid-infrared spectroscopy, confirming the conversion of the oils to biodiesel.

AB  - This work presents the results of a thorough EROEI (Energy Return on Energy Investment) analysis for biocrude production from microalgae processes. We have investigated different alternatives to maximize the energy recoveries of each process considered, which has been modeled and simulated by Aspen Plus™. The estimates for feeds and recirculation of microalgae and nutrients, working conditions, systemization and equipment requirements were obtained using both literature and own experimental data. The Pinch Technology Analysis was applied to optimize the process operating conditions. It was found that the process which uses the combustion of biomass after biocrude extraction is the most favorable one in energy terms. In particular, 2 cases of this type were addressed and compared to a Base case where all energy requirements (heat and electrical) are provided from external sources: Case 1, electricity is supplied externally whereas the biomass and part of the biocrude produced are burned to meet the requirements of thermal energy, and Case 2, where the energy recovered from both biomass and part of biocrude are used to fulfill all heat and electricity duties. These cases were analyzed also when the nitrogen needed for microalgae growth is obtained from wastewaters. Favorable EROEI figures could be calculated. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The National Program for Production and Use of Biodiesel (PNPB), launched in Brazil, is based on the diversification of its feedstock and social inclusion. Among the various oilseeds, palm was identified as the ideal one for the Northern region. However, the participation of palm is still not representative in the Brazilian biodiesel matrix. The key industrial challenges to promote oil palm in the biodiesel sector (as well as surpass them) are represented in the data presented herein. The current level of production is not enough to meet the industry's needs. The use of this oil appears to be a viable possibility in the medium-term. However technological limitations, infrastructure, transaction costs and high investments are pivotal bottlenecks to promote palm in the biodiesel chain. Concerning social promotion, there are not enough results yet. The prolonged process of economic marginalization, which family farmers have undergone in the Northern region, results in companies having to engage in social activities that aim at deeper cultural changes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, experiments were conducted on a single-cylinder high speed SI (spark ignition) engine fueled with 30and 35%vol butanol/gasoline blends and compared to the pure gasoline. This research is trying to find out the common principles about the influence on combustion heat release of SI engine for variables such as ignition timing, engine load, and butanol blend ratio in a wide engine speed range (3000-8500rpm). The results showed that butanol provides higher knocking resistance by allowing advance the ignition timing in SI engines, leading to more efficient combustion. The laminar burning velocity of butanol is higher than that of gasoline, but that doesn't guarantee a faster burning speed in a real engine unless the combustion process is more reasonably organized, such as using the optimum ignition timing. In the overall trend, as the butanol blend ratio increasing, one can achieve a more efficient combustion process with using the optimum operating parameters. Obviously, the rate of heat release became slower and declined in peak value as the engine load decreases, accompanied by a shift of peak value to later for both pure gasoline and butanol/gasoline blends. In the aspect of fuel oxidation rate, the fuel-air ratio is the dominated factor rather than fuel type. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The stability of fuel during storage is an important consideration for bulk users. Storage instability leads to solids formation which can plug nozzles and filters. This work focuses on the effect of the addition of antioxidants on EURO-III and Jatropha Biodiesel blends. The changes in physico-chemical properties were observed for these blends after addition of antioxidants. BHA (butylated hydroxy anisole), BHT (butylatedhydroxy toluene), TBHQ (tert-butylhydroxyquinone) and DPA (diphenylamine) were the antioxidants used for this study. The rate of change in kinematic viscosity and density of EURO-III-Jatropha Biodiesel blends with antioxidants were found to be less as compared to the neat samples. The oxidation stability of the neat samples, after addition of antioxidants, was found to increase significantly. It was also observed that addition of antioxidant significantly improved the oxidation stability of biodiesel-diesel fuel blends however in some case may act as pro-oxidants. The results showed that the addition of an antioxidant to diesel fuel blends influenced beneficially most of the important fuel properties. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sapindus mukorossi is a tree available in northeastern region of India. Fruit of S.mukorossi has some traditional usage and its kernel contains 39% (w/w) oil. Prospect of S.mukorossi oil for biodiesel production is investigated with reference to some relevant properties. The fatty acid profile of oil extracted from S.mukorossi is found comparable with similar seed oils attempted for biodiesel production in this region. Since the acid value of S.mukorossi is found to be 15.6mgKOH/g, so biodiesel is prepared using two stage transesterification. In the first step, alcohol to oil molar ratio of 6:1 with 1wt% of H2SO4, results the maximum reduction in acid value (acid value 1.89mgKOH/g) within 60min. In the second step, 10:1 alcohol to oil molar ratio and 1wt% NaOCH3 gives the optimum yield of biodiesel. Finally, the biodiesel is confirmed by the peaks appeared in 1H NMR and 13C NMR. The properties of the biodiesel are obtained using standard ASTM techniques and found to conform to the existing norms. •Produced biodiesel from high acid value Sapindus mukorossi oil using two step transesterification.•The product formation is confirmed using NMR spectroscopy.•Properties are obtained using standard ASTM techniques and most of these are found to conform to the existing norms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An efficient technology capable of cloning superior Jatropha curcas germplasm through grafting on large scale was standardized. This technique overcomes the bottlenecks associated with conventional seed and cutting raised plants. This is a novel technique being capable of establishing well-rooted pure strands of superior genotype utilising stock-scion concept and also explores possibilities for the improvement of existing inferior strands into high yielding and superior varieties. Among the various grafting methods tried, top cleft grafting was found to be most successful. The ideal stock-scion diameter and grafting height was found to be 3-4 cm and 40-60 cm, respectively. Top cleft grafting was more successful, stable and strong in comparison to other grafting methods, exhibiting 92.0 and 94.09 % success during spring and monsoon seasons, respectively. Side cleft grafting proved to be the second best method resulting in 80.0 and 82.23 % success during spring and monsoon seasons, respectively. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - This study evaluates the variation in oil content and composition of Jatropha curcas L. seeds from 12 origins, grown in Mozambique, under the same edapho-climatic and agronomic conditions. The seeds had oil contents from 37% to 45% (d.w.). The oils were rich in oleic (mean 40%) and linoleic (mean 40%) acids and poor in linolenic acid (mean 0.22%), with high content of beta-sitosterol (71% of total sterols), low acidity and low levels of oxidation products, making them adequate for biodiesel production by alkaline-catalyzed transesterification.The high levels of gamma-tocopherol (69-182. mg/kg) may explain the high oxidative stability exhibited by the oil during 6 months of storage at 28 or 35. °C. Conversely, seeds storage under high temperatures and humidity promoted the growth of fungi responsible for oil degradation. Therefore, under tropical climate conditions, when oil conversion to biodiesel is not possible immediately after fruit harvest, it is better to extract the oil and store it under closed containers without contact with oxygen and light, to preserve its quality, than to store the seeds. © 2013.

AB  - This study presents the first reported evaluation of Manchurian apricot (. Prunus mandshurica Skv.) seed kernel oil as a promising feedstock for biodiesel preparation, including a comparison with Siberian apricot (. Prunus sibirica L.) oil. The oil content of the Manchurian apricot kernels (55.17. ±. 5.52%) was somewhat higher than that of the Siberian apricot kernels. Similar to Siberian apricot, Manchurian apricot oil has low acid value, indicating that the two oils enabled direct base-catalyzed transesterified for biodiesel production without acid pretreatment. The fatty acid compositions of Manchurian apricot and Siberian apricot oils determined results showed a high percentage of monounsaturated fatty acids (69.15% and 67.78%, respectively). Other than cetane number and oxidation stability, the properties of biodiesel made from the two oils conformed to EN 14214-08, ASTM D6751-10 and GB/T 20828-07 standards. In general, Manchurian apricot represents a potentially useful biodiesel feedstock. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The focus of this work was to evaluate the potential of non-edible feedstocks to yield biodiesel by an enzymatic route. The ethanolysis of native oils from tropical crops, such as andiroba (Carapa guianensis), babassu (Orbignya sp.), jatropha (Jatropha curcas), macaw palm (Acrocomia aculeata), palm tree (Elaeis guineensis) and industrial waste (beef tallow) in solvent-free system was studied. All reactions were carried out with the microbial lipase from Burkholderia cepacia immobilized on a silica-polyvinyl alcohol matrix in a solvent-free system at 50°C for a maximum period of 24h. Under the conditions tested the biocatalyst was efficient in converting all fatty acids in the lipid feedstocks into the corresponding ethyl esters. Viscosity values for biodiesel samples obtained in each reaction (4.3 and 6.0mm2/s) showed consistent reduction in relation to their original feedstock material, which also confirms the high conversion of triglycerides to ethyl esters (&gt;94.5%). This comparative study shows that the formation of ethyl esters from different non-edible feedstocks was feasible and can provide a considerable increase in the prospect of attaining an environmental sustainability of the process as a whole. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As the production volume of biodiesel grows, conventional raw materials used in the production of biodiesel, such as rapeseed oil, are lacking, and other potentially oleaginous plants, the oil of which could be used for production of biodiesel, must be investigated. This article addresses opportunities for chufa sedge cultivation and presents the quality indicators for chufa sedge oil and the biodiesel derived from it. The results show that chufa sedge oil may be used directly in biodiesel production, and the biodiesel produced from chufa sedge oil complies with the requirements of the standards in almost all properties except for oxidation stability and cold filter plugging point. These indicators can be improved by adding the synthetic antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene and the synthetic depressant Wintron XC-30. This article presents the properties determined from the study of chufa sedge oil mixtures combined with mineral diesel fuel and conventional biodiesel fuel, with variation in the concentrations of the components. These mixtures comply with the requirements set for fuels. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The possibility of economically deriving fuel from cultivating algae biomass is an attractive addition to the range of measures to relieve the current reliance on fossil fuels. Algae biofuels avoid some of the previous drawbacks associated with crop-based biofuels as the algae do not compete with food crops. The favourable growing conditions found in many developing countries has led to a great deal of speculation about their potentials for reducing oil imports, stimulating rural economies, and even tackling hunger and poverty. By reviewing the status of this technology we suggest that the large uncertainties make it currently unsuitable as a priority for many developing countries. Using bibliometric and patent data analysis, we indicate that many developing countries lack the human capital to develop their own algae industry or adequately prepare policies to support imported technology. Also, we discuss the potential of modern biotechnology, especially genetic modification (GM) to produce new algal strains that are easier to harvest and yield more oil. Controversy surrounding the use of GM and weak biosafety regulatory system represents a significant challenge to adoption of GM technology in developing countries. A range of policy measures are also suggested to ensure that future progress in algae biofuels can contribute to sustainable development. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Algal biofuel is an emerging energy source that has the potential to improve upon the environmental benefits realized by conventional biofuels and contribute to the biofuels mandate set by the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). While there has been much research into producing fuel from algae, a commercial-scale facility has not yet been built. We examine two case studies of energy technology innovation in the United States, first generation biodiesel and solar photovoltaics (PV), using the technological innovation system (TIS) framework to provide lessons and inform the path forward for commercializing algal biofuel. We identify five event types that have been the most influential to these innovation processes: changing expectations, technology development, demonstration projects, policy targets, and government subsidies. Some algal biofuel demonstration projects have occurred, but despite falling under the mandates set forth in the RFS (a policy target), algal biofuels do not currently receive production subsidies. The main finding from the case study analysis is that government interventions have significantly influenced the innovation processes of first generation biodiesel and solar PV and will likely be key factors in the commercialization of algal biofuel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper identifies conventional liquid fossil fuels that can be replaced or blended with biofuel and quantifies the biofuels required to meet the Indonesian biofuel target of at least 5% of the total primary energy mix in 2025. The analysis was conducted using the Long range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) system with an energy elasticity of 1 and maximum allowable biofuel blending ratios according to the current best practices. The results show that the target could be achieved with the maximum blending alternative based on constant energy demand growth of 6%. The target requires a total contribution from biofuel of about 8-27. GL in 2025 depending on blending ratios. In energy terms, these are equivalent to 232-782. PJ or about 40-135 million barrels crude oil, which constitute roughly around 3.3-11.0% of the estimated liquid fossil fuel oil annual consumption in that year. The results imply that it may have detrimental environmental impact, as it requires 5.2. million. ha of palm oil and sugar cane plantations. On the positive side, achieving the target offers potential new employment opportunities of about 3.4 million jobs, particularly in the agricultural sector relevant to liquid biofuel production. © 2013.

AB  - The negative environmental impact of the aviation industry, related mainly to the gaseous emissions from turbine exhausts, is increasing with the increased demand on travel. In addition to the adverse environmental effects, the currently used aviation fuel is posing economic burdens on the air transport sector, with the increase in crude oil prices. Therefore, the aviation industry is investigating the potential of substituting the currently used aviation fuel with alternative fuels - mainly those derived from biofuels. Of all the available sources of biofuels, numerous studies indicate that those derived from algae seem to be the most promising, in terms of providing a viable and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. This study explores the feasibility of microalgal jet fuel, taking into consideration technological, environmental, and economic aspects, using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Two scenarios are explored, with one stressing on the environmental importance and the second on the economic importance of the alternative jet fuel. The results indicate that microalgal derived jet fuel can only compete with conventional jet fuel, when giving the environmental criterion the higher weight.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare four alternatives for providing decentralized energy production in small communities in terms of their flue gas emissions and toxicological properties of the emissions. In this study, two different size classes of boilers were examined and the use of fossil fuel oils was compared against wood fuels. The lowest PM1 emission, 0.1mgMJ-1, was observed from small-scale light fuel oil combustion. In medium-scale wood combustion, PM1 emission values from a grate fired wood combustion boiler (10MW) without particulate filtration were the highest (264mgMJ-1) but were substantially reduced down to 0.6mgMJ-1 due to the usage of an electrostatic precipitator (ESP). The wood combustion particles were mainly formed of potassium salts. In light fuel oil combustion, one of the main components in the particles was sulphate whereas in heavy fuel oil combustion also significant amounts of V and Ni were emitted. Pellet combustion produced the lowest PAH emissions. Overall, oil combustion produced higher amount of PAHs than wood combustion. This was indicated also as a higher cytotoxicity of the oil combustion samples when compared to those from wood combustion in the corresponding scale of boilers. However, when calculated on an equal mass basis, the particles collected after ESP were even more cytotoxic which can be explained by the altered chemical characteristics of the emissions in the ESP. Due to the variation in the emissions and in the toxicity of the emissions, we propose that in the long term, not only the emission levels but also the toxicity of the emissions should be taken into account in the regulations of the emission limits of the combustion plants. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is an environmental-friendly fuel that can replace petroleum diesel. However, after transesterification reaction of vegetable oils, the obtained crude biodiesel must be purified. The commonly applied purification step is water washing. This step is a concern in biodiesel production, since large quantities of clean water are used, generating a wastewater stream to be further treated. Here we propose the application of microand ultrafiltration processes to purify crude biodiesel. Crude biodiesel was filtrated in a dead-end process at different transmembrane pressures and using membranes of different pore sizes. Flux results showed that greater transmembrane pressures, as well as greater pore sizes, enablegreater fluxes. Density, viscosity and acid values of purified biodiesel (washed and filtrated) are in accordance to the international legislation for biodiesel quality. Both processes (water washing and membrane separation) were able to reduce the amount of soap detected in crude biodiesel. However, the proposed microfiltration membranes were not efficient as the washing method to reduce the free glycerol content. The ultrafiltration membrane of 30kDa was also not able to produce a purified biodiesel according to the international legislation for free glycerol content. Between the analyzed membranes, the glycerol content limit (less than 0.02wt%) was achieved only with the ultrafiltration membrane of 10kDa. Water addition in the crude biodiesel improved the glycerol removal by membrane filtration. The obtained results showed that the membrane separation process is a suitable alternative for biodiesel purification. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Increasing concerns about limited fossil fuels and global environmental problems have focused attention on the need to develop sustainable biofuels from renewable resources. Although microbial production of diesel has been reported, production of another much in demand transport fuel, petrol (gasoline), has not yet been demonstrated. Here we report the development of platform Escherichia coli strains that are capable of producing short-chain alkanes (SCAs; petrol), free fatty acids (FFAs), fatty esters and fatty alcohols through the fatty acyl (acyl carrier protein (ACP)) to fatty acid to fatty acyl-CoA pathway. First, the β-oxidation pathway was blocked by deleting the fadE gene to prevent the degradation of fatty acyl-CoAs generated in vivo. To increase the formation of short-chain fatty acids suitable for subsequent conversion to SCAs in vivo, the activity of 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase (FabH), which is inhibited by unsaturated fatty acyl-ACPs, was enhanced to promote the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis by deleting the fadR gene; deletion of the fadR gene prevents upregulation of the fabA and fabB genes responsible for unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis. A modified thioesterase was used to convert short-chain fatty acyl-ACPs to the corresponding FFAs, which were then converted to SCAs by the sequential reactions of E. coli fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, Clostridium acetobutylicum fatty acyl-CoA reductase and Arabidopsis thaliana fatty aldehyde decarbonylase. The final engineered strain produced up to 580.8 mg l -1 of SCAs consisting of nonane (327.8 mg l-1), dodecane (136.5 mg l-1), tridecane (64.8 mg l-1), 2-methyl-dodecane (42.8 mg l-1) and tetradecane (8.9 mg l-1), together with small amounts of other hydrocarbons. Furthermore, this platform strain could produce short-chain FFAs using a fadD-deleted strain, and short-chain fatty esters by introducing the Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 wax ester synthase (atfA) and the E. coli mutant alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE mut). © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - A study of a gas turbine combustor that considers two conventional fuels and one biofuel is presented. The kind of fuel supplied to the combustor can impact in the Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT) provoking significant changes in the power output and efficiency. Moreover, it can cause some damage in the initial steps of the gas turbine due to the migration of the hot streak. Natural gas, Diesel and Bioethanol are considered in the combustor in order to compare the performance of the power plant. The use of biofuel in a gas turbine combustor presents some benefits; a) better behavior in the distribution of the TIT, b) slightly higher power output and c) less impact of NOx and CO2 emissions. The analysis was based in the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and thermodynamics. The results indicate that it is necessary to increase the mass flow rate of bioethanol to maintain the power output of the turbine, due to a significant reduction of the TIT was observed. On the other hand, the use of bioethanol permits an important reduction of NOx emissions when they are compared with the conventional fuels (natural gas or diesel). Also, a noble benefit is obtained due to the biofuel comes from biomass-derived material, resulting in a reduction of CO2 global warming. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biofuels derived from pyrolysis of microalgae can be potential alternatives for petroleum-derived fuels. Pyrolysis is an easily controllable thermochemical conversion process that yields energy fuels such as bio-oil, char and combustible gases. Microalgae is a very promising feedstock for this process since it has high lipid content, grows faster than lignocellulosic biomass, has high productivity and high photosynthetic efficiency. Several reaction parameters including temperature could affect the yield and quality of biofuels from pyrolysis. This paper aimed to evaluate the effect of temperature during pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis oculata using a pressurized fixed-bed batch-type reactor. Based on the results, the distribution of the products significantly varied with pyrolysis temperature, and the pyrolysis process can be manipulated to favor one of its products. Bio-oil with high heating value (HHV) of about 38 MJ/kg, due to its high carbon (76wt%) and hydrogen (11wt%) contents, and low oxygen content (7wt%), can be produced from N. oculata. It also consists mainly of saturated (34.95%) and unsaturated aliphatics (34.43%), and aromatics (14.19%) ranging from C8 to C21, which is comparable to diesel fuel. The HHV of the char (27 MJ/kg) and gas (27 MJ/m3) were also relatively high. Based on their heating values (HHV) and compositions, the char, bio-oil and gas produced from pyrolysis of N. oculata can be potentially used as alternative sources of energy. Mass and energy conversion efficiencies of the process were also estimated to be approximately equal to 76% and 68%, respectively. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, a method to determine the composition of blends of biodiesel with mineral diesel (BXX) by multivariate curve resolution with Alternating Least Squares (MRC-ALS) combined to comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with Flame Ionization Detection (GC. ×. GC-FID) is presented. Chromatographic profiles of BXX blends produced with biodiesels from different sources were used as input data. An initial evaluation carried out after multiway principal component analysis (MPCA) was used to reveal regions of the chromatograms were the signal was likely to be dependent on the concentration of biodiesel, regardless its vegetable source. After this preliminary step MCR-ALS modeling was carried out only using relevant parts of the chromatograms. The resulting procedure was able to predict accurately the concentration of biodiesel in the BXX samples regardless of its origin. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: There has been a great deal of interest in fuel productions from lignocellulosic biomass to minimize the conflict between food and fuel use. The bioconversion of xylose, which is the second most abundant sugar present after glucose in lignocellulosic biomass, is important for the development of cost effective bioprocesses to fuels. Rhodococcus opacus PD630, an oleaginous bacterium, accumulates large amounts of triacylglycerols (TAGs), which can be processed into advanced liquid fuels. However, R. opacus PD630 does not metabolize xylose. Results: We generated DNA libraries from a Streptomyces bacterium capable of utilizing xylose and introduced them into R. opacus PD630. Xsp8, one of the engineered strains, was capable of growing on up to 180 g L§ssup§-1§esup§ of xylose. Xsp8 grown in batch-cultures derived from unbleached kraft hardwood pulp hydrolysate containing 70 g L§ssup§-1§esup§ total sugars was able to completely and simultaneously utilize xylose and glucose present in the lignocellulosic feedstock, and yielded 11.0 g L§ssup§-1§esup§ of TAGs as fatty acids, corresponding to 45.8% of the cell dry weight. The yield of total fatty acids per gram of sugars consumed was 0.178 g, which consisted primarily of palmitic acid and oleic acid. The engineered strain Xsp8 was introduced with two heterologous genes from Streptomyces: xylA, encoding xylose isomerase, and xylB, encoding xylulokinase. We further demonstrated that in addition to the introduction and the concomitant expression of heterologous xylA and xylB genes, there is another molecular target in the R. opacus genome which fully enables the functionality of xylA and xylB genes to generate the robust xylose-fermenting strain capable of efficiently producing TAGs at high xylose concentrations. Conclusion: We successfully engineered a R. opacus strain that is capable of completely utilizing high concentrations of xylose or mixed xylose/glucose simultaneously, and substantiated its suitability for TAG production. This study demonstrates that the engineered strain possesses a key trait of converters for lipid-based fuels production from lignocellulosic biomass. © 2013 Kurosawa et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Bio-fuel production provides an alternative non-fossil fuel without the need to redesign current engine technology. This study presents an experimental investigation into the effects of using biodiesel blends on diesel engine performance and its emissions. The biodiesel fuels were produced from Sunflower oil using the transesterification process with low molecular weight alcohols and sodium hydroxide then tested on a steady state engine test rig using a Euro 4 four cylinder CI (compression ignition) engine. This study also shows how by blending biodiesel with diesel fuel at intervals of B5, B10, B15, and B20 can decrease harmful gas emissions significantly while maintaining similar performance output and efficiency. Production optimization was achieved by changing the variables which included methanol/oil molar ratio, NaOH catalyst concentration, reaction time, reaction temperature, and rate of mixing to maximize biodiesel yield. The technique used was the RSM (response surface methodology). In addition, a second-order model was developed to predict the biodiesel yield if the production criteria is known. The model was validated using additional experimental testing. It was determined that the catalyst concentration and molar ratio of methanol to sunflower oil were the most influential variables affecting percentage conversion to fuel and percentage initial absorbance. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The production of transportation fuels from the conversion of biomass into gasoline and diesel in a bio-refinery is an attractive, clean, carbon neutral and sustainable process. The investment cost for the commercial application of a stand-alone bio-refinery may be reduced via integration with an existing petroleum refinery, whereby bio-refinery intermediates can be upgraded using the existing petroleum refinery infrastructure. In this work, two options of operational scenarios are studied and compared. The first option is to consider the bio-refinery and an existing petroleum refinery as stand-alone plants. The second option is to integrate bio-refinery network into an existing petroleum refinery and view it as an enterprise plant. The enterprise plant is represented in a superstructure, which is formulated as an MINLP (mixed integer nonlinear programming) model. The MINLP model involves logic constraints to allow the conditional designing of the optimal enterprise plant network. The model application is demonstrated on representative case studies. The model results shows that the optimal enterprise plant network design achieved 2.82% ($21.5MM/year) higher profit compared to the combined profits of the stand-alone plants. As a result, the payback time for a new bio-refinery investment is reduced from 6.9 to 4.7 years. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The impact on CO2 emissions of integrating new technologies (a biomass-to-Fischer-Tropsch fuel plant and a post-combustion CO2 capture plant) with a complex refinery has previously been investigated separately by the authors. In the present study these designs are integrated with a refinery and evaluated from the point-of-view of economics and GHG (greenhouse gas emissions) emissions and are compared to a reference refinery. Stand-alone Fischer-Tropsch fuel production is included for comparison. To account for uncertainties in the future energy market, the assessment has been conducted for different future energy market conditions. For the post-combustion CO2 capture process to be profitable, the present study stresses the importance of a high charge for CO2 emission. A policy support for biofuels is essential for the biomass-to-Fischer-Tropsch fuel production to be profitable. The level of the support, however, differs depending on scenario. In general, a high charge for CO2 economically favours Fischer-Tropsch fuel production, while a low charge for CO2 economically favours Fischer-Tropsch fuel production. Integrated Fischer-Tropsch fuel production is most profitable in scenarios with a low wood fuel price. The stand-alone alternative shows no profitability in any of the studied scenarios. Moreover, the high investment costs make all the studied cases sensitive to variations in capital costs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Because of the world energy crisis, many countries have initiated a series of measures to resolve this problem through alternative energy resources. Biodiesel as an alternate fuel has received much attention in recent years. A number of reports are available on the production of biodiesel from vegetable oils and related sources but its production from microalgae is a highly prospective field. Microalgae can produce and accumulate lipids within their cells. These lipids on transesterification yields biodiesel. Hence, microalgae have the capacity to produce more biodiesel per acre land than any other plants or living organisms. This manuscript deals with chemical and biochemical aspects of microalgae-based biodiesel and methodology of its production. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Recently, Jatropha curcas L. has attracted worldwide attention for its potential as a source of biodiesel. However, most DNA markers have demonstrated high levels of genetic similarity among and within jatropha populations around the globe. Despite promising features of copia-type retrotransposons as ideal genetic tools for gene tagging, mutagenesis, and marker-assisted selection, they have not been characterized in the jatropha genome yet. Here, we examined the diversity, evolution, and genome-wide organization of copia-type retrotransposons in the Asian, African, and Mesoamerican accessions of jatropha, then introduced a retrotransposon-based marker for this biofuel crop. Results: In total, 157 PCR fragments that were amplified using the degenerate primers for the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of copia-type retroelements were sequenced and aligned to construct the neighbor-joining tree. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that isolated copia RT sequences were classified into ten families, which were then grouped into three lineages. An in-depth study of the jatropha genome for the RT sequences of each family led to the characterization of full consensus sequences of the jatropha copia-type families. Estimated copy numbers of target sequences were largely different among families, as was presence of genes within 5 kb flanking regions for each family. Five copia-type families were as appealing candidates for the development of DNA marker systems. A candidate marker from family Jc7 was particularly capable of detecting genetic variation among different jatropha accessions. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to metaphase chromosomes reveals that copia-type retrotransposons are scattered across chromosomes mainly located in the distal part regions. Conclusion: This is the first report on genome-wide analysis and the cytogenetic mapping of copia-type retrotransposons of jatropha, leading to the discovery of families bearing high potential as DNA markers. Distinct dynamics of individual copia-type families, feasibility of a retrotransposon-based insertion polymorphism marker system in examining genetic variability, and approaches for the development of breeding strategies in jatropha using copia-type retrotransposons are discussed. © 2013 Alipour et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major public health problem in India. Although several International guidelines for diagnosis and management of COPD are available, yet there are lot of gaps in recognition and management of COPD in India due to vast differences in availability and affordability of healthcare facilities across the country. The Indian Chest Society (ICS) and the National College of Chest Physicians (NCCP) of India have joined hands to come out with these evidence-based guidelines to help the physicians at all levels of healthcare to diagnose and manage COPD in a scientific manner. Besides the International literature, the Indian studies were specifically analyzed to arrive at simple and practical recommendations. The evidence is presented under these five headings: (a) definitions, epidemiology, and disease burden; (b) disease assessment and diagnosis; (c) pharmacologic management of stable COPD; (d) management of acute exacerbations; and (e) nonpharmacologic and preventive measures. The modified grade system was used for classifying the quality of evidence as 1, 2, 3, or usual practice point (UPP). The strength of recommendation was graded as A or B depending upon the level of evidence.

AB  - Biofuels derived from edible and non-edible oil are gaining interest as next generation fuels for replacement of conventional petroleum fuels. There is a huge potential for producing bio-diesel considering large and wide variety of biomass feedstock cultivated in India. In this context, this paper assesses the land requirements to meet the national biofuel policy target from different edible and non-edible seeds. This study has also been carried out as a comparative analysis between four different biodiesel crops for CO2 mitigation potential and with possible application for Clean Development Mechanism credits. Research indicates that in Indian perspective the mitigation potential of microalgae is the largest, followed by the Jatropha. Edible food crops Soya bean and coconut considered for this study found to have the smallest mitigation potential.

AB  - Biofuels have attracted significant research attention in recent years due to various energy shortages. However, the presence of phospholipid impurities in biofuels prevents their use in diesel engines. In our previous study we developed Lewis-acid ZrO2 materials for the adsorption of phospholipids in oil solutions. In this work, for the first time, we describe the development of strong Lewis-acid Y2O3 novel structures, such as Y2O3 cubes and Y2O 3 flowers for the phospholipid removal in soybean oil solution. This is the first report for the discussion of Y2O3 cubes and flowers. The relevant growth mechanism for the cubes and flowers was also discussed in this study. The as-prepared Y2O3 flowers exhibit better performance in phospholipid removal than Y2O 3 cubes due to the larger specific surface area of the Y 2O3 flowers. This work also provides a feasible method for using Y2O3 novel structures to remove phospholipids from plant oils that is suitable for biofuel applications. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - A huge amount of kernel cake, which contains a variety of toxins including phorbol esters (tumor promoters), is projected to be generated yearly in the near future by the Jatropha biodiesel industry. We showed that the kernel cake strongly inhibited plant seed germination and root growth and was highly toxic to carp fingerlings, even though phorbol esters were undetectable by HPLC. Therefore it must be detoxified before disposal to the environment. A mathematic model was established to estimate the general toxicity of the kernel cake by determining the survival time of carp fingerling. A new strain (Streptomyces fimicarius YUCM 310038) capable of degrading the total toxicity by more than 97% in a 9-day solid state fermentation was screened out from 578 strains including 198 known strains and 380 strains isolated from air and soil. The kernel cake fermented by YUCM 310038 was nontoxic to plants and carp fingerlings and significantly promoted tobacco plant growth, indicating its potential to transform the toxic kernel cake to bio-safe animal feed or organic fertilizer to remove the environmental concern and to reduce the cost of the Jatropha biodiesel industry. Microbial strain profile essential for the kernel cake detoxification was discussed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The applicability of ionic liquid-methanol cosolvent system to both extract bio-oil and simultaneously pretreat the carbohydrate fraction of jatropha and safflower biomass for enzymatic hydrolysis to fermentable sugars is presented. Although pretreatment with either the cosolvent or pure ionic liquid yielded comparable hydrolysis kinetics and fermentable sugar yields on safflower whole seeds, the addition of alcohol to the ionic liquid was necessary to optimally recover both bio-oil and fermentable sugars. The ionic liquid [C2mim][Ac] was far more effective than [C2mim][MeSO4] with optimum processing conditions occurring at a cosolvent concentration of 70-30 wt% of [C2mim][Ac] to methanol and a processing temperature of 120°C. Under these conditions, the majority of the bio-oil was extracted and 25.4 wt% (safflower) and 14.3 wt% (jatropha) of the whole seed biomass were recovered as fermentable sugars. The recovery of fermentable sugars from the carbohydrate fraction was as high as 74% and 78% for jatropha and safflower seeds, respectively, when using [C2mim][Ac] cosolvent. A preliminary theoretical analysis of two potential oil seed processing pathways using the cosolvent system suggested that the corecovery of bio-oil, fermentable sugars, and a protein rich meal can recover a majority of the energy contained in the original biomass - a result that improves upon the traditional approach of solely extracting bio-oil. © 2013 Godwin Severa et al.

AB  - Agricultural products are strongly affected by variations in climatic conditions. The cultivation of oilseed crops is expanding under different climatic zones. Vegetable oils are also important sources of biofuel. It is renewable and does not contribute to raising the net level of CO2 in the atmosphere. The aim of the present investigation was to determine the impact of climatic factors on seed oil content and oil quality of sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) genotype TS-3 with the perspectives of biodiesel production. The seed samples were collected from field grown plants in three regions of Pakistan differing in temperature and moisture regimes viz. district Bannu, district Kohat (Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa), and district Attock (Punjab), respectively. The mean day and night temperatures and average rainfall varied in the three regions during vegetative and reproductive phases of sesame. The average day temperature was higher in Attock. Minimum day temperature during the reproductive phase was observed in Kohat, while minimum night temperature during grain filling and maturation was recorded in Attock. Maximum seed oil content was exhibited by seed samples collected from Kohat exhibiting 3 and 4°C lower day temperature than Attock and Bannu, respectively, during the reproductive stage. Significantly higher oil specific gravity was detected in seed samples collected from Bannu. The lower acid value was recorded for seed samples of Kohat. A significantly higher iodine number was found in the oil of seed samples collected from Attock. The palmitic acid (C16:0) and linoleic acid (C18:2) content did not vary significantly in seed samples of the three regions. Maximum oleic acid (C18:1) content was exhibited by seed samples collected from Kohat. Significantly higher biodiesel yield was obtained from the oil of seed samples collected from Kohat and Bannu, respectively. It can be inferred that climatic conditions significantly affect the oil yield and quality of sesame and that agroclimatic conditions of Kohat and Bannu are suitable for cultivation of sesame for biodiesel production. © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Fatty-acid residue as plant oil asphalt (FA-POA) is a neglected biomass. The main objectives of this study were to identify the composition of FA-POA and to investigate the vacuum pyrolysis of FA-POA to synthesize liquid biofuel. Proximate and ultimate analysis of FA-POA was performed. The physical properties were also examined according to ASTM standards. The composition of FA-POA was inferred from FTIR spectra and thermal gravimetric analysis. GC–MS was conducted to determine the composition in the pyrolytic oil and biogas. Results showed that FA-POA is a polymerization product of fatty acids. It is formed by the combination of CC addition or association and carboxyl dehydration. In vacuum pyrolysis, a pyrolytic-oil yield of 71 wt % was achieved on a FA-POA basis. The pyroltyic oil mainly consists of fatty acids, paraffins, cycloparaffins, olefins, and aromatics. It was upgraded to pyrolytic biodiesel, which is characterized as having a high calorific value and moderate oxygen content. A pyrolysis reaction scheme of FA-POA was proposed from the experimental results. It is concluded that FA-POA is an attractive biomass source for liquid biofuels, chemicals, and biochar.

AB  - Biofuels are considered as the most attractive and alternative energy sources for the heat and power applications in the near future. Biodiesel, derived from various vegetable oils, has poor oxidation stability and cold flow properties, despite its merits over petroleum diesel. On the other hand, bio-oil obtained from woody biomass through pyrolysis has many hindered phenols, which is a merit and may solve this problem, even though the bio-oil has low calorific value and high viscosity. In this investigation, an attempt has been made to study the effect of combustion, performance and emission characteristics of a direct injection diesel engine fueled with biodiesel and bio-oil emulsions. Emulsions made from wood pyrolysis oil (WPO) and methyl ester of jatropha (JME) were used as the alternative fuels in a single cylinder, four stroke, air cooled diesel engine developing a power of 4.4 kW at 1,500 rpm. Three emulsions by taking 5, 10 and 15% of WPO on a volume basis were emulsified with 95, 90 and 85% of JME, denoted as JOE5, JOE10 and JOE15 respectively. The experimental results showed an increased thermal efficiency, and reduced HC and CO emissions, with the JME-WPO emulsions. The NO emissions for the JME-WPO emulsions were found to be higher than those of diesel operation, but reduced with the addition of WPO in JME. The smoke emissions showed a declining trend compared to that of diesel operation in the same engine. JME-WPO emulsions exhibited shorter ignition delay than that of diesel operation at full load. The values of peak pressure are higher by 9.8, 7.9 and 8.8% than those of diesel operation at full load for JOE5, JOE10 and JOE15 respectively. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2012.

AB  - There is an increasing demand of hydrocarbons owing to the fluctuations in crude oil prices and reduced fossil resources. Lignocellulosic biomass is seen as a potential renewable source of sustainable hydrocarbons. The hydropyrolysis of jatropha seed de-oiled cake has been carried out at various hydropyrolysis temperatures (300, 350, 400 and 450°C) and pressures of hydrogen (1, 20, 40 and 52 bar). It has been observed that the liquid bio-oil yields have increased with pyrolysis temperature and pressure. It was also found that 40 bar is the optimum value of hydrogen pressure for the hydropyrolysis reactions at 450°C to obtain maximum liquid yield (17 wt.%) in the given experimental setup. The frequency factor of 98 s-1 and activation energy of 29 kJ/mol are the lowest at 40 bar reaffirming the fact that heat and mass transfer limitations are the least at 40 bar pressure. © Springer Science+Business Media 2012.

AB  - As a novel alternative fuel for diesel oil, bio-oil was upgraded by emulsification technology and the tribological performances of bio-oil and upgrade ones were tested on a cylinder liner-piston ring tribometer. The surface profilometer, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to analyze the micro-morphology and the valence states of elements on the rubbing surface and the tribological mechanisms were also discussed. The results show that the bio-oil from Chlorella had better friction-reducing and anti-wear properties than those of bio-oil from rice husk. The performances of the bio-oil can be improved significantly by the emulsification method. The lubrication mechanism was ascribed to the formation of lubricative films from adsorption, extrusion, and frictional deposition of the bio-oil organics on the cylinder surface, the rolling of micro-balls caused by local frictional melting and protective oxidation film of Fe2O3 and FeOOH on the friction surface during the friction process. Moreover, the bio-oil from Chlorella formed a nitrogen-contained organic film on the frictional surface, which was also an important reason for the better tribological performances.

AB  - Decreasing oil supplies and increasing energy demand provide incentives to find alternative fuels. First, the valorisation of edible crops for ethanol and biodiesel production led to first generation biofuels. Nowadays, research is focused on lignocellulosic biomass as a source of renewable carbon (second generation biofuels). Whereas the cellulosic ethanol production is in progress, a new way consisting of the transformation of ex-lignocellulose sugars and polyols towards light hydrocarbons by heterogeneous catalysis in aqueous phase has been recently described. This process is performed under mild conditions (T < 300°C and P < 50 bar). It requires on one hand hydrogen formation by catalytic reforming of carbohydrates in aqueous phase and on the other hand, the dehydration/hydrogenation of polyols leading to alkanes by selective C-O bond cleavages. The challenge here is to conceive multifunctional catalytic systems that are stable, active and selective under the reaction conditions. The aim of this article is to present the involved reactions, the catalytic systems described in literature for that kind of transformation and examples of industrial applications. © 2013, IFP Energies nouvelles.

AB  - Cultivation in glycerol instead of sugars inhibits 2,3- butanediol (2,3-BD) production by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. In this study, we report that B. amyloliquefaciens readily produces 2,3-BD from biodiesel-derived glycerol in the presence of beet molasses as a co-substrate. Unexpectedly, the molasses stimulated 2,3-BD production and simultaneously reduced the duration of fermentation. Productivity of 2,3-BD was enhanced at the start of fermentation, and yields increased under continuous molasses supply. Subsequently, 2,3-BD production in molasses-supplemented fed-batch culture was observed. Prior to inoculation of fed-batch fermentation culture, 15 g/l of molasses was added to the bioreactor. After 6 h of incubation, the bioreactor was fed with a solution containing 80 % glycerol and 15 % molasses. The 2,3- BD concentration, yield, and productivity significantly improved, reaching 83.3 g/l, 0.42 g/g, and 0.87 g/l·h, respectively. To our knowledge, these results are the highest report for 2,3-BD fermentation from biodieselderived glycerol. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

AB  - The liquefaction of rice hull (a typical agricultural waste) has been conducted with n-butanol solvent at various reaction temperatures ranging from 260 to 320 C. As a result, it was found that biomass conversion rates were increased with increasing temperature up to 320dgC. However, it was observed that its rate of conversion to liquid was about 83% at 320 C for 30 min. The crude oil yield with rice hull increased up to 1,273 mg/g/L at 300 C, but the yield of Fraction 1 at 280 C was raised suddenly, and peaked at 2 times that of the initial input amount of feedstock. Furthermore, the calorific values of crude oil and Fraction 1 from rice hull were about 5,843 and 8,061 kcal/kg and were enhanced 163 and 225%, respectively, relative to its feedstock as rice hull, respectively. Fraction 1 may be suitable as an alternative liquid fuel of gasoline, based on an engine performance test. Sixty species of organic compounds in crude oil were categorized into 8 classes of compounds, including acids, alcohols, aliphatic hydrocarbons, ethers, esters, ketones, phenol, and aromatics, and others. In the crude oil from rice hull, the most common chemical types were esters and ethers accounting for 32.0 and 19.2% of the total extract, respectively. Analysis of Fraction 1 revealed that the main chemical components were C5H12O, C7H14O 2, C8H16O2, and C12H 26O2. Therefore, for producing clean and green fuel energy with plant biomass liquefaction it is necessary to further investigate crude oil and to further refine Fraction 1 through catalytic cracking or hydro-de-oxygenation (HDO). © 2013 The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - With increasing energy prices and concerns about the environmental impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, a growing number of national governments are putting emphasis on improving the energy efficiency of the equipment employed throughout their transportation systems. Within the U.S. transportation sector, energy use in commercial vehicles has been increasing at a faster rate than that of automobiles. A 23% increase in fuel consumption for the U.S. heavy duty truck segment is expected from 2009 to 2020. The heavy duty vehicle oil consumption is projected to grow while light duty vehicle (LDV) fuel consumption will eventually experience a decrease. By 2050, the oil consumption rate by LDVs is anticipated to decrease below 2009 levels due to CAFE standards and biofuel use. In contrast, the heavy duty oil consumption rate is anticipated to double. The increasing trend in oil consumption for heavy trucks is linked to the vitality, security, and growth of the U.S. and global economies. An essential part of a stable and vibrant U.S. economy is a productive U.S. trucking industry. Studies have shown that the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) is strongly correlated to freight transport. As the economy grows, the freight tonnage increases as well as the annual vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Over 80% of all U.S. freight tonnage is transported by diesel power and over 75% is transported by trucks. The improved efficiency of heavy-duty engines and vehicles has been quickly overwhelmed by the increase in annual VMT. This results in heavy-duty vehicles consuming a growing share of the total transportation-related petroleum. Given the vital role that the trucking industry plays in the economy, improving the efficiency of diesel engines is a central focus of this paper. Trucks are the mainstay for trade, commerce, and economic growth. Sustaining a U.S. trucking industry that is competitive in global markets requires innovation. The truck manufacturing and supporting industries are faced with numerous challenges to reduce oil consumption and greenhouse gases, meet stringent emissions regulations, provide customer value, and improve safety. A key part of the strategy to meet these requirements is to improve the efficiency of the internal combustion engine (ICE) powering the trucks. The performance, low cost, and fuel flexibility render the ICE the leading candidate to power commercial vehicles for many decades. Historically, diesel engine technologies have taken more than 10 years after first introduced to diffuse throughout the commercial vehicle marketplace. This rate is faster when fuel economy provides a business advantage to the vehicle's owner. Increased efficiency and reduced emissions of diesel engines can be realized through technologies that improve engine design and better integrate systems. Engine manufacturers have a growing need to refine the capability to innovate, design, develop, and validate engine efficiency improvements. Therefore, the primary purpose of this paper is to provide guidelines and tools that allow a systematic approach to engine design and development that focuses on satisfying regulatory requirements, achieving greater fuel efficiency, and improving transportation freight efficiency. The on-highway heavy-duty diesel engine is used to illustrate the processes; however, the general principles may be applied to other diesel and natural gas engine applications, such as off-highway or power generation. For the past two decades, engine manufacturers have focused on reducing engine emissions to near zero levels while maintaining or slightly increasing fuel efficiency. With the implementation of the new EPA/NHTSA commercial vehicle GHG regulations in 2011, the need to reduce fuel consumption has been explicitly linked to the ability to manufacture and sell engines. The forward looking technology roadmaps in this paper provide a framework for improving engine efficiency over the next 10 to 15 years. The list of improvements consists of engine components, aftertreatment, and powertrain advancements. Copyright © 2013 SAE International.

AB  - In recent years, trans-esterified vegetable oils have been widely applied to diesel engine in order to suppress greenhouse gas emissions. However, "neat" vegetable oils are expected to be directly used to resolve some difficulties faced in their use, such high viscosity and slightly high fuel consumption. In this study neat linseed oil has been investigated as a neat vegetable oil. It was found to show higher fuel consumption than diesel fuel, however at the same time it showed lower indicated fuel consumption than diesel fuel. These results suggest some increase in engine friction loss in a neat biofuel diesel engine. Studies have been extensively investigated the difference in friction loss and a newly developed "improved deceleration method" has been applied. Doing so confirmed the higher fuel injection driving torque caused by the higher viscosity of neat linseed oil relative to diesel fuel and the effect of the enlarged inner diameter of the fuel injection pipe on reducing the engine friction of high-viscosity fuel. Finally, a neat linseed oil engine with an optimized fuel injection pipe showed lower fuel consumption than a diesel fuel engine. The enlargement of the fuel injection pipe and fuel heating which may be more relevant for high-viscosity fuel, were compared from the view- point of fuel injection driving torque to organize the results of fuel consumption improvement in a neat biofuel diesel engine.

AB  - This paper presents material about using two-component RME-E and three-component D-RME-E biodiesels in high-speed diesel engines. The results of the analysis of fuel injection parameters described in Part I of this scientific paper - Research of characteristics of working cycle of high-speed diesel engine operating on biofuels RME-E and D-RME-E. Part 1. Indicators of fuel injection system and indicative process - allow conducting a coherent research of heat release in the cylinder of diesel engines transferred from operation on mineral diesel D to mixed biodiesels containing E. Effects of increased ethanol E in the biodiesel of 1A41 diesel engine have been analysed in a wide range of loads, ranging from 0.25 to 1.0 Penom. It was found that the result of the transfer from two-phase heat release to one-phase heat release is an increase in the fuel's economy of the engine for every 10% increase of E in the fuel (increase of indicative process efficiency makes up 0.4÷0.5%). Dependency of heat release and nitrogen oxide emissions in the exhaust gases remains the same for mineral diesel, RME-E and D-RME-E. Indicators of cyclic stability of the diesel engine, operating on biodiesels containing E ≤ 30%, did not exceed those that are common for diesel engines operating on mineral diesel.

AB  - The world's energy supply is mainly composed of fossil fuels, which are a non-renewable source of energy that is rapidly running out. To overcome this concern, industry has been focusing on the production of biofuels such as biodiesel. A range of approaches has been considered to transform oils into applicable biodiesel: dilutions, microemulsifications, pyrolysis and transesterification. The latter method consists of the conversion of triglycerides to a mixture of alkyl esters and glycerol, in the presence of an acyl acceptor and a catalyst. Due to high selectivity when using enzymes as catalysts, and mild operating conditions, biocatalytic transesterification has proven to be an efficient method. Cutinase, from the superfamily α/β hydrolases, is an enzyme with lipolytic activity that effectively catalyses transesterification reactions. This article highlights the use of cutinase microencapsulated in bis(2ethylhexyl) sodium sulfosuccinate (AOT)-reversed micelles to perform the biocatalytic transesterification of triglycerides, with low chain-length alcohols (e.g. methanol), in organic media to produce biodiesel. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - How consumers might switch from gasoline and diesel to alternative energy sources is not known, since the availability of alternatives is currently very limited. To bridge this gap, we exploit exogenous variation in ethanol prices at Brazil's pumps and uncover substantial consumer heterogeneity in the choice between long-established gasoline and an alternative that is similarly available and usable: sugarcane ethanol. We observe roughly 20% of flexible-fuel motorists choosing gasoline when gasoline is priced 20% above ethanol in energy-adjusted terms ($/mile) and, similarly, 20% of motorists choosing ethanol when ethanol is priced 20% above gasoline. We use transaction-level data to explore "non-price" characteristics which differentiate the two goods in the minds of different groups of consumers. Our findings suggest-and a counterfactual illustrates-that switching away from gasoline en masse, should this be desired, would require considerable price discounts to boost voluntary adoption, in the US and elsewhere. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Fatty acid derivatives have ideal properties for use as drop-in biofuels. An effective strategy in engineering microbial cells to maximize productivity and yield involves dynamic control of protein production in response to concentrations of key intermediates. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the activities of the native transcription factors responsive to fatty acids are repressed in the presence of a glucose carbon source. In order to develop a modular fatty acid regulation system in S. cerevisiae, we constructed fatty acid/fatty acyl-CoA biosensors in S. cerevisiae using bacterial FadR transcriptional repressors and yeast synthetic promoters containing DNA-binding operators. We demonstrated the functionality of FadR repressors in S. cerevisiae, and tuned the sensing system by varying the promoter strength upstream to the FadR-coding sequence by varying the number of operator sites in the synthetic promoter and by using FadR from two bacterial sources (Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae) with different ligand sensitivities. We envision that our fatty acid/fatty acyl-CoA biosensors can be used for regulation of protein expression based on the availability of fatty acid intermediates, which will assist in balancing of cellular metabolism during fatty acid derivatives production in yeast. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Over the past decade, both Asia and Europe have devoted considerable effort to expanding the production of first-generation biofuels to fuel cars, taxis, buses, trucks, motorcycles, etc. On the one hand, with "peak oil" potentially looming in the future, and on the other, with an insatiable need for petroleum and diesel, the prospect of large-scale use of biofuels enjoyed tremendous public appeal as they seemed to provide a long-term alternative and clean fuel source in Asia and Europe. However, globally today, biofuels constitute only 3 % of the total transport fuel mix. Production is still steadily increasing in some countries, but their economic competitiveness and environmental sustainability have come into question in others with the result that production has slowed down considerably or even halted. The outlook for second- and third-generation biofuels is promising. However, they also cannot yet supplement, far less substitute, for petroleum and diesel in a commercially viable way. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) has potential as an oilseed crop that may be grown during fall (autumn) and winter months in the Midwestern United States and harvested in the early spring as a biodiesel feedstock. There has been little agronomic improvement in pennycress through traditional breeding. Recent advances in genomic technologies allow for the development of genomic tools to enable rapid improvements to be made through genomic assisted breeding. Here we report an annotated transcriptome assembly for pennycress. RNA was isolated from representative plant tissues, and 203 million unique Illumina RNA-seq reads were produced and used in the transcriptome assembly. The draft transcriptome assembly consists of 33 873 contigs with a mean length of 1242 bp. A global comparison of homology between the pennycress and Arabidopsis transcriptomes, along with four other Brassicaceae species, revealed a high level of global sequence conservation within the family. The final assembly was functionally annotated, allowing for the identification of putative genes controlling important agronomic traits such as flowering and glucosinolate metabolism. Identification of these genes leads to testable hypotheses concerning their conserved function and to rational strategies to improve agronomic properties in pennycress. Future work to characterize isoform variation between diverse pennycress lines and develop a draft genome sequence for pennycress will further direct trait improvement. © 2013 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This study presents Bacillus firmus NII 0830 for producing poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) using bio diesel industry generated glycerol, a waste by-product, as sole carbon source under submerged fermentation and production process was optimized using statistical experimental design. PHB accumulation was observed up to 1.60 g/l from 4.36 g/l of total bacterial biomass at inoculum size of 3% v/v, incubation temperature 30°C, crude glycerol concentration 5% v/v, 250 RPM, incubation time 60 h and media pH 6.0 during initial statistical design. Further Response Surface design experiments yielded 61% of PHB from B. firmus NII 0830. Glycerol has a low market price and it does not require any further refinement, makes present process more economical. Further, utilization of low-grade waste glycerol solves its disposal problem, hence it is aptly an environmentally friendly 'waste to wealth' bioprocess.

AB  - The necessity to move towards a sustainable economy is increasing day by day owing to various problems like climate change, increasing crude oil prices, etc. In this line, hydropyrolysis of Jatropha seed deoiled cake has been carried out at various pressures of hydrogen (1, 20, 40 and 52 bar) at 450 °C. With an increase in pressure under the experimental conditions of present study from 1 to 40 bar, the yield of bio-oil is found to have increased and beyond 40 bar the bio-oil yields have decreased. It has been observed that the liquid bio-oil yield is highest at 17 wt% at 40 bar. The FTIR spectrum of the bio-oil and char at 40 bar shows maximum functionality, indicating the clear opening of the macromolecular structure. The EDAX analysis of the hydropyrolysis char obtained at 40 bar pressure show a maximum of 85 wt% carbon and minimum of oxygen 13 wt%. © 2013 Springer Japan.

AB  - Biofuel crops are promoted as a climate friendly alternative to fossil energy. Yet environmental risks such as potential biodiversity loss are not always adequately considered. This might occur directly as a consequence of land-use change from natural systems to biofuel plantations, but also through invasive behavior of the biofuel species, as it might disperse and establish into adjacent natural systems. Therefore, there is a need to perform ex-ante invasiveness risk assessments including field trials on new biofuel species before they get promoted and expanded on a large scale. This perspective uses Jatropha curcas L. as a model biofuel crop and reviews the biological traits and the circumstantial factors which may contribute to its invasive behavior. J. curcas has recently received much attention as a biodiesel 'wonder crop' and is being planted at large scale without scientific study on its invasiveness risk. We applied two risk assessment frameworks to provide an ex-ante invasiveness risk assessment and obtained that J. curcas is a species with a high invasiveness risk, which is in contradiction with recent experimental evidence. We discuss the limitations of the available risk assessment frameworks, which may have led to unreliable prediction. We interpret the outcome of this theoretical exercise with some recommendations for the selection, introduction, cultivation, and processing stages of J. curcas and other biofuel crops to minimize invasiveness risk. Finally we point to the responsibilities of investors and governments and the need for integrated research of the whole biofuel production supply chain to avoid bio-invasions. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel, as one type of renewable energy, is an ideal substitute for petroleum-based diesel fuel and is usually made from triacylglycerides by transesterification with alcohols. Biodiesel production based on microbial fermentation aiming to establish more efficient, less-cost and sustainable biodiesel production strategies is under current investigation by various start-up biotechnology companies and research centers. Genetic engineering plays a key role in the transformation of microbes into the desired cell factories with high efficiency of biodiesel production. Here, we present an overview of principal microorganisms used in the microbial biodiesel production and recent advances in metabolic engineering for the modification required. Overexpression or deletion of the related enzymes for de novo synthesis of biodiesel is highlighted with relevant examples. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) has been identified as a biodiesel plant globally. Efforts are underway to domesticate JCL for high seed yield. The plant has potential to grow on marginal/degraded/substandard lands to avoid competition with food crops, but little is known about its potential to reclaim degraded lands. At this study, several accessions of JCL were planted in 2005 on sodic soil to assess soil amelioration potential of the plant. After six years (2011) of plant growth, seed yield was not economically viable; however, soil properties improved significantly when compared to initial (0-year plantation) soil properties at 0-15cm soil depth. Random soil samples were collected from 0 to 15cm soil depth beneath and outside canopies of JCL with high, medium and poor growth in the year 2008 (3-year plantation) and 2011 (6-year plantation). Soil bulk density, pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) decreased and soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), microbial biomass (MB-C, MB-N and MB-P) and enzyme activities (dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase and protease) increased significantly with effect of JCL plantation. Significant decrease in soil pH, EC and ESP has been noticed from 8.6 to 7.6, 1.29 to 0.98dSm-1 and 20.7% to 13.8%, respectively. Similarly, soil fertility parameters like SOC, MB-C, dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase and protease increased significantly from 4.55 to 8.41gkg-1, 98 to 352μgg-1, 16.3 to 51.2μgTPFg-1h-1, 75.8 to 338.2μgPNPg-1h-1 and 43.7 to 163.2μgTyrosineg-1h-1, respectively after 6 years of JCL cultivation on sodic soil. Changes in soil properties were significantly higher beneath the canopy than outside canopy. Soil sodicity parameters (bulk density, pH, EC and ESP) and fertility attributes (SOC, N, P, MB and enzymes) were significantly negatively and positively correlated with the height, biomass and litter fall of JCL, respectively. Furthermore, to test whether changes in soil properties are induced by test crop, changes were compared with Prosopis juliflora plantation of same age, which is generally planted for amelioration of sodic soils. The significant decrease in soil sodicity and increase in soil fertility conclude that JCL is equally good to reclaim the sodic soils. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Piggery effluent is one of the most highly produced wastewaters throughout the world, containing high levels of inorganic nutrient species. In this study, a microalga Scenedesmus obliquus YSW-14 (S. obliquus) was employed not only for nutrient removal from piggery wastewater effluent but also for lipid accumulation in the algal biomass as a feedstock for biofuel production. The piggery wastewater effluent was diluted up to fivefold with synthetic media to reduce the toxicity of (in)organic components, which resulted in improved microalgal growth, nutrient removal, and lipid productivity. Among the examined culture conditions, a 40% concentration of wastewater effluent was found to be most effective for microalga lipid productivity (0.13 mg L-1). S. obliquus removed 155 mg total nitrogen and 4 mg total phosphate per gram of dried algae for growth at the same dilution condition. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using microalgae for advanced wastewater treatment and subsequent production of lipids as biofuel feedstock. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The effluent from a continuous-flow stirred tank reactor (CSTR) treating synthetic wastewater was used as an alternative carbon source to glucose for algal biomass and biodiesel production. The influence of the effluent on microalgal cell growth and lipid yield, as well as the utilization of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in the effluent were investigated. The results indicate that C. protothecoides can proliferate in the CSTR effluent and accumulate biolipid. The final lipid content of the culture with the effluent feeding was 27 ± 1.11 % after 168 h cultivation in flasks, which was higher than that with glucose of the same COD concentration. Valeric acid, ethanol, and butyric acid were favorable carbon sources for cell growth. The soluble microbial products (SMP) can be used as a carbon source for cell growth, and the existence of SMP could protect the cell from the inhibition caused by strong VFAs and improve the utilization of VFAs. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The rapid growth of worldwide energy demands has led to mounting concerns about energy shortages and has promoted the development of biofuels, which are susceptible to climate change. To evaluate the effects of future environmental changes such as CO2 enrichment and water stress on the growth and biodiesel production of bioenergy plants, we exposed Jatropha curcas to two levels of CO2 concentration (ambient and elevated) and three watering regimes (well-watered, moderate drought, and severe drought) to study its biomass accumulation and allocation, energy cost-gain properties, and photosynthetic response. Elevated CO2 enhanced biomass accumulation of J. curcas by 31.5, 25.9, and 14.4 % under well-watered, moderate drought, and severe drought treatments, respectively, indicating that the stimulating effect was greater under optimum water conditions than in water-deficit conditions. Drought stress significantly increased the biomass allocation to roots, especially the fine roots. CO2 enrichment also increased the root mass fraction, though not significantly. CO2 enrichment significantly enhanced the photosynthetic rate measured under growth CO2 concentration (A growth) and decreased foliar N content and therefore construction cost irrespective of watering conditions. Under elevated CO2, J. curcas employed a quicker return energy use strategy indicated by the higher photosynthetic energy use efficiency and lower payback time. There was a pronounced downregulation in the light-saturated photosynthetic rate under the common CO2 concentration (P max) under long-term CO2 exposure, due to a decrease in the initial and total ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) activities and partially lower foliar N content. The significant interaction of CO2 enrichment and watering regimes implied that the stimulation of plant growth by CO2 enrichment may be negated by soil drought in the future. Long-term field experiments manipulating multiple factors simultaneously are needed to explore how the ecophysiological traits measured for J. curcas translate into bioenergy production. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - In the present paper, (infrared) IR measurements were performed in order to study the behaviour of biofuels combustion in a transparent Euro 5 diesel engine operating in premixed mode. (Commercial diesel fuel) REF, (Gas To Liquid) GTL and (Rapeseed Methyl Ester) RME biofuels have been used. An elongated single-cylinder transparent engine equipped with the multi-cylinder head of commercial passenger car and (common rail) CR injection system was used. A sapphire window was set in the bottom of the combustion chamber, and a sapphire ring was placed in the upper part of the cylinder. Measurements were carried out through both accesses by means of high-speed infrared digital imaging system. IR camera was able to detect the emitted light in the wavelength range 1.5-5μm. Infrared imaging allowed acquiring larger amount of information than UV (ultraviolet) and visible cameras. In particular the IR camera was used for the characterization of injection and combustion process. Analysing the IR images, it was possible to identify clearly the seven jets of vaporized fuel that react with air in the bowl. During the late combustion phase, the IR image showed a good capability to follow the hot burned gas both in the bowl and above the piston. The IR camera has shown high sensibility permitting to follow carefully the soot oxidation process within the cylinder. The GTL shows an advance of about 8° crank angles in the evolution of combustion process with respect to the RME. On the contrary a longer chemical activity has been detected for the latter biofuel. Finally, the IR camera was revealed very useful tool to characterize the combustion process for long time allowing high quality of the results. Images of the reactions that happen in the combustion chamber and above the piston head were clearly acquired even if the optical windows were obscured by the soot produced from the previous combustion cycles. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lipids and carbohydrates are employed in the nature to store internal energy due to the large number of the high energy atomic bonds in their structure. Internal energy stored in the bonds is used to fuel work producing engines or metabolic activity of living organisms. This paper investigates the thermodynamic efficiency of the glucose and lipid synthesis and breakdown by photosynthetic microalgae. Photosynthetic microalgae are able to convert 3.8% of the solar exergy into the chemical exergy of algal lipid. As the microalgae convert the first product of the photosynthesis, i.e. glucose, into lipid, 47-49% of the chemical exergy is lost. If the microalgal cell consumes the photosynthetically produced glucose for its own energy demand, then about 30% of the glucose exergy can be converted into work potential in case of immediate and short-term energy demands. Organism can convert about 22% of the glucose exergy into work potential after a long-term storage. If the algal lipid is harvested for biodiesel production and the produced biodiesel is combusted in a Diesel engine, then about 17% of the exergy of the photosynthetically produced glucose can be converted into useful work. Biodiesel is among the most popular renewable fuels. The lipids are harvested from their storage in the cells to produce biodiesel before following the lipid breakdown path of the cellular metabolism. Our analysis indicates that, extracting the first product of photosynthesis, i.e. glucose or glucose polymers instead of lipids may be more efficient thermodynamically, if new motors capable to extract their bond energy is developed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study estimated the greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) and net energy ratio (NER) for producing hydrogenation-derived renewable diesel (HDRD) from canola and camelina in Western Canada. Using 1MJ of energy in the HDRD produced as the functional unit, a variety of scenarios were evaluated to account for variations in allocation methods, co-products, oilseed yield, N2O emission factor, and land use change (LUC). In producing HDRD, the farming stage and the oil conversion stage (i.e. the HDRD production stage) are the most energy and emission intensive. For canola based HDRD, the GHGs and NERs lie in the ranges of 33-94gCO2e/MJ and 1.2-2.2MJ/MJ respectively. For camelina based HDRD, the GHGs and NERs range from 30 - 82gCO2e/MJ and 1.0-2.3MJ/MJ respectively. In the base scenario (mass allocation; oilseed meal and propane fuel gas co-products; average yield; 0.76% N2O emission factor; LUC ignored), HDRD from camelina (38gCO2e/MJ, 2.0MJ/MJ) is environmentally superior to HDRD from canola (48gCO2e/MJ, 1.7MJ/MJ) due to lower agricultural inputs and higher yield for camelina. Considering all of the scenarios examined, HDRD from both crops appears to be more sustainable than fossil diesel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Traditionally, biodiesel has been produced from edible oils due to their low free fatty acids. However, their use has elevated some issues such as food versus fuel and many other problems that have negatively affected their economic viability. Therefore, exploration of non-edible oils may significantly reduce the cost of biodiesel especially in poor countries which can barely afford the high cost of edible oils. This paper aims to produce biodiesel from several edible and non-edible oils that are readily available in the South East Asian market. These oils include; Jatropha curcas, Calophyllum inophyllum, Sterculia foetida, Moringa oleifera, Croton megalocarpus, Patchouli, Elaeis guineensis (palm), Cocos nucifera (coconut), Brassica napus (canola) and Glycine Max (soybean) oils. This was followed by an investigation of physico-chemical properties of the produced biodiesel. This paper also discusses the concept of biodiesel blending to improve some of the properties of these feedstocks. For instance, blending of SFME and CoME improves the viscosity of SFME from 6.3717mm2/s to 5.3349mm2/s (3:1), 4.4912mm2/s (1:1) and 3.879mm2/s (1:3). The properties of other biodiesel blends were estimated using the polynomial curve fitting method. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study examined bio-oil and bio-char fuel produced from Spirulina Sp. by slow pyrolysis. A thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) was used to investigate the pyrolytic characteristics and essential components of algae. It was found that the temperature for the maximum degradation, 322°C, is lower than that of other biomass. With our fixed-bed reactor, 125g of dried Spirulina Sp. algae was fed under a nitrogen atmosphere until the temperature reached a set temperature between 450 and 600°C. It was found that the suitable temperature to obtain bio-char and bio-oil were at approximately 500 and 550°C respectively. The bio-oil components were identified by a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The saturated functional carbon of the bio-oil was in a range of heavy naphtha, kerosene and diesel oil. The energy consumption ratio (ECR) of bio-oil and bio-char was calculated, and the net energy output was positive. The ECR had an average value of 0.49. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The growing need to use biofuel raw materials that do not compete with food and feed have resulted in a growing interest in lignocellulosic materials and microalgae. However, the life cycle environmental benefits of both biofuels have been questioned. The aim of this study was to evaluate how environmental sustainability of forest-based and microalgae biodiesel can be estimated by using the life cycle assessment framework. These biofuel chains were chosen because they are contrasting systems, as the first one is based on a "natural" feedstock production system, while the second one is an entirely anthropogenic system using an artificial infrastructure and external inputs to grow microalgae. This study focuses on life cycle impact categories still under methodological development, namely resource depletion, land use and land use change, water use, soil quality impacts and biodiversity. In addition, climate impacts were quantified in order to exemplify the uncertainty of the results and the complexity of estimating the parameters. This study demonstrates the difficulty to assess the absolute range of the total environmental impacts of the two systems. The results propose that the greenhouse gas emissions of microalgae biodiesel are higher than those of forest residue-based biodiesel, but the results of the microalgae chain are very uncertain due to the early development stage of the technology, and due to assumptions made concerning the electricity mix. On the other hand, the microalgae system has other advantages such as low competition on productive land and low biodiversity impacts. The findings help to recognise the main characteristics of the two production chains, and the main remaining research issues on bioenergy assessment along with the methodological development needs of life cycle approaches. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Agricultural residues offer the possibility of reducing fossil fuel consumption, increasing energy security, and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. However, certain residues, like palm oil residues, either represent a disposal problem for the processing industries or they are not used and thus, there is a considerable potential for improvement. These factors represent a strong driving force for the development of innovative polygeneration plants based on solid residues. This paper considers an energy analysis of a palm oil mill (POM) in Colombia processing 30. ton of fresh fruit bunch per hour (FFB/h). Different heat and power generation options were considered with solid residues as feedstock. These configurations included steam cycles using backpressure or condensing-extraction turbines. The possibilities to produce pellets from the residues and biodiesel from palm oil were also analyzed. The steam cycle base operational parameters were 20. bar and 350°C. More advanced steam conditions (40. bar) were also considered. The results show that it is possible to cover the demand of the POM and the required energy demand for residues preparation including possible pelletization and also biodiesel production. It is possible to obtain an excess of electricity between 0.4 and 3. MW if only residues are used. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent fertilizer-derived greenhouse gas which plays a predominant role in the life-cycle assessment of biofuels. The use of generic emissions factors to estimate its emissions in such context has been widely criticized because of its lack of accuracy, since N2O emissions are highly dependent on local soil and climate conditions, as well as crop management. This paper proposes an alternative method using an agroecosystem model (CERES-EGC) at interconnected geographical scales (from plot to regional). This method was applied to a case study comparing 1st and 2nd generation bioethanol made from sugar beet and Miscanthus feedstock, respectively, in the Picardy region (France), using a spatially-explicit approach and simple land-use options. This new method made it possible to capture the variability in direct N2O emissions in relation to pedoclimatic conditions. Biomass supply options, minimizing N2O emissions or minimizing the land area used by maximizing high yielding units, were used to select the most suitable arable fields on which to grow the feedstock. There were few differences between the two options in terms of area of land cultivated for both crops. However for sugar beet, the effect of minimizing total direct N2O emissions was more noticeable. Regional yield and N2O emission maps resulted in supply curves useful to optimize the placement of biorefinery facilities and feedstock production fields. This method should be further completed with the estimation of changes in soil carbon stocks to take into account land-use change effects and with landscape-scale simulation to consider indirect downstream emissions. © Springer Science+Business Media 2012.

AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential use of biodiesel produced from waste cooking oil (WCO) in Mexico and its CO2 emission reduction potential for the Mexican transport sector and associated costs. The results show, based on 2010 data, that the potential of biodiesel from WCO is between 7.8PJ and 17.7PJ that represent between 1.5% and 3.3% of petro-diesel consumption for the road transport sector and can reduce between 0.51 and 1.02Mt of CO2, (1.0%-2.7% of CO2-associated emissions), depending on the recovery ratio of WCO from vegetable oil consumption for cooking and considering CO2 emissions for biodiesel production and methanol emissions during production and combustion in the blend. Primary energy used to produce 1MJ of WCO-biodiesel is 0.8727MJ, while literature reports 1.2007MJ to produce 1MJ of petro-diesel. Biodiesel costs are similar to petro-diesel costs if WCO is free. The paper offers suggestions for policies that promote increased recollection of WCO for biodiesel production and reduced illegal marketing of WCO, which is the main barrier to increase biodiesel production from WCO. The data used for the analysis is based on a case study of a WCO biodiesel plant that operates in Mexico City. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An integrated approach, which combined freshwater microalgae Chlorella zofingiensis cultivation with piggery wastewater treatment, was investigated in the present study. The characteristics of algal growth, lipid and biodiesel production, and nutrient removal were examined by using tubular bubble column photobioreactors to cultivate C. zofingiensis in piggery wastewater with six different concentrations. Pollutants in piggery wastewater were efficiently removed among all the treatments. The specific growth rate and biomass productivity were different among all the cultures. As the initial nutrient concentration increased, the lipid content of C. zofingiensis decreased. The differences in lipid and biodiesel productivity of C. zofingiensis among all the treatments mainly resulted from the differences in biomass productivity. It is worthy of note that the diluted piggery wastewater with 1900mgL-1 COD provided an optimal nutrient concentration for C. zofingiensis cultivation, where the advantageous nutrient removal and the highest productivities of biomass, lipid and biodiesel were presented. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydroprocessing catalysts, sulfided Ni-W (on mesoporous silica-alumina) and Ni-Mo (on mesoporous γ-alumina), under typical hydroprocessing conditions, can very effectively produce liquid fuel from mixtures of waste vegetable oil and refinery gas oil. The acidity of the catalyst controls the relative amount of diesel range (straight chain) alkanes and cracked lighter products. The yield of diesel range (250-380°C) product varied between 60 and 90%, while kerosene (jet) range product varied between 10 and 35% depending upon the reaction conditions and type of catalyst used. The hydrodeoxygenation pathway for oxygen removal from triglyceride seems to be favored over the Ni-Mo catalyst, while decarboxylation+decarbonylation pathway is favored over the Ni-W catalyst and the respective pathways becomes more dominant with increasing vegetable-oil content in the feed. Vegetable oil conversion does not adversely influence hydrodesulfurization of gas oil indicating viability of co-processing. The activation energy for overall S-removal is much lower than that for overall O-removal. Density and acidity (TAN) of the products meet the required specification and cetane number is better than that for pure diesel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An industrial project was developed to optimize the biodiesel production from crude palm oil. This process was developed for a one ton scale application on the palm oil production facility in equatorial Africa, to be used on the plantation to provide fuel for the fleet of the company. Because of the specific conditions (crude palm oil as starting material, application in technologically difficult conditions), it was essential for the developed procedure to be robust and simple, and to use minimum amounts of chemicals. The process was optimised on lab-scale in 2005 and 2006, scaled up in the following year, and is since then successfully applied as intended on the palm oil plantation. The produced biodiesel is used pure, without mixing with diesel fuel and without additives. After several years of continuous use, no negative effects were noticed on the engines. The process efficiency and durability are therefore confirmed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present world is in a dilemma with fast depletion of fossil fuels. So there arises a drastic need for development of biofuels to power the earth. From an environmental point of view, biodiesel has great potential as an alternative diesel fuel. In this study, lipase from Burkholderia cepacia was first cross linked with glutaraldehyde followed by entrapment in a hybrid matrix of equal proportions of alginate and κ-carrageenan. Later, this biocatalyst was employed for biodiesel production from crude Jatropha curcas L. oil. The optimal conditions for processing 10g crude Jatropha oil were: 35°C, 1:10molratio of oil to ethanol, 1g water, 5.25g immobilized lipase, 6g RCF and 24h reaction time. At the optimal conditions, 100% yield of fatty acid ethyl esters could be achieved. The immobilized lipase was stable and retained 73% relative transesterification activity after six cycles of reuse. This shows that the immobilized lipase in alginate/κ-carrageenan matrix is a potential environmental friendly biocatalyst for biodiesel industry. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The production of liquid biofuels from biomass stocks for the substitution of crude oil products (gasoline, diesel, etc.) in the transportation sector is one of the main objectives of bioenergy research. One of the main advantages of using biofuels is that, if one considers their complete life cycle, their carbon emissions can be substantially lower than in the case of fossil fuels. In this chapter, we describe all biofuel technologies and prospects. Thus, bioethanol and biodiesel that are usually produced from agricultural crops may have reached economic viability, but they also compete against food production elevating their prices. For this reason, second-generation biofuels are currently being developed which use lignocellulosic biomass (straw, grass, forestry sawdust, etc.) and therefore do not compete for agricultural land and water. In addition, we also treat in this chapter the so-called third-generation biofuels, like those obtained from microalgae, which offer excellent prospects for the production of biodiesel due to their high concentration in lipids. Besides, microalgae do not compete for large freshwater resources and can act as CO2 sinks during their growth. Hydrogen obtained from biomass can be considered another third-generation biofuel, but it is described in Chap. 5. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.

AB  - Architectonics of the paper-structured catalyst for the application to the biofuel reformer or direct internal reforming SOFC (DIRSOFC) was studied. Inorganic fiber network, "paper", composed of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) fiber (Zf), alumina fiber (Af) and inorganic binder (Al 2O3 sol (As) or ZrO2 sol (Zs) or CeO 2 sol (Cs)) was prepared by a simple paper-making process. Then, the catalytic activities of the Ni and Ni-MgO loaded papers called "paper-structured catalysts (PSCs)" for the steam reforming of biodiesel fuels (BDFs) were evaluated. Ni-MgO loaded PSC using Cs as an inorganic binder, Ni-MgO/ZfAfCs, exhibited excellent performance over Ru/γAl2O3 catalyst beads. Formation of light hydrocarbons, especially C2H4, was eliminated and water-gas shift reaction was more promoted compared to the catalyst beads.© 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - Understanding the radiative forcing caused by anthropogenic aerosol sources is essential for making effective emission control decisions to mitigate climate change. We examined the net direct plus indirect radiative forcing caused by carbonaceous aerosol and sulfur emissions in key sectors of China and India using the GISS-E2 chemistry-climate model. Diesel trucks and buses (67 mW m-2) and residential biofuel combustion (52 mW m-2) in India have the largest global mean, annual average forcings due mainly to the direct and indirect effects of BC. Emissions from these two sectors in China have near-zero net global forcings. Coal-fired power plants in both countries exert a negative forcing of about -30 mW m-2 from production of sulfate. Aerosol forcings are largest locally, with direct forcings due to residential biofuel combustion of 580 mW m-2 over India and 416 mW m-2 over China, but they extend as far as North America, Europe, and the Arctic. Key Points Direct and indirect effects of aerosol sources are quantified Residential biofuel combustion in India has the largest local forcing Local aerosol emissions in China cause forcing far away, including the Arctic. © 2013.

AB  - Crude glycerol is a byproduct of biodiesel production. In this study, we isolated a yeast strain that grows vigorously using crude glycerol as a carbon source, and tested the effects of culture conditions on triacylglycerol (TG) production. TYC-2187, isolated from wild grapes and identified as Pseudozyma sp., converted high-concentration crude glycerol into TG more efficiently than other strains of the genus Pseudozyma. Sequence analysis of the 26S rRNA gene D1/D2 domain indicated that TYC-2187 diverged from other strains of the genus Pseudozyma. Optimum culture temperature and optimum initial pH of culture medium, that maximized TG yield of TYC-2187, were 25°C and pH 6.0, respectively. Optimum nitrogen source was yeast extract and optimum concentration was 10 g/L. Optimum concentration of glycerol, when the yeast was cultured for 48 h under optimum conditions, was 80 g/L. TG yield peaked at 15.7 g/L at 48 h and then remained at this level until 66 h. In addition, much of the glycerol in the medium had been consumed by 48 h. Fatty acid composition of TG produced by TYC-2187, including linolenic acid methyl ester content, iodine value, and cetane number, complied with biodiesel standards. These results suggest that the TYC-2187 yeast strain is superbly able to produce TG that is suitable for biodiesel production using crude glycerol. © 2013 by Japan Oil Chemists' Society.

AB  - The oilseed camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz) was grown extensively in Northern Europe up to the 1950s. Increasing fuel prices coupled with a 'diet-conscious' society have revived interest in camelina for food and biofuel uses. This study assessed the agronomic potential of the crop under Mediterranean dryland conditions and the scope for selection in a diverse collection for food and biofuel use. Yield trials were conducted in the Western Australian wheatbelt between 1999 and 2008. In 14 environments, camelina gave an average yield of 1.04tha-1 compared with the canola (Brassica napus L.) control yield of 1.48tha-1. Camelina outyielded canola significantly at one site, whereas canola significantly outyielded camelina at five sites. Thirty accessions of camelina from five countries were compared in the field in 2011. Agronomic characteristics were recorded and fatty acid analyses performed; significant differences were observed. Accessions were identified with desirable biofuel qualities, and others selected as having fatty acid characteristics suitable for food use. Averaged over accessions, erucic acid content was high at 4.0%, ranging from 5.2% to a low of 2.5% in accession 4130. However, this line was tested in the agronomic trials and its fatty acid profiles varied greatly across environments. For stockfeed use, the protein content of the seed was found to be in range 23.2-29.1%. © CSIRO 2013.

AB  - Biofuel is becoming prominent among the alternatives to conventional petro-diesel due to economic, environmental and social factors. In this paper we have presented a study of the quality of biodiesel influenced by the physical and chemical properties. The values of physical and chemical properties of biodiesel were compared with American Standards and Testing Materials (ASTM). The physico-chemical properties of groundnut oil and reused groundnut oil were assessed for their potential in biodiesel production. We determined acid value, saponification number, Iodine value, cloud point, pour point, kinetic viscosity, flash point, fire point, copper strip corrosion, cetane number, heat of combustion, specific gravity and boiling point. The results show that the groundnut oil produced high quality biodiesel as compared to reused groundnut oil.

AB  - Biodiesel production has received considerable attention in the recent past as a biodegradable and non polluting fuel. Alkyl esters of fatty acid (biodiesel) have several outstanding advantages among other non-renewable and clean engine fuel alternative and can be used in any diesel engine without any modification. Transesterification of edible and non- edible oils is mainly used to decrease the viscosity of edible and non-edible oil; however, other properties of the oil remain same and this new fuel has been called as biodiesel. It consists of edible and non-edible oil and belongs to ecological fuels because of the qualitative composition (carbon 77%, hydrogen 12% and oxygen 11%). Environmental benefits of its use include lower exhaust emission of particulate matter and green house gases, such as CO, CO2 and SOx. Biodiesel is an environment friendly biofuel since it provides a means to recycle of CO2; biodiesel does not contribute global warming. Perhaps the next most critical pollutant from the perspectives of human health and environmental quality is NOx; NOx is the key to controlling ground level ozone and smog in urban areas. The review paper presents the results of biodiesel combustion emission on the environment.

AB  - The decarboxylation of brown grease (BG) to green diesel hydrocarbons over a 5 wt % Pd/C catalyst was investigated in semibatch and batch reactors. Catalytic deoxygenation of BG under H2-Ar occurs primarily via decarboxylation with the liquid products of primarily n-heptadecane and n-pentadecane. A 90% conversion of BG in a semibatch mode was obtained in 7 h. In contrast, in a batch reaction the conversion was roughly 40% in the same reaction time. However, by pretreating the "as received" BG with H2, the conversion in a batch reactor was increased 1.4-fold; and when the H2 to BG ratio was increased to 3/1 (mol/mol), the conversion was further improved. A complete conversion of BG into green diesel via decarboxylation is possible over 5% Pd/C catalyst at 300 C and 1.5 MPa. This study demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining valuable green diesel biofuel from waste oil. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The present work is a literature review on combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of biodiesel fuels derived from different origins. Substitute for fossil fuels with renewable biofuels has been set as a target across world to reduce greenhouse effect and energy dependence as well as to improve rural economy. Biodiesel can be considered as one of the potential renewable energy sources for diesel engines. Biodiesel can be used directly or in blended form of diesel. In the present review, the results of combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of biodiesels obtained from different feedstocks which are reported in various research studies are discussed. From the review, it is observed that the combustion characteristics of biodiesel are almost similar to that of diesel. Biodiesel fuels show a slightly inferior performance when compared to diesel. The reported values of oxides of nitrogen emissions from biodiesels were higher as compared to diesel, whereas the carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and smoke emissions of biodiesel fuels are comparable to diesel. From the present review, biodiesel fuels can be recommended as a prospective alternative fuel for conventional petro-diesel fuel.

AB  - A large abundance of environmentally harmful biomass waste is generated by water blooms. In order to provide an applicable solution for the relief of the environmental pressure, natural algae of Taihu Lake water blooms (CTL), mainly cyanobacteria, were catalytically pyrolyzed over silica-supported nickel phosphide to produce bio-oil. The properties of the bio-oil, such as chemical composition, elemental composition, and higher heating value (HHV), were examined. The composition of the gas product was also detected. The results suggest that catalytic pyrolysis could effectively convert the algae to a high quality bio-oil, in which the oxygen content was considerably reduced from 41.7 wt% in the algae to 8.0 wt% in the bio-oil. Long-chained alkanes became the primary component (59.4%). The HHV of the bio-oil obtained from catalytic pyrolysis was 37.2 MJ kg-1. The results indicate that it is possible to achieve high-grade renewable transportation fuels via catalytic pyrolysis of environmentally harmful CTL, and nickel phosphide is an applicable and effective catalyst. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

AB  - Biofuels are advanced to replace fossil fuels in order to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and other environmental impacts. Yet freshwater scarcity is another growing concern and increased production of biofuels may increase this problem. In order to assess whether biofuels truly have a higher water use than do fossil fuels, a life cycle assessment study of a low input jatropha plantation in northern Mozambique was conducted. In addition to different water use indicators, the fossil energy use and global warming potential were assessed for 1 MJ of jatropha oil. The analysis compares results for jatropha oil with fossil diesel, generally showing lower global warming potential and fossil energy use for jatropha oil. However, aspects related to land use may alter the global warming potential of jatropha oil. Regarding water use, the choice of the water use indicator strongly influences the results. Specifically the indication of (1) so-called green water flows, (2) formation of so-called blue water and (3) water scarcity show crucial influences on the comparison. Depending on these specific features, jatropha oil may have higher or lower water use than fossil diesel. A number of uncertainties, such as the jatropha oil yield, are also shown to have a considerable impact on the results. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Life cycle studies of corn ethanol have largely centered on the fuel's carbon and energy benefits. However, with the recognition that this narrow focus falls short of addressing the environmental sustainability of fuel substitution, there is a growing body of literature that extends assessment to a broader range of impacts, such as eutrophication, smog formation, acidification, and water and land use. Using the USEtox impact assessment model, this study evaluates the life cycle freshwater ecotoxicity, human health cancer, and noncancer effects of U.S. corn ethanol and gasoline, which are less well understood in comparison to other impact categories. This study also takes into account spatial and temporal variations in corn production and ethanol conversion technologies. Results show that corn ethanol generates potentially larger freshwater ecotoxicity than gasoline due to releases of pesticides in corn growth, particularly, atrazine, acetochlor, chlorpyrifos, and cyfluthrin. So does corn ethanol have a higher potential noncancer impact due to releases of heavy metals through use of phosphate fertilizers. The two fuels seem to induce similar potential caner impacts. The results indicate that replacing gasoline with corn ethanol could further degrade water quality and exacerbate noncancer related human health issues. Overall, this study implies that environmental policymaking should consider a broader spectrum of impacts beyond carbon and energy to avoid or minimize potential environmental burden-shifting. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, prepared silica supported sulfonic acid was used as a heterogeneous catalyst for the production of 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) from fructose based carbohydrates and the synthesis of ethyl d-glucopyranoside from glucose based carbohydrates in ethanol. EMF was obtained in a high yield of 83.8% from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) after 10 h, and a 63.1% yield was obtained from fructose at 100°C for 24 h. Temperature experiments demonstrated that a higher reaction temperature (in the case of 120°C) resulted in side reactions such as polymerization of HMF and alcoholysis of HMF into ethyl levulinates. When di- and poly-saccharides (sucrose and inulin) were used, the fructose moieties in sucrose and inulin were also successfully converted into EMF. However, the silica supported sulfonic acid catalyst was inert for the production of EMF from aldose based carbohydrates such as glucose and cellobiose. Ethyl d-glucopyranoside was formed in a high yield of 91.7% from glucose. More importantly, the catalyst could be reused several times without losing its catalytic activity with an average EMF yield of around 60% from a one-pot reaction of fructose. This work provides a good outlook for the conversion of carbohydrates into fine chemicals and biofuel additive. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

AB  - To characterize the metabolic signatures of lipid accumulation in Jatropha curcas seeds, comparative proteomic technique was employed to profile protein changes during the seed development. Temporal changes in comparative proteome were examined using gels-based proteomic technique at six developmental stages for lipid accumulation. And 104 differentially expressed proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry. These protein species were classified into 10 functional categories, and the results demonstrated that protein species related to energy and metabolism were notably accumulated and involved in the carbon flux to lipid accumulation that occurs primarily from early to late stage in seed development. Glycolysis and oxidative pentose phosphate pathways were the major pathways of producing carbon flux, and the glucose-6-phosphate and triose-phosphate are the major carbon source for fatty acid synthesis. Lipid analysis revealed that fatty acid accumulation initiated 25days after flowering at the late stage of seed development of J. curcas. Furthermore, C16:0 was initially synthesized as the precursor for the elongation to C18:1 and C18:2 in the developing seeds of J. curcas. Together, the metabolic signatures on protein changes in seed development provide profound knowledge and perspective insights into understanding lipid network in J. curcas. Biological significance: Due to the abundant oil content in seeds, Jatropha curcas seeds are being considered as the ideal materials for biodiesel. Although several studies had carried out the transcriptomic project to study the genes expression profiles in seed development of J. curcas, these ESTs hadn't been confirmed by qRT-PCR. Yet, the seed development of J. curcas had been described for a pool of developing seeds instead of being characterized systematically. Moreover, cellular metabolic events are also controlled by protein-protein interactions, posttranslational protein modifications, and enzymatic activities which cannot be described by transcriptional profiling approaches alone. In this study, within the overall objective of profiling differential protein abundance in developing J. curcas seeds, we provide a setting of physiological data with dynamic proteomic and qRT-PCR analysis to characterize the metabolic pathways and the relationship between mRNA and protein patterns from early stage to seed filling during the seed development of J. curcas. The construction of J. curcas seed development proteome profiles will significantly increase our understanding of the process of seed development and provide a foundation to examine the dynamic changes of the metabolic network during seed development process and certainly suggest some clues to improve the lipid content of J. curcas seeds. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - This study deals with the development of the controlled-ignition technology for high-performance compression ignition alcohol engines. The objective of this study is to clarify the physical aspects of the main factors governing the auto-ignition phenomenon of an alcohol spray. We are now in the process of drawing a map that will indicate the influence of the auto-ignition quality evaluated by the ignition delay at each governing parameter. When the mapping is completed by a number of systematic experiments, the engine control logic can be established and high-performance alcohol engines can be realized. In order to realize such engines adaptable for any kind of biofuels including alcohols with a poor auto-ignition quality, the establishment of the ignition-control technology is most important. In the mixture formation process, two kinds of factors that govern the auto-ignition phenomenon of an alcohol spray have to be considered. One can be called the internal factor relating to the fuel properties. The other can be called the external factor corresponding to the surrounding gas conditions such as pressure, temperature, and oxygen concentration. This paper mainly focuses on the effect of the external factors on auto-ignition. In the experiments, ethanol−diethyl ether (ED) blended fuels were employed in order to investigate the effects of internal factors. Spray mixture formation and auto-ignition phenomenon of tested fuels in a large constant-volume-electrical-heating chamber was visualized by the shadowgraph method and images were recorded with a high-speed camera. The results obtained showed that the oxygen concentration and temperature of the surrounding gas strongly influence the ignition delay. © 2013 by Begell House, Inc.

AB  - This study focuses on family farmer engagement in the Brazilian national programme for Production and use of Biodiesel (PNPB). The Brazilian government has been promoting the role of family farmers as producers of biomass for biodiesel since 2004; however, fewer than expected family farmers have decided to produce biomass for biodiesel. The North of Minas Gerais is one region where a biodiesel plant has been strategically located to source castor beans grown by family farmers. The target family farm type in this region specializes in beef and/or dairy production with low input pasture (approximately 30. ha per farm), maize intercropped with beans (approximately 1. ha per farm) and sugarcane (approximately 1. ha per farm). We selected this region for a case study to explore management decisions of farmers, industry and policy makers that influence family farmer engagement with biodiesel production through cultivation of castor beans. To evaluate outcomes for family farmers engaging with the PNPB, we focused on how cultivation of castor beans impacts family farmers in terms of income levels, income stability and levels of milk production. We used an application of systems thinking known as Bayesian network modelling (BNM). BNM was chosen for its suitability to integrate different types of knowledge and to include quantitative and qualitative variables. The study was built on a body of scientific literature explaining why family farmers have not been cultivating castor beans for biodiesel production and a body of experiential knowledge of local actors (farmers, extension officers, policy makers, biodiesel manufacturers and researchers in North of Minas Gerais). The complete BNM consisted of a 'cause and effect' diagram where the strengths of the causal relationships were quantified with elicited opinions from surveyed local actors. We used the complete BNM to explore scenarios that could improve outcomes for family farmers and consequently increase their level of engagement. For example, we addressed subsidy structures of the PNPB, crop management, farm-level trade-offs and value-chain innovations. We demonstrate that decisions to support family farmer engagement with biodiesel are not singular. Engagement by family farmers requires simultaneously: improvements in technical crop management, reductions in farm-level cash constraints and innovations in the production chain such that engagement of family farmers goes beyond cultivation of one more low-value crop. Finally we discuss some methodological issues from this application of BNM to farming systems research. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Over the past decade, soy biodiesel (BD) has become a first alternative energy source that is economically viable and meets requirements of the Clean Air Act. Due to lower mass emissions and reduced hazardous compounds compared to diesel combustion emissions (CE), BD exposure is proposed to produce fewer adverse health effects. However, considering the broad use of BD and its blends in different industries, this assertion needs to be supported and validated by mechanistic and toxicological data. Here, adverse effects were compared in lungs and liver of BALB/cJ mice after inhalation exposure (0, 50, 150, or 500 μg/m3; 4 h/d, 5 d/wk, for 4 wk) to CE from 100% biodiesel (B100) and diesel (D100). Compared to D100, B100 CE produced a significant accumulation of oxidatively modified proteins (carbonyls), an increase in 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), a reduction of protein thiols, a depletion of antioxidant gluthatione (GSH), a dose-related rise in the levels of biomarkers of tissue damage (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH) in lungs, and inflammation (myeloperoxidase, MPO) in both lungs and liver. Significant differences in the levels of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, interferon (IFN) γ, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- were detected in lungs and liver upon B100 and D100 CE exposures. Overall, the tissue damage, oxidative stress, inflammation, and cytokine response were more pronounced in mice exposed to BD CE. Further studies are required to understand what combustion products in BD CE accelerate oxidative and inflammatory responses. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Four groups of catalysts have been tested for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of phenol as a model compound of bio-oil, including oxide catalysts, methanol synthesis catalysts, reduced noble metal catalysts, and reduced non-noble metal catalysts. In total, 23 different catalysts were tested at 100 bar H2 and 275 C in a batch reactor. The experiments showed that none of the tested oxides or methanol synthesis catalysts had any significant activity for phenol HDO under the given conditions, which were linked to their inability to hydrogenate the aromatic ring of phenol. HDO of phenol over reduced metal catalysts could effectively be described by a kinetic model involving a two-step reaction in which phenol initially was hydrogenated to cyclohexanol and then subsequently deoxygenated to cyclohexane. Among reduced noble metal catalysts, ruthenium, palladium, and platinum were all found to be active, with activity decreasing in that order. Nickel was the only active non-noble metal catalyst. For nickel, the effect of support was also investigated and ZrO2 was found to perform best. Pt/C, Ni/CeO2, and Ni/CeO2-ZrO 2 were the most active catalysts for the initial hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol but were not very active for the subsequent deoxygenation step. Overall, the order of activity of the best performing HDO catalysts was as follows: Ni/ZrO2 &gt; Ni-V2O5/ZrO 2 &gt; Ni-V2O5/SiO2 &gt; Ru/C &gt; Ni/Al2O3 &gt; Ni/SiO2 Pd/C &gt; Pt/C. The choice of support influenced the activity significantly. Nickel was found to be practically inactive for HDO of phenol on a carbon support but more active than the carbon-supported noble metal catalysts when supported on ZrO2. This observation indicates that the nickel-based catalysts require a metal oxide as a carrier on which the activation of the phenol for the hydrogenation can take place through heterolytic dissociation of the O-H bond to facilitate the reaction. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The effect of antioxidants on the oxidation stability of oils extracted from Jatropha curcas seeds was measured by the accelerated oxidation test specified in EN 14112 using commercial Rancimat 873 equipment. To find the appropriate antioxidant for jatropha oil, fourteen different antioxidants were screened at concentrations of 500 and 1000ppm. Pyrogallol (PY) and propyl gallate (PG) significantly improved the oxidative stability of jatropha oil and PY was further studied at concentrations of 50-1000ppm. Even at concentrations as low as 50ppm, PY was found to fulfill the specifications set by the DIN 51605 norm for plant oil as biofuels. Mixtures of antioxidants were tested at concentrations varying between 100 and 1000ppm, showing a synergistic effect for the combination of PY and N,N′-di-sec-butyl-p-phenylenediamine at all concentrations and ratios tested. It further was found that the quality, i.e. the history of the oil in terms of processing, age and storage conditions, strongly affects the performance of PY as the antioxidant. PY in particular improved the oxidative stability of oxidized and highly acidic oils. PY was found to be a good antioxidant for both jatropha oil and the derived biodiesel. Practical applications: Jatropha oil is one of many potential triglyceride feedstocks suitable for the production of biofuel or other consumer products. Finding the best antioxidant for this particular resource is important since the resistance to oxidative degradation depends on the chemical structure of the triglyceride. Pyrogallol was found to be the preferred antioxidant with beneficial results found for oxidized and, as a result, highly acidic oils. The results of this study are useful for companies involved in jatropha oil-derived products such as biodiesel, lubricants or other non-food applications. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - A genetic variability study of oil content, fatty acid composition and karanjin content of seeds was carried out in candidate plus trees of Pongamia pinnata from selected agro-ecological zones of southern peninsular India. Significant zonal variation (P < 0.01) for biochemical traits was recorded. Significant positive correlation (P < 0.05) was recorded for latitude with oleic acid. Longitude showed significant negative correlation with palmitic acid and oleic acid. Altitude positively correlated with oleic acid and linolenic acid; negatively correlated with linoleic acid and seed oil content. Phenotypic co-efficient of variation was higher than the genotypic co-efficient of variation for all the biochemical traits. The oleic acid positively correlated with seed oil content (P < 0.05) and negatively correlated with linoleic acid and linolenic acid (P < 0.01). The zone 1, zone 2, zone 3 and zone 4 showed high heritability and genetic advance for oleic acid, linoleic acid and oleic to linoleic acid ratio. Based on Ward's method, the pongamia accessions were grouped into three major clusters and four sub-groups depending on their geographical locations. Further, the results obtained in this study could be used as background information for biofuel programs in India and other tropical countries. © 2013 AOCS.

AB  - Catalyst-free biodiesel production from non-edible Ceiba pentandra (kapok) oil via supercritical methanol transesterification was demonstrated in this work. The supercritical transesterification experiments were performed in a batch reactor at temperatures of 250-350°C, pressures of 10-18MPa, reaction times of 120-600s, and methanol to oil molar ratios of 15:1-35:1. Response surface methodology (RSM) and four-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were applied for the design and optimization of the experiments with respect to temperature, pressure, reaction time, and molar ratio of methanol to oil simultaneously. The response (i.e., FAME yield) was fitted by a quadratic polynomial regression model using least square analysis in a five-level-four-factor central composite design (CCD). The optimum conditions were found as follows: methanol to oil molar ratio of 30:1, temperature of 322°C, pressure of 16.7MPa, and reaction time of 476s with FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) yield of 95.5%. The significance of the reaction parameters toward FAME yield was in the order of methanol to oil molar ratio>reaction time>pressure>temperature. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study aims to investigate the comparative corrosion of light-weight metals such as aluminum and magnesium in palm biodiesel. Immersion test at room temperature was carried out for each metal for 1440h. Sample characterization techniques employed include weight loss measurement, SEM (scanning electron microscope), XRD (X-ray diffraction), TAN (total acid number) and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy). Results showed that the corrosion rate of magnesium was much higher compared to that of aluminum. The surface morphology revealed a significant difference between the biodiesel exposed aluminum and magnesium specimens. Upon exposure to biodiesel, the magnesium surface was found to be fully covered by gel-like sticky mass while the aluminum surface remained clean. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of ambient oxygen concentration on biodiesel and diesel spray combustion under simulated compression-ignition engine conditions in a constant-volume chamber. The apparent heat release rate (AHRR) is calculated based on the measured pressure. High-speed imaging of OH* chemiluminescence and natural luminosity (NL) is employed to visualize the combustion process. Temporally and spatially resolved NL and OH* contour plots are obtained. The result indicates that AHRR depends monotonically on the ambient oxygen concentration for both fuels. A lower oxygen concentration yields a slower AHRR increase rate, a lower peak AHRR value, but a higher AHRR value during the burn-out stage when compared with higher ambient oxygen concentration conditions. OH* chemiluminescence and NL contours indicate that biodiesel may experience a longer premixed-combustion duration. The 18% ambient O2 condition works better for biodiesel than diesel in reducing soot luminosity. With 12% O2, diesel combustion is significantly degraded. However, both fuels experience low temperature combustion at 10% O2. These results may imply that biodiesel is able to achieve the desired lower soot production under a moderate oxygen level with higher combustion efficiency, while diesel needs to be burned under very low ambient oxygen concentration for low soot production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A new type of biofuel, pine oil, is introduced in this work for the purpose of fueling diesel engine. The viscosity, boiling point and flash point of the reported oil are lower, when compared to that of diesel. Also, the calorific value of pine oil biofuel is comparable to diesel. As a result, it can be directly used in diesel engine without trans-esterifying it. Pine oil biofuel and their blends of 25%, 50%, and 75% with diesel were tested in a single cylinder, four-stroke, direct injection diesel engine and the combustion, emissions and performance results were compared with diesel. The results show that at full load condition, 100% pine oil reduces CO (carbon monoxide), HC (hydrocarbon) and smoke emissions by 65%, 30% and 70%, respectively. The brake thermal efficiency and maximum heat release rate increase by 5% and 27%, respectively. However, the NOx (oxides of nitrogen) emission is higher than that of diesel fuel at full load condition. The experimental work reveals that 100% pine oil can be directly used in diesel engine and potential benefits of pine oil biofuel have been reaped. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The optimization of the composition of the algae for the simultaneous production of bioethanol and biodiesel is presented. We consider two alternative technologies for the biodiesel synthesis from algae oil, enzymatic or homogeneous alkali catalyzed that are coupled with bioethanol production from algae starch. In order to determine the optimal operating conditions, we not only couple the technologies, but simultaneously optimize the production of both biofuels and heat integrate them while optimizing the water consumption. Multi-effect distillation is included to reduce the energy and cooling water consumption for ethanol dehydration. In both cases, the optimal algae composition results in 60% oil, 30% starch, and 10% protein. The best alternative for the production of biofuels corresponds to a production price of 0.35 $/gal, using enzymes, with energy and water consumption values (4.00 MJ/gal and 0.59 gal/gal). © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - A total of 113 Jatropha curcas clonal accessions collected from different regions of India were studied to quantify the magnitude of genetic variability present in the test population and to identify important yield-attributing characters useful for developing high-yielding Jatropha cultivars. High heritability was observed for fruits per plant, seeds per plant, 100-seed weight, seed/kernel (S/K) ratio and kernel oil percentage coupled with high genetic advance suggesting that the accessions can be considered improvement. The significant positive association of seed oil content (%) with 100-seed weight suggested the effectiveness of indirect selection for seed oil content through 100-seed weight. Accessions 76, 120, 29, 86 and 84 showed above average higher values for all yield attributes (viz. fruit and seed yield, 100-seed weight, S/K ratio and oil content) suggesting these as best out of the test accessions. Accessions showing higher values for one or the other yield attributes could be selected as parents for further improvement. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Additional or alternative feedstocks are one of the major areas of interest regarding biodiesel. In this paper, the fuel properties of kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) seed oil methyl esters are comprehensively reported. This biodiesel is also relatively unique by containing small amounts of cyclic fatty acid methyl esters and of methyl epoxyoleate. Biodiesel from kenaf seed oil generally meets fuel property specifications in biodiesel standards. No influence of either the methyl esters of epoxyoleic acid or the cyclic fatty acids on fuel properties was detected at the levels present in kenaf, however, the kinematic viscosity was moderately higher than could be expected, indicating that cyclic moieties may increase viscosity. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra of kenaf seed oil methyl esters are also discussed. © 2013.

AB  - Algal biodiesel has been a subject of growing importance in the realm of renewable energy due to carbon capture properties and its potential for photosynthetic efficiency with high lipid output. This study identified five isolates of freshwater green algae, belonging to the Chlorellaceae, and measured the lipid classes and fatty acid profiles of these species to determine suitability for biodiesel production. To induce the greater accumulation of lipids, especially in the form of triacylglycerols (TAGs) desired for biodiesel, we examined the lipid accumulation in cells stressed by nitrogen limitation, sulfur deficiency, or pH stress. Increases in biomass were monitored in order to determine if adjusting pH incrementally over the course of the experiment had any effect on growth and lipid accumulation of several isolates. TAG accumulation was visually screened by Nile Red fluorescence and further assessed by gas chromatography. Lipid amounts were comparably equal or better for pH stress treatments than for standard nutrient-deprivation treatments. Incrementally adjusted pH over the course of growth triggered lipid accumulation comparable to constant pH stress treatments, yet biomass accumulation was equivalent to unstressed growth. One isolate obtained from the Athabasca oil-sands region of Alberta, OS4-2, is a good candidate for biodiesel production, having accumulated over 45 % of its dry weight as lipid, with over 80 % of the lipid as triacylglycerols, and contains an abundance of 18:1 fatty acids. This class of fatty acids improves the cold flow and oxidative stability of biodiesel and is ideal for biofuel used in a Canadian climate. © 2012 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

AB  - The lipid characteristics of microalgae are known to differ between species and change with growth conditions. This work provides a methodology for lipid characterization that enables selection of the optimal strain, cultivation conditions, and processing pathway for commercial biodiesel production from microalgae. Two different microalgal species, Nannochloropsis sp. and Chlorella sp., were cultivated under both nitrogen replete and nitrogen depleted conditions. Lipids were extracted and fractionated into three major classes and quantified gravimetrically. The fatty acid profile of each fraction was analyzed using GC-MS. The resulting quantitative lipid data for each of the cultures is discussed in the context of biodiesel and omega-3 production. This approach illustrates how the growth conditions greatly affect the distribution of fatty acid present in the major lipid classes and therefore the suitability of the lipid extracts for biodiesel and other secondary products. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The Directive 2009/28/EC established the overall target that 20% of energy consumption should be represented by renewable energy sources by 2020 in each European member state. Furthermore, the Directive sets a mandatory 10% minimum target for biofuels in the transport sector. Biofuels are potentially an important alternative to mineral diesel. We propose a pilot production line of biodiesel from sunflower on local scale in the Province of Siena (Tuscany) to research a possible reduction of fossil fuel consumption in the transport sector. This study might represent an opportunity to reduce petroleum dependence in the transport sector. Environmental Impact Indicators were provided by Material Flow Accounting, Embodied Energy Analysis and Emergy Accounting. Results showed that agricultural phase is the critical step in the production line. A comparative Life Cycle Assessment analysis for the biodiesel production line with mineral diesel production showed environmental advantages of the biofuel production, however requiring a higher land demand. Therefore, biodiesel may not the optimal solution on large scale but might be a good alternative to fossil fuel. This would depend upon the entire production cycle taking place in a limited area. This is necessary in order to fulfill the needs of local farms and small enterprises. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Refined Jatropha curcas L. oil (JCO) and methanol were used as the reactants for the transesterification reactions in a Radleys reactor in the presence of a heterogeneous ash catalyst derived from the waste aquatic plant Lemna perpusilla Torrey. Physical characterization of the catalyst showed partly crystalline behaviour and a moderate surface area 9.622m2g-1. The L. perpusilla Torrey ashes obtained from traditional combustion method were further calcined at 550±5°C before use. In addition to other non-metal and metallic constitutes the ash contains 11.3% potassium which attributed to its catalytic behaviour. The cumulative mass fraction of 89.43% of the oil was converted to biodiesel at 65±5°C in 5h at 1:9M ratio of oil to alcohol with 5% of the ash as catalyst. The biodiesel (FAME) so obtained were characterized using appropriate ASTM methods and found within the defined standard limits. The catalyst could be reused upto 3-times but there is a reduction of efficacy by about 25% for 3rd consecutive batch reaction. The activation energy was calculated for FAME and found to be 29.49kJmol-1. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Field Pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) is a member of the mustard family and may be grown as a winter crop between traditional summer crops to produce renewable biomass for renewable diesel and jet fuel. This paper estimated total annual biofuel production potential of 15 million cubic metres from rotation between corn and soybeans on 16.2 million hectares in the Midwest without impact on food production. This study also investigated the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy balance of pennycress-derived Hydroprocessed Renewable Jet (HRJ) fuel and Renewable Diesel (RD). Both system expansion and allocation approaches were applied to distribute environmental impacts among products and co-products along the life cycle of each biofuel. The life cycle GHG emissions (excluding land use change) for RD and HRJ range from 13 to 41gMJ-1 (CO2 eq.) and -18 to 45gMJ-1 (CO2 eq.), respectively, depending on how the co-products are credited. The majority of the energy required for each biofuel product is derived from renewable biomass as opposed to non renewable fossil. The fossil energy consumptions are considerably lower than the petroleum fuels. Scenario analyses were also conducted to determine response to model assumptions, including nitrogen fertilizer application rate, nitrogen content in crop residues, and sources of H2. The results show that pennycress derived biofuels could qualify as advanced biofuels and as biomass-based diesel as defined by the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS2). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The land potential for producing biomass for bioenergy purposes has been highly debated in recent years. The present paper analyses the possibilities and consequences for land use and agricultural production of biofuel production in Denmark based on domestic wheat and rape under specific scenario conditions for the period 2010-2030. The potential is assessed for a situation where policy targets for renewable energy carriers in the transport sector is reached using biofuels, and where second generation ethanol increasingly substitutes first generation ethanol.Three scenarios are developed and evaluated: a baseline, an alternative scenario allowing continuous growth in the now dominant livestock branch and a biofuel scenario assuming that efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in biofuel displaces part of the domestic production of fodder.Results show that the biofuel demand could be met in 2020; but only if current rape oil production is used to satisfy local bio-diesel demand. It would also imply that the Danish bio-diesel export currently supplying a minor part of the German fuel market would seize. In 2030, however, only about 60 percent of the biofuel demand would be covered by self-sufficiency. If biofuels were to displace animal production to make up for this, a reduction of the pig production between 10 and 20 percent would result. Efficiency increases across production branches would allow the animal production to continue un-affected if about half of the rape oil produced for other purposes is utilized. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although biodiesel has begun to penetrate the fuel market, its effect on injection processes, combustion and emission formation under diesel engine conditions remains somewhat unclear. Typical exhaust measurements from engines running biodiesel indicate that particulate matter, carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbons are decreased, whereas nitrogen oxide emissions tend to be increased. However, these observations are the result of complex interactions between physical and chemical processes occurring in the combustion chamber, for which understanding is still needed. To characterize and decouple the physical and chemical influences of biodiesel on spray mixing, ignition, combustion and soot formation, a soy methyl-ester (SME) biodiesel is injected into a constant-volume combustion facility under diesel-like operating conditions. A range of optical diagnostics is performed, comparing biodiesel to a conventional #2 diesel at the same injection and ambient conditions. Schlieren high-speed imaging shows virtually the same vapour-phase penetration for the two fuels, while simultaneous Mie-scatter imaging shows that the maximum liquid-phase penetration of biodiesel is higher than diesel. Differences in the liquid-phase penetration are expected because of the different boiling-point temperatures of the two fuels. However, the different liquid-phase penetration does not affect overall mixing rate and downstream vapour-phase penetration because each fuel spray has similar momentum and spreading angle. For the biodiesel and diesel samples used in this study, the ignition delay and lift-off length are only slightly less for biodiesel compared to diesel, consistent with the fuel cetane number (51 for biodiesel, 46 for diesel). Because of the similarity in lift-off length, the differences in equivalence ratio distribution at the lift-off length are mainly affected by the oxygen content of the fuels. For biodiesel, the equivalence ratio is reduced, which, along with the fuel molecular structure and oxygen content, significantly affects soot formation downstream. Spatially resolved soot volume fraction measurements obtained by combining line-of-sight laser extinction measurements with planar laser-induced incandescence imaging show that the soot concentration can be reduced by an order of magnitude for biodiesel. These integrated measurements of spray mixing, combustion and quantitative soot concentration provide new validation data for the development of computational fluid dynamics spray, combustion and soot formation models suitable for the latest biofuels. © 2012 IMechE.

AB  - Water contaminated by oil and gas production poses challenges to the management of America's water resources. Here we report the design, fabrication, and laboratory evaluation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes decorated with superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) for oil-water separation. As revealed by confocal laser-scanning fluorescence microscopy, the magnetic carbon nanotubes (MCNTs) remove oil droplets through a two-step mechanism, in which MCNTs are first dispersed at the oil-water interface and then drag the droplets with them out of water by a magnet. Measurements of removal efficiency with different initial oil concentration, MCNT dose, and mixing time show that kinetics and equilibrium of the separation process can be described by the Langmuir model. Separation capacity qt is a function of MCNT dose m, mixing time t, and residual oil concentration Ce at equilibrium:1qt=1qmax2kwm(1KCe+1)21t+1qmax(1KCe+1) where qmax, kw, and K are maximum separation capacity, wrapping rate constant, and equilibrium constant, respectively. Least-square regressions using experimental data estimate qmax=6.6(±0.6) g-diesel g-MCNT-1, kw=3.36(±0.03)Lg-diesel-1min-1, and K=2.4(±0.2)Lg-diesel-1. For used MCNTs, we further show that over 80% of the separation capacity can be restored by a 10min wash with 1mL ethanol for every 6mg MCNTs. The separation by reusable MCNTs provides a promising alternative strategy for water treatment design complementary to existing ones such as coagulation, adsorption, filtration, and membrane processes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work is to explore the potential of producing biodiesel and valuable co-products from the biomass of Schizochytrium mangrovei PQ6 which was isolated from Phu Quoc Island, Kien Giang province, Vietnam. This microalga contains high lipid content (up to 70% of dry cell weight) and high level of total fatty acids, which is ideal for making biodiesel. The production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from this marine microalga resulted in a yield of 88% based on algal oil and 44% based on algal biomass. The process of separating the obtained FAME into a first fraction enriched with saturated FAME (SFAME) and a second fraction enriched with unsaturated FAME (UFAME) was then investigated to exploit the valuable co-products. The obtained results shown that the mass fraction of SFAME and UFAME were 70% and 30%, respectively. The UFAME fraction contains a high content of DHA (accounting for 69.000% of TFAs). The test results of the SFAME fraction indicated that specific gravity at 15°C, flash point, water and sediment, kinematic viscosity at 40°C, sulfated ash, sulfur, copper strip corrosion at 50°C, cetane number, carbon residue, iodine number, workmanship meet Vietnam Biodiesel B100 Standard. Moreover, the utilization of waste glycerol from biodiesel process as carbon source for the cultivation of the microalgae S. mangrovei PQ6 and Spirulina platensis was also investigated. © 2013 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

AB  - Jatropha curcas seeds are a promising feedstock for biodiesel production. However, Jatropha seed oil and other plant parts are toxic due to the presence of phorbol esters (PEs). The ever-increasing cultivation of toxic genotype of J. curcas runs the risk of increased human exposure to Jatropha products. In the present study, effects of J. curcas oil (from both toxic and nontoxic genotypes), purified PEs-rich extract and purified PEs (factors C1, C2, C3mixture, (C4+C5)) on reconstituted human epithelium (RHE) and human corneal epithelium (HCE) were evaluated in vitro. The PEs were purified from toxic Jatropha oil. In both RHE and HCE, the topical application of PEs containing samples produced severe cellular alterations such as marked oedema, presence of less viable cell layers, necrosis and/or partial tissue disintegration in epithelium and increased inflammatory response (interleukin-1α and prostaglandin E2). When compared to toxic oil, histological alterations and inflammatory response were less evident (P&lt;0.05) in nontoxic oil indicating the severity of toxicity was due to PEs. Conclusively, topical applications of Jatropha PEs are toxic towards RHE and HCE models, which represents dermal and occular toxicity respectively. Data obtained from this study would aid in the development of safety procedures for Jatropha biodiesel industries. It is advised to use protective gloves and glasses when handling PEs containing Jatropha products. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We developed and characterized 1207 SSRs to enrich the validated markers repertoire of Jatropha curcas. A total of 248 polymorphic SSRs were identified with a panel of 7 accessions of J. curcas including some exotic accessions. Furthermore, 179 and 331 SSRs were found polymorphic among parental lines of NBRI-J05. ×. EC643912 and Chhatrapati. ×. Jatropha integerrima used in developing two mapping population respectively. The number of alleles varied from 2 to 5 with an average of 2.24. ±. 0.55 and 2.42. ±. 0.62 alleles/SSR for CA and GA enriched library respectively. Most of the SSRs had lower PIC value (less than 0.30) and the maximum PIC value was observed for JGM_A281, JGM_A326 (0.63) followed by JGM_B300 (0.62), JGM_B361 (0.58), JGM_A244 (0.55), JGM_B595 (0.55) and JGM_B176 (0.55). The genetic similarity coefficient among the accessions of J. curcas and one accession of J. integerrima ranged from 0.11 to 0.92 with an average of 0.57. ±. 0.31. The phenogram classified all the 7 accessions of J. curcas in one cluster and the J. integerrima remained as an out group. The BLASTX analysis of SSR containing sequences showed maximum similarity of 50% with Ricinus communis (Euphorbiaceae) followed by Populus trichocarpa (22%), Vitis vinifera (16%) and Arabidopsis spp. (4.5%). This study may enrich the validated repertoire of SSR markers in J. curcas and could be used in various genetic studies including construction of linkage map, diversity analysis, and QTL/association mapping. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Jatropha curcas seeds are a promising source of oil for biodiesel production. The presence of toxic phorbol esters in oil, biodiesel byproducts/co-products (e.g., seedcake and seed meal) and different plant parts however, raises both occupational and eco-toxicological concerns. Due to toxicity issues, there is a need to develop a rapid, sensitive, and accurate method for determining phorbol ester content. An HPLC/UV-based rapid determination of phorbol esters using a C18 column (20, 50, and 75mm columns) was devised and validated. Vortex extraction was found to be the best method for extracting phorbol esters. The separation of Jatropha phorbol esters was best achieved with increased column lengths and run times (e.g., run times of 6, 8, and 12.5min for 20, 50, and 75mm columns, respectively). The limit of detection and limit of quantification for Jatropha phorbol esters (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate equivalent) ranged from 26 to 68ng and 107-200ng using three columns, respectively. The finalized method was rapid (≤12.5min run time) and able to detect low concentrations (up to 26ng) of phorbol esters when compared to conventional methods (&gt;35min run time and 400-800ng detection limit). The analyzed phorbol ester concentrations for different Jatropha samples (kernel, kernel meal, seedcake, seed meal, and oil) were within the acceptable range of reported values. The developed method was shown to be a rapid, sensitive, accurate, and cost-effective approach, which would find diverse applications ranging from value-added co-product development risk assessment to agricultural research. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sooting tendencies have been measured for 29 compounds with 5 carbon atoms and different oxygen contents, along with 12 additional oxygenated pure compounds and 10 blends of commercial fuels. The test compounds include alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, acids, esters, keto-esters and hydroxy-esters. The Threshold Sooting Index (TSI), as defined and used in the literature, was primarily used to quantify the sooting tendency of the compounds. It is shown that this index does not account for the presence of oxygen atoms in the fuel molecules, and the impact of fuel oxygen on the stoichiometric air requirement. The application of TSI to oxygenated fuels leads to sooting tendencies inconsistent with those reported in the literature. A new sooting index is proposed for oxygenated and non-oxygenated compounds, which considers the relation between the height of the flame tip and the volumetric stoichiometric air requirement of the flame. This new index is denoted as the Oxygen Extended Sooting Index (OESI). The results obtained by this new index corroborate that not only the oxygen content but also the molecular structure has an influence on the sooting tendency of fuels. Different functional groups, not only those including oxygen atoms, impart different sooting tendencies. A structural group contribution approach based on group additivity is proposed to interpret experimental observations on the effect of oxygen functional groups on the sooting tendency of fuels using the example of C-5 oxygenated fuels. Groups with a higher fraction of carbon-carbon bonds showed a higher contribution to the sooting tendency than those with a higher concentration of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Among the C-5 mono-oxygenated compounds, the sooting tendency increased in this order: aldehydes < alcohols < ketones < ethers < n-alkanes and for the C-5 di-oxygenated compounds, the sooting tendency order was: acids < esters < di-ethers. In general, both unsaturated and branched compounds showed slight increases in sooting tendency with respect to their saturated and linear counterparts. Finally, the new sooting index was applied to commercial biofuel blends (denatured ethanol-gasoline and soybean-derived biodiesel-diesel) and empirical correlations were obtained. © 2013 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - In this study, we carried out sodium hydroxide and sonication pretreatments of rapeseed straw (Brassica napus) to obtain monosugar suitable for production of biofuels. To optimize the pretreatment conditions, we applied a statistical response-surface methodology. The optimal pretreatment conditions using sodium hydroxide under sonication irradiation were determined to be 75.0 °C, 7.0 % sodium hydroxide, and 6.8 h. For these conditions, we predicted 97.3 % enzymatic digestibility. In repeated experiments to validate the predicted value, 98.9 ± 0.3 % enzymatic digestibility was obtained, which was well within the range of the predicted model. Moreover, sonication irradiation was found to have a good effect on pretreatment in the lower temperature range and at all concentrations of sodium hydroxide. According to scanning electron microscopy images, the surface area and pore size of the pretreated rapeseed straw were modified by the sodium hydroxide pretreatment under sonication irradiation. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Biodiesel fuels were prepared from different vegetable oil sources (canola, soybean, sunflower, and corn) and studied through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The dielectric constant from these biofuels evidenced no important dependence on feedstock, suggesting basically no change in fuels' polarity from varying the raw materials. In a different way, huge variations of the electrical resistivity and relaxation frequency were found when comparing among the studied biodiesels. Our findings demonstrate that these variations are closely associated with changes in the biodiesel viscosity, which is known to modulate charge mobility and was feedstock dependent. Accordingly, the impedance spectroscopy is here revealed to be a sensitive, alternative and reliable analytical approach for distinguishing among different feedstock-related biodiesels and monitoring certain biofuels' properties, like viscosity and interrelated parameters, usually connected with fatty acid structural profiles in biodiesel fuels.

AB  - Isocyanate functional benzoxazine (NCO-4HBA-a) is used for coupling with hydroxyl-group-containing molecules. Glycerol is used in a model reaction to study the urethane bonds formed between the NCO-4HBA-a and the glycerol's hydroxyl groups. The model supports a reaction between NCO-4HBA-a and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), which leads to an improved char yield, determined by thermogravimetric analysis. Glycerol-based benzoxazine is also an attractive benzoxazine synthesized from the products of biofuel production. Upon functionalization with benzoxazine and subsequent thermal treatment, the hydroxyl-containing polymer gains thermal stability shown by improved char yield of polybenzoxazine cross-linked PVA.

AB  - Background:Particulate air pollution is associated with cardiovascular disease. Acute phase response is causally linked to cardiovascular disease. Here, we propose that particle-induced pulmonary acute phase response provides an underlying mechanism for particle-induced cardiovascular risk.Methods:We analysed the mRNA expression of Serum Amyloid A (Saa3) in lung tissue from female C57BL/6J mice exposed to different particles including nanomaterials (carbon black and titanium dioxide nanoparticles, multi- and single walled carbon nanotubes), diesel exhaust particles and airborne dust collected at a biofuel plant. Mice were exposed to single or multiple doses of particles by inhalation or intratracheal instillation and pulmonary mRNA expression of Saa3 was determined at different time points of up to 4 weeks after exposure. Also hepatic mRNA expression of Saa3, SAA3 protein levels in broncheoalveolar lavage fluid and in plasma and high density lipoprotein levels in plasma were determined in mice exposed to multiwalled carbon nanotubes.Results:Pulmonary exposure to particles strongly increased Saa3 mRNA levels in lung tissue and elevated SAA3 protein levels in broncheoalveolar lavage fluid and plasma, whereas hepatic Saa3 levels were much less affected. Pulmonary Saa3 expression correlated with the number of neutrophils in BAL across different dosing regimens, doses and time points.Conclusions:Pulmonary acute phase response may constitute a direct link between particle inhalation and risk of cardiovascular disease. We propose that the particle-induced pulmonary acute phase response may predict risk for cardiovascular disease. © 2013 Saber et al.

AB  - Although biofuels are seen as a viable option for partially replacing fossil fuels in the transportation sector, their widespread application raises questions about their potential economic, societal and environmental impacts. This article illustrates the application of a sustainability evaluation methodology to biofuels throughout their supply chain based on sustainability indicators. Five indicators (LCEE, FER, GW, LUI, and CSCE) were selected for the analysis, taking into account the information available in the open literature, and the availability of data to calculate them. Biodiesel and bioethanol from common feedstocks are compared with each other and with fossil diesel and gasoline, their main competitors, with the goal of identifying which ones are better from a sustainability point of view. Results show that ethanol from sugarcane is the most sustainable option, even when compared with dominant fossil fuels; while no feedstock for biodiesel production emerges as a better option. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents results from a gate-to-gate analysis of the energy balance, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and economic efficiency of biochar production from palm oil empty fruit bunches (EFB). The analysis is based on data obtained from EFB combustion in a slow pyrolysis plant in Selangor, Malaysia. The outputs of the slow pyrolysis plant are biochar, syngas, bio-oil and water vapor. The net energy yield of the biochar produced in the Selangor plant is 11.47 MJ kg-1 EFB. The energy content of the biochar produced is higher than the energy required for producing the biochar, i.e. the energy balance of biochar production is positive. The combustion of EFB using diesel fuel has the largest energy demand of 2.31 MJ kg-1 EFB in the pyrolysis process. Comparatively smaller amounts of energy are required as electricity (0.39 MJ kg-1 EFB) and for transportation of biochar to the warehouse and the field (0.13 MJ kg-1 EFB). The net greenhouse gas emissions of the studied biochar production account for 0.046 kg CO 2-equiv. kg-1 EFB yr-1 without considering fertilizer substitution effects and carbon accumulation from biochar in the soil. The studied biochar production is profitable where biochar can be sold for at least 533 US-$ t-1. Potential measures for improvement are discussed, including higher productivity of biochar production, reduced energy consumption and efficient use of the byproducts from the slow pyrolysis. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Improved synthetic approaches for preparing small-sized Ni nanoparticles (d=3 nm) supported on HBEA zeolite have been explored and compared with the traditional impregnation method. The formation of surface nickel silicate/aluminate involved in the two precipitation processes are inferred to lead to the stronger interaction between the metal and the support. The lower Brønsted acid concentrations of these two Ni/HBEA catalysts compared with the parent zeolite caused by the partial exchange of Brønsted acid sites by Ni2+ cations do not influence the hydrodeoxygenation rates, but alter the product selectivity. Higher initial rates and higher stability have been achieved with these optimized catalysts for the hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid and microalgae oil. Small metal particles facilitate high initial catalytic activity in the fresh sample and size uniformity ensures high catalyst stability. The small matter of size: Nearly 5-8-fold enhancements of initial rates and improved recyclability have been achieved with Ni/HBEA catalysts, prepared by improved synthesis techniques, on the hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid and microalgae oil. The average size and uniformity of Ni particles are crucial for maintaining the highly active and stable catalyst. The small metal sites facilitate high initial rates and the good uniformity ensures high catalyst stability (see figure). Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - We present a life cycle assessment of synthetic paraffinic kerosene produced from Jatropha curcas. The feedstock is grown in an intercropping arrangement with pasture grasses so that Jatropha is coproduced with cattle. Additional innovations are introduced including hybrid seeds, detoxification of jatropha seedcake, and cogeneration. Two fuel pathways are examined including a newly developed catalytic decarboxylation process. Sensitivities are examined including higher planting density at the expense of cattle production as well as 50% lower yields. Intercropping with pasture and detoxifying seedcake yield coproducts that are expected to relieve pressure on Brazil's forests and indirectly reduce environmental impacts of biofuel production. Other innovations also reduce impacts. Results of the baseline assessment indicate that innovations would reduce impacts relative to the fossil fuel reference scenario in most categories including 62-75% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, 64-82% reduction in release of ozone depleting chemicals, 33-52% reduction in smog-forming pollutants, 6-25% reduction in acidification, and 60-72% reduction in use of nonrenewable energy. System expansion, which explicitly accounts for avoided deforestation, results in larger improvements. Results are robust across allocation methodologies, improve with higher planting density, and persist if yield is reduced by half. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Generally, the magnitude of pollutant emissions from diesel engines running on biodiesel fuel is ultimately coupled to the structure of the fuel's constituent molecules. Previous studies demonstrated the relationship between the organic fraction of particulate matter (PM) and its oxidative potential. Herein, emissions from a diesel engine running on different biofuels were analyzed in more detail to explore the role that different organic fractions play in the measured oxidative potential. In this work, a more detailed chemical analysis of biofuel PM was undertaken using a compact time of flight aerosol mass spectrometer (c-ToF AMS). This enabled a better identification of the different organic fractions that contribute to the overall measured oxidative potentials. The concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured using a profluorescent nitroxide molecular probe 9-(1,1,3,3- tetramethylisoindolin-2-yloxyl-5-ethynyl)-10-(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BPEAnit). Therefore, the oxidative potential of the PM, measured through the ROS content, although proportional to the total organic content in certain cases, shows a much higher correlation with the oxygenated organic fraction as measured by the c-ToF AMS. This highlights the importance of knowing the surface chemistry of particles for assessing their health impacts. It also sheds light onto new aspects of particulate emissions that should be taken into account when establishing relevant metrics for assessing health implications of replacing diesel with alternative fuels. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A freshwater cyanobacterium, Phormidium autumnale KNUA026, was isolated from puddles of icy water in Gyeongsan City, South Korea and its potential as a biofuel feedstock was investigated. Maximal growth was obtained when the culture was incubated at 25°C and around pH 9.0. The total lipid content of the isolate was approximately 14.0% of dry weight and it was found that strain KNUA026 was able to autotrophically synthesize heptadecane (C17 H36) which can be directly used as fuel without requiring a transesterification step. As this benthic cyanobacterium was capable of forming thick mats, it could be easily harvested by gravitational settling and this property may reduce the cost of production in commercial applications. Hence, P. autumnale KNUA026 appears to be a promising resource for use in the production of microalgae-based biofuels. © The Korean Society of Phycology.

AB  - Microbial biosynthesis of fatty acid-derived biofuels from renewable carbon sources has attracted significant attention in recent years. Free fatty acids (FFAs) can be used as precursors for the production of micro-diesel. The expression of codon optimized two plants (Umbellularia californica and Cinnamomum camphora) medium-chain acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterase genes (ucFatB and ccFatB) in Escherichia coli resulted in a very high level of extractable medium-chain-specific hydrolytic activity and caused large accumulation of medium-chain free fatty acids. By heterologous co-expression of acyl-coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase from Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, specific plant thioesterases in E. coli, with supplementation of exogenous ethanol, resulted in drastic changes in fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) composition ranging from 12:0 to 18:1. Through an optimized microbial shake-flask fermentation of two modified E. coli strains, yielded FFAs and FAEEs in the concentration of approximately 500mgL-1/250mgL-1 and 2.01mgg-1/1.99mgg-1, respectively. The optimal ethanol level for FAEEs yield in the two recombinant strains was reached at the 3% ethanol concentration, which was about 5.4-fold and 1.93-fold higher than that of 1% ethanol concentration. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Faced with the twin challenges of anthropogenic climate change and 'peak oil', the need for an urgent and radical transformation of transport energy has been widely recognised. Adopting a neo-Polanyian economic sociology approach, this article asks what conditions European governance capacity to respond to these challenges, at either national or regional levels, using biofuels as a case study. It asks if the complexity of its political institutions, and the heterogeneity of interests and economic organisations, present 'the biggest obstacle of all' (Cohen 2007) to reduce fossil fuel dependency. By examining the European Commission level and comparing five countries, evidence is produced for a political failure in terms of continued fossil fuel dependency. Incumbent interests in the agricultural sector and a distinctively European legacy of a transport fleet dependent on fossil diesel, have led to a marriage of convenience between rapeseed farmers and vehicle manufacturers. As a consequence, rather than escaping from the path dependency on fossil fuels (Unruh 2000), Europe has gone down a cul-de-sac of rapeseed biodiesel inherently limited in scope, and with the low levels of greenhouse gas emissions savings. Ironically this outcome is in part an unintended consequence of opposition to biofuels from environmentalist groups and politics. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Emissions and fuel economy are evaluated for two types of biofuels, namely 2-phenyl ethanol and cyclohexaneethanol. Both are derived from lignin, a form of lignocellulosic biomass. The former and latter oxygenates have an aromatic and aliphatic (i.e. saturated) ring structure, respectively. Two parametric engine sweeps were performed. First, non-EGR operation by means of varying the load via injection duration/quantity. Second, EGR operation by gradually increasing the level of EGR. The goal of this work is to evaluate the overall performance of these lignin-derived biofuels in a compression ignition (CI) engine over a wide range of operation conditions. More specifically, the research is focused on the effect of oxygenate aromaticity. The rationale behind this is that, starting from lignin, itself an aromatic molecule, it would require an expensive hydrogenation step to ultimately produce saturated ringed oxygenates like cyclohexaneethanol from the more lignin-like 2-phenyl ethanol. If there are no adverse effects of using the latter over the former, it makes no sense to consider further hydrogenation upgrading. The engine experiments have been conducted on a modified DAF heavy-duty diesel engine. The results demonstrate that further processing of aromatic oxygenates by means of hydro-treating to saturated rings is not only expensive, but also disadvantageous for the NOx-soot trade-off. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - At present, one of the most promising methods of processing renewable raw materials is pyrolysis, which allows liquid organic products (bio-oil) to be derived from biomass. For obtaining fuel products from bio-oil, the latter needs to be preliminarily upgraded. It is appropriate to carry out this process in two stages. The first stage-decarboxylation-is intended to reduce the corrosiveness (acidity) of the feedstock and hydrogen consumption at the second stage. Decarboxylation is usually conducted over noble metal-based catalysts. There are examples of employing cheaper catalysts based on alkaline-earth metals; however, these catalysts suffer from insufficient stability. Here, we report the activity of MgO-based catalysts in the decar- boxylation of pentanoic acid, a model compound imitating bio-oil, and the effect of dopants on the stability of the magnesium-containing catalysts. The process has been carried out in an inert atmosphere at a temper- ature of 350°C and a pressure of 0.50 MPa. Raising the MgO calcination temperature to 1200°C and intro- ducing stabilizing admixtures (Al2O3, SiO2, and ZrO2) affords catalysts that are mainly deactivated via car- bonate formation rather than the formation of soluble magnesium salts and are, therefore, more promising from the standpoint of regenerability. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2013.

AB  - This paper examines three substrates for anaerobic co-digestion: abattoir waste; cheese waste and food waste. These substrates were assessed in detail for suitability for biomethane production. Biomethane potential (BMP) assays were carried out in mono and co-digestion for the three substrates and two mixes: T1 (40% abattoir waste; 50% cheese waste and 10% food waste on a wet weight basis) and T2 (30% abattoir waste; 40% cheese waste and 30% food waste). The C:N ratio of both mixes was below optimum. Low levels suggest that the production of free ammonia (NH3) in semi-continuous digestion was of primary concern. Both mixes were digested in a semi-continuous process for 25 weeks. The recommended operating condition for T1 was a loading rate of 3 kg VS mn -3 day-1 at a retention time of 23 days. The biomethane yield was 305 L CH4 kg-1 volatile solids (VS) which was 87% of the BMP value and equivalent to 61% biodegradability. For T2 (with the higher C:N ratio) a higher loading rate of 4 kg VS mn-3 day -1 at a lower retention time of 15 days was recommended. The biomethane yield was 439 L CH4 kg-1 VS (99% of the BMP value and 84% biodegradibility). At these conditions, levels of total ammonical nitrogen (TAN) were 4109 and 4831 mg L-1 for T1 and T2, respectively. These values are on the large side according to the literature. The temperature was reduced to 35°C to minimize toxicity associated with TAN. Ratios of volatile acids to bicarbonate were typically in the range of 0.2-0.3 suggesting stable operation. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - Biodiesel from microalgae has the potential as a sustainable fuel, since some species show exceptionally high lipid accumulation potential under various stresses. Effects of different concentrations of Ca, Mg and NaCl in the growth medium on biomass yield and lipid accumulation of Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus grown under batch culture mode were investigated. Starvation of Mg showed a marginal rise in lipid content for a short period of time. Ca-starved cultures, however, demonstrated a profound rise in lipid content, i.e. 40% of dry cell wt. (dcw) was recorded against 11.9% control for C. vulgaris and 37% (dcw) against 11.3% for S. obliquus. Under increased concentration of Mg, significant rise in biomass and lipid yield was recorded. Effect of NaCl-induced osmotic stress showed lipid accumulation of ∼ 40% (dcw) in both the test algae, whereas the biomass yield was severely affected. The fatty acid profiles under the above stresses were analysed and discussed. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - Biodiesel, using microalgae as feedstocks, is being explored as the most potent form of alternative diesel fuel for sustainable economic development. A comparative assessment of various protocols for microalgal lipid extraction was carried out using five green algae, six blue-green algae and two diatom species treated with different single and binary solvents both at room temperature and using a soxhlet. Lipid recovery was maximum with chloroform-methanol in the soxhlet extractor. Pre-treatments of biomass, such as sonication, homogenization, bead-beating, lyophilization, autoclaving, microwave treatment and osmotic shock did not register any significant rise in lipid recovery. As lipid recovery using chloroform-methanol at room temperature demonstrated a marginally lower value than that obtained under the soxhlet extractor, on economical point of view, the former is recommended for microalgal total lipid extraction. Transesterification process enhances the quality of biodiesel. Experiments were designed to determine the effects of catalyst type and quantity, methanol to oil ratio, reaction temperature and time on the transesterification process using response surface methodology. Fatty acid methyl ester yield reached up to 91% with methanol:HCl:oil molar ratio of 82:4:1 at 65°C for 6.4 h reaction time. The biodiesel yield relative to the weight of the oil was found to be 69%. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - Biodiesel, produced from plant and animal oils, is an important alternative to fossil fuels because, apart from dwindling supply, the latter are a major source of air pollution. In this investigation, effects of castor oil biodiesel blends have been examined on diesel engine performance and emissions. After producing castor methyl ester by the transesterification method and measuring its characteristics, the experiments were performed on a four cylinder, turbocharged, direct injection, diesel engine. Engine performance (power, torque, brake specific fuel consumption and thermal efficiency) and exhaust emissions were analysed at various engine speeds. All the tests were done under 75% full load. Furthermore, the volumetric blending ratios of biodiesel with conventional diesel fuel were set at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30%. The results indicate that lower blends of biodiesel provide acceptable engine performance and even improve it. Meanwhile, exhaust emissions are much decreased. Finally, a 15% blend of castor oil-biodiesel was picked as the optimized blend of biodiesel-diesel. It was found that lower blends of castor biodiesel are an acceptable fuel alternative for the engine. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - Microalgae hold promise for the production of sustainable replacement of fossil fuels due to their high growth rates, ability to grow on non-arable land and their high content, under the proper conditions, of high energy compounds that can be relatively easily chemically converted to fuels using existing technology. However, projected large-scale algal production raises a number of sustainability concerns concerning land use, net energy return, water use and nutrient supply. The state-of-the-art of algal production of biofuels is presented with emphasis on some possible avenues to provide answers to the sustainability questions that have been raised. Here, issues concerning algal strains and supply of nutrients for large-scale production are discussed. Since sustainability concerns necessitate the use of wastewaters for supply of bulk nutrients, emphasis is placed on the composition and suitability of different wastewater streams. At the same time, algal cultivation has proven useful in waste treatment processes, and thus this aspect is also treated in some detail. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - To avoid bacterial contamination due to medium replacement in the expanded application of a photosynthesis-fermentation model, an integrated photosynthesis-fermentation hybrid system was set up and evaluated for algal lipid production using Chlorella protothecoides. In this system, the CO 2-rich off-gas from the fermentation process was recycled to agitate medium in the photobioreactor, which could provide initial cells for the heterotrophic fermentation. The cell concentration reached 1.03±0.07 g/L during photoautotrophic growth and then the concentrated green cells were switched to heterotrophic fermentation after removing over 99.5% of nitrogen in the medium by a nitrogen removal device. At the end of fermentation in the system, the cell concentration could reach as high as 100.51±2.03 g/L, and 60.05±1.38% lipid content was achieved simultaneously. The lipid yield (60.36±2.63 g/L) in the hybrid system was over 700 times higher than that in a photobioreactor and exceeded that by fermentation alone (47.56±7.31 g/L). The developed photosynthesis-fermentation hybrid system in this study was not only a feasible option to enhance microalgal lipid production, but also an environment-friendly approach to produce biofuel feedstock through concurrent utilization of ammonia nitrogen, CO2, and organic carbons. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - There is a pressing need for sustainable renewable fuels that do not negatively impact food and water resources. Algae have great potential for the production of renewable biofuels but require significant water and fertilizer resources for large-scale production. Municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill leachate (LL) was evaluated as a cultivation medium to reduce both water and elemental fertilizer demands of algae cultivation. Daily growth rate and cell yield of two isolated species of algae (Scenedesmus cf. rubescens and Chlorella cf. ellipsoidea) were cultivated in MSW LL and compared with Bold's Basal Medium (BBM). Results suggest that LL can be used as a nutrient resource and medium for the cultivation of algae biomass. S. cf. rubescens grew well in 100% LL, when pH was regulated, with a mean growth rate and cell yield 91.2% and 92.8% of those observed in BBM, respectively. S. cf. rubescens was more adaptable than C. cf. ellipsoidea to the LL tested. The LL used in this study supported a maximum volumetric productivity of 0.55 g/L/day of S. cf. rubescens biomass. The leachate had sufficient nitrogen to supply 17.8 g/L of algae biomass, but was limited by total phosphorus. Cultivation of algae on LL offsets both water and fertilizer consumption, reducing the environmental footprint and increasing the potential sustainability of algae-based biofuels. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - The daunting energy challenges in the 21st century are a result of over-reliance on limited fossil fuels coupled with ever-increasing energy demand. Among the solutions is the development of technologies and infrastructures to help in the smooth transition to alternative and renewable energy sources. Nanotechnology, a combination of chemistry and engineering, is viewed as the new candidate for clean energy applications. It involves the manipulation of nanoscale structures to integrate them into larger material components and systems. In comparison to bulk materials, nanomaterials have high surface areas and are expected to exhibit higher activities. They also demonstrate better stability and durability and are more cost-effective with high recycling potential. This paper reviews selected recent advances in the development of nanotechnology in the emerging solar energy and biofuel fields. Special emphases are given to studies on photovoltaics (including Schottky junction solar cells, organic solar cells, quantum dot-sensitized solar cells, and earth-abundant Cu2ZnSnS4 materials) and artificial photosynthesis. As for the biofuel section, a review on the use of nanotechnology in transesterification, gasification, pyrolysis, and hydrogenation, as well as in the reforming of biomass-derived compounds is given. As these technologies become more mature, efficient, and economical, they could eventually replace traditional fossil fuels. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Algae biofuel have emerged as viable renewable energy sources and are the potential alternatives to fossil-based fuels in recent times. Algae have the potential to generate significant quantities of commercially viable biofuel apart from treating wastewater. Three algal species, viz. Chlorococcum sp., Microcystis sp. and Phormidium sp. proliferating in wastewater ponds were isolated and cultured in the laboratory myxotrophically under similar wastewater conditions. Chlorococcum sp. attained a mean biomass productivity of 0.09 g l-1 d-1 with the maximum biomass density of 1.33 g l-1 and comparatively higher lipid content of 30.55% (w/w) on the ninth day of the culture experiment. Under similar conditions Microcystis sp. and Phormidium sp. attained mean biomass productivities of 0.058 and 0.063 g l-1 d-1 with a total lipid content of 8.88% and 18.66% respectively. Biochemical composition (carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and phosphates) variations and lipid accumulation studies were performed by comparison of the ratios of carbohydrate to protein; lipid to protein (L/P) and lipid to phosphates using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy which showed higher L/P ratio during the stationary phase of algal growth. Composition analysis of fatty acid methyl ester has been performed using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Chlorococcum sp. with higher productivity and faster growth rate has higher lipid content with about 67% of saturated fatty acid dominated by palmitate (36.3%) followed by an unsaturate as linoleate (14%) and has proved to be an economical and viable feedstock for biofuel production compared to the other wastewater-grown species.

AB  - Technoeconomic analysis of renewable aviation fuels has not been widely considered, despite the increasing global attention that the field has received. We present three process models for production of aviation-fuel from microalgae, Pongamia pinnata seeds and sugarcane molasses. The models and assumptions have been deposited on a wiki (http://qsafi.aibn.uq.edu.au) and are open and accessible to the community. Based on currently available long-term reputable technological data, this analysis indicates that the biorefineries processing the microalgae, Pongamia seeds, and sugarcane feedstocks would be competitive with crude oil at $1343, $374, and $301/bbl, respectively. Sensitivity analyses of the major economic drivers suggest technological and market developments that would bring the corresponding figures down to $385, $255, and $168/bbl. The dynamic nature of the freely accessible models will allow the community to track progress toward economic competitiveness of aviation fuels from these renewable feedstocks. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Unlike most biofuel species, Jatropha curcas has promise for use in marginal lands, but it may serve an additional role by stabilizing soils. We evaluated the growth and structural responsiveness of young J. curcas plants to diverse soil conditions. Soils included a sand, a sandy-loam, and a clay-loam from eastern Mexico. Growth and structural parameters were analyzed for shoots and roots, although the focus was the plasticity of the primary root system architecture (the taproot and four lateral roots). The sandy soil reduced the growth of both shoot and root systems significantly more than sandy-loam or clay-loam soils; there was particularly high plasticity in root and shoot thickness, as well as shoot length. However, the architecture of the primary root system did not vary with soil type; the departure of the primary root system from an index of perfect symmetry was 14±5% (mean ± standard deviation). Although J. curcas developed more extensively in the sandy-loam and clay-loam soils than in sandy soil, it maintained a consistent root to shoot ratio and root system architecture across all types of soil. This strong genetic determination would make the species useful for soil stabilization purposes, even while being cultivated primarily for seed oil. © 2013 Ofelia Andrea Valdés-Rodríguez et al.

AB  - Instruments used to regulate the consumption of oil in the transport sector include fuel taxes, biofuel requirements, and fuel-efficiency standards. However, the effects that these have on oil consumption and price vary. If market power is present in the oil market, the directions of change in consumption and price might contrast with those in a competitive market. As a result, the market structure affects not only the effectiveness of the policy instruments used to reduce oil consumption, but also the terms of trade and carbon leakage. In particular, reduced oil consumption, as a result of increased fuel-efficiency standards, will unambiguously increase the price of oil under a monopoly. © The editors of The Scandinavian Journal of Economics 2013.

This study takes a detailed look at particulate matter (PM) from a single cylinder common rail diesel engine operated under conventional and premixed LTC combustion modes with diesel, biodiesel and biodiesel-ethanol fuels. Soot, particle number and particle size distribution are investigated. Experiments show that for conventional combustion, accumulation mode particulates are reduced by biodiesel and reduced further by biodiesel-E20 (20% ethanol by volume). The reduction is attributed to higher fuel oxygen content, lower stoichiometric air-fuel ratio and reduced aromatic content reducing carbonaceous soot. Nucleation mode particles from conventional combustion with diesel, biodiesel and biodiesel-E20 fuels show similar size distributions. For premixed LTC, biodiesel shifts the accumulation mode size distribution curve upwards (i.e., more particles) and towards smaller size particles relative to diesel. In LTC, biodiesel produces more semi-volatile organic carbon and lower soot. The shift in size distribution for biodiesel may be caused by more semi-volatile organic carbon in the exhaust causing an increase in the growth of particles nucleated from volatile species, and less soot leading to a reduction in the number of large carbonaceous agglomerates. Biodiesel-E20 decreases accumulation mode particles of all sizes by reducing soot and the amount of biodiesel-derived semi-volatile organic carbon available for growing particles. Biodiesel increases LTC nucleation mode particles relative to diesel. Biodiesel-E20 increases the amount of small nucleation particles (<20 nm) and decreases the amount of large nucleation particles (20-50 nm) relative to diesel. The increases in nucleation particles for biodiesel and small nucleation particles (<20 nm) for biodiesel-E20 are believed to be caused by less soot and more exhaust semi-volatile organic carbon causing increased nucleation. Biodiesel-B20 produces the lowest soot and total particle number concentration, both at conventional and premixed LTC, demonstrating its potential as an alternative fuel for diesel engines. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A new approach for the incorporation of safety criteria into the selection, location, and sizing of a biorefinery is introduced. In addition to the techno-economic factors, risk metrics are used in the decision-making process by considering the cumulative risk associated with key stages of the life cycle of a biorefinery that includes biomass storage and transportation, process conversion into biofuels or bioproducts, and product storage. The fixed cost of the process along with the operating costs for transportation and processing as well as the value of the product are included. An optimization formulation is developed based on a superstructure that embeds potential supply chains of interest. The optimization program establishes the tradeoffs between cost and safety issues in the form of Pareto curves. A case study on bio-hydrogen production is solved to illustrate the merits of the proposed approach. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - SUMMARY: In the present work, catalytic cracking of fish oil industrial residue was investigated to study the effect of temperature, type of catalyst and the heating rate on the yield of organic liquid fraction (OLF) and its acid value. The highest bio-oil yield of 72% (wt.) was obtained at temperature range of 300-500°C and heating rate of 10°C/min with the mixture of Al2O3 and Na2CO3 as a catalyst. It was found that the mixture of Na2CO3 and MgSO4 as a catalyst gives lowest acid value of 8.75 mgKOH/goil and 68.1% of OLF yield. Furthermore, the acid value is reduced to 0.36 mgKOH/goil using Na2CO3 as an absorbent. The results show that the catalytic cracking process represents a sustainable method to produce bio-oil from fish oil industrial residues with physicochemical characteristics similar to the diesel fuel. © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass, microalgae and sewage sludge have distinct compositions and structures to each other. To understand the effect of feedstock differences on biomass liquefaction process, the liquefaction characteristics of rice straw (lignocellulosic biomass), Spirulina (microalgae) and sewage sludge were comparatively studied. Liquefaction experiments were performed in a 500mL autoclave at identical conditions (623K, 9.4-10.1MPa and 20min retention time). Although the content of organic materials in sewage sludge was the lowest among above three biomasses, the yield of bio-oil from sewage sludge reached up to 39.5±1.16%, higher than those from rice straw (21.1±0.93%) and Spirulina (34.5±1.31%). Besides, the bio-oils from sewage sludge had the highest heating value (36.14MJ/kg). However, Spirulina showed the highest conversion (79.7±1.02%). GC-MS analysis results indicated that the major compounds in the bio-oil from rice straw were phenolic compounds. In case of sewage sludge and Spirulina, esters were the main compositions. The volatility distribution of hydrocarbons was evaluated by C-NPgram (Carbon-Normal Paraffin gram). It was showed that the majority of hydrocarbons from sewage sludge and Spirulina were distributed at C17 and C20, whereas they were distributed at C8 in rice straw-derived bio-oil. The types of feedstocks have a significant effect on biomass liquefaction. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In order to meet the growing global energy requirement, exhaustive research is carried to develop and use variety of renewable fuels. Main objective of the present study is to compare the performance, emissions and combustion characteristics of biodiesel derived from non-edible Karanja oil in an unmodified diesel engine and to compare the results with baseline results of diesel fuel. Important physico-chemical properties of Karanja oil after transesterification were experimentally evaluated and found within acceptable limits of relevant standards. The performance parameters evaluated in the present study includes brake thermal efficiency of Karanja biodiesel with different compositions at 5%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 100% with mineral Diesel. BTE was about 3-5% lower with Karanja biodiesel and its blends with respect to diesel. Also, emissions parameters such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, UBHC (unburned hydrocarbon), oxides of nitrogen and smoke opacity for different test fuels were also measured. UBHC, CO, CO2 and smoke were lower with Karanja biodiesel fuel. However, NOx emissions of Karanja biodiesel and its blend were higher than Diesel. The combustion analysis was done using peak cylinder pressure and heat release rate with respect to crank angle. The peak cylinder pressure and heat release rate was lower for Karanja biodiesel. The results from the experiments suggest that biodiesel from non-edible oil like Karanja and its blends with diesel could be a potential fuel for diesel engine and play a vital role in the near future especially for small and medium energy production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Primary energy savings potential is used to compare five residual municipal solid waste treatment systems, including configurations with mechanical (MT) and mechanical-biological (MBT) pre-treatment, which produce waste-derived fuels (RDF and SRF), biogas and/or recover additional materials for recycling, alongside a system based on conventional mass burn waste-to-energy and ash treatment. To examine the magnitude of potential savings we consider two energy efficiency levels (state-of-the-art and best available technology), the inclusion/exclusion of heat recovery (CHP vs. PP) and three different background end-use energy production systems (coal condensing electricity and natural gas heat, Nordic electricity mix and natural gas heat, and coal CHP energy quality allocation).The systems achieved net primary energy savings in a range between 34 and 140MJprimary/100MJinput waste, in the different scenario settings. The energy footprint of transportation needs, pre-treatment and reprocessing of recyclable materials was 3-9.5%, 1-18% and 1-8% respectively, relative to total energy savings. Mass combustion WtE achieved the highest savings in scenarios with CHP production, nonetheless, MBT-based systems had similarly high performance if SRF streams were co-combusted with coal. When RDF and SRF was only used in dedicated WtE plants, MBT-based systems totalled lower savings due to inherent system losses and additional energy costs. In scenarios without heat recovery, the biodrying MBS-based system achieved the highest savings, on the condition of SRF co-combustion. As a sensitivity scenario, alternative utilisation of SRF in cement kilns was modelled. It supported similar or higher net savings for all pre-treatment systems compared to mass combustion WtE, except when WtE CHP was possible in the first two background energy scenarios. Recovery of plastics for recycling before energy recovery increased net energy savings in most scenario variations, over those of full stream combustion. Sensitivity to assumptions regarding virgin plastic substitution was tested and was found to mostly favour plastic recovery. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is a suitable process to eliminate the oxygen content in vegetable oils and to produce a renewable fuel with characteristics similar to petroleum derived diesel. In this investigation, ordered mesoporous materials based on SBA-15 and Al-SBA-15 were synthesized and impregnated by incipient wetness impregnation with Ni or Co nitrate, being subsequently calcined and reduced with hydrogen. All the samples were characterized by means of XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption analysis at 77 K, ICP-OES, H 2-TPR and TPD-NH3. Hydrotreating of a methyl esters mixture, used as convenient surrogate of triglycerides, was studied in the present work. Catalytic tests were carried out in a fixed-bed tubular reactor at 340-300 °C and 30 bar of H2 for 6 h, obtaining n-paraffins as main products. The results revealed that the presence of aluminum in the supports favors HDO processes, specifically at low temperatures, achieving higher selectivities and yields to C18 hydrocarbons than SBA-15 based materials. Besides, acid sites promote the formation of non-linear hydrocarbons in addition to n-paraffins, which are mainly produced with pure silica based catalysts. Regarding active phases, Co proved to be more active than Ni under the reaction conditions used in this study. On the basis of these results, Co/Al-SBA-15 can be considered as a very promising catalyst for the production of biofuels in diesel range from vegetable oils with a remarkable HDO activity. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuel substitution for fossil fuels has been recommended in the literature and promoted in many countries; however, there are concerns about its economic viability. In this paper we focus on the cost-effectiveness of fuels, i.e., we compare the social costs of biofuels and fossil fuels for a functional unit defined as 1km of vehicle transportation. We base our empirical results on a case study in Vietnam and compare two biofuels and their alternative fossil fuels: ethanol and gasoline, and biodiesel and diesel with a focus on the blends of E5 and E10 for ethanol, and B5 and B10 for biodiesel. At the discount rate of 4%, ethanol substitution for gasoline in form of E5 or E10 saves 33% of the social cost of gasoline if the fuel consumption of E5 and E10 is the same as gasoline. The ethanol substitution will be cost-effective if the fuel consumption of E5 and E10, in terms of Lkm-1, is not exceeding the consumption of gasoline by more than 1.7% and 3.5% for E5 and E10 respectively. The biodiesel substitution would be cost-effective if the fuel consumption of B5 and B10, in terms of Lkm-1 compared to diesel, would decrease by more than 1.4% and 2.8% for B5 and B10 respectively at the discount rate of 4%. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Syagrus romanzoffiana is a palm species from the Arecaceae family, commonly known in Brazil as Jerivá. Its fruit is a drupe, global or oval with rigid endocarp that contains a high seed oil content, 52% (w/w) on a wet basis. This study analyzed Jerivá oil composition with regard to fatty acids and some physical-chemical properties related to its quality, aiming at using this oil as a raw material to produce biodiesel. The oil extracted is mainly composed of saturated fatty acids. The quality parameters of the Jerivá oil are in accordance with the European regulations, ASTM and Brazilian standards. Preliminary production tests revealed that the S. romanzoffiana oil is a viable alternative for the production of biodiesel. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although the documentation of fuel biodeterioration dates back to the late 19th century, general recognition of the value of microbial contamination control evolved slowly until the 1980s. Since the early 1980s a number of factors have converged to stimulate greater interest in fuel and fuel system biodeterioration. This, in turn, has stimulated applied research in the ecology of biodeteriogenic processes and biodeterioration control. This presentation reviews progress in both of these areas since 1980. The aforementioned factors that have provided the impetus for improved microbial control, the evolution of our understanding of the nature of the biodeteriogenic processes will be discussed. Activities of consensus organizations to develop guidelines and practices will also be reviewed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper models the economic feasibility of growing the oilseed crop Camelina sativa (" camelina" ) in the western United States to produce value-added protein feed supplement and an SVO-based biofuel. Modeled in eastern Colorado, this study demonstrates that camelina can be grown profitably both as a commodity and as an energy biofuel. These findings, along with the stochastic crop rotation budget and profitability sensitivity analysis, reflect unique contributions to the literature. The study's stochastic break-even analysis demonstrates a 0.51 probability of growing camelina profitably when diesel prices reach 1.15 $ L-1. Results also show that the sale of camelina meal has the greatest impact on profitability. Yet once the price of diesel fuel exceeds 0.90 $ L-1, the farmer generates more revenue from the ability to offset diesel fuel purchases than the revenues generated from the sale of camelina meal. A risk analysis using second degree stochastic dominance demonstrates that a risk-averse farmer would choose to grow camelina if the price of diesel equals or exceeds 1.31 $ L-1. The article concludes that camelina can offset on-farm diesel use, making it economically feasible for farmers to grow their own fuel. As a result, camelina production may increase farm income, diversify rural economic development, and contribute to the attainment of energy policy goals. •This is a stochastic budget analysis of growing camelina as SVO-based biofuel.•Results demonstrate economic feasibility for producers to grow their own fuel.•Camelina production can diversify regional and national energy portfolios.•Camelina production can contribute to on-farm energy independence. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Free lipase-mediated alcoholysis offers an effective alternative approach to biodiesel production due to its merits of faster reaction rate and lower preparation cost. Further promoting the application of free lipase in catalyzing the transesterification of crude renewable oils is of significance since the cost of oil feedstock accounts for a major part in biodiesel production. Crude renewable oils typically contain a certain amount of phospholipids and it has been found that the phospholipids have inhibitory effect on lipase's catalytic performance during immobilized lipase-catalyzed biodiesel production. However, the influence of phospholipids on free lipase-mediated alcoholysis in oil/water biphasic system has not been reported. In this work, free lipase from Aspergillus niger was employed as the catalyst for biodiesel production and the effect of phospholipids on free lipase's catalytic performance was explored for the first time. It was found that both the reaction rate and the final FAME content increased and the free lipase exhibited better reuse stability in the presence of phospholipids. Further study on the distribution of phosphorous showed that within 2% phospholipids contained in the oil feedstock, only less than 4 ppm phosphorous remained in the final methyl esters, which well met the phosphorous demand of biodiesel standard. The above results demonstrated that free lipase-mediated alcoholysis was promising for biodiesel production especially with low quality crude vegetable oils as the feedstock. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - It has been recognized that oils derived from microorganism and wastewater sludge are comparable replacements of traditional biodiesel production feedstock, which is energy intensive and costly. Energy balance and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are essential factors to assess the feasibility of the production. This study evaluated the energy balance and GHG emissions of biodiesel production from microbial and wastewater sludge oil. The results show that energy balance and GHG emissions of biodiesel produced from microbial oil are significantly impacted by the cultivation methods and carbon source. For phototrophic microorganism (microalgae), open pond system gives 3.6 GJ higher energy gain than photo bioreactor system in per tonne biodiesel produced. For heterotrophic microorganisms, the energy balance depends on the type of carbon source. Three carbon sources including starch, cellulose, and starch industry wastewater (SIW) used in this study showed that utilization of SIW as carbon source provided the most favorable energy balance. When oil extracted from municipal sludge is used for biodiesel production, the energy gain is up to 29.7 GJ per tonne biodiesel produced, which is higher than the energy gain per tonne of biodiesel produced from SIW cultivated microbes. GHG emissions study shows that biodiesel production from microbes or sludge oil is a net carbon dioxide capture process except when starch is used as raw material for microbial oil production, and the highest capture is around 40 tonnes carbon dioxide per tonne of biodiesel produced. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The marine transportation sector, responsible for consuming a large amount of degraded fuel oil, is one of the major contributors to global warming and air pollution. These effects are responsible for a large number of premature deaths in the US and throughout the world. The international regulation known as the 2008 MARPOL Annex VI Amendment, which is enforced by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), has imposed progressively more stringent limits on emissions from marine vessels. Biodiesel, an environmentally friendly, renewable, clean, and low-carbon fuel, is regarded as the most appropriate alternative fuel for marine vessels. However, the promotion of biodiesel use in water-borne transportation is considered to be a bigger challenge than its more successful development in land-based applications. The major obstacles to promoting biodiesel blends in marine transportation are examined in this study. The strategies proposed to overcome these obstacles include the comprehensive field testing of the biodiesel blends in marine vessels of various representative types, establishing a marine-grade biodiesel specification, increasing the price competitiveness of marine-grade biodiesel by reducing its manufacturing costs, providing tax cuts, exemptions, and government subsidies, increasing the amount of biodiesel use in marine applications, adopting compatible elastomers and metallic materials in fuel feeding systems and storage tanks, applying approaches or technologies suitable for improving the low-temperature fluidity of biodiesel blends, and increasing the added value of purified glycerol. The effective application of these strategies will enable the more widespread use of biodiesel in marine applications, significantly reducing emissions from ships, improving global air quality, protecting the ecological environment and improving people's health. © 2013.

AB  - A field study was conducted at eight sites in western Canada to determine the influence of agronomic inputs on fatty acid profiles and biodiesel quality of canola. Protein and chlorophyll concentration and fatty acid profiles were determined from seed samples at all sites. Oil was extracted from canola seed samples from three sites, converted to biodiesel, and subjected to standard protocols. Protein concentration increased at higher than recommended rates of nitrogen (N) and the higher canola seeding rate (150 seeds m-2) reduced chlorophyll levels in canola oil. All biodiesel samples fell below new oxidation stability tolerance levels (minimum 8 h). However, given the routine addition of commercial antioxidant additives, all biodiesel samples from this study were suitable for blending in middle distillate fuels. Cloud point values were lowest at normal N (1×) rates. Normal N rates increased stearic acid content, whereas high N rates (1.5×) increased gadoleic acid content. Low seeding rates (75 seeds m-2) increased palmitic acid content. The combination of normal N (1×) with a high seed rate (150 seeds m-2) increased oleic acid content. Conversely, the combination of high N (1.5×) with a low seed rate (75 seeds m-2) increased linolenic acid content. Gadoleic acid content increased in the continuous canola rotation versus the canola-wheat-canola rotation; similar trends were observed with palmitic, linoleic, and linolenic acid. Oleic acid tended to be higher in canola rotated with wheat. Cold filter plugging point (CFPP) was predicted based on saturated fatty acid content. Usually, a high seeding rate (150 seeds m-2) combined with a normal N rate (1×) led to the most favourable (lowest) CFPP values. Low CFPP values were also associated with canola rotated with wheat compared with continuous canola production. Seeding rate, N, and crop rotation influenced protein and chlorophyll concentration, fatty acid profiles, cloud point, and CFPP.

AB  - Vaporization, microexplosion and ignition characteristics of a single droplet of pyrolysis bio-oil/fuel oil blends were examined using a suspended-droplet heating device. The bio-oil used in the experiment was produced from the fast pyrolysis process of lauan (shorea) wood, which is of low heating value, and high water as well as oxygen contents. The heating temperature (ambient temperature) and the mixing ratio of bio-oil/fuel oil blends were varied in the experiment. Two kinds of fuel oil were adopted, i.e., diesel and heavy fuel oil (HFO). The droplet evaporation, microexplosion and ignition behaviors were recorded by a high-speed video system. Meanwhile, the temperature histories (droplet and ambient temperatures) were measured by two K-type thermocouples in the heating process. For pure bio-oil, it was found that at the lower ambient temperature, 300 C, random behavior (including expansion, bubbling, ejecting, and swelling) and microexplosion could be observed but ignition did not occur. However, at the higher ambient temperature, 500 C, random behavior, microexplosion and ignition occurred for pure bio-oil and also for all cases of bio-oil/diesel blends. Random behavior and microexplosion occurred because the bio-oil contained many chemical compositions with various boiling points and water. For the bio-oil/HFO blends, ignition did not occur for low bio-oil contents (smaller than 50%) in the blends. However, when the bio-oil content was equal to or greater than 60%, ignition could occur but bio-oil/HFO-blends droplets took longer to finish burning compared with the bio-oil/diesel droplets. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The European Union currently pays great attention to the possibilities for the use of biofuels to power mobile machinery. The main reasons for the promotion of biofuels is the effort of Member States to reduce dependence on oil imports, efforts to reduce emissions from internal combustion engines and also efforts to support agriculture. As the best substitute for diesel, promoting fatty acid methyl ester, namely in the Czech conditions rapeseed methyl ester (RME). Requirements for diesel fuel are the norm ČSN EN 590 and prescribes requirements for RME standard ČSN EN 14214. At present, based on the requirements of EU directives there is a mandatory addition of methyl ester in diesel of a maximum volume fraction of 7%. This blended fuel complies with ČSN EN 590 and can be used without any modification to existing diesel engines. Production of methyl ester of fatty acids is energy intensive and therefore offer, with the allowance made for the structural adjustment of the combustion engine, the possibility to use a mixture of diesel fuel and oil directly. In this paper they are compared on the basis of the complete characteristics of the engine performance parameters (torque and engine power) and minimum specific fuel consumption. Based on standardised test NRSC (non-road steady cycle) are also compared smoke and fuel consumption of the internal combustion engine of a Zetor 8641 Forterra tractor (tractor has worked less than 100 hours). As the fuel is a mixture of different ratios of selected diesel with rapeseed oil, jatropha curcas oil and rapeseed oil methyl ester.

AB  - In order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, the production of biofuels from lignocellulosic agricultural residues is the focus of industrial and scientific interest. The feedstocks of the second generation used for bioethanol production are lignocellulose-containing raw materials like different types of straw, or other plants like miscanthus x giganteus. In all these plants, the cellulose in the lignocellulose is not accessible to enzymes. Therefore, lignin and/or hemicelluloses have to be removed by a specific pretreatment in order to make enzymatic degradation of cellulose possible. We examined and compared the pretreatment of wheat straw by means of steam treatment and steam explosion treatment. After hydrolysis, glucose concentrations up to 300 g kg-1 were reached both for steam-pretreated straw and steam-exploded straw. After fermentation, ethanol concentrations ranging from 120-140 g kg-1 were achieved. Results suggest that the explosion process slightly favors the solubilisation of sugars and, therefore, enhances ethanol production. Only at higher temperature and longer incubation time does the explosion process not seem to be necessary. In addition to this, we examined most of the lignocellulosic residuals in Austria available for bioethanol production. As a result, we can show that even in a country not focused on agricultural production all the bioethanol needed for E10 can easily be provided.

AB  - It is widely known that the use of biofuels is still limited by their particular physical-chemical properties, which are less advantageous than fossil fuels (diesel and gas petro fuels). This amounts to significant apparent differences related to the functional parameters and pollutant emissions (NOx) for compression-ignition (CI) engines fueled with biofuels. Elimination of these shortcomings can be achieved via a modern injection system, an electronically controlled high-pressure common rail system. This is why achieving a precise injection process is necessary, and injection parameters are directly influenced by the phenomenon of cavitation and the erosion process of the injector nozzle. This article presents a computer simulation study of the influence of various fuels (biofuels) on the effect of erosion (and intensity) on the performance of the injection process. The magnitude of the injector nozzle erosion process is different using diesel fuel compared to using biodiesel and pure vegetable oil, implying the need for greater attention to injection system self-development design programs and to the overall maintenance characteristics of CI engines fueled with biodiesel. There are also different patterns of velocity at the nozzle exit for each of the studied cases, differences that have a direct bearing on future fuel spray development inside the combustion chamber. © Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers.

AB  - Hydrotreatment of glycerol (a byproduct of bio-diesel production) was conducted in the presence of a number of different supported metal catalysts at a temperature of 300 C under 5 MPa initial pressure of H2. The bio-oil products were comprehensively characterized to determine their physical/chemical properties. Experiments with supported catalyst metals revealed a positive correlation between support acidity and bio-oil yield. It was determined that MoCoP is the most effective combination of catalyst metals, and the bio-oil yield from hydro-treatment of glycerol with the MoCoP catalysts is strongly dependent on the support materials, following the trend of MgO &lt; AC &lt; Al2O3 &lt; zeolite. With the MoCoP/zeolite catalyst, a maximum yield of ∼40 wt.% bio-oil, and &gt;90% glycerol conversion was achieved for 60 min reaction. The volatile components of the bio-oil were found to consist mostly of substituted phenols and ketones in the C6-C9 range. The bio-oils obtained had a maximum HHV of 33 MJ/kg and the majority (∼95%) of the compounds present was found to have boiling points lower than 165 C, making these bio-oils potential oxygenated fuel additives. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - An engine cylinder liner-piston ring tribotester was used to investigate the effects of different diesel fuels on the tribological properties of a cylinder liner-piston ring. The wear surface morphology and roughness were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope and a surface profiler. The chemical structures and components of the tested oils were characterized using a Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The chemical components and element distribution on the rubbed surface were studied using energy-dispersive X-ray spectra. The results showed that the cylinder liner-piston ring lubricated with bio-oil (BO) had a lower friction coefficient but higher wear mass and greater surface roughness than one lubricated with diesel oil (DO), and emulsified bio-oil (EBO) can decrease the wear weight loss and surface roughness of the friction pairs. The protective film created by BO between the cylinder liner and piston ring lowered the friction coefficient due to the adsorption of polar groups of carboxylic acids and alcohols on the rubbing surface. However, these oxygen-containing organics in the BO also corroded the rubbing surfaces, which resulted in higher wear mass compared to that caused by DO. The main wear mechanisms can be identified as corrosive wear for BO and abrasive wear for EBO and DO. The EBO showed promising potential becaus its use resulted in lower corrosion and lower wear. © Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers.

AB  - The influence of different parameters on the conversion of carbohydrates and biomass into the potential biofuel intermediate 5-bromomethylfurfural (BMF) has been studied. Our optimized conditions avoid the use of lithium salt additives, making this method cheaper and environmentally more benign compared to previously reported methods. Different wood species and their potential as a raw material in BMF and furfural production have also been evaluated. In addition, we report a very simple and efficient procedure for conversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into BMF or 5-chloromethylfurfural (CMF). © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gradual depletion of fossil fuels warmed the use of biodiesels as an alternative fuel source and a suitable way to minimize the usage of fossil fuels. Biodiesel is a renewable source of energy derived from plant oil or animal fats. They are mono alkyl ester of long chain fatty acids formed by seed oil.Efficiency of transesterification of oil from three sources(Jatropha, Karanjia and Simarouba DC)was determined in this experiment with methanol as a solvent and Paratoulene sulphonic and sodium methoxide as a catalyst. In this experiment we are concentrating on the factor that effect transesterification i.e. optimization of catalyst, molar concentration, effect of reaction time and temperature. The output characteristics may include certain physio-chemical properties that vary from plant to plant. These may be verified by Gas chromatography and NMR along with their molar ratio. © EM International Printed in India. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hydrotreating of C18 fatty acids for biofuel production was investigated with dodecane as solvent in a fixed bed reactor. The effects of temperature (300 C-375 C), pressure (2 MPa-8 MPa), WHSV (4 h- 1-18 h- 1) and hydrogen to oil ratio (500 NmL/mL-1000 NmL/mL) on the oxygen removal reaction pathways of hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), decarbonylation/decarboxylation (DCO/DCO2) as well as α/β-C scission and isomerization reactions to form the C 15-C18 hydrocarbons were systemically evaluated. For all experiments the same commercial Ni-W supported on modified SiO 2-Al2O3 by NTY zeolite catalyst was used. The hydrotreating temperature is the most dominant operating parameter that affects the catalyst performance. The HDO to DCO/DCO2 ratio increases with decreasing temperature and/or increasing pressure. Low temperature and high WHSV will promote the isomerization reaction to cause more iso-paraffins in the products. The conversion of C18 fatty acids and/or product yield is little affected by the H2/oil ratio. Moreover, the concentration of C18 fatty acids in dodecane has a significant effect on the conversion of C18 fatty acids and C18 yield (HDO reaction), which decreases with the concentration of C18 fatty acids. Adsorbed hydrogen to fatty acid ratio has significant effect on deoxygenation pathways including C-O scission and C-C scission. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work investigated the effect of ultrasound on the biodesulfurization of bunker oil by the native microbial cells in oil/water biphasic system. The operational parameters for the desulfurization procedure such as ultrasonic irradiation time, ultrasonic wave amplitude, biocatalyst initial concentration and ratio of oil phases to aqueous phases were studied. An obviously positive effect was observed after introduction of ultrasound into the BDS system. The sulfur content of bunker oil did not decrease in absence of ultrasound pre-treatment. After ultrasonic pre-treatment, about 10-20% of sulfur was removed for the samples without any additive and was dependent on ultrasonic irradiation time, ultrasonic wave amplitude, biocatalyst initial concentration and ratio of oil phases to aqueous phases. During the desulfurization, even though an easily available carbon source, glycerol, was supplied, some low molecular weight hydrocarbons can be consumed by cells as carbon source, resulting in a loss in the fuel value or energy loss. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Black carbon aerosol plays a unique and important role in Earth's climate system. Black carbon is a type of carbonaceous material with a unique combination of physical properties. This assessment provides an evaluation of black-carbon climate forcing that is comprehensive in its inclusion of all known and relevant processes and that is quantitative in providing best estimates and uncertainties of the main forcing terms: direct solar absorption; influence on liquid, mixed phase, and ice clouds; and deposition on snow and ice. These effects are calculated with climate models, but when possible, they are evaluated with both microphysical measurements and field observations. Predominant sources are combustion related, namely, fossil fuels for transportation, solid fuels for industrial and residential uses, and open burning of biomass. Total global emissions of black carbon using bottom-up inventory methods are 7500 Gg yr-1 in the year 2000 with an uncertainty range of 2000 to 29000. However, global atmospheric absorption attributable to black carbon is too low in many models and should be increased by a factor of almost 3. After this scaling, the best estimate for the industrial-era (1750 to 2005) direct radiative forcing of atmospheric black carbon is +0.71 W m-2 with 90% uncertainty bounds of (+0.08, +1.27) W m-2. Total direct forcing by all black carbon sources, without subtracting the preindustrial background, is estimated as +0.88 (+0.17, +1.48) W m-2. Direct radiative forcing alone does not capture important rapid adjustment mechanisms. A framework is described and used for quantifying climate forcings, including rapid adjustments. The best estimate of industrial-era climate forcing of black carbon through all forcing mechanisms, including clouds and cryosphere forcing, is +1.1 W m-2 with 90% uncertainty bounds of +0.17 to +2.1 W m-2. Thus, there is a very high probability that black carbon emissions, independent of co-emitted species, have a positive forcing and warm the climate. We estimate that black carbon, with a total climate forcing of +1.1 W m-2, is the second most important human emission in terms of its climate forcing in the present-day atmosphere; only carbon dioxide is estimated to have a greater forcing. Sources that emit black carbon also emit other short-lived species that may either cool or warm climate. Climate forcings from co-emitted species are estimated and used in the framework described herein. When the principal effects of short-lived co-emissions, including cooling agents such as sulfur dioxide, are included in net forcing, energy-related sources (fossil fuel and biofuel) have an industrial-era climate forcing of +0.22 (-0.50 to +1.08) W m-2 during the first year after emission. For a few of these sources, such as diesel engines and possibly residential biofuels, warming is strong enough that eliminating all short-lived emissions from these sources would reduce net climate forcing (i.e., produce cooling). When open burning emissions, which emit high levels of organic matter, are included in the total, the best estimate of net industrial-era climate forcing by all short-lived species from black-carbon-rich sources becomes slightly negative (-0.06 W m-2 with 90% uncertainty bounds of -1.45 to +1.29 W m-2). The uncertainties in net climate forcing from black-carbon-rich sources are substantial, largely due to lack of knowledge about cloud interactions with both black carbon and co-emitted organic carbon. In prioritizing potential black-carbon mitigation actions, non-science factors, such as technical feasibility, costs, policy design, and implementation feasibility play important roles. The major sources of black carbon are presently in different stages with regard to the feasibility for near-term mitigation. This assessment, by evaluating the large number and complexity of the associated physical and radiative processes in black-carbon climate forcing, sets a baseline from which to improve future climate forcing estimates. ©2013 The Authors.

AB  - This paper describes the use of bio-oil derived from the pyrolysis of waste wood in a single cylinder, air cooled, direct injection (DI), diesel engine developing power of 4.4kW at 1500rpm used in agricultural and standby applications. The combustion, performance and emission characteristics of the diesel engine fueled with three different emulsions made from wood pyrolysis oil (WPO) and Jatropha methyl ester (JME) are compared with those of JME and diesel operations. The WPO of 5%, 10% and 15% by volume is emulsified with 95%, 90% and 85% by volume of JME, denoted as X1JOE5, X1JOE10 and X1JOE15 respectively. The combustion of JME, X1JOE5, X1JOE10 and X1JOE15 starts earlier by 2.6°CA, 2.3°CA, 2.8°CA and 2°CA respectively compared to that of diesel at load. Shorter ignition delay and higher peak cylinder pressure are observed with JME and its emulsions with WPO. There is a significant reduction in the nitric oxide (NO) emissions by 2.5% when fueled with X1JOE15. The smoke opacity decreases by 25%, 26.7%, 22.1% and 18.2% for JME and its emulsions with WPO respectively, in comparison with diesel at fullload. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, the commercially available diesel fuel (Bu00), butanol(20%)-diesel(80%) (by vol.) (Bu20), butanol(30%)-diesel(70%) (Bu30), and butanol(40%)-diesel (60%) (Bu40) fuels were tested. Experiments were conducted on a high-speed direct injection (DI) diesel engine for passenger-car application for varied loads at two representative engine speeds. The results showed that butanol-diesel blends slightly increased combustion pressure and accelerated burning rate. As fueled by the Bu40 blend, the maximum power output of the engine cannot be affected. Besides, butanol-diesel blends increased BSFC and brake thermal efficiency. Moreover, the effects of butanol addition on diesel engine exhaust emissions were varied with loads. Under low-load conditions, CO emissions obviously increased while NOx emissions decreased as butanol blending ratio increased. Under high-load conditions, on the contrary, CO emissions decreased but NOx emission increased. For the 40% butanol-diesel blend, in addition, HC emissions were higher than the neat diesel and lower percentage of butanol-diesel blends, especially at low-load. It is interesting that smoke decreased significantly at all conditions with the use of butanol-diesel blends, and the more butanol blending ratio the less smoke. Overall butanol is a potentially promising biofuel, which could be used conveniently up to high blending ratio with diesel fuel in diesel engines. © 2013.

AB  - This paper describes the synthesis of a rubber seed supply network to support the green energy demand in Malaysia. An optimised rubber seed supply network design, which maximises biomass utilisation, secures local biomass supply as well as reduces material loss and emissions resulted from inefficient logistic activities has been carried out. The utilisation of rubber seed oil (RSO) for biofuel production in Malaysia and its contribution to the national biomass renewable energy portion is forecasted. The supply network of the biomass is synthesised through mixed integer linear programming. Both centralised and de-centralised rubber seed processing facilities are studied. The network model shows that the selection of rubber seed processing plant is highly dependant on the volume of feedstock. A simplified real case study is presented to demonstrate the optimisation model. In addition, biodiesel price is largely dependent on the feedstock market. Thus, comparison of crude palm oil (CPO) and RSO production processes have been made in term of (i) energy and utility consumptions, (ii) feedstock price and (iii) environmental impact. Sensitivity analysis of rubber seed oil price for obtaining optimal blending ratio of rubber seed oil and crude palm oil has been performed in order to determine the market uncertainty of the biodiesel price. The potential of substituting rubber seed oil for crude palm oil as an alternative blending feedstock for biodiesel production has been validated. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nanoscale measurements using atomic force microscopy are performed in order to scrutinize the friction phenomena observed in microscale ball-on-disc tribological tests under (boundary lubrication) BLregime. Two reference biodiesels, one derived from a vegetable source (soybean) and the other from animal fat,are compared. A linear dependence of the friction coefficient (μ) with the Stribeck parameter (S = viscosity×velocity/load) is observed: μ = 0.11-26.54×. S for the animal fat and μ = 0.12-51.56×. S for the soybean biodiesel. The nanotribological tests allowed highlighting the cohesion component of friction force in the BL regime that is associated to the intrinsic characteristics of the biodiesels, the respective friction coefficients being μ = 0.0206 for the animal fat and μ = 0.0233 for the soybean biodiesel. The better lubricity of the animal fat biodiesel compared to the soybean observed in microscale is attributed to the presence of sulfur and to the higher amount of mono- and di-glycerides contaminants in it. The polarity and/or chemical affinity of the respective sulfur and OH groups facilitate them to reacting with the steel surfaces during the rubbing action. At nanoscale level, the same ranking in friction is observed among the biodiesels, being that here the friction phenomena are attributed to the cohesive forces other than those related to viscosity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, we present a superstructure optimization approach for the integration of the simultaneous production of liquid fuels and hydrogen from switchgrass and shale gas. The process is based on Fischer-Tropsch technology in which the shale gas is reformed with steam, while the switchgrass is gasified and reformed (with steam or partial oxidation). The raw gas is cleaned up and its composition may be adjusted (using either water gas shift reaction or pressure swift adsorption). Next, the sour gases are removed before the liquid fuels are produced using an FT reactor. The heavy liquids are upgraded using hydrocracking to increase the yield towards FT-diesel. A sensitivity study on the raw material prices reveals that production costs for the biomass-shale gas facility are below $1/gal as long as biomass price is below $100/t and the price of the shale gas is not higher than $11.5/MMBTU. Furthermore, hydrogen is produced as long as the demand for liquid fuels can be met and there is enough shale gas available. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Improved thermal efficiency, reduction in fuel consumption and pollutant emissions from biodiesel fueled diesel engines are important issues in engine research. To achieve these, rapid and perfect air-fuel mixing are the most important requirements. The mixing quality of biodiesel spray with air can be improved by selecting the best injection parameters and better design of the combustion chamber. Experiments were performed using a DI (direct injection) diesel engine equipped with a conventional jerk type injection system and pistons having HCC (hemispherical combustion chamber) and TRCC (toroidal re-entrant combustion chamber) geometries. The combined effect of varying, injection pressure and combustion chamber geometries, on the combustion, performance and exhaust emissions, using a blend of 20% POME (pongamia oil methyl ester) by volume in diesel were evaluated. The test results showed that improvement in terms of brake thermal efficiency and specific fuel consumption for TRCC operated at higher injection pressure. Substantial improvements in reduction of emissions levels were also observed for TRCC operated at higher injection pressure. However improved combustion, due to better air motion inside the cylinder and high pressure injection, increased the oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Increasing injection pressure decreased ignition delay, and increased peak in-cylinder pressure and maximum heat release rate. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Currently, the main crop for biodiesel in Malaysia is palm oil. Recently, Jatropha curcas has drawn the attention of the Malaysian Government. This paper aims to study the feasibility of Jatropha as a potential biodiesel feedstock for Malaysia. Physico-chemical properties of Jatropha biodiesel and its blends with diesel followed by engine performance and emissions characteristics of B10, B20 and B0 were studied. The results show that viscosities of B10 and B20 are closer to diesel. Moreover, only the oxidation stability of B10 and B20 meet the European specifications (EN 590) of 20h. Therefore, only B10 and B20 have been used to evaluate engine performance and emission. Compared to B0, the average reduction in brake power (BP) is 4.67% for B10 and 8.86% for B20. It was observed that brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) increases as the percentage of biodiesel increase. Compared to B0, a reduction in hydrocarbon (HC) emission of 3.84% and 10.25% and carbon monoxide (CO) emission of 16% and 25% was reported using B10 and B20. However, the blends give higher nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission of 3% and 6% using B10 and B20. As a conclusion, B10 and B20 can be used in a diesel engine without any modifications. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study aims to determine optimal biodiesel ratio that can achieve the goals of fewer emissions, reasonable fuel economy and wide engine operating range. Different advanced machine learning techniques, namely ELM (extreme learning machine), LS-SVM (least-squares support vector machine) and RBFNN (radial-basis function neural network), are used to create engine models based on experimental data. Logarithmic transformation of dependent variables is used to alleviate the problems of data scarcity and data exponentiality simultaneously. Based on the engine models, two optimization methods, namely SA (simulated annealing) and PSO (particle swarm optimization), are employed and a flexible objective function is designed to determine the optimal biodiesel ratio subject to various user-defined constraints. A case study is presented to verify the modeling and optimization framework. Moreover, two comparisons are conducted, where one is among the modeling techniques and the other is among the optimization techniques. Experimental results show that, in terms of the model accuracy and training time, ELM with the logarithmic transformation is better than LS-SVM and RBFNN with/without the logarithmic transformation. The results also show that PSO outperforms SA in terms of fitness and standard deviation, with an acceptable computational time. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) is an engine combustion strategy that utilizes in-cylinder fuel blending to produce low NOx and PM emissions while maintaining high thermal efficiency. Previous RCCI research has been investigated in single-cylinder heavy-duty engines [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The current study investigates RCCI operation in a light-duty multi-cylinder engine over a wide number of operating points representing vehicle operation over the US EPA FTP test. Similarly, previous RCCI engine experiments have used petroleum based fuels such as ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel (ULSD) and gasoline, with some work done using high percentages of biofuels, namely E85 [7]. The current study was conducted to examine RCCI performance with moderate biofuel blends, such as E20 and B20, as compared to conventional gasoline and ULSD. The engine experiments consisted of in-cylinder fuel blending using port fuel-injection (PFI) of gasoline or E20 and early-cycle, direct-injection (DI) of ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) or B20 fuel. At the selected load points, the results from RCCI combustion using biofuels and petroleum fuels are compared. Preliminary results show that with E20, the peak load was able to be raised from 8 to 10 bar BMEP, due to ethanol's lower propensity for autoignition. Ethanol's low reactivity enabled an increased reactivity gradient and reduced the pressure rise rate (PRR) compared to gasoline. This increase in peak load also allowed for a 5% relative increase in brake thermal efficiency (BTE). Replacing ULSD with B20 was shown to increase combustion efficiency at low loads. The unique fuel properties of these biofuel blends increases the benefits of the use of RCCI combustion compared to conventional diesel combustion (CDC). Copyright © 2013 SAE International.

AB  - Fractional distillation of bio-oil derived from pyrolysis of corn stover was investigated under atmospheric and reduced pressure/vacuum conditions. Characterization of the fractions in terms of moisture, total acid number (TAN), energy content, elemental and chemical compositions was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the distillation process in separating the components and rendering improved product properties. Results showed high yields (wt.%) of the heavy fractions (b.p. 180-250 C at 1 bar; 160-230 C at 0.5 bar) and significant reduction in moisture and TAN content. Water was obtained as a separate layer in the first (light) fraction (b.p.≤100 C at 1 bar; ≤80 C at 0.5 bar). The heating values increased, especially for the light distillates in both atmospheric and vacuum distillation and the heavy distillates in atmospheric distillation. Analysis of the chemical composition showed that aromatic and oxygenated compounds were distributed in the light and middle fractions (∼15-20%) while phenolic compounds were concentrated in the heavy fraction (∼53%). The distillation process was effective in separating the components and yielding a product (heavy fraction) with improved properties and composition and which can be further utilized as feedstock for future upgrading procedures or as a blending material with other liquid fuels. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Butanol (C4H9OH) is a potential biofuel alternative in fossil fuel gasoline and diesel formulations. The usage of butanol would necessarily lead to direct emissions into the atmosphere; thus, an understanding of its atmospheric processing and environmental impact is desired. Reaction with the OH radical is expected to be the predominant atmospheric removal process for the four aliphatic isomers of butanol. In this work, rate coefficients, k, for the gas-phase reaction of the n-, i-, s-, and t-butanol isomers with the OH radical were measured under pseudo-first-order conditions in OH using pulsed laser photolysis to produce OH radicals and laser induced fluorescence to monitor its temporal profile. Rate coefficients were measured over the temperature range 221-381 K at total pressures between 50 and 200 Torr (He). The reactions exhibited non-Arrhenius behavior over this temperature range and no dependence on total pressure with k(296 K) values of (9.68 ± 0.75), (9.72 ± 0.72), (8.88 ± 0.69), and (1.04 ± 0.08) (in units of 10-12 cm3 molecule-1 s-1) for n-, i-, s-, and t-butanol, respectively. The quoted uncertainties are at the 2σ level and include estimated systematic errors. The observed non-Arrhenius behavior is interpreted here to result from a competition between the available H-atom abstraction reactive sites, which have different activation energies and pre-exponential factors. The present results are compared with results from previous kinetic studies, structure-activity relationships (SARs), and theoretical calculations and the discrepancies are discussed. Results from this work were combined with available high temperature (1200-1800 K) rate coefficient data and room temperature reaction end-product yields, where available, to derive a self-consistent site-specific set of reaction rate coefficients of the form ATn exp(-E/RT) for use in atmospheric and combustion chemistry modeling. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This work addresses the integrated design of the high temperature steam electrolysis (HTSE) and biomass to liquid (BtL) hybrid process. The comprehensive gate-to-gate analysis includes BtL and hydrogen production on-site operations. Simulations are carried out using commercial process simulation software - ProSimPlus - to allow physical modeling as well as mass and energy balances; modeling is based on standard elementary and user modules and supported by various CEA (French Atomic Energy and Alternative Energies Commission) previous works. The framework for assessment is proposed. Considering productivity, efficiency, cost, and environmental issues, five sustainability criteria are chosen: carbon matter yield, energy efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions, electrolysis water use, and levelized biofuels production cost. Simulations results verify that hydrogen input is almost doubling the biogenic carbon conversion into liquid biofuels. They bring out significant secondary energy saving for HTSE compared to the standard process and clear advantages over alkaline electrolysis considering technical and environmental criteria. HTSE coupling allows a sharp increase in productivity (biofuels/biomass) with a limited increase in cost and environmental impact at almost constant primary efficiency. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biofuels production has been promoted in the attempt to address global warming and oil dependence concerns. However, the environmental impact of biofuels is a very complex issue and cannot be represented by GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions only (carbon footprint). In particular, water consumption (water footprint) has been recognized as a key issue in renewable fuels production. This paper proposes a multiobjective Mixed Integer Linear Programming modeling framework to optimize the environmental (i.e., the carbon and water footprints) and economic performances of bioethanol supply chains. Multiechelon, multiperiod, and spatially explicit features are embedded within the formulation to steer decisions and investments through a global approach. The strategic design and planning of corn- and stover-based bioethanol production networks is taken into account. A case study is presented referring to the emerging Italian ethanol production. Results show the effectiveness of mathematical programming-based tools to provide decision makers with a quantitative analysis assessing the economic and environmental performances of different design configurations. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The link between emissions of vehicular particulate matter (PM) and adverse health effects is well established. However, the influence of new emission control technologies and fuel types on both PM emissions and health effects has been less well investigated. We examined the health impact of PM emissions from two vehicles equipped with or without a diesel particulate filter (DPF). Both vehicles were powered either with diesel (B0) or a 50% v/v biodiesel blend (B50). The DPF effectively decreased PM mass emissions (∼85%), whereas the fuel B50 without DPF lead to less reduction (∼50%). The hazard of PM per unit distance driven was decreased for the DPF-equipped vehicle as indicated by a reduced cytotoxicity, oxidative, and pro-inflammatory potential. This was not evident and even led to an increase when the hazard was expressed on a per unit of mass basis. In general, the PM oxidative potential was similar or reduced for the B50 compared to the B0 powered vehicle. However, the use of B50 resulted in increased cytotoxicity and IL-6 release in BEAS-2B cells irrespective of the expression metric. This study shows that PM mass reduction achieved by the use of B50 will not necessarily decrease the hazard of engine emissions, while the application of a DPF has a beneficial effect on both PM mass emission and PM hazard. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Research on renewable fuels has to assess possible adverse health and ecological risks as well as conflicts with global food supply. This investigation compares the two newly developed biogenic diesel fuels hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and jatropha methyl ester (JME) with fossil diesel fuel (DF) and rapeseed methyl ester (RME) for their emissions and bacterial mutagenic effects. Samples of exhaust constituents were compared after combustion in a Euro III heavy duty diesel engine. Regulated emissions were analyzed as well as particle size and number distributions, carbonyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and bacterial mutagenicity of the exhausts. Combustion of RME and JME resulted in lower particulate matter (PM) compared to DF and HVO. Particle numbers were about 1 order of magnitude lower for RME and JME. However, nitrogen oxides (NOX) of RME and JME exceeded the Euro III limit value of 5.0 g/kWh, while HVO combustion produced the smallest amount of NOX. RME produced the lowest emissions of hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) followed by JME. Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, and several other carbonyls were found in the emissions of all investigated fuels. PAH emissions and mutagenicity of the exhausts were generally low, with HVO revealing the smallest number of mutations and lowest PAH emissions. Each fuel showed certain advantages or disadvantages. As proven before, both biodiesel fuels produced increased NOX emissions compared to DF. HVO showed significant toxicological advantages over all other fuels. Since jatropha oil is nonedible and grows in arid regions, JME may help to avoid conflicts with the food supply worldwide. Hydrogenated jatropha oil should now be investigated if it combines the benefits of both new fuels. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel is a fast emerging alternate fuel but with its own disadvantage of having limited oxidative stability. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) obtained from high acid value (46.41 mgKOHg-1) rubber seed oil (RSO) was characterized by GC-MS and 1H-NMR. Fuel properties analysed were found to fit the required ASTM D6751 standard. Moreover, the possibility of monitoring the conversion efficiency of RSO to its corresponding methyl esters using FT-IR and NIR techniques was also analysed. As an important specification of bio-fuel quality, the fuel must have a minimum of three hours of oxidative stability (110oC) as per ASTM D6751 standard. Influence of metal contaminants, air, moisture and light on oxidative stability was studied on biodiesel having high iodine value. Acid value, peroxide value and induction period were recorded for samples under six different environments such as open (light exposed), closed (light exposed), open (dark), closed (dark), open (metal contaminated) and closed with metal contamination. Significant impact was observed only when metals are present as contaminants. Extent of degradation (oxidation) is higher when the samples are contaminated by metals, limiting the storage stability to thirty days. Higher oxidative stability was achieved under dark in the closed environment but in the absence of any metal contaminant.

AB  - This paper introduces the production process of an alternative transportation biofuel, biobutanol. European legislation concerning biofuels and their sustainability criteria are also briefly described. The need to develop methods to ensure more sustainable and efficient biofuel production processes is recommended. In addition, the assessment method to evaluate the sustainability of biofuels is considered and sustainability assessment of selected feedstocks for biobutanol production is performed. The benefits and potential of using lignocellulosic and waste materials as feedstocks in the biobutanol production process are also discussed. Sustainability assessment in this paper includes cultivation, harvest/collection and upstream processing (pretreatment) of feedstocks, comparing four main biomass sources: food crops, non-food crops, food industry by-product and wood-based biomass. It can be concluded that the highest sustainable potential in Finland is when biobutanol production is integrated into pulp & paper mills. © 2013, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

AB  - Ensuring the sustainability of biofuels is a mandatory requisite for the EU Member States. The EU Renewables Directive focuses on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of high biodiversity and carbon stock lands. The current framework does not consider the consumption of non-renewable resources. Starting from the paper "Assessment of biodiesel energy sustainability using the ExROI concept" published in Energy [4], which defined the ExROI (Exergy Return on Investment) indicator and applied it to well-to-tank biodiesel production from rapeseed, sunflower and palm, this paper proposes extending the use of ExROI, which involves exergy cost accounting, to the life cycle; extending the calculations to soybean and used cooking oil; and assessing ways to "defossilise" the cycles. This paper demonstrates that the ExROI is a better indicator than the EROI (Energy Return on Investment) which only considers energy flows. Also, it shows that biodiesel life cycles have positive ExROI values and that the ExROI value can be improved up to 26.51; i.e. for one unit of non-renewable sources invested in the process more than 26 units of biodiesel are obtained. This means that biodiesel can be around five times more sustainable than fossil diesel, from the viewpoint of non-renewable resources consumption.

AB  - This work assess the technical viability of the use of straight vegetable oils as fuel for a compression ignition engine applied to distributed electric generation. The use of neat soybean, sunflower, and tung oils, three vegetable oils with potential for application in southern Brazil, was assessed. For this purpose, an electronically controlled conversion kit that preheats the fuel to a proper temperature was developed and adapted to a single-cylinder, naturally aspired, mechanically injected and controlled, compression ignition engine. The engine performance in a steady-state dynamometric cell, in terms of power, torque, specific fuel consumption, and emissions, using vegetable oils, was measured and compared to the performance for neat diesel oil. The neat diesel oil resulted in the highest brake power and the neat tung oil resulted in the lowest, with the relative difference among all fuels varying between 5 % and 20 %. However, the first law efficiency was highest for some of the blends tested, reaching 38 %, and increased for lower speed. The NOx and CO emissions both increased as the engine speed decreased, revealing the lack of complete combustion especially in the higher speed regime.

AB  - Due to the concern on the availability of recoverable fossil fuel reserves and the environmental problems caused by the use of those fossil fuels, considerable attention has been given to biodiesel production as an alternative to petrodiesel. The two most common types of biofuels are ethanol and biodiesel. However, as the biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils and animal fats, there are concerns that biodiesel feedstock may compete with food supply in the long-term. Hence, the recent focus is to find oil bearing plants that produce non-edible oils as the feedstock for biodiesel production. In this project, plant species, Lemon grass (Cymbopogan flexuosus) is discussed as newer sources of oil for biodiesel production. Lemongrass is native to India and tropical Asia. In India, it is cultivated along Western Ghats (Maharashtra, Kerala), Karnataka and Tamil Nadu states besides foot-hills of Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim i.e., it can be cultivated on wide range throughout India and may favor easy availability. This study investigates the performance of Lemongrass oil and its blends as fuel for a CI engine. The data thus generated were compared with the data obtained using diesel. The engine exhibited a very good performance without any problem of combustion. It is suggested that, Lemongrass oil and its blends can be used as an alternate fuel for diesel engine. © 2006-2013 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

AB  - Poor performance of leachbed reactors (LBRs) is attributed to channelling, compaction from waste loading, unidirectional water addition and leachate flow causing reduced hydraulic conductivity and leachate flow blockage. Performance enhancement was evaluated in three LBRs M, D and U at 22 ± 3 °C using three water addition and leachate recycle strategies; water addition was downflow in D throughout, intermittently upflow and downflow in M and U with 77% volume downflow in M, 54% volume downflow in U while the rest were upflow. Leachate recycle was downflow in D, alternately downflow and upflow in M and upflow in U. The strategy adopted in U led to more water addition (30.3%), leachate production (33%) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) solubilisation (33%; 1609. g against 1210. g) compared to D (control). The total and volatile solids (TS and VS) reductions were similar but the highest COD yield (g-COD/g-TS and g-COD/g-VS removed) was in U (1.6 and 1.9); the values were 1.33 and 1.57 for M, and 1.18 and 1.41 for D respectively. The strategy adopted in U showed superior performance with more COD and leachate production compared to reactors M and D. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The pyrolysis behaviors and kinetics of the water-soluble fraction of bio-oil in the oxygen atmosphere in a fixed bed reactor were studied by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. Based on the experimental data, activation energies, reaction order and kinetic parameters were calculated by the Achar differential method and the Coats-Redfern integral method, the most probable mechanism functions were worked out, and therefore, thermal kinetic equations were finally obtained. The results showed that the pyrolysis of water-soluble fraction of bio-oil could be divided into three stages, that is, the evaporation of volatile fractions, the decomposition of heavy fractions and char combustion. The activation energies of volatilization were higher than those of decomposition stage. The first stage was expressed as first order reaction, which could be simulated by first order reaction model, and the second stage was expressed as second order reaction, which could be presented by the corresponding reaction model.

AB  - The article provides the results of an analyses of the characteristics of fuel injection system as well as the processes indicated in diesel engines 1A41 and F2L511, transferred from working with mineral diesel to working with rapeseed methyl ester-ethanol (RME-E) and mineral diesel fuel-rapeseed methyl ester-ethanol (D-RME-E). In biofuel, ethanol takes a part of 10÷40%. It was found that the E part in the fuel causes a lag of fuel injection of 2÷6 CA (greater values of fuel injection lag are common for partial engine loads and greater amount of E in fuel) that does not occur with mineral diesel fuel or RME. The analysis shows how a lag of fuel ignition limits the dynamic parameters (P max, (d p/d φ)max) of the cycle and specific emission of nitric oxides (eNOx) in exhaust gas. It is possible to convert diesel engines, operating on D to ethanol-containing biofuels without adjusting the fuel injection system parameters. At the same time, it is necessary to increase residual pressure in high-pressure fuel line of diesel engines with fuel injection pressure of 60÷70 MPa. © 2013 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.

AB  - In an effort to consume fewer non-renewable resources and use primarily raw materials of biological origin in the production of biofuel, biomass-derived biobutanol can be used for transesterification of rapeseed oil. The study investigates the physical and chemical characteristics of rapeseed oil butyl esters (RBE) and 10%, 20% and 30% RBE-diesel composites. Characteristics of RBE and their composites with conventional diesel (D) are a little different from rapeseed oil methyl esters (RME) and their composites with D, while their basic characteristics comply with the requirements of European Standard EN 14214. Comparative tests in 4-stroke 4-cylinder 1Z type diesel engine of Audi-80 using 10-30% RBE and 10-30% RME compounds as fuels have been performed, and the results indicate that the biologically derived additives improved the energy characteristics of the engine but increased the fuel consumption compared to pure diesel. Increasing the bio-component concentration up to 30% in diesel and biodiesel fuel (RME and RBE) mixtures leads to complex improvements in the environmental impact compared to pure diesel; however, in the case of mixtures with RBE, slightly higher concentrations of CO2, HC and NO x were observed in engine exhaust gases compared to RME and D mixtures of analogical composition. © 2013 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.

AB  - The world's availability of fossil fuel has shown limited supply in the near future; consequently, efforts towards finding alternative and sustainable sources of fuel have been heightened targeting on-farm biofuel production and industrial processing of bioethanol. In Kenya, smallholder farmers grow castor (Ricinus communis L.), croton (Croton megalocarpus L.) and jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) as the main biofuel feedstocks despite limited knowledge on their agronomic practices. They are grown either as monocrops, intercrops or as boundary crops with their seeds pressed locally or sold to the local biodiesel processors. The overall research question of this study was to evaluate the performance of these cropping systems with detailed investigation on the existing biofuel cropping systems, their yields, associated cropping challenges and possible solutions. A household survey was conducted in 210 smallholder farmers selected randomly from three regions: namely Laikipia, Nyeri and Lamu Districts, with seventy farmers per region. Farmers were asked questions on the general crop husbandry. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 17.1. Results showed that farmers practiced monocropping, intercropping, live fencing and boundary cropping systems with biofuel feedstocks and that their yields exhibited a lot of variability in the range of a few to 900 kg ha-1yr-1. Moreover, market availability and rainfall reliability presented the most cropping challenges while organized market, availability of adapted clones and irrigation were cited as the best possible solutions. It was concluded that the biofuel yield variability and the cropping systems used were as a result of the poor knowledge of agronomic practices.

AB  - We evaluate the economic feasibility for two bio-oil upgrading pathways: two-stage hydrotreating followed by fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) or single-stage hydrotreating followed by hydrocracking. In the hydrotreating/FCC pathway, two options are available as the hydrogen source for hydrotreating: merchant hydrogen or hydrogen from natural gas reforming. The primary products of the hydrotreating/FCC pathway are commodity chemicals whereas the primary products for the hydrotreating/hydrocracking pathway are transportation fuels and hydrogen. The two pathways are modeled using Aspen Plus® for a 2000 metric tons/day facility. Equipment sizing and cost calculations are based on Aspen Economic Evaluation® software.The bio-oil yield via fast pyrolysis is assumed to be 65% of biomass. We calculate the internal rate of return (IRR) for each pathway as a function of feedstock cost, fixed capital investment (FCI), hydrogen and catalyst costs, and facility revenues. The results show that a facility employing the hydrotreating/FCC pathway with hydrogen production via natural gas reforming option generates the highest IRR of 13.3%. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that product yield, FCI, and biomass cost have the greatest impacts on facility IRR. Monte-Carlo analysis shows that two-stage hydrotreating and FCC of the aqueous phase bio-oil with hydrogen produced via natural gas reforming has a relatively low risk for project investment. © 2013.

AB  - What are the conditions for the public understanding of biofuels and how do the media shape these conditions under the influence of a new production of knowledge? This article investigates how the biofuel controversy plays out in the Swedish press and Google search engine results and analyses winners and losers in the tight attention economy of contemporary media. It describes different visibility strategies biofuel stakeholders employ in both media arenas, and identifies a form of technoscientific promotion that hybrid actors use to succeed in the day-to-day struggle for media attention. To conclude, it raises broader societal questions of the contemporary blurring of knowledge boundaries and the emergence of new information hierarchies and their biases. By understanding how contemporary media shape controversies, we can address the democratic potential of both mass media and science. © The Author(s) 2013.

AB  - Microbially synthesized fatty acids are an attractive platform for producing renewable alternatives to petrochemically derived transportation fuels and oleochemicals. Free fatty acids (FFA) are a direct precursor to many high-value compounds that can be made via biochemical and ex vivo catalytic pathways. To be competitive with current petrochemicals, flux through these pathways must be optimized to approach theoretical yields. Using a plasmid-free, FFA-producing strain of Escherichia coli, a set of chemostat experiments were conducted to gather data for FFA production under phosphate limitation. A prior study focused on carbon-limited conditions strongly implicated non-carbon limitations as a preferred media formulation for maximizing FFA yield. Here, additional data were collected to expand an established kinetic model of FFA production and identify targets for further metabolic engineering. The updated model was able to successfully predict the strain's behavior and FFA production in a batch culture. The highest yield observed under phosphate-limiting conditions (0.1 g FFA/g glucose) was obtained at a dilution rate of 0.1 h -1, and the highest biomass-specific productivity (0.068 g FFA/gDCW/h) was observed at a dilution rate of 0.25 h-1. Phosphate limitation increased yield (∼45 %) and biomass-specific productivity (∼300 %) relative to carbon-limited cultivations using the same strain. FFA production under phosphate limitation also led to a cellular maintenance energy ∼400 % higher (0.28 g/gDCW/h) than that seen under carbon limitation. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The objective of this work was to study the two-step acid base homogenous catalyzed transesterification of olive pomace oil, with the ultimate purpose of producing biodiesel under mild reaction conditions by optimizing the process. Optimization of the experimental procedure was conducted by a factorial design of 23 under the acidic pretreatment step and during the basic transesterification. The optimal production of methyl esters (97.8%) was achieved for the experimental conditions H2SO4=20 wt%/CH3OH=35:1/T=40°C and KOH=0.6+ fatty acid value /CH3OH=9:1/ T=60°C, in the acidic and basic stage of the process, respectively. Finally, to properly assess the quality of the biofuel produced, it was tested for all the European Standard properties. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Prolific algal growth in sewage ponds with high organic loads in the tropical regions can provide cost-effective and efficient wastewater treatment and biofuel production. This work examines the ability of Euglena sp. growing in wastewater ponds for biofuel production and treatment of wastewater. The algae were isolated from the sewage treatment plants and were tested for their nutrient removal capability. Compared to other algae, Euglena sp. showed faster growth rates with high biomass density at elevated concentrations of ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) and organic carbon (C). Profuse growth of these species was observed in untreated wastewaters with a mean specific growth rate (μ) of 0.28 day-1 and biomass productivities of 132 mg L-1 day-1. The algae cultured within a short period of 8 days resulted in the 98 % removal of NH4-N, 93 % of total nitrogen 85 % of ortho-phosphate, 66 % of total phosphate and 92 % total organic carbon. Euglenoids achieved a maximum lipid content of 24.6 % (w/w) with a biomass density of 1.24 g L-1 (dry wt.). Fourier transform infrared spectra showed clear transitions in biochemical compositions with increased lipid/protein ratio at the end of the culture. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry indicated the presence of high contents of palmitic, linolenic and linoleic acids (46, 23 and 22 %, respectively), adding to the biodiesel quality. Good lipid content (comprised quality fatty acids), efficient nutrient uptake and profuse biomass productivity make the Euglena sp. as a viable source for biofuel production in wastewaters. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Turnip oil (TO; Raphanus sativus L.) produces seeds that contain around 26 wt% of inedible base stock that are suitable as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production. A turnip oil methyl ester (TME) was prepared from acid-catalyzed pretreated TO in an effort to evaluate important fuel properties of turnip oil-based biodiesel, such as kinematic viscosity, cloud point, pour point (PP), cold filter plugging point, acid value, oxidative stability and lubricity. A comparison was made with soybean oil methyl esters (SME) as per biodiesel fuel standards such as ASTM D6751 and EN 14214. TME was characterized using FTIR, HPLC and 1H NMR. Except PP property, SME displays superior fuel properties compared to TME. Blends (B5 and B20) of TME in ultra-low sulphur diesel fuel (ULSD) were also assessed for the aforesaid fuel properties and compared to an analogous set of blends of soybean oil methyl ester in ULSD as per petro diesel fuel standards such as ASTM D975 and D7467. TME B5 blends in ULSD displayed improved PP property in comparison to neat ULSD and blends of SME in ULSD. It was demonstrated that the B5 and B20 blends of TME in ULSD had acceptable fuel properties as per ASTM D975 (for B5 blend) and ASTM D7467 (for B20 blend). In summary, turnip oil has potential as an alternative, non-food feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).

AB  - Previous assessments of the economic feasibility and large-scale productivity of microalgae biofuels have not considered the impacts of land and carbon dioxide (CO2) availability on the scalability of microalgae-based biofuels production. To accurately assess the near-term productivity potential of large-scale microalgae biofuel in the USA, a geographically realized growth model was used to simulate microalgae lipid yields based on meteorological data. The resulting lipid productivity potential of Nannochloropsis under large-scale cultivation is combined with land and CO2 resource availability illustrating current geographically feasible production sites and corresponding productivity in the USA. Baseline results show that CO2 transport constraints will limit US microalgae-based bio-oil production to 4 % of the 2030 Department of Energy (DOE) alternative fuel goal. The discussion focuses on synthesis of this large-scale productivity potential results including a sensitivity analysis to land and CO2 resource assumptions, an evaluation of previous modeling efforts, and their assumptions regarding the transportation of CO2, the feasibility of microalgae to meet DOE 2030 alternative fuel goals, and a comparison of the productivity potential in several key regions of the USA. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Field experiments were conducted to assess the potential for anaerobic biostimulation to enhance BTEX biodegradation under fermentative methanogenic conditions in groundwater impacted by a biodiesel blend (B20, consisting of 20 % v/v biodiesel and 80 % v/v diesel). B20 (100 L) was released at each of two plots through an area of 1 m2 that was excavated down to the water table, 1. 6 m below ground surface. One release was biostimulated with ammonium acetate, which was added weekly through injection wells near the source zone over 15 months. The other release was not biostimulated and served as a baseline control simulating natural attenuation. Ammonium acetate addition stimulated the development of strongly anaerobic conditions, as indicated by near-saturation methane concentrations. BTEX removal began within 8 months in the biostimulated source zone, but not in the natural attenuation control, where BTEX concentrations were still increasing (due to source dissolution) 2 years after the release. Phylogenetic analysis using quantitative PCR indicated an increase in concentration and relative abundance of Archaea (Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota), Geobacteraceae (Geobacter and Pelobacter spp.) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (Desulfovibrio, Desulfomicrobium, Desulfuromusa, and Desulfuromonas) in the biostimulated plot relative to the control. Apparently, biostimulation fortuitously enhanced the growth of putative anaerobic BTEX degraders and associated commensal microorganisms that consume acetate and H2, and enhance the thermodynamic feasibility of BTEX fermentation. This is the first field study to suggest that anaerobic-methanogenic biostimulation could enhance source zone bioremediation of groundwater aquifers impacted by biodiesel blends. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - We studied lipids and fatty acids (FA) in bottom sediments from four Siberian water bodies, Bugach, Lesnoi and Krasnoyarsk freshwater reservoirs and brackish Shira lake, that differed in physico-chemical and biological conditions. We considered the potential of the bottom sediments as a feedstock for biodiesel production and estimated properties of the obtained biodiesel as a fuel on the basis of FA composition. Contents of lipids and FA in the sediments moderately varied and were generally close to the reported data from lacustrine and estuarine systems. We confirmed that long-term eutrophication of a water body resulted in the lipid-rich bottom sediments that make them a feedstock for biodiesel production. Each of the studied water bodies had specific FA composition of sediments likely due to different organic matter sources and transformation processes. Despite these differences in FA profiles, calculated key parameters (cetane number, iodine number and heat of combustion) of biodiesel produced from all the studied sediments met the limits established by current biodiesel standards. Thus, the variation in the sediment FA composition due to environmental characteristics of a water body likely has no principal significance for fuel properties of the obtained biodiesel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Following up the rather sobering results of the biofuels boom in Tanzania, we analyze the preconditions that would make large-scale oil production from the feedstock Jatropha curcas viable. We do this by employing an economic land evaluation approach; first, we estimate the physical land suitability and the necessary inputs to reach certain amounts of yields. Subsequently, we estimate costs and benefits for different input-output levels. Finally, to incorporate the increased awareness of sustainability in the export sector, we introduce also certification criteria. Using data from an experimental farm in Kilosa, we find that high yields are crucial for the economic feasibility and that they can only be obtained on good soils at high input rates. Costs of compliance with certification criteria depend on site specific characteristics such as land suitability and precipitation. In general, both domestic production and (certified) exports are too expensive to be able to compete with conventional diesel/rapeseed oil from the EU. Even though the crop may have potential for large scale production as a niche product, there is still a lot of risk involved and more experimental research is needed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This analysis identifies the sensitivity of the fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing pathway to facility location. The economic feasibility of a 2000 metric ton per day fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing biorefinery is quantified based on 30 different state-specific facility locations within the United States. We calculate the 20-year internal rate of return (IRR) and net present value (NPV) for each location scenario as a function of state- and region-specific factors. This analysis demonstrates that biorefinery IRR and NPV are very sensitive to bio-oil yield, feedstock cost, location capital cost factor, and transportation fuel market value. The IRRs and NPVs generated for each scenario vary widely as a result, ranging from a low of 7.4% and -$79.5 million in Illinois to a high of 17.2% and $165.5 million in Georgia. The results indicate that the economic feasibility of the fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing pathway is strongly influenced by facility location within the United States. This result could have important implications for cellulosic biofuel commercialization under the revised Renewable Fuel Standard. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study sets preference for biofuels (corn- and cellulose-based ethanol) vs. gasoline within a three-dimensional social dilemma framework recognizing a social conflict (individual vs. collective interests), a temporal conflict (immediate vs. future interests) and a biospheric conflict (human vs. biospheric interests). Using this framework, values (egoistic, altruistic, and biospheric) and time orientation (concern with immediate, and concern with future consequences) are hypothesized to relate to preference for biofuels. To test these hypotheses, a panel of U.S. consumers completed a brief inventory of values, the consideration of future consequences-14 scale, and made a series of choices in fueling scenarios. Results revealed that values and CFC overlap, and that preference for biofuels was inversely related to egoistic values and consideration of immediate consequences and positively related to biospheric values and consideration of future consequences, supporting the three-dimensional social dilemma framework. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We conducted a test of a direct burning of crude Jatropha oil (CJO) and pitch in a commercial boiler system. The fuel, crude Jatropha oil is not biodiesel which comes from transesterification process of bio oil, but it is pure plant oil like cooking oil. The higher heating value (HHV) of the CJO is 39.3 MJ/kg (9380 kcal/kg) and is lower than that of commercial heating oil, 44.0 MJ/kg. The kinematic viscosity of CJO is 36.2 mm2/s at 40 °C and 8.0 mm2/s at 100 °C. The burner used in the test is a commercial burner for a commercial heating oil and its capacity is 140 kW (120,000 kcal/h).We did a preliminary test whether the combustion is stable or not. The preliminary test was a kind of open air combustion test using the commercial burner with crude Jatropha oil. We found that the combustion can be stable if the crude Jatropha oil temperature is higher than 90 °C. We measured the flue gas concentration by using a gas analyzer. The NOx concentration of crude Jatropha oil is 80 ∼ 100 ppm and CO concentration is nearly 0 ppm at flue gas O2 concentration of 2.5 and 4.5%. We also tested a pitch combustion and the result shows that the NOx concentration of pitch is about 90 ∼ 110 ppm and CO concentration is below 30 ppm at flue gas O2 concentration of 2.5 and 4.5%. As a reference data, combustion of heating oil was conducted. The NOx concentration of heating oil is about 80 ppm which is the lowest value of tested fuels. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As an alternative to conventional sulfide catalysts, NiMo carbide catalysts were prepared by impregnation method and studied for the hydrotreating of soybean oil to produce hydrocarbons in the gasoline to diesel range. The effect of the catalyst supports on activity and selectivity was investigated by using three different types of materials: mesoporous material (Al-SBA-15), alumina (γ-Al2O3) and zeolites (ZSM-5, Zeolite β and USY). The structural characterization of the catalysts was performed using XRD, BET and TEM. Catalytic tests were carried out in a bench scale flow reactor at 400 C and 650 psi. The results showed that the Al-SBA-15 supported catalyst has the highest surface area of 711.5 m2 g-1 and largest pore volume of 0.71 cm3 g-1. Among the five catalysts, hydrotreating on NiMoC/Al-SBA-15 gave the highest yield of organic liquid product (96%) and highest selectivity (97%) to hydrocarbons in the boiling range of the diesel fraction. For the three zeolite-supported catalysts, hydrotreating of soybean oil produced more hydrocarbon products in the boiling range of green gasoline (about 15-40%). © Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Traditional oil purification process has some drawbacks, such as high energy cost, high chemicals demand and the loss of neutral oil. In this study, for the first time, an alternative process was introduced, which combines microfiltration (MF) pretreatment for oil dewaxing and ultrafiltration (UF) purification process for phospholipid removal. More energy and chemicals can be saved by these processes without the loss of neutral oil. It was found that crude Jatropha oil after MF pretreatment shows a higher permeate flux than the degummed Jatropha oil does. After combining two-step membrane filtration process, the physical properties of crude Jatropha oil were greatly improved. The kinematic viscosity was decreased from 28 mm2/s to 25 mm 2/s, while carbon residue was also reduced from 5.5 wt% to 2.9 wt%. The newly developed two-step membrane filtration process in this study can be effectively applied for the purification of crude Jatropha oil used for biofuels. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In developing future fuels there is an opportunity to make use of advances in many fields of science and engineering to ensure that such fuels are sustainable in both production and utilization. One such advance is the use of synthetic biology to re-engineer photosynthetic micro-organisms such that they are able to produce novel hydrocarbons directly from CO2. Terpenes are a class of hydrocarbons that can be produced biologically and have potential as liquid transport fuels. This paper presents experimental studies on a compression ignition engine and spark ignition engine in which the combustion and emissions of 12 different terpenes that could potentially be produced by cyanobacteria were assessed as single components and blends with fossil diesel and fossil gasoline. The 12 terpenes were chosen to explore how small changes to the molecular structure of geraniol (a terpene most easily produced by cyanobacteria) impact on combustion and emissions. Furthermore, the toxicity of some of the best performing terpenes were assessed using the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (hereafter, Synechocystis) as a prelude to a metabolic engineering programme. The compression ignition engine tests were carried out at constant injection timing and constant ignition timing, and the spark ignition engine tests were conducted at a constant spark timing and a constant lambda value of 1. Of the terpenes tested in the compression ignition engine, geranial and farnesene were found to be the best performing single component fuels in terms of combustion and emissions. In blends with fossil diesel, the presence of geranial or farnesene did not have a significant effect on combustion phasing up to a terpene content of 20% (wt/wt), though levels of NOx and CO did increase. In the spark ignition engine experiments of terpene and fossil gasoline blends, citronellene and linalool were found to be soluble in fossil gasoline and combusted in a steady manner up to a terpene content of 45% and 65% (wt/wt) respectively. Of those terpenes with the most potential as either diesel or gasoline fuels, geraniol and geranial were found to be the most toxic to Synechocystis, with farnesene and linalool less toxic and citronellene having no detrimental effect. Addition of n-dodecane to the cultures was found to ameliorate the toxic effects of all five terpenes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) were produced from four different vegetable oils (sunflower, cotton seed, olive oil, and used frying oil) using calcium ethoxide as a heterogeneous solid base catalyst. The ester preparation involved a two-step transesterification reaction, followed by purification. The effects of the mass ratio of catalyst to oil, the molar ratio of ethanol to oil, and the reaction temperature were studied on conversion of sunflower oil to optimize the reaction conditions in both stages. The rest of the vegetable oils were converted to ethyl esters under optimum reaction parameters. The optimal conditions for first stage transterification were an ethanol/oil molar ratio of 12:1, catalyst amount (3.5%), and 80°C temperature, whereas the maximum yield of ethyl esters reached 80.5%. In the second stage, the yield of ethyl esters showed signs of improvement of 16% in relation with the one-stage transesterification, which was obtained under the following optimal conditions: catalyst concentration 0.75% and ethanol/oil molar ratio 6:1. Property analysis of prepared ethyl ester samples was done, in order to examine their quality parameters. The results obtained showed that the density, viscosity, and calorific value of the produced ethyl esters had values close to those of a no. 2 diesel. On the contrary, the cold filter plugging points were higher than the conventional diesel fuel. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The seed of Chinese Spicehush, containing 41.87% crude oil with 24.54% saturated acids and 75.32% unsaturated acids, could potentially be an alternative source of biodiesel. The problems of water pollution and the high purification cost of biodiesel can be avoided by using solid basic catalysts. The catalytic efficiency of CaMgZn oxide for the transesterification of Spicehush oil was evaluated. Catalysts were prepared via conventional co-precipitation methods and were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller equation. The catalyst with a Ca/Mg/Zn molar ratio of 2:1:7 exhibited excellent catalytic performance and possessed a unique mesoporous structure with a surface area of 51.35 m2g-1 and an average pore diameter of 11.6 nm. The calcination temperature largely affected the structural and catalytic properties of the catalyst. Under the optimal transesterification conditions at 65°C (catalyst amount of 5 wt.%, molar ratio of methanol to oil of 12, reaction time of 2 h), a high conversion ratio of 92.3% can be obtained. The biodiesel conversion rate did not exhibit a linear relationship with the amount of CaMgZn catalyst and reached maximum values at the catalyst amount of 5 wt.%. The CaMgZn solid basic catalysts could be applied as an alternative to traditional homogenous catalysts. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The chemical industry is one of the most important business sectors, not only economically, but also societally; as it allows humanity to attain higher standards and quality of life. Simultaneously, chemical products and processes can be the origin of potential human health and environmental issues, incurring economic costs, and raising social concerns. An alternative to addressing these challenges after the fact is the implementation and development of more sustainable products and processes. To guide decision-makers, designers, and stakeholders in developing more sustainable chemical processes, the sustainability evaluation and design tool Gauging Reaction Effectiveness for the Environmental Sustainability of Chemistries with a Multi-objective Process Evaluator (GREENSCOPE) has been proposed and developed. Two previous contributions presented a holistic set of sustainability indicators as well as their definition, a sustainability measurement scale, and data requirements. This contribution demonstrates the successful implementation and use of GREENSCOPE for a sustainability performance assessment. In this evaluation, the manufacture of biodiesel is undertaken as a case study to demonstrate and describe this achievement. Results from this study show the positive features of this process and identify opportunities for sustainability improvement in the areas of material and energy use, environmental impacts, and economics during the production of this important biofuel. Therefore, GREENSCOPE is proposed as a fundamental tool for evaluating and designing more sustainable chemical processes. © This article not subject to U.S. Copyright.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests that the size-resolved mixing state of carbon-containing particles is very critical in determining their optical properties, atmospheric lifetime, and impact on the environment. However, still little is known about the mixing state of particles in the urban area of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, China. To investigate the mixing state of submicron carbon-containing particles, measurements were carried out during spring and fall periods of 2010 using a single-particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS). Approximately 700 000 particles for each period were detected. This is the first report on the size-resolved mixing state of carbon-containing particles by direct observations in the PRD region. Cluster analysis of single-particle mass spectra was applied to identify carbon-containing particle classes. These classes represented -80% and -90% of all the detected particles for spring and fall periods, respectively. Carbon-containing particle classes mainly consisted of biomass/biofuel burning particles (Biomass), organic carbon (OC), fresh elemental carbon (EC-fresh), internally mixed OC and EC (ECOC), internally mixed EC with sulfate (EC-Sulfate), vanadium-containing ECOC (VECOC), and amines-containing particles (Amine). In spring, the top three ranked carbon-containing particle classes were ECOC (26.1 %), Biomass (23.6 %) and OC (10 %), respectively. However, the fraction of Biomass particles increased remarkably and predominated (61.0 %), while the fraction of ECOC (3.0 %) and V-ECOC (0.1 %) significantly decreased in fall. To highlight the influence of monsoon on the properties of carbon-containing particles in urban Guangzhou, their size distributions, mixing state, and aerosol acidity were compared between spring and fall seasons. In addition, a case study was also performed to investigate how the formation of fog and haze influenced the mixing state of carboncontaining particles. These results could improve our understanding of the mixing state of carbon-containing particles, and may also be helpful in modeling the climate forcing of aerosol in the PRD region. © Author(s) 2013.

AB  - Background: Succinic acid is one of the key platform chemicals which can be produced via biotechnology process instead of petrochemical process. Biomass derived bio-oil have been investigated intensively as an alternative of diesel and gasoline fuels. Bio-oil could be fractionized into organic phase and aqueous phase parts. The organic phase bio-oil can be easily upgraded to transport fuel. The aqueous phase bio-oil (AP-bio-oil) is of low value. There is no report for its usage or upgrading via biological methods. In this paper, the use of AP-bio-oil for the production of succinic acid was investigated. Results: The transgenic E. coli strain could grow in modified M9 medium containing 20 v/v% AP-bio-oil with an increase in OD from 0.25 to 1.09. And 0.38 g/L succinic acid was produced. With the presence of 4 g/L glucose in the medium, succinic acid concentration increased from 1.4 to 2.4 g/L by addition of 20 v/v% AP-bio-oil. When enzymatic hydrolysate of corn stover was used as carbon source, 10.3 g/L succinic acid was produced. The obtained succinic acid concentration increased to 11.5 g/L when 12.5 v/v% AP-bio-oil was added. However, it decreased to 8 g/L when 50 v/v% AP-bio-oil was added. GC-MS analysis revealed that some low molecular carbon compounds in the AP-bio-oil were utilized by E. coli. Conclusions: The results indicate that AP-bio-oil can be used by E. coli for cell growth and succinic acid production. © 2013 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Levulinic acid (LA) is considered as a renewable platform chemical and can be used for the synthesis of variety of important fuels and chemicals. In particular, its esterification with ethanol produces ethyl levulinate (EL) would be green process, as it can be used as diesel miscible biofuel (DMB), preventing global warming by decreasing atmospheric CO2. This study explores the use of modified H-ZSM-5 by desilication viz.; DH-ZSM-5 and dodecatungstophosphoric acid (DTPA) loaded on DH-ZSM-5 for esterification of LA with ethanol aiming to EL. Different degree of desilication of H-ZSM-5 was performed by using aq. NaOH (0.2-1.5 M) at 338 K for 30 min and then DTPA was loaded on these desilicated H-ZSM-5 (DH-ZSM-5) support. H-ZSM-5, DH-ZSM-5 and DTPA on these DH-ZSM-5 samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption, pyridine chemisorbed IR spectroscopy, Temperature Programmed Ammonia Desorption (TPAD). The increase in conversion of levulinic acid was observed from 28% to 94% with increase of DTPA loading from 0% to 15%. The increased LA conversion may be due to increase in total acidity from 43.14% to 84.31%. The use of DH-ZSM-5 as support for deposition of DTPA may be reported for the first time. The present work also extended to optimize process parameters such as DTPA loading on DH-ZSM-5, catalyst to LA ratio, LA to ethanol molar ratio, speed of agitation, particle size reaction temperature and catalyst reusability. Kinetic study based on pseudo-homogeneous (P-H) model is also presented. The experimental results follow second order kinetics. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biofuels have the potential to be sustainable, secure, low carbon footprint transportation fuels. Primarily due to government mandates, biofuels have become increasingly adopted as transportation fuels over the last decade and are projected to steadily increase in production. Here the prospects of biofuels are summarized in terms of several important performance measures, including: lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy return on investment (EROI), land and water requirements, and tailpipe emissions. A review of the literature leads to the conclusion that most first-generation biofuels, including corn ethanol and soybean biodiesel produced in the United States, reduce tailpipe pollutant emissions and GHG emissions-provided their feedstocks do not replace large quantities of fixed carbon. However, their production is perhaps unsustainable due to low EROI and significant land-use and water requirements. Second-generation biofuels; for example ethanol produced from lignocellulosic biomass, have the potential for larger reductions in GHG emissions and can provide sustainable EROI with reasonable land area usage; however, they require water inputs several orders-of-magnitude greater than required by petroleum fuels. Advanced biofuels from algal oils and synthetic biological processes are further from commercial reality and require more assessment but potentially offer better performance due to their orders-of-magnitude greater yields per land area and lower water requirements; at present, the energy costs of such biofuels are uncertain. © 2013 by ASME.

AB  - A prototype capable of generating underwater high-voltage discharges (3.5 kV) coupled with water plasma expansion was constructed. The level of phytomass disintegration caused by transmission of the pressure shockwaves (50-60 MPa) followed by this expansion was analyzed using gas adsorption techniques. The dynamics of the external surface area and the micropore volume on multiple pretreatment stages of maize silage and sunflower seeds was approximated with robust analytical techniques. The multiple increases on the reaction surface were manifest in up to a 15% increase in cumulative methane production, which was itself manifest in the overall acceleration of the anaerobic fermentation process. Disintegration of the sunflower seeds allowed up to 45% higher oil yields using the same operating pressure. Copyright © IWA Publishing 2013 Water Science and Technology.

AB  - In this paper, we have studied the aqueous-phase hydrodeoxygenation of sorbitol over two fundamentally different types of bifunctional catalysts: Pt/Zr-P and PtReOx/C in a continuous flow reactor. During the reaction, the Pt/Zr-P catalyst undergoes phase transformations of amorphous into crystalline Zr-P having a rhombohedral framework along with a 97% loss of surface area, 86% loss of Pt surface sites, and 95% loss of surface acid sites. PtReOx/C has a higher hydrothermal stability than that of Pt/Zr-P and only lost 17% of its surface area during the reaction. The number of Pt surface sites increased by a factor of 3.5 for the PtReOx/C catalyst after reaction. Products were classified into three major categories: (1) light gases, (2) gasoline-range products, and (3) aqueous-phase products. The light gases included CO2 and C1C4 alkanes. The gasoline-range products included C5C6 alkanes, C2C6 alcohols, tetrahydrofurans, tetrahydropyrans, and small amounts of C2C6 aldehydes, ketones, and organic acids. The aqueous-phase products included isosorbide, mannitol, sorbitan, hexanetriol, C2C6 diols, glycerol, and methanol. The gasoline-range yield of each catalyst was 66.8% and 44.4% for the Pt/Zr-P and PtReOx/C catalysts, respectively. The PtReOx/C catalyst had a 34 times higher reaction rates than Pt/Zr-P on a Pt mass basis. However, the turnover frequency of both catalysts was similar based on the number of surface Pt sites measured after reaction. The acid sites on the PtReOx catalyst are able to isomerize sorbitol into mannitol, whereas no mannitol was observed with the Pt/Zr-P catalyst. Mannitol had a lower rate of coke formation than sorbitol for APHDO on the Pt/Zr-P catalyst. The PtReOx/C had a higher selectivity toward secondary alcohols than Pt/Zr-P which produced all primary alcohols. The PtReO x/C had a higher CO2 selectivity than Pt/Zr-P, suggesting the PtReOx/C has a higher rate of decarbonylation than Pt/Zr-P. Pt/Zr-P had a higher rate of CO bond cleavage than PtReOx/C, leading to higher C6 product selectivity (35.8% vs. 11.6%). © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bio-oils produced from small-scale pyrolysis may have economic and environmental benefits for both densifying agricultural biomass and supplying local bioenergy markets with fossil energy alternatives to support state policies (e.g., Renewable Portfolio Standards). We analyze the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG), energy, and cost tradeoffs for farm-scale bio-oil production via fast pyrolysis of corn stover feedstock and subsequent utilization for power generation in the state of Pennsylvania. We evaluate the life cycle ramifications of either cofiring the biochar coproduct with coal in existing power plants for energy generation, or using the biochar as a land amendment within the agricultural sector. The results show GHG emissions of 217 and 84 g CO2e per kWh of bio-oil electricity for coal cofiring and land amendment, respectively. Cofiring biochar with coal displaces more fossil energy than does land application. We discuss the potential for bio-oil and biochar penetrating near-term electricity markets (c. 2015). Our analysis shows that the electricity produced from burning pyrolysis oil and biochar with variable operating costs of $93/MWh and $18/MWh, respectively, are competitive with the fuel oil and coal electricity markets in Pennsylvania within the vicinity of the agricultural sites supplying biomass in spite of the potentially higher NOx emissions due to nitrogen present in the fuel. Small scale pyrolysis bio-oil may be an economically viable and environmentally sustainable near-term option for peak power production and for meeting the state's Renewable Portfolio Standards. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Recently, the steam reforming of biofuels has been presented as a potential hydrogen source for fuel cells. Because this scenario represents an interesting opportunity for Colombia (South America), which produces large amounts of bioethanol, the steam reforming of ethanol was studied over a bimetallic RhPt/La2O3 catalyst under bulk mass transfer conditions. The effect of temperature and the initial concentrations of ethanol and water were evaluated at space velocities above 55,000 h-1 to determine the conditions that maximize the H2/CO ratio and reduce CH4 production while maintaining 100% conversion of ethanol. These requirements were accomplished when 21 mol% H2O and 3 mol% C2H 5OH (steam/ethanol molar ratio = 7) were reacted at 600 °C. The catalyst stability was assessed under these reaction conditions during 120 h on stream, obtaining ethanol conversions above 99% during the entire test. The effect of both H2 and air flows as catalyst regeneration treatments were evaluated after 44 and 67 h on stream, respectively. The results showed that H2 treatment accelerated catalyst deactivation, and air regeneration increased both the catalyst stability and the H2 selectivity while decreasing CH4 generation. Fresh and spent catalyst samples were characterized by TEM/EDX, XPS, TPR, and TGA. Although the Rh and Pt in the fresh catalyst were completely reduced, the spent samples showed a partial oxidation of Rh and small amounts of carbonaceous residue. A possible Rh-Pt-Rh2O3 structure was proposed as the active site on the catalyst, which was regenerated by air treatment. Copyright © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - Background: Cyanobacteria can utilize solar energy and convert carbon dioxide into biofuel molecules in one single biological system. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is a model cyanobacterium for basic and applied research. Alkanes are the major constituents of gasoline, diesel and jet fuels. A two-step alkane biosynthetic pathway was identified in cyanobacteria recently. It opens a door to achieve photosynthetic production of alka(e)nes with high efficiency by genetically engineering cyanobacteria. Results: A series of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 mutant strains have been constructed and confirmed. Overexpression of both acyl-acyl carrier protein reductase and aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase from several cyanobacteria strains led to a doubled alka(e)ne production. Redirecting the carbon flux to acyl- ACP can provide larger precursor pool for further conversion to alka(e)nes. In combination with the overexpression of alkane biosynthetic genes, alka(e)ne production was significantly improved in these engineered strains. Alka(e)ne content in a Synechocystis mutant harboring alkane biosynthetic genes over-expressed in both slr0168 and slr1556 gene loci (LX56) was 1.3% of cell dry weight, which was enhanced by 8.3 times compared with wildtype strain (0.14% of cell dry weight) cultivated in shake flasks. Both LX56 mutant and the wildtype strain were cultivated in column photo-bioreactors, and the alka(e)ne production in LX56 mutant was 26 mg/L (1.1% of cell dry weight), which was enhanced by 8 times compared with wildtype strain (0.13% of cell dry weight). Conclusions: The extent of alka(e)ne production could correlate positively with the expression level of alkane biosynthetic genes. Redirecting the carbon flux to acyl-ACP and overexpressing alkane biosynthetic genes simultaneously can enhance alka(e)ne production in cyanobacteria effectively. © 2013 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - A key advantage of using microalgae for biofuel production is the ability of some algal strains to thrive in waters unsuitable for conventional crop irrigation such as saline groundwater or seawater. Nonetheless, the availability of sustainable water supplies will provide significant challenges for scale-up and development of algal biofuels. We conduct a partial techno-economic assessment based on the availability of freshwater, saline groundwater, and seawater for use in open pond algae cultivation systems. We explore water issues through GIS-based models of algae biofuel production, freshwater supply (constrained to less than 5% of mean annual flow per watershed) and costs, and cost-distance models for supplying seawater and saline groundwater. We estimate that, combined, these resources can support 9.46 × 107 m 3 yr-1 (25 billion gallons yr-1) of renewable biodiesel production in the coterminous United States. Achievement of larger targets requires the utilization of less water efficient sites and relatively expensive saline waters. Despite the addition of freshwater supply constraints and saline water resources, the geographic conclusions are similar to our previous results. Freshwater availability and saline water delivery costs are most favorable for the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and Florida peninsula, where evaporation relative to precipitation is moderate. As a whole, the barren and scrub lands of the southwestern U.S. have limited freshwater supplies, and large net evaporation rates greatly increase the cost of saline alternatives due to the added makeup water required to maintain pond salinity. However, this and similar analyses are particularly sensitive to knowledge gaps in algae growth/lipid production performance and the proportion of freshwater resources available, key topics for future investigation. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The aerobic biodegradation kinetics and mineralization of six petrodiesel/soybean-biodiesel blends (B0, B20, B40, B60, B80, and B100), where B100 is 100% biodiesel, were investigated by acclimated cultures. The fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) of biodiesel were found to undergo rapid abiotic transformation in all experiments. The C10-C21 n-alkanes of petrodiesel were metabolized at significantly higher microbial utilization rates in the presence of biodiesel. The rates of mineralization of the blends were also enhanced in the presence of biodiesel; yet a similar enhancement in the extent of mineralization was not observed. Abiotic fuel-blends/aqueous-phase equilibration experiments revealed that the FAMEs of biodiesel were capable of cosolubilizing the n-alkanes of petrodiesel, a mechanism that fully explains the faster utilization and mineralization kinetics of petrodiesel in the presence of biodiesel without necessarily enhancing the extent of biomineralization. The biodegradation of six targeted aromatic compounds present in petrodiesel was also influenced by the amount of biodiesel in a blend. While toluene, o-xylene, and tetralin were not degraded in the B0 and B20 treatments, all of the targeted aromatic compounds were degraded to below detection limits in the B40 and B80 treatments. Biomass acclimated to B60, however, was unable to degrade most of the aromatic compounds. These results indicate that the amount of biodiesel in a blend significantly affects the absolute and relative abundance of the dissolved and bioavailable constituents of biodiesel and petrodiesel in a way that can considerably alter the biodegrading capacity of microbial cultures. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The main objective of the paper is to present the results of the computational fluid dynamics simulation of a direct injection single cylinder engine using diesel, biodiesel, or different mixture proportions of diesel and biodiesel and compare the results to a test bed measurement in the same functioning point. The engine used for verifying the results of the simulation is a single cylinder research engine from AVL with an open engine control unit, so that the injection timings and quantities can be controlled and analyzed. In Romania, until the year 2020 all the fuel stations are obliged to have mixtures of at least 10% biodiesel in diesel. The main advantages using mixtures of biofuels in diesel are: the fact that biodiesel is not harmful to the environment; in order to use biodiesel in your engine no modifications are required; the price of biodiesel is smaller than diesel and also if we compare biodiesel production to the classic petroleum based diesel production, it is more energy efficient; biodiesel assures more lubrication to the engine so the life of the engine is increased; biodiesel is a sustainable fuel; using biodiesel helps maintain the environment and it keeps the people more healthy.

AB  - Electrical consumption in a household is not stable but changeable in one day throughout a whole year. The consumption depends on weather, seasons and users. This characteristic of demand makes it difficult to design and build a distributed power generation system to meet the demand for a household. For this reason, a stand-alone distributed power generation system (DPGS) needs to be carefully designed not only to meet the dynamic household electricity demand, but also to be economical. Hence, for a DPGS, it is essential to utilise electrical energy storage (EES) unit to store the excessive energy while power generation is running at off-peak time; and then the EES may supply the stored energy during the peak demand period. This study investigates a distributed power generation system with an electric energy storage unit to meet the dynamic electricity demand in a household. The system composes of one diesel-engine-generator (DG) running with biofuel; a fuel cell; integrated with an energy storage unit including a supercapacitor and a group of batteries. Models have been set up in Dymola software and two different system configurations are proposed and simulated. The characteristics of the integrated DPGS-EES system are presented and discussed. The results show that both configurations are working properly to meet the demand. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The study was carried out to utilize waste frying oil for biodiesel production because it is cheap, easily available and renewable raw material. The used frying oil was analyzed for water contents (0.43 %), iodine value (52), sponification value (205), free fatty acids (8.7 %) and acid value (0.8 mg KOH/g). Esterification and transesterification were conducted to convert free fatty acids and triglycerides to methyl ester (biodiesel), respectively. One-step and two-step transeterification reactions were carried out to measure the efficiency of these processes for biodiesel production. The biodiesel produced from used frying oil was examined for flash point (185 °C), kinematic viscosity (4.86 mm2/s) and specific gravity (0.884 g/mL) that were meeting the limits of ASTM and Thai standards. Hence, it was proved to be a useful technique for biodiesel production at commercial scale.

AB  - The preparation of biofuel by pyrolysis of plant matter in a flow system using coarse sand and rounded rocks as the carrier was carried out in a new type of continuous reactor with a twin screw, in which the process is carried out at a controlled temperature (400-500 °C). The pyrolysis of cogon grass (Imperata cylindrica) was studied as a means for obtaining biofuel. The chemical composition of the resultant product was also investigated. The feeding rate was 2 kg/h and the screw rotational rate was 150 rpm. The use of this raw material provided for a moderate yield of biofuel (42.5 mass %), containing 21.78% phenols, 14.48% 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, 3.83% 2-methoxyphenoyl, 3.23% 3-methylphenol, 3.87% 2-methylphenol, and 3.12% 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol as well as various alcohols and ketones. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Diesel fuel has a limited resource, and concerns over environmental pollution are leading to the use of 'bio-origin fuels' as they are renewable and environmentally benign. Palm oil methyl ester, an esterified biofuel, has an excellent cetane number and a reasonable calorific value. Besides, palm oil methyl ester (C18.07H34.93O2) has around 11.25% of oxygen bonded in its molecular structure which increases its burning intensely. Thus, it closely resembles the behavior of diesel. However, being a fuel of different origin, the standard design limits of a diesel engine is not suitable for palm oil methyl ester. Therefore, in this work, a set of design and operational parameters are studied to find out the optimum performance of a palm oil methyl ester run diesel engine. The parameters varied are the compression ratio (CR) and injection timing (IT) along with load in a variable compression ratio diesel engine. The palm oil methyl ester run engine is investigated for its performance, combustion and emission characteristics. The combination of CR=18 and IT=20°BTDC improves the efficiency by 8% and cuts the exhaust gas temperature by 5%. Moreover, the palm oil methyl ester run engine lowers the ignition delay which further gets reduced by 7% and 12% with CR augmentation and IT retardation, respectively. The increase in CR trims down carbon monoxide by 40%, nitrogen oxides by 46% and hydrocarbon by 40%; however, it increases carbon dioxide emission by 19%. The IT retardation reduces the carbon dioxide emission by 16%. © IMechE 2013.

AB  - Toxicity of engine out emissions from primary and secondary aerosols has been a major cause of concern for human health and environmental impact. This study aims to evaluate comparative toxicity of nanoparticles emitted from a modern common rail direct injection engine (CRDI) fuelled with biodiesel blend (B20) vis-à-vis mineral diesel. The toxicity and potential health hazards of exhaust particles were assessed using various parameters such as nanoparticle size and number distribution, surface area distribution, elemental and organic carbon content and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons adsorbed onto the particle surfaces, followed by toxic equivalent factor assessment. It was found that biodiesel particulate toxicity was considerably lower in comparison to mineral diesel. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - Bio oil, produced by a fast pyrolysis of biomass, seems to be promising as the alternative to fossil fuel. However, bio oil has some undesired properties for fuel applications: high acidity, corrosiveness, low octane value, thermal instability, etc. These properties restrict its direct use for transportation, and require upgrading technology by reducing the oxygen content before use. Regarding to the complicated composition of bio oil, it is difficult to identify the reaction mechanism. Therefore, a model compound is widely used in bio oil upgrading research. Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) experiments were performed in a quartz fluidized bed for a bio-oil model compound (acetol, ethyl acetate, guaiacol) over a HZSM-5 molecular sieve catalyst at 550°C, aiming to study the cracking characteristics of model compounds and the reaction mechanism as well as catalyst deactivation properties. The FCC facility mainly consisted of a gas-supplying unit, a pre-heater, a fluidized bed reactor with an inner diameter of 4cm and a height of 50 cm, a two-step condenser, an accumulative flowmeter and a gas-collecting unit. Gas products were quantified by GC 9800, liquid products quantified and qualified by Agilent 7890/5973-GC/MS, coke deposition detected by TG-DSC (Netsch STA409PC). The liquid products of acetol cracking are composed of aromatics, phenols (&lt;5%), and hydrocarbons, while oxygen is released in the form of CO, CO2, H2O. The liquid product of ethyl acetate cracking is mainly aromatics (&gt;65%), oxygenated chemicals were less than 7%, and olefin content in the gas products is higher than 60%, which shows that the HZSM-5 has good selectivity of aromatics and olefins and has good deoxygenation properties. The liquid products of guaiacol are phenols (~50%), aromatics (~25%) and oxygenated chemicals (&lt;10%), which proves the stable structure of phenol. The catalytic liquid product of a model compound without aromatic rings contains mainly aromatics and a low content of oxygenated chemicals. The catalytic gaseous products for acetol and ethyl acetate are mainly CO and olefin, respectively. The main catalytic product of phenols are phenolic compounds, followed by aromatics, which means phenols have relatively stable structures, while the olefin gaseous products are around 30%. The coke deposition rate is acetol &gt; guaiacol &gt; ethyl acetate. According to the catalytic cracking products distribution, the catalytic reaction pathways is speculated to illustrate that deoxygenation and cyclodehydration take place over a bio-oil catalytic cracking reaction, and show a good selectivity of aromatics and olefins, which provides a theoretical basis for the bio-oil catalytic cracking mechanism study.

AB  - Monoglycerides represent a reaction residue in renewable biodiesel fuel. Among the possible glyceridic forms they are poorly soluble and have high melting point. For this reason during the in field use of biodiesel neat or in blend with diesel, monoglycerides can cause problems as regards to the cold stability of the fuel and the plugging of filters. The problem of quantitatively evaluating the monoglycerides content in biodiesel has been addressed and solved during the last 20 years, generally by means of GC. Recently the need for a strong reduction of total and saturated monoglycerides content appeared. In parallel with the technology changes new analytical methods have to be developed, in order to fulfill the requirement of accuracy and precision at low concentration levels. The technique presented here allows the determination of total monoglycerides content and the separate quantification of glycerol monopalmitate and stearate. The proposed method is based on acetylation of hydroxy groups of the sample, followed by micro column solid phase separation, isolation of polar fraction containing all acetylated glycerides, and GC quantification with internal standard. By using this technique a low noise GC path is obtained thus allowing the identification and the quantification of peaks. Our results are discussed in comparison to those obtained with the existing standards and demonstrated a good repeatability even at low concentration levels. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - This research is an in-depth environmental analysis of potential alternative fuel technologies for waste collection vehicles. Life-cycle emissions, cost, fuel and energy consumption were evaluated for a wide range of fossil and bio-fuel technologies. Emission factors were calculated for a typical waste collection driving cycle as well as constant speed. In brief, natural gas waste collection vehicles (compressed and liquid) fueled with North-American natural gas had 6-10% higher well-to-wheel (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions relative to diesel-fueled vehicles; however the pump-to-wheel (PTW) GHG emissions of natural gas waste collection vehicles averaged 6% less than diesel-fueled vehicles. Landfill gas had about 80% lower WTW GHG emissions relative to diesel. Biodiesel waste collection vehicles had between 12% and 75% lower WTW GHG emissions relative to diesel depending on the fuel source and the blend. In 2011, natural gas waste collection vehicles had the lowest fuel cost per collection vehicle kilometer travel. Finally, the actual driving cycle of waste collection vehicles consists of repetitive stops and starts during waste collection; this generates more emissions than constant speed driving. © 2013 .

AB  - The investigation of lubricated friction and wear is an extended study. This paper outlines the tribological characteristics of Jatropha oil (JO) contaminated bio-lubricant by using Cygnus wear and Four-ball tribo testing machines. To formulate the bio-lubricants, 10-50% by volume of Jatropha oil were blended with the base lubricant SAE 40. Experimental results showed that the lubrication regime that occurred during the test was boundary lubrication while the main wear mechanisms were abrasive and the adhesive wear. During Cygnus wear testing, the lowest wear was found with the addition of 10% JO, and above 20% contamination, the wear rate was increased considerably. The addition of Jatropha oil in the base lubricant acted as a very good lubricant additive which reduced the friction and wear scar diameter of maximum 34% and 29%, respectively during the tribo test. The application of 10% bio-lubricant in the automotive engine will enhance the mechanical efficiency and take part to reduce the dependency on petroleum oil as well. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The superstructure optimization of algae-based hydrocarbon biorefinery with sequestration of CO2 from power plant flue gas is proposed. The major processing steps include carbon capture, algae growth, dewatering, lipid extraction and power generation, and algal biorefinery. We propose a multiobjective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model that simultaneously maximizes the net present value (NPV) and minimizes the global warming potential (GWP) subject to technology selection constraints, mass balance constraints, energy balance constraints, technoeconomic analysis constraints, and environmental impact constraints. The model simultaneously determines the optimal decisions that include production capacity, size of each processing unit, mass flow rates at each stage of the process, utility consumption, economic, and environmental performances. We propose a two-stage heuristic solution algorithm to solve the nonconvex MINLP model. Finally, the bicriteria optimization problem is solved with ε-constraint method, and the resulting Pareto-optimal curve reveals the trade-off between the economic and environmental criteria. The results show that for maximum NPV, the optimal process design uses direct flue gas, a tubular photobioreactor for algae growth, a filtration dewatering unit, and a hydroprocessing pathway leading to 47.1 MM gallons of green diesel production per year at $6.33/gal corresponding to GWP of 108.7 kg CO2-eq per gallon. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Over recent decades, direct injection diesel engines have become the propulsion systems most commonly used in automotive vehicles in Europe. Their leading position in the European market is due to improvements in performance, driveability and their capacity for facing the increasingly restrictive standards to which are subject. Nevertheless, their main drawbacks are related to the emission levels, the use of fossil fuels and the engine noise. To mitigate the first two problems, alternative fuels are being used in these engines with encouraging results. The impact of these fuels on engine noise might therefore be analyzed in order to evaluate the feasibility of such a solution. In this work the effect of diverse alternative fuels on emissions, performance and engine noise quality was analyzed. Compared with standard diesel fuel, results show a scarce variation of combustion noise quality whereas soot level decreases, NOx emissions increase and specific consumption deteriorates. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The feasibility of biodiesel production from soapnut (Sapindus mukorossi) oil was investigated with respect to the fuel properties and its blending properties with diesel. Soapnut oil methyl esters (SNME) had satisfactory fuel properties, and the predominant components were methyl oleate at 55.2 wt.% and methyl eicosenoate at 23.9 wt.%. The SNME had the cetane number of 58, cold filter plugging point of 6 °C, flash point of 177 °C, iodine value of 83.6 g I2/100 g, and kinematic viscosity of 4.88 mm2/s at 40 °C. In addition, the oxidation stability of the SNME satisfied the requirements of the biodiesel specifications. Furthermore, the SNME was blended with diesel at various volumetric percentages and evaluated for fuel properties in comparison with the relevant specifications. The linear correlations were established to describe the variations of the properties of the SNME-diesel blends with the volumetric percentage of the SNME. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels, such as biohydrogen, biomethanol, bioethanol and biodiesel may be the future of energy for transportation. The methanol can be used directly for powering Otto engines or fuel cells; it is commonly used in biodiesel production for its reactivity. Biohydrogen is a replacement for fossil and biorenewable liquid fuels. Based on a mechanism composed by 20 reversible elementary reactions among 8 reactive species, we propose a reduction process to obtain the mechanism of hydrogen, and from 129 reversible elementary reactions among 23 reactive species, we obtain a reduced mechanism for the methanol. Therefore, the aim of this work is the development of an algorithm consisting of 7 steps, which eliminates the fastest reactions of the reaction mechanism since the slowest reactions are rate-determining. The main advantage of the strategy is the decrease of the work needed to solve the system of chemical equations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of mechanical pressing to extract oil from jatropha seeds using a twin-screw extruder. Experiments were conducted using a co-rotating (Clextral BC 21, France) twin-screw extruder. The influence of operating conditions on oil yield, specific mechanical energy and oil quality was examined. Operating conditions included screw configuration, pressing temperature and screw rotation speed.Generally, it was the screw configuration, or profile, that most affected oil extraction efficiency. The best oil yields, a minimum 57.5%, were obtained with a trituration zone composed of 10 monolobe and 10 bilobe paddles, and a pressing zone composed of 50mm long, reverse pitch screws with a -33mm pitch. In addition, oil extraction yield increased with decreasing temperature and screw rotation speed. Highest oil extraction yield (70.6%) with good press cake quality (residual oil content lower than 8%) was obtained under operating conditions of 153rpm screw rotation speed, 5.16kg/h inlet flow rate of jatropha seeds, and 80°C pressing temperature. The corresponding expressed oil was inexpensive to produce (71Wh/kg seed processed or 314Wh/kg expressed oil for specific mechanical energy) compared with another continuous technique, i.e. the single expeller press, commonly used for mechanical extraction of jatropha oil. Its quality was also satisfactory for biodiesel production. The acid value, the density and the kinematic viscosity were 5.4mg of KOH/g of oil, 915kg/m3 and 36.7×10-6m2/s, respectively. © 2013 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - The Brazilian biodiesel program has created great demand for biodiesel. The production of oleaginous derived biodiesel produced by small-scale farmers is a key objective of PNPB. The Social Fuel Seal is one of the instruments for achieving this goal. Five years after the mandatory implementation of program, Brazil is among the world's leading producers of biodiesel. However, the goal of the productive insertion of small-scale farmers in Brazil's less favored regions has not been fully achieved. The Brazilian government has faced difficulties to promote regional development based on PNPB, consequently not reaching the audacious goals that were set at the beginning of the program. In this context of difficulties, the productive arrangements with palm oil should be emphasized. This paper submits in detail the model developed by Agropalma - in partnership with public agencies - together with family farming in the North of the country. These social projects are taken as reference and can promote social inclusion in the country's national biodiesel productive chain. Moreover, this case can serve as an assessment tool for other countries that seek to invest in the production of biodiesel with the concern for the social production inclusion of disadvantaged small-scale family farmers. © 2012.

AB  - This research examines the economic implications of different designs for a national low carbon fuel standard (NLCFS) for the road transportation sector. A NLCFS based on the average Carbon Intensity (CI) of all fuels sold generates an incentive for fuel suppliers to reduce the measured CI of their fuels. The economic impacts are determined by the availability of low carbon fuels, estimates of which can vary widely. Also important are the compliance path, reference level CI, and the design of the credit system, particularly the opportunities for trading and banking. To quantitatively examine the implications of a NLCFS, we created the Transportation Regulation and Credit Trading (TRACT) Model. With TRACT, we model a NLCFS credit trading system among profit maximizing fuel suppliers for light- and heavy-duty vehicle fuel use for the United States from 2012 to 2030. We find that credit trading across gasoline and diesel fuel markets can lower the average costs of carbon reductions by an insignificant amount to 98% depending on forecasts of biofuel supplies and carbon intensities. Adding banking of credits on top of trading can further lower the average cost of carbon reductions by 5%-9% and greatly reduce year-to-year fluctuations in credit prices. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The use of biofuels can increase land competition, leading to global land use change (LUC). LUC poses risks such as increased greenhouse gas emissions and food prices. The magnitude of the risk is uncertain, but could be significant. Given these uncertainties and risks, we suggest that policymakers pursue a mix of the following three strategies: (1) promote feedstocks that rely less on land; (2) reduce LUC risk for land-using feedstocks; and (3) stimulate investments that increase land productivity and environmental protection. To realize these three strategies, we recommend that policymakers distinguish among feedstocks based on LUC risk; explore certifying production that avoids land competition; and adopt policy mechanisms that encourage investments in LUC-prone areas. We favor including feedstock-specific LUC emissions estimates in policies despite relatively large scientific uncertainty. While misleadingly precise, point estimates can be selected from science-based ranges to directly link LUC policy to emissions and provide strong transparent signals to biofuel investors. LUC emissions estimates can be updated regularly (~3-5 years) to reflect improvements in scientific understanding, and global changes in policy and economic environments. With or without LUC emissions point estimates, additional policies, some outside the biofuel sector, will be needed to pursue the three strategies above. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may have adverse effects on urban air quality and human exposure to harmful pollutants. The use of bioethanol fuelled vehicles is increasing worldwide and may create new undesired pollution effects. Different measurement campaigns were performed in a pilot study to contribute to the understanding of the consequences associated with the use of bioethanol blended fuel (E95) on a series of pollutants. Ambient screening measurements of NO2, O3, acetic acid, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were performed at different urban locations, exposed and not exposed to the circulation of bioethanol buses. In addition, volatile organic compounds were measured at the exhaust pipe of a bioethanol fuelled bus, both under idling conditions (carbonyls; DNPH cartridge) and under on-road driving conditions applying online monitoring (PTR-TOF). Higher ambient acetaldehyde values were measured at locations exposed to bioethanol fuelled buses than at locations not exposed, and very high acetaldehyde and acetic acid values were measured from the exhaust pipe during driving conditions (acetaldehyde&gt;150ppm; acetic acid≈20-30ppm) and modelled at close distance to the bioethanol bus. Human exposure to high concentration of acetaldehyde is expected, and it may involve a significantly increased chance in developing cancer. The high concentration of acetic acid will involve odour annoyance and significant material degradation or corrosion. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The question of whether or not biofuels help mitigate climate change has attracted much debate in the literature. Using a global computable general equilibrium model that explicitly represents land-use change impacts due to the expansion of biofuels, our study attempts to shed some light on this question. Our study shows that if biofuel mandates and targets currently announced by more than 40 countries around the world are implemented by 2020 using crop feedstocks and if both forests and pasture lands are used to meet the new land demands for biofuel expansion, this would cause net release of GHG emissions to the atmosphere until 2043 as the GHG emissions released through land-use change exceeds the reduction of emissions due to replacement of gasoline and diesel. On the other hand, if the use of forest lands is avoided by channeling only pasture lands to meet the demand for new lands, the net release of GHG emissions would cease by 2021, a year after the full implementation of the mandates and targets. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - In the medium to long term, low fossil fuel availability will make it necessary to find alternatives. Mass production of biofuels will not be a practical solution because it requires strong competition for land that is used for growing food. Therefore, it will be necessary to revise the frame of transportation energy sources. The number of pure light- and heavy-duty electric vehicles could increase in urban areas. Instead, it will be hard to find a viable alternative to the internal combustion engine for extra-urban transport vehicles, therefore alternative synthetic fuels could be used to compensate for fossil fuel depletion. Aside from a small share obtainable from biomass, most synthetic fuels are expected to be obtained from coal. Among these, synthetic natural gas represents a very good solution. In fact, synthetic natural gas will be advantageous with respect to hydrogen, whose on-board storage will be an unsolved problem in the medium term, and with respect to synthetic liquid fuels, which require more energy in the production phase. Moreover, the carbon content of liquid fuels, which is higher than that of gaseous fuels, will be responsible for higher CO2 emissions from vehicles. Currently, natural gas has poor diffusion in the transport sector, and this paper highlights the motivations for favouring a policy aimed at increasing the share of gaseous fuel-powered vehicles. In addition to the low environmental impact, synthetic natural gas also offers the possibility of optimising the utilisation of future resources. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Renewable Fuel Standard aims to increase the production of biofuels to improve energy efficiency and decrease carbon dioxide emissions in the US. The effectiveness of this regulation is being debated by the scientific community regarding carbon emissions from direct and indirect land-use change. A valid alternative may be to design policies that stimulate sustainable land use in biofuel production. This article develops a model that simulates a voluntary program to increase the land use efficiency in production of biofuels. This stochastic dynamic model optimizes the sustainability of biofuels producible by including climate information and participatory decisions on land use. The model is parameterized using the Maximum Entropy econometric technique to present a simulation of the program in the State of Alabama. The results of this simulation show that participatory decisions on land-use may increase the net energy value of produced biofuel up to 215.68% and reduce the carbon emissions by 19.67% towards the state energy goals. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper proposes a multiobjective, mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for the superstructure optimization of hydrocarbon biorefineries via gasification pathway under economic and environmental criteria. The proposed hydrocarbon biorefinery superstructure includes a number of major processing stages, such as drying of the cellulosic biomass feedstocks, air separation unit, gasification, syngas conditioning, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, hydroprocessing, power generation, and the diesel and gasoline production. The superstructure considers alternatives of technologies and equipment, such as gasification technologies, cooling options, hydrogen production sources, and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis catalysts. The economic objective is measured by the net present value (NPV), and the environmental concern is measured using global warming potential (GWP) that follows the life cycle assessment procedures, which evaluates the gate-to-gate environmental impacts of hydrocarbon biofuels. The multiobjective MINLP model simultaneously determines the technology selection, operation conditions, flow rate of each stream, energy consumption of each unit, economic performance, environmental impacts, and equipment sizes. The multiobjective MINLP problem is solved with the e{open}-constraint method. The resulting Pareto-optimal curve reveals the trade-off between the economic and environmental performances. The optimal solution reveals that the high-temperature gasification, direct cooling, internal hydrogen production and cobalt catalysis have the best environmental and economic performances. At the breakeven point, where the optimal NPV is 0, the unit production cost of hydrocarbon biorefinery is $4.43 per gasoline-equivalent gallon (GEG) with unit GWP of 20.92kg CO2 eqv./GEG. In the case of maximum NPV of $810 MM, the corresponding unit production cost is $3.17/GEG. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel, which is derived from oil/fat by transesterification with alcohol, has attracted considerable attention over the past decades due to its ability to subsidise fossil fuel derived energy as a renewable and carbon neutral fuel. Several approaches for biodiesel fuel production have been developed, among which transesterification using a catalyst gives high yields of methyl ester. This method has therefore been widely utilized for biodiesel production in a number of countries. In this study, a Downflow Liquid Contactor Reactor (DLCR) has been used for the liquid-liquid transesterification reaction of sunflower oil with alcohol with extraordinary results. The reactor provides great potential for chemical reactions, which are normally limited by mass transfer and possesses a number of distinctive advantages over conventional multiphase reactors. Inside the reactor a high velocity liquid jet stream is produced which generates powerful shear and energy, causing vigorous agitation in the upper part of the reactor. The high mixing intensity in the DLCR enabled the manufacture of biodiesel to European Standard EN14214 (ester content 96.5%) in 2.5 min at 40 °C with 0.43 wt.% alkali catalyst and alcohol to oil molar ratio of 4.5 to 1.0. The separation of FAME from glycerol is done by gravity settling only without water washing. The effect of the alcohol type (methanol, ethanol) on biodiesel yield was also investigated. The process offers the advantage of continuous large scale production with limited reactor volume. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biorefinery approach is introduced for the biodiesel production by utilizing low cost raw material, such as rice bran oil (RBO). The valorization of RBO was carried out by homogeneous transesterification process using response surface methodology (RSM) based on a two-variable central composition design (CCD). The process variables, temperature and catalyst concentration were found to have significant influence on biodiesel yield. The optimum combination derived via RSM for high ester yield (99.4%) was found to be 0.75% wt catalyst concentration at a reaction temperature of 45 °C. As biodiesel chemically is a long-chain alkyl methyl esters, its long-term fuel properties have become of great concern to the fuel industry. In order to determine the effects of long storage on oxidation stability, RBO biodiesel sample was stored for 24 months and the different physical-chemical properties were checked with respect to time. The results show that the acid value (AV), peroxide value (PV), and viscosity (ν) increased while the iodine value (IV) decreased. Based on results, correlations were obtained in terms of AV, IV, PV and ν as a function of time. Those correlations can be used to predict how long time biodiesel can safely be stored. AV, IV and PV of the biodiesel sample which was stored were within the limits in European biodiesel specifications (EN 14214). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many countries are promoting the use of biodiesel as a direct replacement for, or blend stock component with petroleum based diesel fuel using policy instruments that aim to gradually increase the use of vegetable oil biodiesel-diesel ratio from the current (or inexistent) blend to values among 15-20% by an specific upcoming year. For the particular use of palm oil as biomass raw material in the diesel-palm oil biodiesel (Diesel-POB) blend that goal could bring some difficulties because the high content of saturated fatty acids in POB could confer a problematic high cloud point to the fuel mixtures. On the other hand, the use of castor oil biodiesel in the blends could lower the cloud point value but, simultaneously, increase the viscosity of the diesel-biodiesel blends. In this article there were evaluated three properties (viscosity, cloud point and flash point) of binary mixtures castor oil biodiesel (COB), palm oil biodiesel (POB) and diesel fuel. It was also measured the cloud point for some ternary bends of Diesel/POB/COB. It was found that diesel-castor oil biodiesel (Diesel. COB) blends showed appropriate and approximately the same cloud point temperatures when the biodiesel concentration in those mixtures was under 40% in volume. The use of palm oil biodiesel-castor oil biodiesel (POB. COB) blends to obtain a type of pure biodiesel with both low cloud point and viscosity was not a practical option. Experimental data were also compared with the predictions of different published models for diesel-biodiesel mixtures. The general thermodynamic expressions used for estimation of viscosity and cloud point for liquid mixtures showed lower deviations from experimental values properties predictions from other proposed empirical models. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Thermal non-catalytic cracking of jojoba oil, a non-triacylglyceride-based wax produced by the desert plant, Simmondsia chinensis, was compared to that of triacylglyceride-based soybean oil. Optimum liquid product yield was produced at a higher temperature for jojoba oil compared to soybean oil but at similar reaction pressure and residence time. At optimum conditions, jojoba oil generated a similar gas phase fraction as soybean oil while the liquid product contained a smaller quantity of undesirable polyaromatic and non-GC-elutable (low volatility high-MW) products, with nearly 90% of the cracking liquid product being GC quantifiable. This product included a mixture of linear saturated short-chain fatty acids whose size distribution peaked at C 10. It also included alkanes (predominantly linear) that peaked at C 7-C 8, and smaller concentrations of alkenes, aromatics, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Thus, jojoba oil is an excellent renewable feedstock for the production of replacements for petroleum-derived transportation fuels and chemicals. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Gold-of-pleasure or false flax (Camelina sativa L. Crantz) is being developed as an alternative oil crop for biodiesel and for food use. The seed meal, which contains three relatively unique glucosinolates, is being evaluated for approval for use as an ingredient in animal feeds and for other uses. The objective of this research was to develop reproducible methods for the isolation of large quantities of pure camelina glucosinolates (glucoarabin, glucocamelinin, and 11-(methylsulfinyl)-undecylglucosinolate) and develop efficient methods for quantifying these compounds. The separation and purification of the camelina glucosinolates were achieved using a combination of reverse phase chromatography, counter-current chromatography and ion exchange chromatography. An efficient reverse phase HPLC separation method was used to quantitate the glucosinolate content in camelina seed and plant extracts. The quantitation methodology was used to measure glucosinolate levels in seeds from 30 cultivars grown in a U.S. field trial and measure glucosinolates levels in sprouted camelina seeds. © 2012 .

AB  - Biodiesel is one of the renewable and clean burning fuels, which can be used in diesel engines. Biodiesel is usually generated from food-grade vegetable oils using transesterification process. Using the food-grade vegetable oils is not economical since they are more expensive than diesel fuel. Therefore, it is said that the main obstacle for commercialization of biodiesel is its high cost. The kind of feedstock, which is used is the most effective factor on the biodiesel characteristics and the price. So, at first finding a proper feedstock has an important role in different places. Therefore in this research the possibility of using date seed as a cheap feedstock for biodiesel production was investigated, because it is produced largely in the hot arid regions of southwestern Asia and northern Africa. After extracting oil and producing biodiesel from Phoenix dactylifera (date seed) oil, the properties of biodiesel were evaluated by fuel standard tests and the results were compared with EN14214 and ASTM D6751 standards and also compared with the properties of produced. According to the results, the important benefit of the biodiesel from the date seed oil is high cetane number (60.3), low iodine value (46), viscosity (3.84mm 2/s) and flash point (140°C) and the only weak point is its high pouring point (-1°C) which limits the use of date seed biodiesel in cold weather in comparison with other vegetable biodiesel fuels. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Environmental friendly bio-oil which offers supply reliability as a potential alternative fuel, has spurred to rapid development of biofuels technology. Palm oil is a potential renewable energy source for biofuels production in the future and Malaysia is one of the world largest palm oil producers. However, undesired oxygen content in the plant fatty acid that contributes to low energy density, high viscosity, and low stability, makes the palm oil not effective to be used as biofuels directly. In the present study, the performance of silica supported trimetal catalyst, NiSnK/SiO2, on deoxygenation of used palm oil was evaluated. In addition, the effects of operating parameters, such as reaction temperature and weight hourly space velocity were investigated. Conversion of palmitic acid as high as 90% was achieved in deoxygenation of used palm oil at reaction temperature 350oC. In order to have a better understanding on the deoxygenation reaction, model compound system using the major saturated fatty acid in the used palm oil, palmitic acid was also carried out. Palmitic acid was found mainly decarboxylated into n-pentadecane with some decarbonylation and isomerizations products.

AB  - Biofuels and their blends with fossil fuel are important energy resources, whose production and application have been largely increased internationally. This study focuses on the evaluation of the activation energy of the thermal decomposition of three pure fuels: farnesane (renewable diesel from sugar cane), biodiesel and fossil diesel and their blends (20% farnesene and 80% of fossil diesel - 20F80D and 20% farnesane, 50% fossil diesel and 30% biodiesel - 20F50D30B). Activation energy has been determined from thermogravimetry and Model-Free Kinetics. Results showed that not only the cetane number is important to understand the behavior of the fuels regarding ignition delay, but also the profile of the activation energy versus conversion curves shows that the chemical reactions are responsible for the performance at the beginning of the process. In addition, activation energy seemed to be suitable in describing reactivity in the case of blends of renewable and fossil fuels. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME; Biodiesel) of four plant species of Brassicaceae family having more than 30% fixed oil in their seeds were examined. Base catalyzed transesterification using 1:6 molar ratio (oil:methanol) at 70°C was the optimal method to convert crude oil into FAMEs. FAME of oil of these four species, Brassica alba (white mustard), Brassica campestris (mustard), Brassica rapa (canola), and Eruca sativa (rocket seed oil), were found suitable for use as biodiesel and they meet the major specification of biodiesel standards of the United States. The selected plants have great potential for biodiesel use in ordinary diesel engine due to their engine efficiency, consumption, and performance, which is in accordance with mineral diesel. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biodiesel has been produced from various vegetable oils, such as palm, canola (rapeseed), cottonseed, sunflower, and soybean oils as well as a variety of less common oils. This study evaluated the production of biodiesel using tea seed (Camellia sinensis) oil as a raw material. Methyl ester was produced by transesterification of tea seed oil with methanol in the presence of a catalyst (NaOH). The fuel properties such as pour point (PP), kinematic viscosity, cetane number, flash point, density, copper strip corrosion, and heating value were determined and discussed in light of American (ASTM D6751) and European (EN 14214) biodiesel standards. Not only the specifications of pure biodiesel but also its blends with diesel fuel were analyzed. Biodiesel produced from tea seed oil exhibit a low pour point value of -5°C, one of the lowest found for a biodiesel fuel. The cold flow properties of tea seed methyl ester (TSME) demonstrate its operational viability during the cold weather conditions. As a result, tea seed oil, as agricultural crop, might be a reasonable raw material for the biodiesel production. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Biodiesel production has increased dramatically over the last decade, raising the need for new rapid and non-destructive analytical tools and technologies. 1H Low Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (LF-NMR) applications, which offer great potential to the field of biodiesel, have been developed by the Phyto Lipid Biotechnology Lab research team in the last few years. Results: Supervised and un-supervised chemometric tools are suggested for screening new alternative biodiesel feedstocks according to oil content and viscosity. The tools allowed assignment into viscosity groups of biodiesel-petrodiesel samples whose viscosity is unknown, and uncovered biodiesel samples that have residues of unreacted acylglycerol and/or methanol, and poorly separated and cleaned glycerol and water. In the case of composite materials, relaxation time distribution, and cross-correlation methods were successfully applied to differentiate components. Continuous distributed methods were also applied to calculate the yield of the transesterification reaction, and thus monitor the progress of the common and in-situ transesterification reactions, offering a tool for optimization of reaction parameters. Conclusions: Comprehensive applied tools are detailed for the characterization of new alternative biodiesel resources in their whole conformation, monitoring of the biodiesel transesterification reaction, and quality evaluation of the final product, using a non-invasive and non-destructive technology that is new to the biodiesel research area. A new integrated computational-experimental approach for analysis of 1H LF-NMR relaxometry data is also presented, suggesting improved solution stability and peak resolution. © 2013 Berman et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - In this study, emissions of carbonyl compounds from the use B50 and B100 were measured with a non-road diesel generator. A total of 25 carbonyl compounds were identified in the exhaust, including 10 with laboratory-synthesized standards. Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein were found as the most abundant carbonyl compounds emitted for both diesel and biodiesel. The sulphur content of diesel fuels and the source of biodiesel fuels were not found to have a significant impact on the emission of carbonyl compounds. The overall maximum incremental reactivity (MIR) was the highest at 0 kW and slightly increased from 25 to 75 kW. The MIR of B100 was the highest, followed by diesel and B50, which is consistent with the emission rates of total carbonyl compounds. This suggests that the use of biodiesel blends may be more beneficial to the environment than using pure biodiesel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - With dwindling fossil oil resources and increased economic growth of many developing countries due to globalization, energy driven from an alternative source such as bio-energy in a sustainable fashion is the need of the hour. However, production of energy from biological source is relatively expensive due to low starch and sugar contents of bioenergy plants leading to lower oil yield and reduced quality along with lower conversion efficiency of feedstock. In this context genetic improvement of bio-energy plants offers a viable solution. In this manuscript, we reviewed the current status of functional genomics studies and related patent activities in bio-energy plants. Currently, genomes of considerable bio-energy plants have been sequenced or are in progress and also large amount of expression sequence tags (EST) or cDNA sequences are available from them. These studies provide fundamental data for more reliable genome annotation and as a result, several genomes have been annotated in a genome-wide level. In addition to this effort, various mutagenesis tools have also been employed to develop mutant populations for characterization of genes that are involved in bioenergy quantitative traits. With the progress made on functional genomics of important bio-energy plants, more patents were filed with a significant number of them focusing on genes and DNA sequences which may involve in improvement of bio-energy traits including higher yield and quality of starch, sugar and oil. We also believe that these studies will lead to the generation of genetically altered plants with improved tolerance to various abiotic and biotic stresses. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Biomass fast pyrolysis oil (bio-oil) is considered to be a promising renewable liquid energy carrier. But it cannot be applied in stationary combustion engines, so upgrading is required. A considerable alternative upgrading method is hydrodeoxygenation; the heavy fraction of hydrodeoxygenated pyrolysis oil (HDO-oil) is called HHDO-oil. In this article, HHDO-oil co-processed with paraffin oil in a fixed-bed was studied under the conditions of different temperatures, different weight hourly space velocity, and also different co-processed ratio. It was found that co-processing of 20 wt% HHDO-oil with paraffin oil gave higher yields of liquid and better oil quality than that of the pure paraffin oil cracking. The optimum operating condition was at 520°C, the weight hourly space velocity was 4.0 h-1, and the co-processed ratio was 20%. In this operating condition, it produced the highest yield of liquid, which was 78.65 wt%, including gasoline fraction that was 8.48 wt%, diesel fraction was 37.37 wt%, lubricant fraction was 19.03 wt%, and residue fraction was 13.78 wt%. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We assess the economic feasibility of a 10 million gallon per year biodiesel plant that uses canola seeds as feedstock. A Monte Carlo Cash Flow model is programmed using @Risk simulation software. The model is programmed with three output variables: stream of revenues, profits/loss, and the resulting net present value (NPV) over ten year forecast period. The study finds that the likelihood of the NPV greater than zero is 63% on average. This indicates that the plant may be economically feasible, subject to model assumptions. Sensitivity and scenario analyses show that the NPVs were most affected by fluctuations in biodiesel price, canola seed price, and the price of seed meal. Indeed, over the long-term, feedstock price and biodiesel subsidies remain the major determining factors of profitability in biodiesel production. Historically, feedstock prices have been characterized by high volatility. The profitability of the biodiesel plant hinges to a large extent on the assumption that feedstock prices remain low and regular gasoline prices, especially petroleum diesel, remain stable over the forecast horizon. Moreover, the analysis assumes that the current biodiesel subsidy at $1.00/gallon remains in effect over the period of the study. Thus, removal of the subsidy would also render biodiesel production unprofitable given current feedstock prices. © 2013 International Food and Agribusiness Management Association (IFAMA).

AB  - The microalgae have the capacity to mitigate CO2 emissions and to produce lipids, which are considered with potential to obtain third-generation biofuel. This review provides updated information of the influence of culture conditions on the lipids production with high productivity and profile suitable for the biodiesel production. This document presents a compilation of research conclusions over the last 13 years around the world. In the literature consulted, the authors conclude that although the behavior of microalgae at physiological stress conditions, varies between species; the nutrients limitation, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, associated with heterotrophic growth or high irradiances in phototrophy are considered the most efficient strategies to increase the lipid content in microalgae, particularly triglycerides (consisting of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids), which are excellent for the production of biodiesel. Also, it is reported that the lipid content increase and the number of unsaturated fatty acids decrease with the addition of small amounts of CO2 and harvesting the biomass it the stationary phase of growth.

AB  - In this work we report on the preparation, characterization, and properties of a thermally treated lignin-derived, phenolic-rich fraction (PRF) of wood pyrolysis bio-oil obtained by ethyl acetate extraction. The PRF was characterized for viscoelastic and rheological behavior using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and cone and plate rheology. A unique thermoplastic behavior was evidenced. Heat-treated PRFs acquire high modulus but show low temperatures of thermal flow which can be systematically manipulated through the thermal pretreatment. Loss of volatiles, changes in molecular weight, and glass transition temperature (Tg) were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), mass spectrometry (MS), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), respectively. Underlying mechanisms for the thermal and rheological behavior are discussed with regard to interactions between pyrolytic lignin nanoparticles present in the system and the role of volatile materials on determining the properties of the material resembling in several aspects to colloidal suspension systems. Low thermal flow temperatures and reversible thermal effects can be attributed to association of pyrolytic lignin particles due to intermolecular interactions that are easily ruptured at higher temperatures. The thermoplastic behavior of PRF and its low Tg is of particular interest, as it gives opportunities for application of this fraction in several melt processing and adhesive technologies. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The mechanism of the catalytic reduction of palmitic acid to n-pentadecane at 260 °C in the presence of hydrogen over catalysts combining multiple functions has been explored. The reaction involves rate-determining reduction of the carboxylic group of palmitic acid to give hexadecanal, which is catalyzed either solely by Ni or synergistically by Ni and the ZrO2 support. The latter route involves adsorption of the carboxylic acid group at an oxygen vacancy of ZrO2 and abstraction of the α-H with elimination of O to produce the ketene, which is in turn hydrogenated to the aldehyde over Ni sites. The aldehyde is subsequently decarbonylated to n-pentadecane on Ni. The rate of deoxygenation of palmitic acid is higher on Ni/ZrO2 than that on Ni/SiO2 or Ni/Al2O3, but is slower than that on H-zeolite-supported Ni. As the partial pressure of H2 is decreased, the overall deoxygenation rate decreases. In the absence of H 2, ketonization catalyzed by ZrO2 is the dominant reaction. Pd/C favors direct decarboxylation (-CO2), while Pt/C and Raney Ni catalyze the direct decarbonylation pathway (-CO). The rate of deoxygenation of palmitic acid (in units of mmol moltotal metal -1 h-1) decreases in the sequence r (Pt black)≈r(Pd black)&gt;r(Raney Ni) in the absence of H2. In situ IR spectroscopy unequivocally shows the presence of adsorbed ketene (Cï£34;Cï£34;O) on the surface of ZrO2 during the reaction with palmitic acid at 260 °C in the presence or absence of H2. Biomass to biofuels: The conversion of palmitic acid to n-pentadecane over ZrO2 mainly proceeds by hydrogenation of the carboxylic acid group to give hexadecanal (rate-determining step), which is catalyzed either solely by Ni sites or synergistically by Ni sites and sites on the ZrO2 support (see scheme). In the absence of H2, ketonization is the dominant reaction catalyzed by ZrO 2. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - This article describes the effects of hydroxylated biodiesel (castor oil methyl ester -COME) on the properties, combustion, and emissions of butanol-diesel blends used within compression ignition engines. The study was conducted to investigate the influence of COME as a means of increasing the butanol concentration in a stable butanol-diesel blend. Tests were compared with baseline experiments using rapeseed methyl esters (RME). A clear benefit in terms of the trade-off between NOX and soot emissions with respect to ULSD and biodiesel-diesel blends with the same oxygen content was obtained from the combination of biodiesel and butanol, while there was no penalty in regulated gaseous carbonaceous emissions. From the comparison between the biodiesel fuels used in this work, COME improved some of the properties (for example lubricity, density and viscosity) of butanol-diesel blends with respect to RME. The existence of hydroxyl group in COME also reduced further soot emissions and decreased soot activation energy. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - • First-generation biofuels can have several environmental and socioeconomic impacts. • Major impacts include greenhouse gas emissions, atmospheric pollution, water overconsumption and pollution, deforestation, biodiversity loss, rural development, food security, energy security, public health, and social conflicts. • The nature and the magnitude of biofuel impacts depend on the feedstock, the mode of feedstock production, the agricultural practices adopted during feedstock production, the environmental and socioeconomic context of biofuel production, the stage of the biofuel's life-cycle, and the policies in place during biofuel production, use, and trade. • Trade-offs are inevitable, but at least some of biofuels' negative impact can be mitigated through careful planning. © Gasparatos, Stromberg, and Takeuchi.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of biomass can be used to produce a raw bio-oil product, which can be upgraded by catalytic hydroprocessing to hydrocarbon liquid products. In this study, the upgraded products were distilled to recover light naphtha and oils and to produce a distillation residue with useful properties for coker processing and production of a renewable low-sulfur electrode carbon. For this hydroprocessing work, phase separation of the bio-oil was applied as a preparatory step to concentrate the heavier, more phenolic components, thus, generating a more amenable feedstock for residue production. Low residual oxygen content products were produced by continuous-flow catalytic hydroprocessing of the phase separated bio-oil. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - • Biofuels, in conjunction to their positive carbon balance with regards to fossil fuels, also represent a significant potential for sustainability and economic growth of industrialized countries because they can be generated from locally available renewable material. • Biofuels are usually classified as follows: 1. First-generation biofuels are directly related to a biomass that is generally edible. 2. Second-generation biofuels are defined as fuels produced from a wide array of different feedstock, ranging from lignocellulosic feedstocks to municipal solid wastes. 3. Third-generation biofuels are, at this point, related to algal biomass but could to a certain extent be linked to utilization of CO2 as feedstock. • Scaling second- and third-generation biofuel processes thus requires solid economics that are directly dependent on optimized carbon utilization that relies on the production of fuels (commodities), as well as high value co-products. © Lee and Lavoie.

AB  - The emulsification is well known for being considered as a solution for improving biodiesel combustion. In this extent, the size of the dispersed droplets is crucial to favour micro-explosions and optimising the combustion. The present mini-channel operates liquid/liquid dispersion at higher flow rates than with usual implementations of minichannels and micro-channels. Due to this particular condition of functioning, the flow enhanced in the mini channel is classified as a high-speed emulsifying one. In this study, the dispersion of water into sunflower oil as a water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion is tested. In such an in-line process, high-shear implies higher velocities at smaller scales, making an optical visualisation difficult. But the light scattering technique enables to detect micro-scaled droplets, at the required high velocities. The proper design and exploitation of a focalised laser beam through a transparent, hydrophobic mini-channel is explained. A focalised laser beam is crossing the mini-channel, dealing with the scattering cross sections of the water droplets. The measurement of the collected beam is successfully matched to the geometrical properties of the emulsion (water fraction and size of inner droplets) through the classical light scattering theoretical basement. The calibration of the collected laser light technique obtained in the straight mini-channel is followed by measurements approaching the high shear rate zone of the cross-flowing mini-channel © Société Hydrotechnique de France, 2013.

AB  - The increasing consumption of energy with the depletion of crude oil reserves urges the usage of alternative fuel. Since there is an existing demand for edible vegetable oils, waste vegetable oils and non-edible crude vegetable oils are preferred as potential low priced biodiesel sources. In this study, utilization of Cotton Seed Oil (CSO) was tested for its potential use as biodiesel. The density, viscosity, acid value, saponification number, iodine value, cetane number wereanalyzed and all are found to be within the range specified by the ASTM standards. The Ultrasonic studies gave an idea on the ignition standard, compressibility, relaxation time of the CSO for its use as a biofuel source. The physico- chemical and ultrasonic properties of the blends B10, B20 and 100% CSO B100 were also found to be within the ASTM standards and the blend B20 of the CSO can serve as the potential source for biodiesel.

AB  - Tomato manufacturing industry originates substantial amounts of residues. If left without control these residues can constitute an environmental problem. Their energetic use can solve this problem and give added value to the process. In this research physical-chemical characteristics of this biomass and its components are studied to evaluate the possibility of an energy recovery. In general, the dry residues of tomato processing industry are suitable as solid biofuel for energy purposes in large size power plants. The separation of components that constitute tomato residues (peels and seeds) makes sense in case of production and exploitation of oil from tomato seeds. The results can be useful for developing standards on these materials. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the present study we demonstrate the rhizoremediation potential of a biodiesel plant Jatropha curcas L. against lindane and discuss the field applicability of Jatropha based remediation techniques and future research prospects. Six different experimental approaches were conducted to evaluate the phytoremediation potential of Jatropha under glasshouse conditions. For this, Jatropha plants were grown in garden soil spiked with four increasing concentration of lindane (5, 10, 15 and 20 mg kg-1) and harvested after 45, 180 and 300 d. One set of control plants were grown in lindane free soil and another set of spiked soils were kept without Jatropha plants. At every harvesting, plant growth, lindane accumulation in plant parts, residual lindane concentration in soil as well as percentage lindane dissipation from soil were calculated. After 300 d, the accumulation of lindane in Jatropha grown in four simulated soils reached up to 5.42, 10.83, 15.95 and 20.85 μg g-1 plant dry matter, respectively. Correspondingly, the residual lindane soil concentrations in the above four treatments were reduced to 89, 82, 77 and 72% with respect to the applied lindane amounts, respectively. We conclude that Jatropha enhances the dissipation of lindane in simulated soil and is useful for onsite remediation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Seed processing and oil pre-treatment were optimised to improve the yield and quality of biodiesel obtained from Sinapis alba. By using solvent extraction or mechanical pressing followed by solvent extraction, an oil extraction yield greater than 41 wt.% and a de-oiled cake with less than 2 wt.% of oil could be obtained. The oil characterisation showed that erucic acid was the most predominant fatty acid in the oil composition (>50 wt.%). A high phosphorous content (>36 mg/kg) and acid value (>1.5 mg KOH/g) were obtained. To obtain a biodiesel with a high methyl ester content, it was necessary to carry out an oil refining process (acid degumming and chemical de-acidification) followed by a standard transesterification with methanol and sodium methoxide as a catalyst. Finally, the quality of the purified biodiesel was tested according to the EN 14214 and ASTM D6751 standards. The results of this work revealed the possibility of using the oil from Sinapis alba seeds as a suitable source for biodiesel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work investigated the effect of the oxygen enrichment in the intake air of diesel engines on the combustion and emissions performance using rape seed oil (RSO) as a fuel. The purpose of the paper is to investigate the potential of oxygen enrichment in the intake air method to restrain the deterioration of particulate emissions of the RSO due to its high viscosity so as to explore the possibility of direct use of SVO (straight vegetable oil) in diesel engines, which can reduce CO2 emissions and save cost. The combustion parameters such as ignition delay, heat release rate, in-cylinder peak temperature and pressure were determined. Engine out particulate and gaseous emissions of the RSO were measured at oxygen concentrations from 21% (by volume) (no enrichment) to 24% (by volume) and compared to diesel results. The enrichment of the intake air with oxygen decreased the ignition delay and premixed combustion duration, and increased the in-cylinder peak pressure and temperature. The particulate, CO and hydrocarbon emissions were significantly reduced while the NOx emissions increased as the oxygen enrichment rate increased. 22% oxygen enrichment rate was suggested to achieve lower than diesel particulate emissions with the lowest NOx penalty. Increased NOx could be controlled by other methods. The results show that the oxygen enrichment in intake air method enabled direct combustion of SVO in diesel engines with reduced particulate, hydrocarbon and CO emissions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In order to improve the productivity and reduce the production cost of biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester) made from waste cooking oil, orthogonal tests and single factor tests were conducted to optimize the process. The effects of ratio of methanol to waste cooking oil, content of catalyst, reaction time, and reaction temperature were investigated systematically in this study. The results showed that all these factors had significant impacts on the reaction for producing biodiesel from waste cooking oil. The significance of factors influencing biodiesel production in descending order is stir speed&gt; content of catalyst input&gt; reaction time&gt; mass ratio of methanol to waste cooking oil&gt;reaction temperature. The optimal stir speed, mass ratio of methanol to waste cooking oil, content of catalyst input, reaction time, and reaction temperature were 60 r·min-1, 0.22:1, 1.0%, 3 h, and 60 °C, respectively.

AB  - Mixed crude palm oil (MCPO), the mixture of palm fiber oil and palm kernel oil, has become of great interest as a renewable energy source. It can be easily extracted from whole dried palm fruits. In the present work, the degummed, deacidified MCPO was blended in petroleum diesel at portions of 30% and 40% by volume and then tested in agricultural diesel engines for long term usage. The particulates from the exhaust of the engines were collected every 500 hr using a four-stage cascade air sampler. The 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameters for the first three stages were 10, 2.5 and 1 μm, while the last stage collected all particles smaller than 1 μm. Sixteen particle bounded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed using a high performance liquid chromatography. The results indicated that the size distribution of particulate matter was in the accumulation mode and the pattern of total PAHs associated with fine-particles (&lt; 1 μm) showed a dominance of larger molecular weight PAHs (4-6 aromatic rings), especially pyrene. The mass median diameter, PM and total PAH concentrations decreased when increasing the palm oil content, but increased when the running hours of the engine were increased. In addition, Commercial petroleum diesel (PB0) gave the highest value of carcinogenic potency equivalent (BaPeq) for all particle size ranges. As the palm oil was increased, the BaPeq decreased gradually. Therefore the degummed-deacidified MCPO blends are recommended for diesel substitute. © 2013 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Red mud was investigated in triglyceride transesterification with a view to determine its viability as a basic catalyst for use in biodiesel synthesis. The effect of calcination temperature on the structure and activity of red mud catalysts was investigated. It was found that highly active catalyst was obtained by simply drying red mud at 200°C. Utilization of red mud as a catalyst for biodiesel production not only provides a cost-eifective and environmentally friendly way of recycling this solid red mud waste, significantly reducing its environmental effects, but also reduces the price of biodiesel to make biodiesel competitive with petroleum diesel. © 2013 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Biofuels from bioenergy crops may substitute a significant part of fossil fuels in the transport sector where, e.g., the European Union has set a target of using 10% renewable energy by 2020. Savings of greenhouse gas emissions by biofuels vary according to cropping systems and are influenced by such regional factors as soil conditions, climate and input of agrochemicals. Here we analysed at a regional scale the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with cultivation of winter wheat for bioethanol and winter rapeseed for rapeseed methyl ester (RME) under Danish conditions. Emitted CO2 equivalents (CO2eq) were quantified from the footprints of CO2, CH4 and N2O associated with cultivation and the emissions were allocated between biofuel energy and co-products. Greenhouse gas emission at the national level (Denmark) was estimated to 22.1 g CO2eq MJ-1 ethanol for winter wheat and 26.0 g CO2eq MJ-1 RME for winter rapeseed. Results at the regional level (level 2 according to the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics [NUTS]) ranged from 20.0 to 23.9 g CO2eq MJ-1 ethanol and from 23.5 to 27.6 g CO2eq MJ-1 RME. Thus, at the regional level emission results varied by up to 20%. Differences in area-based emissions were only 4% reflecting the importance of regional variation in yields for the emission result. Fertilizer nitrogen production and direct emissions of soil N2O were major contributors to the final emission result and sensitivity analyses showed that the emission result depended to a large extent on the uncertainty ranges assumed for soil N2O emissions. Improvement of greenhouse gas balances could be pursued, e.g., by growing dedicated varieties for energy purposes. However, in a wider perspective, land-use change of native ecosystems to bioenergy cropping systems could compromise the CO2 savings of bioenergy production and challenge the targets set for biofuel production. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biodiesel is a biofuel obtained from vegetable oils. The oils used as raw materials are usually refined edible vegetable oils. Nonedible acidic oils are unsuitable for biodiesel production unless reduction of the high content in free fatty acids (FFA) of these materials had been achieved. Obtaining a good raw material from unprofitable oils becomes an important research field. Additionally clays have a long history in industrial sorption and catalysis, some being commercially available and with properties that can be modified. In this work we present the results of the use of the montmorillonite clay K10 and two acid modified clays K10(I) and K10(II), in the esterification of stearic acid with methanol and 95 % of methyl stearate was obtained with K10(II). These clays were then used for the first time to reduce the acidity of enhanced FFA sunflower oil and they show to be very effective. Reduction of FFA from 11 to 4 % was obtained with K10(II) mainly due to 94 % conversion of FFA into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). These clays were also tested with two waste oils, one from domestic use and the other gathered from different restaurants, and showed their ability to lower the acidity of these oils. Reactions were followed by 1H NMR as well as quantitative determination of FFA and FAME. Clays were characterized by FTIR and XRD. © 2012 AOCS.

AB  - The use of biogenic additives in fuels is required by law for environmental reasons. This raises the question of whether the oil separator tested according to ÖNORM EN 858-1 complies with these new requirements. In this study, a commercial mineral oil separator was tested with different fuels with up to 100 % biodiesel (FAME) and its elimination performance was described in terms of the parameters KW, KW-Index DIN EN ISO 9377-2 H 53 (2000), and also the non-standardized parameters for mineral oil analysis in accordance with H 18 and H 53 without the purification stage. The results showed that all the tests with different fuel mixtures complied with the test value of 5 mg/l laid out in EN 858-1 (2005) and based on the parameter mineral oil analysis in accordance with DIN 38409-H 18 (1981). As the purification stage of this method removes the biofuel fraction, the question arises as to whether fuels with increased biogenic content can be analyzed satisfactorily using these standardized mineral oil parameters; and whether the use of pure mineral oil for ÖNORM EN 858-1 (2005) performance tests is still suitable, or whether other fuels should also be used as test media. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - This study evaluated the conventional jet cooking liquefaction process followed by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) at 30% and 35% dry solids (DS) concentration of Indian sorghum feedstock for ethanol production, with addition of acid fungal protease or urea. To evaluate the efficacy of thermostable α-amylase in liquefaction at 30% and 35% DS concentration of Indian sorghum, liquefact solubility, higher dextrins, and fermentable sugars were analyzed at the end of the process. The liquefact was further subjected to SSF using yeast. In comparison with urea, addition of an acid fungal protease during SSF process was observed to accelerate yeast growth (μ), substrate consumption (Qs), ultimately ethanol yield based on substrate (Yp/s) and ethanol productivity based on fermentation time (Qp). The fermentation efficiency and ethanol recovery were determined for both concentrations of Indian sorghum and found to be increased with use of acid fungal protease in SSF process. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Synthetic biology has been presented as the application of engineering principles to (genomic) biology. But in industrial synthetic biology, alongside the much discussed engineering principles of abstraction, modularity, de-coupling and standardisation, we see many other practices of contextualisation through which engineering projects accrue credibility and realisability. This paper discusses how synthetic biologists working on next-generation biofuels construct an economic calculus for biological forms. As they modify microbes to make fuel from plants, waste gases and sunlight, or introduce new metabolic pathways into organisms, they also create novel stories that link economic and metabolic processes, and they attach new contexts to synthetic biology in various forms ranging from global climate change, peak oil, food security, US foreign policy, through to fashion and diet. Examples drawn from well-known next-generation biofuels companies such as Joule Unlimited, Amyris Technologies, Synthetic Genomics, Solazyme and Aurora Algae illustrate how principles of cosmogonic dreaming, metabolic equivalence and supply chain disruption strain to connect the origins of life on earth, the flux of solar radiation, the optimal metabolic flux in a microbe and the prices of petroleum, palm oil or sugar. This economic calculus both connects engineering practice to a plurality of life forms, and creates a space in which synthetic biology can appear as unprecedented. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this study, n-butanol (port fuel injection) PFI was investigated in a direct injection compression ignition engine while at idling speeds, and loads, 1-3 bar IMEP (indicated mean effective pressure) in order to determine the effects on combustion, efficiency, emissions, and specifically, a modified tradeoff of soot and nitrogen oxides. As a result, the engine entered into (low-temperature combustion) LTC regions, for selected loads and speeds. Compared with the baseline taken with ultra-low sulfur diesel no. 2, the heat release with n-butanol in (premixed charge compression ignition) PCCI mode, has resulted in a 75% reduction from the maximum values, while a secondary peak appeared where the diffusion combustion typically occurs in the power stroke. At 3 bar IMEP an early, (bottom dead center) BTDC low-temperature heat release was found that began 6° earlier than for the diesel reference cycle, and corresponding to 1200 K. Soot emissions showed a massive decrease of about 98%, concurrently with a 74% reduction of nitrogen oxides at 3 IMEP by controlling the combustion phases and by modifying the classical NOx-soot tradeoff. The results of this work prove that biodiesel combined with n-butanol PFI in PCCI and LTC are very effective in simultaneously reducing soot and NOx at idling speeds. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa L. Crantz) has received worldwide attention in recent years as a biofuel crop and as a broadleaf option in cereal-based cropping systems. The objective of our 3-year study was to determine camelina seed yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) as affected by six applied nitrogen (N) rates at four rainfed sites in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of the United States. An N+sulfur (S) variable was also included. Seed oil content as affected by applied N and S was also evaluated in 2010. The four sites and their average annual crop-year precipitation during the 3 years were Lind, WA (228mm); Pendleton, OR (421mm); Moscow/Pullman, ID (695mm); and Corvallis, OR (1085). The majority of precipitation occurs in the winter and summers are comparatively dry. Camelina responded differently to applied N among sites based upon precipitation and available soil N. Seed yield did not respond to N rate treatments at Lind, presumably due to sufficient soil residual N and limited precipitation. Seed yield increased with applied N at Pendleton, Moscow/Pullman, and Corvallis. Optimum applied N rates ranged from 0 to 90kgha-1 depending on annual precipitation and soil available N. Maximum seed yield increases attributable to applied N ranged from 19% at Pendleton to 93% at Moscow/Pullman. Camelina NUE was greatest at Moscow/Pullman although it decreased gradually with increasing applied N rates at all sites. Lind, Pendleton, and Corvallis had the same decrease in NUE of -0.06kg seed for each additional kg of available N. Camelina did not respond to applied S at any site. Seed oil content was not affected by applied N or S. Based upon the results of this study, camelina requires about 12kgNha-1 per 100kg of expected seed yield. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work, low grade crude palm oil (LGCPO) with high free fatty acids (FFA) content is introduced as a possible biodiesel production feedstock alternative. The pre-treatment of LGCPO was conducted using ammonium-based deep eutectic solvent which consisted of hydrogen bond donor (i.e. p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate) (PTSA) and salt (i.e. N,N-diethylenethanol ammonium chloride) as a novel recyclable catalyst (DEAC-DES). The DEAC-DES was used in different dosages to reduce the level of FFA to the acceptable limit for biodiesel production. The esterification reaction was carried out to evaluate the effect of varying reaction operating conditions on the reduction of FFA content. The FFA content of LGCPO was reduced from 9.5% to less than 1% using optimum conditions. Four recycling runs of the DEAC-DES were achieved. The conversion of PTSA to deep eutectic solvent improved the recyclability of the acid and the physical properties such as the elimination of acid hygroscopicity. The LGCPO biodiesel fulfilled the international standards. This study demonstrates a potential route for biodiesel production from abundance LGCPO using DEAC-DES and an alkaline catalyst. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Enormous use of petroleum fuels is now widely recognized as unsustainable because of depleting supplies and these fuels contributes to the accumulation of CO2 in environment. Renewable, carbon neutral, transport fuels are necessary for environmental and economical consideration. Biodiesel is monoalkyl ester of long chain fatty acids produced from the trans-esterification reaction of vegetable oil with alcohol in the presence of catalyst &amp; can be used as fuel. Biodiesel is derived from oil crops, waste cooking oil and animal fat or micro algae. Micro algae have emerged as one of the most promising sources for biodiesel production. It can be inferred that micro algae grown in CO2-enriched air can be converted to oily substance. Such an approach can contribute to solve major problems of air pollution resulting from CO2 evolution and future crisis due to a shortage of energy sources. Oil productivity of many micro algae greatly exceeds the oil productivity of the best producing oil crops. Approaches are taken for making microbio-diesel economically competitive with petrodiesel. The production of biodiesel from microalgae oil by transesterification chemically and enzymatically. In the present work Aspergillus niger lipase were screened for a transesterification reaction of algal oil using different acyl acceptor (methanol, ethanol, propanol-2 and n-butanol) in reaction mixture to produce biodiesel; only methanol was found to give appreciable yield. The application of crude lipase was determined to catalyze the transesterification process, and a conversion of 44% was achieved under selected conditions (reaction temperature 40 °C, algal oil/methanol molar ratio 1:4, 5 ml of lipase based on the oil weight, and reaction time of 24h). It was seen that algal oil and optimization of transesterification conditions resulted in adequate yield of biodiesel in the case of the enzyme-based process.

AB  - Biodiesel production from high acidity industrial by-products was studied using heterogeneous acid catalysts. These by-products contain 26-39% of free fatty acids, 45-66% of fatty acids methyl esters and 0.6-1.1% of water and are consequently inadequate for direct basic catalyzed transesterification. Macroporous vanadyl phosphate catalysts with V/P = 1 (atomic ratio) prepared via sol-gel like technique was used as catalyst and it was possible to produce in one reaction batch a biodiesel contain 87% and 94% of FAME, depending on the by-product used as raw material. The initial FAME content in the by-products had a beneficial effect on the reactions because they act as a co-solvent, thus improving the miscibility of the reaction mixture components. The water formed during esterification process seems to hinder the esters formation, possibly due to competitive adsorption with methanol and to the promotion of the FAME hydrolysis reaction.The observed catalyst deactivation seems to be related to the reduction of vanadium species. However, spent catalysts can be regenerated, even partially, by reoxidation of the reduced vanadium species with air. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ethanol obtained from biomass has potential to become an important sustainable transportation fuel in the near future. Renewable energy sources, such as lignocellulosic biomass, are environmentally friendly because they emit less pollution without contributing net carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Among kinds of biomass, lignocellulosic biomass is a very useful feedstock to economically produce environmentally friendly biofuels. The main goal of the research described in this paper is to investigate the process of pretreated biomass, effect of inhibitors and ethanol fermentation as an efficient bio fuel source for the society, as well as to examine whether it is used and beneficial for the society, which helps to control the global warming. Processing of lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol consists of four major operations: (a) Pretreatment (b) Acid or enzymatic hydrolysis (c) Fermentation and (d) Ethanol separation/purification. In this paper alkali and acid method of pretereatment was used to examine their effect on ethanol production. Effective parameters such as pH, Nutrient media and sugar concentration also effected the enzymatic growth and production of ethanol from lignocellulosic biomasses. Production of ethanol from agricultural and forestry residues, municipal solid waste, energy crops, and other forms of lignocellulosic biomass could improve energy security, reduce trade deficits, decrease urban air pollution, and contribute little, if any, net carbon dioxide accumulation to the atmosphere. The use of production of ethanol is more beneficial and economical because most of the lignocellulosic agricultural wastes are converted in to ethanol as biofuel in urban areas. Biofuels should ideally create the environmental, economic and social benefits to the communities in India, but modification in process and car engine should be needed. Bioethanol is also made from different Algal biomass in the terms of third generation of biofuel. In fact, not only are they environmentally friendly, but they have also been shown to get just as good of gas mileage as petroleum based fuels. It will eventually totally replace petroleum fuels, but that remains to be seen. Ethanol is made from agricultural wastes is less polluting than diesel and oil based fuels, and gets better gas mileage than many of the alternatives.

AB  - Facing a steadily increasing world energy demand, jatropha, among other energy crops, has been reported to potentially contribute to biofuel production. A basic characterisation of plant responses to abiotic environmental factors is important for assessing the model-assisted potential of this plant in view of the many agro-ecological zones in which jatropha is presently cultivated. Two pot experiments and two field studies were used to record gas exchange parameters in response to light, nitrogen supply, atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (VPD), leaf age and time of measurements. Variation of N supply from 0 to 16&amp; mm resulted in lower rates of photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance (gs) of treatment 0&amp; mm N compared with other N levels, whereas the light compensation point (IC), quantum yield (QY) and dark respiration rates (Rd) were similar in all treatments. In the field, diurnal effects were evident with higher light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Amax) and QY and lower IC and Rd in the morning than in the afternoon. Considering leaf age effects, fully expanded leaves had a lower Amax compared with expanding leaves and this variation in leaf gas exchange was not related to changes in the chlorophyll index value (SPAD) which steadily increased with leaf age. QY of field and greenhouse plants varied from 0.023 to 0.037 and was substantially lower than in C3 plants. A was positively correlated with gs in a hyperbolic function. A varied from 0.64 to 21.13&amp; μmol&amp; m-2&amp; s-1 and gs varied from 12 to 469&amp; mmol&amp; m-2&amp; s-1. With increasing VPD, gs decreased, but this response differed between the field experiments and the two pot experiments which contrasted each other distinctively. Applying the inverse logistic function of Webb (Ecological Modeling, 56 (1991), 81), the maximal stomatal conductance of jatropha was in the range of 382&amp; mmol&amp; m-2&amp; s-1 and gs is predicted to be close to zero at 5&amp; kPa. These data altogether indicate that light absorption characteristics of single leaves and carbohydrate status parameters should be investigated further to explain the low QY and the pronounced diurnal variation. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

AB  - Medical literature regularly reports on accidental poisoning in children after aspiration of combustibles such as lamp oils which usually contain hydrocarbons or rape methyl esters (RMEs). We aimed to analyze the toxic potential of alkanes and different combustible classes in vitro with regard to biologic responses and mechanisms mediating toxicity. Two different in vitro models were used, i.e. (i) a captive bubble surfactometer (CBS) to assess direct influence of combustibles on biophysical properties of surfactant film and (ii) cell cultures (BEAS-2B and R3/1 cells, primary macrophages, re-differentiated epithelia) closely mimicking the inner lung surface. Biological endpoints included cell viability, cytotoxicity and inflammatory mediator release. CBS measurements demonstrate that combustibles affect film dynamics, i.e. the surface tension/area characteristics during compression and expansion, in a dose and molecular chain length dependent manner. Cell culture results confirm the dose dependent toxicity. Generally, cytotoxicity and cytokine release are higher in short-chained alkanes and hydrocarbon-based combustibles than in long-chained substances, e.g. highest inducible cytotoxicity in BEAS-2B was for hexane 84.6%, decane 74% and hexadecane 30.8%. Effects of RME-based combustibles differed between the cell models. Our results confirm data from animal experiments and give new insights into the mechanisms underlying the adverse health effects observed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In 2010, the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) came into force in the EU and establishes a framework for achieving legally binding greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. Only sustainable biofuels can be counted towards Member State targets. The aim of this paper is to calculate realistic and transparent scenario-based CO2-emission values for the GHG emissions savings of palm oil fuel compared with fossil fuel. Using the calculation scheme proposed by the RED, we derive a more realistic overall GHG emissions saving value for palm oil diesel by using current input and output data of biofuel production (e. g. in South-East Asia). We calculate different scenarios in which reliable data on the production conditions (and the regarding emission values during the production chain) of palm oil diesel are used. Our results indicate values for the GHG emissions savings potential of palm oil biodiesel not only above the 19 % default and 36 % typical value published in RED but also above the 35 % sustainable threshold. Our findings conclude the more accurate GHG emissions saving value for palm oil feedstock for electricity generation to be 52 %, and for transportation biodiesel between 38. 5 and 41 %, depending on the fossil fuel comparator. Our results confirm the findings by other studies and challenge the official typical and default values published in RED. As a result, the reliability of the Directive to support the EU's low-carbon ambitions is being undermined, exposing the EU and commission to charges of trade discrimination and limiting the ability of Member States to achieve their legally binding GHG emission reductions. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - Short-chain carboxylic acids generated by various mixed- or pure-culture fermentation processes have been considered valuable precursors for production of bioalcohols. While conversion of carboxylic acids into alcohols is routinely performed with catalytic hydrogenation or with strong chemical reducing agents, here, a biological conversion route was explored. The potential of carboxydotrophic bacteria, such as Clostridium ljungdahlii and Clostridium ragsdalei, as biocatalysts for conversion of short-chain carboxylic acids into alcohols, using syngas as a source of electrons and energy is demonstrated. Acetic acid, propionic acid, n-butyric acid, isobutyric acid, n-valeric acid, and n-caproic acid were converted into their corresponding alcohols. Furthermore, biomass yields and fermentation stoichiometry from the experimental data were modeled to determine how much metabolic energy C. ljungdahlii generated during syngas fermentation. An ATP yield of 0.4-0.5mol of ATP per mol CO consumed was calculated in the presence of hydrogen. The ratio of protons pumped across the cell membrane versus electrons transferred from ferredoxin to NAD+ via the Rnf complex is suggested to be 1.0. Based on these results, we provide suggestions how n-butyric acid to n-butanol conversion via syngas fermentation can be further improved. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This paper presents an assessment of the productive efficiency of an advanced biodiesel plant in Japan using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The empirical analysis uses monthly input data (waste cooking oil, methanol, potassium hydroxide, power consumption, and the truck diesel fuel used for the procurement of waste cooking oil) and output data (biodiesel) of a biodiesel fuel plant for August 2008-July 2010. The results of this study show that the production activity with the lowest cost on the biodiesel production possibility frontier occurred in March 2010 (production activity used 1.41. kL of waste cooking oil, 0.18. kL of MeOH, 16.33. kg of KOH, and 5.45. kW. h of power), and the unit production cost in that month was 18,517 yen/kL. Comparing this efficient production cost to the mean unit production cost on the production possibility frontier at 19,712 yen/kL, revealed that the cost of producing 1. kL of biodiesel could be reduced by as much as 1195 yen. We also find that the efficiency improvement will contribute to decreasing the cost ratio (cost per sale) of the biodiesel production by approximately 1% during the study period (24 months) between August 2008 and July 2010. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Vegetables oils are simplest route of biofuel utilization in direct injection compression ignition (DICI) engines however several operational and durability problems are encountered while using straight vegetable oils in CI engines due to their high viscosity and low volatility. Reduction of viscosity by blending or exhaust gas heating leads to savings in chemical processing cost incurred on transesterification. In this experimental study, performance, emission and combustion characteristics of Karanja oil blends (K10, K20, K50 and K100) with mineral diesel were investigated in unheated conditions in a direct injection CI engine at different engine loads and constant engine speed (1500 rpm) vis-à-vis baseline data from mineral diesel. Analysis of performance parameters such as brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), thermal efficiency, and exhaust gas temperature; mass emissions of various gaseous pollutant species; combustion parameters such as in-cylinder pressure rise, instantaneous heat release and cumulative heat release etc. were carried out. Detailed combustion analysis revealed that the combustion duration increased significantly even with smaller concentration of Karanja oil in the fuel blend. HC, CO and Smoke emissions were found to decrease for 20-50% (v/v) Karanja oil content in the fuel blends. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A technoeconomic study is conducted to assess the feasibility of integrating geothermal energy into a biorefinery for biofuel production. The biorefinery is based on a thermochemical platform that converts low-value lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels via gasification and fuel reforming. Geothermal energy is utilized in the refinery to generate process steam for gasification and steam-methane reforming in addition to providing excess electricity via the organic Rankine cycle. A process simulation model is developed to simulate the operation of the proposed biorefinery, and corresponding economic analysis tools are utilized to predict the product value. The biorefinery uses 2000 metric tons of corn stover per day, and the products include gasoline, diesel fuel, hydrogen, and electricity. Implementation of geothermal energy into the proposed biorefinery is analyzed through two studies. In the first study, process steam at 150 C with a flow rate of approximately 16 kg/s is assumed to be generated through a heat exchanger process by utilizing the heat from geothermal resources, producing a geothermal liquid at 180 C and a total flow rate of 105 kg/s which is used to provide steam for gasification and steam-methane reforming within the biorefinery. In the second study, additional geothermal capacity of 204 kg/s is assumed to be available and is separated into two phases (liquid and steam) via a flash column. The steam produced is utilized in the same manner as the initial study while the geothermal liquid is used for electricity production via the organic Rankine cycle to add to the profitability of the biorefinery. This analysis considers that the technology is feasible in the near future with a high scope of technology development and the end products are compatible with the present fuel infrastructure. The total capital investment, operating costs, and total product values are calculated considering an operating duration of 20 years for the plant, and the data are reported based on the 2012 cost year. Simulation results show that the price of the fuel obtained from the present biorefinery utilizing geothermal energy ranges from $5.17 to $5.48 per gallon gasoline equivalent, which is comparable to $5.14 using the purchased steam. One important incentive for using geothermal energy in the present scenario is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels used to generate the purchased steam. Geothermal energy is an important renewable energy resource, and this study provides a unique way of integrating geothermal energy into a biorefinery to produce biofuels in an environmentally friendly manner. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biofuels are an important alternative to environmental sustainability, and biodiesel has a detached contribution to this scenario. The increasing use of biodiesel requires the knowledge of several thermophysical properties of this biofuel. This work addresses the measurements of the speed of sound and density at atmospheric pressure of five fatty acid methyl esters (methyl caprylate, methyl caprate, methyl palmitate, methyl stearate, and methyl linoleate). These data are used to test Wada's group contribution method recently proposed by us and its ability to predict the speed of sound of biodiesel fuels and to expand the application of this model to the prediction of the speed of sound of biodiesel fuels. The overall average relative deviations (OARD) obtained were 0.12% for the methyl esters and 0.29% for biodiesels. An extension of this model to high pressures is also proposed and tested with success, presenting an OARD of 1.0% for six biodiesel fuels. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The concept of waste-to-energy (WtE) with regards to the utilization of byproducts from the bioethanol industry (e.g., distiller's dried grain with solubles: DDGS) was employed to enhance the renewability of biodiesel, which would be an initiative stage of a biorefinery due to the conjunction between bioethanol and biodiesel. For example, DDGS is a strong candidate for use as a biodiesel feedstock due to the tremendous amount that is regularly generated. On the basis of an estimation of possible lipid recovery from DDGS, ∼30% of the biodiesel feedstock demand in 2010 could be supported by the total DDGS generation in the same year. Considering the future expansion of the bioethanol industry up to 2020, the possible lipid recovery from DDGS would provide more than 6 times the biodiesel feedstock demand in 2010. In order to enhance the renewability of biodiesel, the transformation of lipid extracted from DDGS into fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) via a noncatalytic transesterification reaction under ambient pressure was investigated in this work. The newly introduced method reported here enables the combination of the esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) and the transesterification of triglycerides into a single step. This was achieved in the presence of a porous material (i.e., charcoal), and the optimal conditions for transformation into biodiesel via this noncatalytic method were assessed at the fundamental level. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biomass fast pyrolysis is considered as a promising route to produce liquid for the transportation field from a renewable resource. However, the derived bio-oils are mainly oxygenated (45–50%w/w O on a wet basis) and contain almost no hydrocarbons. Therefore, upgrading is necessary to obtain a liquid with lower oxygen content and characterization of oxygenated compounds in these products is essential to assist conversion reactions. For this purpose, comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC× GC) can be investigated. Oxygen speciation in such matrices is hampered by the large diversity of oxygenated families and the complexity of the hydrocarbon matrix. Moreover, response factors must be taken into account for oxygenate quantification as the Flame Ionisation Detector (FID) response varies when a molecule contains heteroatoms. To conclude, no distillation cuts were accessible and the analysis had to cover a large range of boiling points (30–630 °C). To take up this analytical challenge, a thorough optimization approach was developed. In fact, four GC× GC column sets were investigated to separate oxygenated compounds from the hydrocarbon matrix. Both model mixtures and the upgraded biomass flash pyrolysis oil were injected using GC× GC-FID to reach a suitable chromatographic separation. The advantages and drawbacks of each column combination for oxygen speciation in upgraded bio-oils are highlighted in this study. Among the four sets, an original polar× semi-polar column combination was selected and enabled the identification by GC× GC-ToF/MS of more than 40 compounds belonging to eight chemical families: ketones, furans, alcohols, phenols, carboxylic acids, guaiacols, anisols, and esters. For quantification purpose, the GC× GC-FID chromatogram was divided into more than 60 blobs corresponding to the previously identified analyte and hydrocarbon zones. A database associating each blob to a molecule and its specific response factor (determined by standards injection at different concentrations) was created. A detailed molecular quantification by GC× GC-FID was therefore accessible after integration of the corrected normalized areas. This paper aims to present a detail level in terms of characterization of oxygenated compounds in upgraded bio-oils which to our knowledge has never been reached so far. It is based on an original column set selection and an extremely accurate quantification procedure. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Conventional diesel and soybean-based biodiesel blends were analyzed as the fuel of a direct injection (DI) compression ignition engine in order to investigate their performance and suitability. The tests were conducted on an air-cooled single cylinder DI diesel engine. Engine torque, brake power, and brake-specific fuel consumption results associated with each of these fuel blends were collected under certain operating conditions. The CO2, CO, and NOx emissions were measured and the in-cylinder pressure was collected and analyzed. The performance characteristics of soybean-diesel blends were similar to those of conventional diesel fuel and the blends showed slightly higher torque and power output compared to the conventional diesel fuel. The results indicate that the soybean ester has great potential as an alternative fuel for diesel engines. © TÜBİTAK.

AB  - The operating characteristics of a single-cylinder four-stroke variable compression ratio engine fueled with esterified tamanu oil were investigated. The suitability of esterified Tamanu oil produced from pinnai oil by transesterification process has been studied in variable compression ratio engine. Experiment has been conducted at various loads like 0 kg, 3 kg, 6 kg, 9 kg, and 12 kg with engine speed of 1500 rpm and at compression ratio varies from 14:1 to 18:1. The impact of compression ratio on fuel consumption, combustion parameters, and exhaust gas emissions is investigated. In order to vary the compression ratio, the clearance volume is changed geometrically by tilting cylinder block arrangement. The performance characteristics like specific fuel consumption, brake power, mean effective pressure, brake thermal efficiencies, and exhaust gas temperature are analyzed for Tamanu oil in the variable compression ratio engine. The emission characteristics like hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide emissions are also measured for Tamanu oil in the same engine. The effect of intake valve closing event-timing modulation on effective compression ratio was also investigated. The motivation behind this analysis was to fix the effective compression ratio for biodiesel. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A novel mechanistic model is presented that describes the aerobic biodegradation kinetics of soybean biodiesel and petroleum diesel in batch experiments. The model was built on the assumptions that biodegradation takes place in the aqueous phase according to Monod kinetics, and that the substrate dissolution kinetics at the oil/water interface is intrinsically fast compared to biodegradation kinetics. Further, due to the very low aqueous solubility of these compounds, the change in the substrate aqueous-phase concentration over time was assumed to approaches zero, and that substrate aqueous concentration remains close to the saturation level while the non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) is still significant. No former knowledge of the saturation substrate concentration (Ssat) and the Monod half-saturation constant (Ks) was required, as the term Ssat/(Ks + Ssat) in the Monod equation remained constant during this phase. The n-alkanes C10-C24 of petroleum diesel were all utilized at a relatively constant actual specific utilization rate of 0.01-0.02 mg-alkane/mg-biomass-hr, while the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) of biodiesel were utilized at actual specific rates significantly higher with increasing carbon chain length and lower with increasing number of double bonds. The results were found to be in agreement with kinetic, genetic, and metabolic evidence reported in the literature pertaining to microbial decay rates, uptake mechanisms, and the metabolic pathway by which these compounds are assimilated into microorganisms. The presented model can be applied, without major modifications, to estimate meaningful kinetic parameters from batch experiments, as well as near source zone field application. We suggest the estimated actual microbial specific utilization rate (kC) of such materials to be a better measure of the degradation rate when compared to the maximum specific utilization rate (k), which might be orders of magnitude higher than kC and might never be observed in reality. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Phase behavior was observed for the systems bio-oil + diesel + carbon dioxide and bio-oil + tail water + carbon dioxide at temperatures from 353.15 K to 423.15 K and within the pressure range from 0.1 MPa to 49.0 MPa. First, equilibria was observed at ambient pressure and temperatures of 353.15 K, 383.15 K, and 423.15 K in a glass flask, which was heated by an electric heater. Afterward the equilibria was observed under elevated pressures in an optical cell (up to 49.0 MPa) and temperatures of 353.15 K, 383.15 K, and 423.15 K. It was discovered that the system bio-oil + diesel + carbon dioxide is immiscible under ambient pressure and temperatures of 353.15 K, 383.15 and 423.15 K. The complete miscibility of bio-oil and diesel in the presence of CO2 could be at temperature 353.15 K detected at pressures above 49.0 MPa, while at temperature of 383.15 K the transition from a dual liquid to a single liquid system was detected at 27.0 MPa. It could be concluded that the miscibility of bio-oil + diesel system in the presence of CO2 depends highly on pressure. Additionally, data on solubility of carbon dioxide in tail water and solubility of carbon dioxide in diesel fuel are presented. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Finite supplies of petroleum-based fossil fuels, in addition to concerns about carbon emissions and energy security, have driven the search for alternative fuels that can be produced from renewable resources. Butanol, pentanol and their isomers have significant advantages over ethanol as a biofuel and these can be produced by fermentation. Results: We demonstrate that yeast can be engineered to produce isobutanol by fermentation of carbohydrate precursors. This was achieved by increasing flux through the valine biosynthetic pathway in addition to decreasing pyruvate decarboxylase activity and increasing the availability of NADPH. We found no initial improvement in isobutanol production by deleting BAT1, LEU4 and LEU9, genes encoding enzymes predicted to compete with isobutanol synthesis. Conclusion: Yeast has potential as a factory for the production of higher alcohol biofuels; however, substantial engineering will be required to achieve economically viable production levels. © 2013 Future Science Ltd.

AB  - The production of first generation biofuels, such as sunflower-based biodiesel, is potentially an option for diversifying the energy matrix in several South American countries. However, biofuels present environmental challenges, especially concerning the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study, using a life-cycle approach, evaluates the GHG emissions and energy balance of the future nationwide production of sunflower-based biodiesel in Chile. Direct land use change is included in the analysis. The overall findings indicate that sunflower biodiesel, under the most likely production conditions, will have better environmental performance than fossil diesel in terms of both indicators. The agricultural stage is associated to key factors such as land use change, and nitrogen fertilizers. These factors contribute significantly to GHG emissions or energy demand in the biodiesel life cycle. The sensitivity analysis shows that no GHG emission saving could occur if nitrogen fertilizers rate exceeds 330 kg N/ha. In order to reduce the environmental impacts of this biofuel, improvement measures are suggested. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - There is considerable interest in both soy and canola as biodiesel feedstock crops because of the net reduction in CO2 emissions resulting from the use of biodiesel in place of petroleum diesel. Whether these two crops differ in net CO2 savings is unknown, in part because of our ignorance of their impact on soil C. We, therefore, monitored soil C for three years in an experiment that included both soy and canola rotations. We found that soil C concentrations were significantly lower under canola than soy, and that the difference represented as much as 64% of the C savings of soy biodiesel over petroleum diesel. We tested two hypotheses that could explain this difference in soil C. First, because canola can acidify the soil, we determined whether a reduction in inorganic C (as carbonate) in canola plots could account for the soil C difference. Carbonate concentration did not differ significantly in soy and canola plots. Second, we determined whether soil organic matter concentration could account for the soil C difference. Soil organic matter concentration was significantly lower in canola than in soy plots, accounting for the difference in soil C. We further hypothesized that because soy is mycorrhizal and canola is not, soy soils should contain higher concentrations of glomalin, a recalcitrant substance produced by mycorrhizal fungi, and that this could help to explain the difference in soil organic matter. Glomalin concentrations were significantly lower in canola plots, but this difference accounted for only a fraction of the total soil C difference. Our results suggest that a proper accounting of life cycle C savings of biodiesel when used in place of petroleum diesel must consider soil C. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Background: Microbial lipid production by using lignocellulosic biomass as the feedstock holds a great promise for biodiesel production and biorefinery. This usually involves hydrolysis of biomass into sugar-rich hydrolysates, which are then used by oleaginous microorganisms as the carbon and energy sources to produce lipids. However, the costs of microbial lipids remain prohibitively high for commercialization. More efficient and integrated processes are pivotal for better techno-economics of microbial lipid technology. Results: Here we describe the simultaneous saccharification and enhanced lipid production (SSELP) process that is highly advantageous in terms of converting cellulosic materials into lipids, as it integrates cellulose biomass hydrolysis and lipid biosynthesis. Specifically, Cryptococcus curvatus cells prepared in a nutrient-rich medium were inoculated at high dosage for lipid production in biomass suspension in the presence of hydrolytic enzymes without auxiliary nutrients. When cellulose was loaded at 32.3 g/L, cellulose conversion, cell mass, lipid content and lipid coefficient reached 98.5%, 12.4 g/L, 59.9% and 204 mg/g, respectively. Lipid yields of the SSELP process were higher than those obtained by using the conventional process where cellulose was hydrolyzed separately. When ionic liquid pretreated corn stover was used, both cellulose and hemicellulose were consumed simultaneously. No xylose was accumulated over time, indicating that glucose effect was circumvented. The lipid yield reached 112 mg/g regenerated corn stover. This process could be performed without sterilization because of the absence of auxiliary nutrients for bacterial contamination. Conclusions: The SSELP process facilitates direct conversion of both cellulose and hemicellulose of lignocellulosic materials into microbial lipids. It greatly reduces time and capital costs while improves lipid coefficient. Optimization of the SSELP process at different levels should further improve the efficiency of microbial lipid technology, which in turn, promote the biotechnological production of fatty acid-derived products from lignocellulosic biomass. © 2013 Gong et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Biofuels extracted from the seeds of Camelina sativa have recently been used successfully as environmentally friendly jet-fuel to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Camelina sativa is genetically very close to Arabidopsis thaliana, and both are members of the Brassicaceae. Although public databases are currently available for some members of the Brassicaceae, such as A. thaliana, A. lyrata, Brassica napus, B. juncea and B. rapa, there are no public Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) or genomic data for Camelina sativa. In this study, a high-throughput, large-scale RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of the Camelina sativa transcriptome was carried out to generate a database that will be useful for further functional analyses.Results: Approximately 27 million clean " reads" filtered from raw reads by removal of adaptors, ambiguous reads and low-quality reads (2.42 gigabase pairs) were generated by Illumina paired-end RNA-seq technology. All of these clean reads were assembled de novo into 83,493 unigenes and 103,196 transcripts using SOAPdenovo and Trinity, respectively. The average length of the transcripts generated by Trinity was 697 bp (N50 = 976), which was longer than the average length of unigenes (319 bp, N50 = 346 bp). Nonetheless, the assembly generated by SOAPdenovo produced similar number of non-redundant hits (22,435) with that of Trinity (22,433) in BLASTN searches of the Arabidopsis thaliana CDS sequence database (TAIR). Four public databases, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Swiss-prot, NCBI non-redundant protein (NR), and the Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), were used for unigene annotation; 67,791 of 83,493 unigenes (81.2%) were finally annotated with gene descriptions or conserved protein domains that were mapped to 25,329 non-redundant protein sequences. We mapped 27,042 of 83,493 unigenes (32.4%) to 119 KEGG metabolic pathways.Conclusions: This is the first report of a transcriptome database for Camelina sativa, an environmentally important member of the Brassicaceae. We showed that C. savita is closely related to Arabidopsis spp. and more distantly related to Brassica spp. Although the majority of annotated genes had high sequence identity to those of A. thaliana, a substantial proportion of disease-resistance genes (NBS-encoding LRR genes) were instead more closely similar to the genes of other Brassicaceae; these genes included BrCN, BrCNL, BrNL, BrTN, BrTNL in B. rapa. As plant genomes are under long-term selection pressure from environmental stressors, conservation of these disease-resistance genes in C. sativa and B. rapa genomes implies that they are exposed to the threats from closely-related pathogens in their natural habitats. © 2013 Liang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - This paper addresses the optimal design and operation of hydrocarbon biorefinery via fast pyrolysis, hydrotreating and hydrocracking of hybrid poplar feedstock under economic and environmental criteria. The hydrocarbon biorefinery encompasses fast pyrolysis for crude bio-oil production, upgrading of the bio-oil through hydrotreating, separation and hydrocracking of long chained hydrocarbons into gasoline and diesel range products, and steam reforming for hydrogen production. We propose a bi-criteria nonlinear programming (NLP) model that seeks to maximize the economic performance measured by the net present value (NPV) and to minimize the environmental impacts. The environmental objective is measured with the global warming potential (GWP) metric according to the life cycle assessment procedures, which covers gate-to-gate environmental impacts of the hydrocarbon biorefinery. The multiobjective NLP model simultaneously determines the production capacity, size of each process units, operational conditions, the flow rates of species and streams at each stage of the process, hydrocarbon biofuel yields, and consumption rate of feedstock, steam, electricity, and natural gas. The bi-criteria NLP model is solved with the e{open}-constraint method, and the resulting Pareto-optimal curve reveals the trade-off between the economic and environmental dimensions of the sustainable hydrocarbon biorefinery. The optimization results reveal that the unit production cost of the hydrocarbon biofuels is $2.31 per gallon of gasoline equivalent (GGE) for the maximum NPV solution and $3.67/GGE for the minimum GWP design. The corresponding greenhouse emission is 8.07kgCO2-eq/GGE. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Future automotive fuels are expected to contain significant quantities of bio-components. This poses a great challenge to the designers of novel low-CO2 internal combustion engines because biofuels have very different properties to those of most typical hydrocarbons. The current article presents results of firing a direct-injection spark-ignition optical research engine on ethanol and butanol and comparing those to data obtained with gasoline and iso-octane. A multihole injector, located centrally in the combustion chamber, was used with all fuels. Methane was also employed by injecting it into the inlet plenum to provide a benchmark case for well-mixed "homogeneous" charge preparation. The study covered stoichiometric and lean mixtures (λ = 1.0 and λ = 1.2), various spark advances (30-50° CA), a range of engine temperatures (20-90°C), and diverse injection strategies (single and "split" triple). In-cylinder gas sampling at the spark-plug location and at a location on the pent-roof wall was also carried out using a fast flame ionization detector to measure the equivalence ratio of the in-cylinder charge and identify the degree of stratification. Combustion imaging was performed through a full-bore optical piston to study the effect of injection strategy on late burning associated with fuel spray wall impingement. Combustion with single injection was fastest for ethanol throughout 20-90°C, but butanol and methane were just as fast at 90°C; iso-octane was the slowest and gasoline was between iso-octane and the alcohols. At 20°C, λ at the spark plug location was 0.96-1.09, with gasoline exhibiting the largest and iso-octane the lowest value. Ethanol showed the lowest degree of stratification and butanol the largest. At 90°C, stratification was lower for most fuels, with butanol showing the largest effect. The work output with triple injection was marginally higher for the alcohols and lower for iso-octane and gasoline (than with single injection), but combustion stability was worse for all fuels. Triple injection produced a lower degree of stratification, with leaner λ at the spark plug than single injection. Combustion imaging showed much less luminous late burning with tripe injection. In terms of combustion stability, the alcohols were more robust to changes in fueling (λ = 1.2) than the liquid hydrocarbons. © 2013 Copyright J. Serras-Pereira, P. G. Aleiferis, and D. Richardson.

AB  - It is well known that the used cooking oil (UCO) is responsible for the high pollution found in groundwater, fact that leads to increase treatment cost of wastewater, moreover, the environmental problems produced by the use of diesel fuel increase the need of seeking alternatives to decrease this problems by means of the reuse of UCO, finding a cleaner alternative fuel. Biofuel such as biodiesel is considered as one of this alternative having environmental advantage due to decrease of pollutant emissions in diesel engines. Biodiesel from UCO is produced throughout the transesterification reaction, using alcohol and a catalyst. This paper reports the effect of temperature, alcohol/oil molar ratio, and catalyst amount used over the yield of the transesterification reaction using oil from hotel industry. The homogeneous catalysts was based in NaOH from 0.5 and 0.7% by weight, the range operation temperatures were between 50 and 60 °C, with molar ratio alcohol / oil 6/1 and 9/1. Quite high yield values were shown, among 83 and 95%, with a statistical error of less than 0.5. © 2013, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

AB  - Models for estimation of the cetane number of biodiesel from their methyl ester composition using artificial neural networks were obtained in this work. An experimental data that covers 48 and 15 biodiesels in the modeling step and validation step respectively were taken. The selection of biodiesel samples took into account a wide range of ester compounds with different unsaturation characteristics and number of carbon atoms. A model to predict cetane number using artificial neural networks was obtained with better accuracy than 95 %. The best neural network for predict the cetane number was a backpropagation network (11:4:1) using a Conjugate Gradient Descend algorithm for the second training step and showing 96.3 % of correlation for the validation data and a mean absolute error of 1.5. The proposed network is useful for prediction of the cetane number of biodiesel in a wide range of composition but keeping the percent of total unsaturations lower than 80 %. The use of the artificial neural networks in this case let to study and understands the effect of individual fatty acids in the cetane number. Therefore they can be used for improving some biofuel properties related to the combustion process and its efficiency. © 2013, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

AB  - In this study, it was performed a comparison of the performance and emissions of two methyl ester fuels: one obtained from animal fat and the other from crude canola oil, in a compression-ignition engine against diesel fuel. The experimental results compared with diesel fuel showed that significant reductions could be obtained by biodiesel derived from animal fat in carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen emissions. Carbon dioxide emissions showed a trend of decreasing with the biodiesel fuels. An increase in brake specific fuel consumption was observed for different biodiesel fuels when compared with diesel fuel. It was concluded that animal tallow methyl ester performed better than canola oil methyl ester, whereas slightly higher brake torque is observed with canola oil methyl ester. © 2012 CEERS, IAU.

AB  - Purpose: This paper performs a life cycle assessment study for a white wine produced in the northern part of Portugal, i.e. the white vinho verde. The purpose is to identify the environmental impacts occurring along the wine life cycle as well as the stages that mostly contribute to the environmental impact, as well as the associated causes. The stages considered include: (1) viticulture, (2) wine production (vinification to storage), (3) wine distribution and (4) bottles production. Methods: The consumption of materials and energy, as well as the emissions to air, soil and water from the wine campaign of 2008/2009 were reported to the functional unit (0.75 l of white vinho verde). A Portuguese company that produces about 25 % of the current total production of white vinho verde supplied specific life cycle data for the stages of viticulture, wine production and distribution. SimaPro and the Ecoinvent database were used to perform the environmental assessment using CML 2001 impact methodology. A sensitivity analysis for a set of significant parameters was performed. Results: Results show that for viticulture the contribution of each impact category is larger than 50 %. The production of bottles is the second contributor varying from about 4 % (to eutrophication) to 26 % (to acidification). Wine production and distribution are the subsequent contributors. The contribution of wine production varies between 0.6 % (to land competition) and about 13 % (from marine aquatic and sediment ecotoxicity 100a). The contribution of distribution is up to 14 % (to photochemical oxidation). Sensitivity analysis shows that significant changes are calculated for parameters as the nitrate leaching to groundwater, the emission of nitrous oxide from managed soil, and from runoff and leaching. Changes in these parameters are significant for only a few impact categories as eutrophication and global warming. Conclusions: Viticulture is the stage with the largest relative contribution to the overall environmental impact and the bottle production is the subsequent stage. In order to improve the environmental performance of the supply chain for wine, it is necessary to optimise the dosage of fertilisers and phytosanitary products used during viticulture. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the most influential parameters relate with the emission of nitrogen compounds associated with the use of fertilisers. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Dual pressures currently arising from energy shortage and environmental degradation worldwide make it critically important to utilize renewable biomass resources for energy. But due to the requirement for the safety of food and feed, triglyceride feedstocks (currently derived mainly from vegetable oils and animal fats) and lignocellulose among the various kinds of naturally-occurring biomass are practical sources for production of liquid biofuels instead of fossil fuels. In this respect, we review the recent progress in the transformation of triglyceride feedstocks and lignocellulose into liquid biofuels by different catalytic routes. These routes include thermal cracking, hydrogenation and transesterification for oils and fats, and gasification-Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, liquefaction-upgrading and selective synthesis via platform chemicals for lignocellulose. The catalysts and processes involved in these catalytic routes are intensively discussed, and their existing problems and possible solutions are addressed, which may provide insights helpful for further studies on the more efficient utilization of biomass for energy.

AB  - U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is a mandatory policy for promoting the utilization of biofuels in road transpiration sector in order to reduce the country's dependency on foreign oil and greenhouse gas emissions. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines the proportion of renewable fuels according to RFS annual target, and requests obligated parties such like fossil fuel refiner, blenders and importer in the U.S. to complete Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) every year. Obligated parties prove they have achieved their RVO through a renewable fuels certification system, which generates Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) for every gallon of qualified renewable fuels produced or imported into U.S., RINs is a key for tracking renewable fuel consumption, which in turn is a key for implementing the RFS in the U.S., separated RINs can be freely traded in market and obligated parties could fulfill their RVO through buying RINs from other stakeholders. This briefing paper highlights RFS policy implementing mechanism and marketing tracking, mainly describes importance of RINs, and the method for generating and tracking RINs by both government and fuels industry participants. © 2013 Chin J Biotech, All rights reserved.

AB  - The emission characteristics of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in exhaust particles from a diesel car were studied. In the experiment, pure diesel fuel and B10 fuel with a biodiesel blend ratio of 10% were chosen. The gaseous emissions of HC, CO and NOx under New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) were measured, and exhaust particulate matter (PM) samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The emission characteristics of PAHs in exhaust particles were highlighted. The results show that the emission concentrations of HC, CO, NOx, and PM decreased when the diesel car used B10 fuel. Fluoranthene and pyrene were dominant in PAHs of PM emissions when the diesel car used pure diesel or B10 fuel. Compared to pure diesel, there was a slight increase in low-ring PAHs emissions when the diesel car used B10 fuel. On the contrary, PAHs emissions in middle and high-ring declined significantly. Besides, Benzo[a]pyrene equivalent toxicity analysis results show that the BEQs of B10 fuel decreased by 21.6% compared to pure diesel. That means the toxicity of PAHs in exhaust particles declined when the diesel car used biodiesel fuel.

AB  - Algal biomass can serve as rich source of bioproducts including lipids for diverse commercial applications. Both biomass production and lipid accumulation are limited by several factors, of which nutrients play a vital role. In the present investigation, the nutritional requirement for the growth by a (an autotrophic) Chlorococcum infusionum was determined using a Plackett-Burman based statistical screening experiment. Five out of the fifteen factors of a reported production medium were found to be significantly affecting the biomass growth. The components NaNO3, K2HPO4, FeSO4.7H2O and KOH had direct proportional correlation with biomass production, while MgSO4 showed inverse proportional relationship in the selected experimental range. Nitrogen was the most influential factor with an effect contribution of 45.77% and a very low p-value of &lt;0.001. The most favorable nitrogen source was potassium nitrate which could replace both sodium nitrate and potassium hydroxide. More than two fold increase in biomass concentration was achieved by screening and standardizing the media components of Bold Basal Medium. Lipid accumulation under normal condition was 12-15% dry cell weight (dcw). Under nitrogen starvation condition, it was 30-35% dcw. However, a semi-starvation condition at 1.75mM of sodium nitrate induced lipid production as high as 40±2% dcw. FAME analysis in GC showed the presence of more saturated fatty acids. Results obtained in this work can further be applied to optimize production of algal biomass and lipid for applications like biofuel, fish or animal feed, fertilizer, etc. Also information obtained could be exploited for wastewater treatment processes. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Through a micro-level study of a biofuel-related land acquisition in rural Tamil Nadu, India, this article reveals how state-subject relations are shaping modern land deal politics. Through its political construction of the concept of 'wasteland' and its associated wasteland development programme, the Indian state has facilitated a series of questionable land acquisitions, reshaping agrarian livelihoods in the process. A class of land brokers has emerged to help carry out the state's project of converting 'wastelands' to more 'productive', state-defined uses such as biofuel cultivation and industrial expansion. Those whose lands have been acquired as part of these programmes have undergone a transition to wage labour, increasing the prolitarianization of agrarian communities. By documenting the mechanics of this 'wasteland governmentality', this study contributes to a political sociology of the state by unpacking the linkages between the state and agrarian subjects in the context of the 'global land grab'. © 2013 International Institute of Social Studies.

AB  - The proposed analytical method allows for simultaneous determination by GC using a programed temperature vaporization injector and a flame ionization detector of the main reaction components (i.e. glycerol, methyl esters, mono-, di-, and triacylglycerols) in the reaction mixture during biodiesel production. The suggested method is convenient for the rapid and simple evaluation of the kinetic data gained during the transesterification reaction and, also partially serves as an indicator of the quality of biodiesel and mainly, as the indicator of the efficiency of the whole production process (i.e. the conversion of triacylglycerols to biodiesel and its time progress). The optimization of chromatographic conditions (e.g. the oven temperature program, injector setting, amount of derivatization reagent, and the derivatization reaction time) was performed. The method has been validated with crude samples of biodiesel made from waste-cooking oils in terms of linearity, precision, accuracy, sensitivity, and limits of detection and quantification. The results confirmed a satisfactory degree of accuracy and repeatability (the mean RSDs were usually below 2%) necessary for the reliable quantitative determination of all components in the considerable concentration range (e.g. 10-1100 μg/mL in case of methyl esters). Compound recoveries ranging from 96 to 104% were obtained. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - The large-scale industrial agriculture that provides the majority of food at present is dependent upon fossil fuels in the form of tractor fuel, mineral fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation. Yet, the age of cheap and abundant fossil fuels will likely come to an end within the coming decades. In this case study, the productivity of a small-scale farm (8 ha arable land, 5.5 ha meadow, 3.5 ha pasture and 18 ha forest) independent on fossil fuels by using organic methods and draught horse power was investigated. The aim was to quantify its productivity when the animal composition and possible alternatives to tractive power were varied. After an analysis of possible solutions, three scenarios for tractive power were selected: draught horse power, diesel tractor, and combination of draught horse power and rapeseed oil fueled tractor. A model that calculates the amount of food available at the farm in terms of meat, milk egg, and crops, converts it into energy units and calculates how many people can be supplied from the farm was developed. The most reasonable of the scenarios studied was when draught horse power was combined with tractor (and combine harvester) driven on locally produced rapeseed oil. Then the farm will have access to all advantages with the tractor and harvester, e.g., timeliness in harvest and lifting heavy loads, and the renewability and efficiency of draught horse power on smaller fields, and lighter operations. This system was able to support between 66 and 82 persons depending on crop yields, milk yields, meat production, fuel demand for the tractor, and availability of forest grazing. Most likely the production capacity lands on ability to support approximately 68-70 persons, and the farm may require fossil fuels to support more than 80 persons. If all farmland globally was to be operated with the same productivity, this would be enough for supplying the global population with food at present. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Carbon (neutral) based renewable liquid biofuels are alternative to petroleum derived transport fuels that contribute to global warming and are of a limited availability. Microalgae based biofuels are considered as promising source of energy. Lyngbya sp. and Synechococcus sp. were studied for the possibility of biodiesel production in different media such as ASNIII, sea water enrichment medium and BG11. The sea water enrichment medium was found superior in enhancing the growth rate of these microalgae. Nitrogen depletion has less effect in total chlorophyll a content, at the same time the lipid content was increased in both Lyngbya sp. and Synechococcus sp. by 1.4 and 1.2 % respectively. Increase in salinity from 0.5-1.0 M also showed an increase in the lipid content to 2.0 and 0.8 % in these strains; but a salinity of 1.5 M has a total inhibitory effect in the growth. The total biomass yield was comparatively higher in tubular LED photobioreactor than the fluorescent flat plated photobioreactor. Lipid extraction was obtained maximum at 60 oC in 1:10 sample: solvent ratio. GC-MS analysis of biodiesel showed high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; 4.86 %) than saturated fatty acid (SFA; 4.10 %). Biodiesel production was found maximum in Synechococcus sp. than Lyngbya sp. The viscosity of the biodiesel was closely related to conventional diesel. The results strongly suggest that marine microalgae could be used as a renewable energy source for biodiesel production.

AB  - This study quantifies the monitored in-vehicle contaminants of carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) under varying climatic conditions using advanced statistical methods of regression trees and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The independent influential variables affecting vehicular CO2 and CO are first identified by using regression trees after considering meteorology, monitoring periods, indoor sources, on-road vehicles, and ventilation. Next, ANOVA is used as a complementary analysis to regression tree results to determine the statistical significance of the identified influential variables and to prioritize the statistically significant variables based on the F value. Passenger ridership and month are observed to have a predominant influence on in-vehicle CO2, while month and sky conditions showed a predominant influence on vehicular CO levels. High passenger ridership on a warm/hot day with good ventilation resulted in high CO2 buildup inside the vehicle. High levels of CO are observed inside the vehicle during fall, spring, and summer months on overcast days, with low to medium indoor temperatures, moderate to good ventilating conditions, low indoor relative humidity, and low wind speeds. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This paper investigates market effects of the Brazilian biodiesel law, which made the use of biodiesel, blended with petroleum diesel, mandatory in Brazil. The study estimates the demand curve for diesel fuel (biodiesel and petroleum diesel) and the industry supply curve of biodiesel. These two pieces of information have been used in a static analysis to draw scenarios with different biodiesel mandates. The results show that the current proportion of biodiesel in the diesel mixture (5%) increases consumers' price by 1.7% and decreases the consumption by 1.5% compared to the scenario without biodiesel. Also, an increase in the biodiesel percentage to 10% would raise the price by 3.5% and reduce the consumption by 3%. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - California Governor's Executive Order (CGEO) S-3-05 requires that California greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions be reduced to 80 % below 1990 levels by the year 2050. Meeting this target will require drastic changes in transportation technology, fuel, and behavior which will reduce criteria pollutant emissions as well as GHG emissions. The improvement to local air quality caused by the reduced criteria pollutant emissions must be calculated to fully evaluate the overall benefits and costs of CGEO S-3-05. In the present study, seven different transportation scenarios that move towards the goals of CGEO S-3-05 in the transportation sector were examined to determine how they would affect future airborne particulate matter (PM2. 5) concentrations in California: (1) hydrogen fuel cells, (2) electric vehicles, (3) high efficiency vehicles, (4) public mass transit, (5) biofuels, (6) biofuels + hybrid electric vehicles, and (7) hydrogen fuel cells + electric vehicles. The air quality implications of each scenario were evaluated using a chemical transport model applied during a wintertime stagnation episode representing future climate in California. Scenarios (6) and (7) reduced population-weighted PM2. 5 mass concentrations by ~9 % and PM2. 5 elemental carbon (EC) concentrations by ~30 % relative to base-case predictions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Deactivation mechanisms of copper chromite (CuCr2O 4ṡCuO) catalyst for vapor-phase selective hydrogenation for furfuryl alcohol have been investigated using ex situ and in situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS), and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). At 200 °C, the catalyst steadily deactivated. One of the dominant origins of catalyst deactivation is poisoning due to strong adsorption of polymeric species formed from the reactant and/or products. Metallic Cu is identified as the active site, while loss of active Cu(I) sites due to hydrogenation is not a deactivation cause, as opposed to previous literature reported. The copper chromite catalyst showed low activity at 300 °C process temperature. Under this condition, the Cu particle size does not change, but Cr/Cu ratio increases by 50%, suggesting that Cr coverage of Cu sites becomes an additional cause of catalyst deactivation at this temperature, along with the poisoning deactivation mechanism at 200 °C. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study presents an experimental effort and detailed numerical simulation of the burning process of an ester-based biodiesel fuel droplet - methyl decanoate (MD). The experiments are carried out using test droplets that are anchored to small SiC support structures (14. μm diameter) and that burn in an ambience subjected to a low gravity level to promote spherical symmetry in the droplet burning process. The initial droplet diameters are 0.53-0.57. mm and the combustion gas is normal atmospheric pressure air. A detailed numerical simulation of the burning process is also presented that features detailed MD combustion chemistry, radiative heat transfer, species diffusion, and phase change effects to predict the evolution of droplet and flame diameter. The analysis also incorporates a model for heat transfer through the droplet support structure. Predicted droplet and flame diameters are shown to agree within the range of uncertainty of the experimental data lending support to the transport model and combustion kinetics incorporated in the simulation. Effects of the tether fiber's size, thermal conductivity, and Nusselt number on the droplet burning data are also examined. Results show that the fiber properties within the range investigated in this study do not significantly affect the burning process. Species and temperature distributions during the transient process of MD droplet combustion are detailed in this study. These comparisons and predictions for multi-phase combustion of MD that have not been seen in the literature provide validation for MD models associated with chemical kinetics and multi-physics and are therefore valuable for the study of ester-based biodiesel combustion. © 2012 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - This study optimized the conversion of animal fat wastes into ethylic biodiesel by alkali-catalyzed process under mild conditions. A mix of chicken and swine fat residues was used as feedstock for biodiesel production. A full 33 factorial design was used to optimize process parameters for maximum fatty acid ethyl esters yield. Factors were evaluated at three different levels: temperature (30; 50; 70 °C), ethanol:fat molar ratio (6:1; 7:1; 8:1) and catalyst concentration (0.44; 0.88; 1.32 wt.%). Effects of the process variables were analyzed using response surface methodology. Moreover, optimum conditions were applied in a bench-scale reactor and biofuel produced was characterized. It was observed that at high temperatures (50 and 70 °C), phase separation between biodiesel and glycerol was impaired. Although high conversion was achieved (96.2%) at 70 °C, this condition is not recommended because no spontaneous phase separation was verified. On the other hand, 30 °C was identified as the best temperature for biodiesel ethanolysis, using 0.96 wt.% catalyst and 7:1 ethanol:fat molar ratio. With these conditions, it is possible to achieve around 83% conversion. Despite the oxidative stability and total glycerin, biodiesel measured properties agreed with quality requirements established by Official Regulations (ASTM 6751 and EN 14214). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In order to evaluate the Camelina sativa biodiesel (CSB) as a viable biofuel alternative, a comprehensive characterisation was performed based on the European and the American standards (EN 14214 and ASTM D6751). For the first time, more than thirty parameters was analysed. The results show that C. sativa oil contains approximately 90% unsaturated fatty acids. This unusual fatty acid pattern is the result of the abundance of C18:1 (12.8-14.7%), C18:2 (16.3-17.2%), C18:3 (36.2-39.4%) and C20:1 (14.0-15.5%) fatty acids. The high C18:3 content is incompatible with EN 14214 specifications and negatively affects biodiesel properties such as the cetane number, the iodine value, the oxidation stability and the linolenic acid methyl ester content. Other critical parameters are the atmospheric equivalent temperature (AET, 90% recovered) and the polyunsaturated (≥4 double bonds) methyl ester content. For these reasons, C. sativa biodiesel presents serious drawbacks for biodiesel applications, although could be good biodiesel feedstocks if the high degree of unsaturation and the molecular weight of the oil are reduced. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Production of biodiesel from non-edible oils is receiving increasing attention. Tung oil, called China wood oil is one kind of promising non-edible biodiesel oil in China. To our knowledge, tung oil has not been used to produce biodiesel by enzymatic method. The enzymatic production of biodiesel has been investigated extensively by using Rhizopus oryzae lipase as catalyst. However, the high cost of R. oryzae lipase remains a barrier for its industrial applications. Through different heterologous expression strategies and fermentation techniques, the highest expression level of the lipase from R. oryzae reached 1334 U/mL in Pichia pastoris, which is still not optimistic for industry applications. Results: The prosequence of lipases from Rhizopus sp. is very important for the folding and secretion of an active lipase. A chimeric lipase from R. oryzae was constructed by replacing the prosequence with that from the R. chinensis lipase and expressed in P. pastoris. The maximum activity of the chimera reached 4050 U/mL, which was 11 fold higher than that of the parent. The properties of the chimera were studied. The immobilized chimera was used successfully for biodiesel production from tung oil, which achieved higher FAME yield compared with the free chimeric lipase, non-chimeric lipase and mature lipase. By response surface methodology, three variables, water content, methanol to tung oil molar ratio and enzyme dosage were proved to be crucial parameters for biosynthesis of FAME and the FAME yield reached 91.9±2.5% at the optimized conditions by adding 5.66 wt.% of the initial water based on oil weight, 3.88 of methanol to tung oil molar ratio and 13.24 wt.% of enzyme concentration based on oil weight at 40°C. Conclusions: This is the first report on improving the expression level of the lipase from R. oryzae by replacing prosequences. The immobilized chimera was used successfully for biodiesel production from tung oil. Using tung oil as non-edible raw material and a chimeric lipase from R. oryzae as an economic catalyst make this study a promising one for biodiesel applications. © 2013 Yu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - A three-step bio-oil production process involving torrefaction pretreatment (225, 250, or 275 °C at 20 min hold time), pyrolysis (500 °C, two heating rates), and secondary catalytic processing over HZSM-5 (at 400, 450, or 500 °C) was studied to determine how treatments affected byproduct formation and catalyst properties and function. Torrefaction pretreatment significantly reduced average yields (%, w/w of feed) of reactor char (100% reduction), catalyst coke (21.4%), and catalyst tar (8.1%) relative to the best-case conditions using non-torrefied feedstock. The yields of chemical components, including levoglucosan, formic acid, acetic acid, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), were significantly reduced in intermediate fast-pyrolysis bio-oil (FPO) derived from torrefied feedstock, while for intermediate slow-pyrolysis bio-oil (SPO), yields of levoglucosan, acetic acid, and 5-HMF were reduced. However, in terms of concentration, only furfural showed a significant correlation with the torrefaction temperature. Both furfural and formic acid indicated correlations with coke formation, although these were negative correlations. For formic acid, a decreased coke yield with an increasing concentration was attributed to the formation of H2 from the thermal decomposition. Combined coke, char, and tar yield significantly decreased with an increasing torrefaction temperature, decreasing formic acid, acetic acid, and furfural concentrations, and an increasing levoglucosan concentration to a minimum of 14.4% (w/w of bio-oil feed). Torrefaction also increased catalyst effectiveness for minimizing changes to pore size, pore volume, and surface area upon upgrading FPO but reduced effectiveness for SPO processing. Torrefaction of biomass prior to slow pyrolysis more effectively maintained weak and strong acid site density after catalytic processing, although no clear effect of torrefaction was seen for FPO-processing catalysts. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

The reduction in coke (%, w/w of feed) as a result of torrefaction was 28.5% relative to the respective control for slow-pyrolysis bio-oil upgrading and 34.9% for fast-pyrolysis bio-oil upgrading. The concentration of aromatic product (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene, i.e., BTEX) was highest at 95 g L-1 for upgraded (at 500 °C) fast-pyrolysis bio-oil derived from biomass torrefied at 275 °C. Catalyst effectiveness for BTEX production significantly increased with increased torrefaction and catalytic cracking temperatures. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Compression ignition (CI) engine design is subject to many constraints, which present a multicriteria optimization problem that the engine researcher must solve. In particular, the modern CI engine must not only be efficient but must also deliver low gaseous, particulate, and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions so that its impact on urban air quality, human health, and global warming is minimized. Consequently, this study undertakes a multicriteria analysis, which seeks to identify alternative fuels, injection technologies, and combustion strategies that could potentially satisfy these CI engine design constraints. Three data sets are analyzed with the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations and Geometrical Analysis for Interactive Aid (PROMETHEE-GAIA) algorithm to explore the impact of (1) an ethanol fumigation system, (2) alternative fuels (20% biodiesel and synthetic diesel) and alternative injection technologies (mechanical direct injection and common rail injection), and (3) various biodiesel fuels made from 3 feedstocks (i.e., soy, tallow, and canola) tested at several blend percentages (20-100%) on the resulting emissions and efficiency profile of the various test engines. The results show that moderate ethanol substitutions (∼20% by energy) at moderate load, high percentage soy blends (60-100%), and alternative fuels (biodiesel and synthetic diesel) provide an efficiency and emissions profile that yields the most "preferred" solutions to this multicriteria engine design problem. Further research is, however, required to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) emissions with alternative fuels and to deliver technologies that do not significantly reduce the median diameter of particle emissions. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Ethyl valerate and pentyl valerate, suitable as a gasoline additive and diesel component respectively, can be obtained in a one pot one step reaction from γ-valerolactone, readily available from lignocellulosic biomass. The reaction takes place in ethanol under H2 through nucleophilic addition of the alcohol to the carboxylic group giving hydroxypentanoate, dehydration to pentenoate and hydrogenation to the saturated ester. The bifunctional catalyst used consists of a non noble metal, namely copper, supported on an amorphous weakly acidic material, therefore representing an interesting alternative to Pt-zeolite catalysts. Pentyl valerate can be obtained in one pot with conversions &gt;90% and selectivity up to 83%. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Diminishing fossil fuel resources, unstable/increasing prices of oil, environmental issues, global warming/climatic shifts, and allied problems have led the world to focus on alternate, environmental friendly, and renewable energy sources. Among many experimental candidates, production of biodiesel from Jatropha curcas L. has gained significant importance. More than 40 countries in the world are evaluating the potential of using this pure plant oil for manufacturing diesel. USEPA's action sets the 2013 volume at 1.28 billion gallons under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. With this premise, it is imperative to identify innovative technologies to handle Jatropha biomass and its efficient oil extraction for economical biofuel production. This study is aimed to make efficient screw expeller to cater massive Jatropha biomass for its oil extraction. A computational flow dynamics (CFD) simulation is performed to estimate the pressure developed inside the barrel through screw pressing when the feedstock is Jatropha seed. This CFD study has helped to determine the optimum values of important operating variables like rotations per minute (rpm), backpressure caused by frictional forces, and effect of changing feed flow rate on the performance of the expeller. The performance of the expeller is measured by power consumption, yield, and efficiency. Experimental validation of the simulation is used to improve oil expeller for Jatropha seed by fabricating the expeller after the analysis of design by ANSYS FLUENT codes. An oil yield in excess of 98%, as compared to a maximum 75% for existing screw expellers, was achieved in practical runs which is very promising. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - According to the International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook 2011, 60 per cent of the population in Africa, some 587 million people, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, lacked access to electricity in 2009. We developed a 6.5 kWe micro-trigeneration prototype, on the basis of internal combustion engine with pure Croton megalocarpus oil (CMO) fuelling, which configures a distributed energy system to generate power, heating and cooling from a single sustainable fuel source for remote users. Croton megalocarpus is an indigenous tree in East and South Africa which has recently attracted lots of interests as a biofuel source because of its high oil-yield rate. The direct and local use of CMO, instead of CMO biodiesel converted by the transesterification process, minimizes the carbon footprints left behind because of the simple fuel production of CMO. The experimental assessment proves that the prototype fuelled with CMO achieves similar efficiency as with diesel. Also, with the elevation of the oil injection temperature, the gaseous and particulate emissions of CMO could be ameliorated to some extent as improvement of the atomization in the spray and the combustion in the engine cylinder. © 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - We attempted to integrate lipase-catalyzed ethanolysis into fermentative bioethanol production. To produce bioethanol, ethanol fermentation from brown rice was conducted using a tetraploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing α-amylase and glucoamylase. The resultant ethanol was distilled and separated into three fractions with different concentrations of water and fusel alcohols. In ethanolysis using the first fraction with 89.3% ethanol, a recombinant Aspergillus oryzae whole-cell biocatalyst expressing Fusarium heterosporum lipase (r-FHL) afforded the highest ethyl ester content of 94.0% after 96. h. Owing to a high concentration of water in the bioethanol solutions, r-FHL, which works best in the presence of water when processing ethanolysis, was found to be more suitable for the integrative process than a commercial immobilized Candida antarctica lipase. In addition, r-FHL was used for repeated-batch ethanolysis, resulting in an ethyl ester content of more than 80% even after the fifth batch. Fusel alcohols such as 1-butanol and isobutyl alcohol are thought to decrease the lipase activity of r-FHL. Using this process, a high ethyl ester content was obtained by simply mixing bioethanol, plant oil, and lipase with an appropriate adjustment of water concentration. The developed process model, therefore, would contribute to biodiesel production from only biomass-derived feedstocks. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Biofuels have been the only alternative fuel which has substantially contributed to supplying transport with energy. Biofuels enjoyed broad support, but now they have come under criticism. In order to obtain answers to the question of what role biofuels could play in the future fuel mix, the following aspects are analysed: competing uses of scarce biomass and biofuels; sustainability of biofuels, standards and certification schemes; types and availability of biofuels; potentials for bioenergy and biofuels; and the technical compatibility of biofuels with vehicles. Finally, preconditions and necessary policy measures for the increased deployment of sustainable biofuels are examined. © 2013 ZBW and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bioethanol as regards to its carbon dioxide emissions. The production of the raw material accounts for more than 50 % of the total cost as well as having a significant part of greenhouse gases emitted during the entire process. For this reason, special emphasis is given to a change in agricultural land usage influenced by the demand of biofuel. Therefore, we have estimated the extent of policy influence according to its bioethanol cost-effectiveness. A case study on bioethanol production in an ex-sugar factory in the region of Thessaly, Greece, illustrates the above ideas. Methods: A partial equilibrium micro-economic model of regional supply in the arable farming system of Thessaly was coupled to industrial processing sub-models of bioethanol production from beets and grains. The maximisation of total welfare determines the most suitable crop mix for farmers as well as the lowest cost configurations for industry and, eventually, the minimal level of support by the government for biofuel activity to take off. The environmental performance is assessed under the life cycle assessment (LCA) framework following three interrelated phases: data inventory, data analysis and interpretation. The economic burden to society to support the activity divided by avoided CO2 eq. emissions indicates the bioethanol cost-effectiveness, in other words, the cost of greenhouse gases emissions savings. Results: The integrated agro-industry model has been parametrically run for a range of biofuel capacities. A change in direct land use results in lower emissions in the agricultural phase, since energy crops are a substitute for intensive cultivations, such as cotton and corn. A change in indirect land use moderates these estimations, as it takes in account imported food crops that are replaced by energy crops in the region. The savings in cost vary around 160 euros per ton of CO2 eq. for the basic agricultural policy scenario. The current policy that supports cotton production by means of increased coupled area payment has increased up to 30 % the cost of greenhouse gas savings due to bioethanol production. Conclusions: An integrated model, articulating the agricultural supply of biomass with ethanol processing, maximises the total surplus that is under constraints in order to determine the cost-effectiveness for different production levels. Results demonstrate that economic performances, as well as the environmental cost-effectiveness of bioethanol, are clearly affected by the parameters of agricultural policies. Therefore, bioenergy, environmental and economic performances, when based on LCA and the conceptual change in land usage, are context dependent. Agricultural policies for decoupling subsidies from production are in favour of cultivation in biomass for energy purposes. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Several factors contribute to the current increased focus on alternative fuels such as biodiesel, including an increasing awareness of the environmental impact of petrochemical (PC) oil products such as PC diesel, the continuously increasing price of PC oil, and the depletion of PC oil. For these reasons, the European Union has enacted a directive requiring each member state to ensure that the share of energy from renewable sources in transport be at least 10 % of the final consumption of energy by 2020 (The European Parliament and the Council 2009). This LCA study assesses the specific environmental impacts from the production and use of biodiesel as it is today (real-time), based on rapeseed oil and different types of alcohols, and using technologies that are currently available or will be available shortly. Different options are evaluated for the environmental improvement of production methods. The modeling of the LCA is based on a specific Danish biodiesel production facility. Methods: The functional unit is "1,000 km transportation for a standard passenger car." All relevant process stages are included, such as rapeseed production including carbon sequestration and N2O balances, and transportation of products used in the life cycle of biodiesel. System expansion has been used to handle allocation issues. Results and discussion: The climate change potential from the production and use of biodiesel today is 57 kg CO 2-eq/1,000 km, while PC diesel is 214 kg CO2-eq/1,000 km. Options for improvement include the increased use of residual straw from rapeseed fields for combustion in a power plant where carbon sequestration is considered, and a change in transesterification from a conventional process to an enzymatic process when using bioethanol instead of PC methanol. This research also evaluates results for land use, respiratory inorganics potential, human toxicity (carc) potential, ecotoxicity (freshwater) potential, and aquatic eutrophication (N) potential. Different sources for uncertainty are evaluated, and the largest drivers for uncertainty are the assumptions embedded into the substitution effects. The results presented should not be interpreted as a blueprint for the increased production of biodiesel but rather as a benchmarking point for the present, actual impact in a well-to-wheels perspective of biodiesel, with options for improving production and use. Conclusions: Based on this analysis, we recommend investigating additional options and incentives regarding the increased use of rape straw, particularly considering the carbon sequestration issues (from the perspective of potential climate change) of using bioalcohol instead of PC alcohol for the transesterification process. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Compared to gasoline engines, diesel engines are more suitable for the conversion to biodiesel application because they have no spark ignition system and also the cetane number of biodiesel is comparable to that of diesel. In this study, the spray behavior characteristics of palm oil biodiesel were analyzed by using a common-rail injection system of a commercial diesel engine and the characteristics were compared with that of diesel. The micro-characteristics of the spray behavior were analyzed by using a finite volume based commercial CFD program (ANSYS 13.0 CFX). The injection pressure and blend ratio of biodiesel-diesel were selected as the main study parameters. The injection pressure is varied in the range from 500 bar to 1600 bar, whereas the injection duration was fixed at 500 μs. The spray angle showed a constant value of about 15° in all experiments. The micro-characteristics of palm oil and diesel were compared based on the particle velocity distributions. Copyright © 2013 American Scientific Publishers.

AB  - Choosing the methanol as the representative of low molecular weight alcohols, experimental research of the viscosity-temperature and thermal response characteristics of bio-oil mixed with low molecular weight alcohols was carried out, and the empirical formulas were established by the regression analysis depending on the Andrade equation and lumped heat capacity method, respectively. The experiment results indicated that the viscosity of the bio-oil/methanol mixtures decreased with increase of the methanol mass proportion and the mixtures' temperature, furthermore, the impact of temperature on the viscosity was reduced as the temperature rose. The thermal time constant of the bio-oil/methanol mixtures decreased at first, then increased with the higher mass proportion of methanol, the minimum constant appeared when the methanol proportion was up to around 30wt.%.

AB  - Catalytic cracking experiments were performed for bio-oil model compounds (acetic acid, guaiacol, n-heptane and hexamethylene, etc) using HZSM-5 molecular sieve catalyst at 550 °C, aiming to study the reaction mechanism and catalyst properties. The results show that the main product for catalytic cracking of n-heptane and hexamethylene is aromatics (53% and 91%, respectively in area). Catalytic cracking reaction occurs more easily for those oxygen-free model compounds. The aromatics content increase effectively (from 12% to 90% in area) with increasing addition of catalyst for acetic acid. The guaiacol structure is quite complex and the catalyst mainly removes its methoxy group. Increasing the weight of catalyst could lead to aromatics formation more easily.

AB  - Goal and scope: The life cycle inventory of landfill emissions is a key point in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of waste management options and is highly subject to discussion. Result sensitivity to data inventory is accounted for through the implementation of scenarios that help examine how waste landfilling should be modeled in LCA. Method: Four landfill biogas management options are environmentally evaluated in a Life Cycle Assessment perspective: (1) no biogas management (open dump), conventional landfill with (2) flaring, (3) combined heat and power (CHP) production in an internal combustion engine and (4) biogas upgrading for use as a fuel in buses. Average, maximum and minimum literature values are considered both for combustion emission factors in flares and engines and for trace pollutant concentrations in biogas. Results: Biogas upgrading for use as a fuel in buses appears as the most relevant option with respect to most non-toxic impact categories and ecotoxicity, when considering average values for trace gas concentrations and combustion emission factors. Biogas combustion in an engine for CHP production shows the best performances in terms of climate change, but generates significantly higher photochemical oxidant formation and marine eutrophication impact potentials than flaring or biogas upgrading for use as a fuel in buses. Interpretation and discussion: However the calculated environmental impact potentials of landfill biogas management options depend largely on the trace gas concentrations implemented in the model. The use of average or extreme values reported in the literature significantly modifies the impact potential of a given scenario (up to two orders of magnitude for open dumps with respect to human toxicity). This should be taken into account when comparing landfilling with other waste management options. Also, the actual performances of a landfill top cover (in terms of oxidation rates) and combustion technology (in terms of emission factors) appear as key parameters affecting the ranking of biogas management options. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The production of 1,3-propanediol (PD) by a newly isolated Citrobacter freundii strain [FMCC-B 294 (VK-19)] was investigated. Different grades of biodiesel-derived glycerol were employed. Slightly lower PD biosynthesis was observed in batch experiments only when crude glycerol from waste-cooking oil trans-esterification was utilized and only at elevated initial substrate concentrations employed. Batch bioreactor cultures revealed the capability of the strain to tolerate elevated amounts of substrate (glycerol up to 170. g/L) and produce quantities of PD in such high substrate concentrations. Nevertheless, maximum PD quantities (45.9. g/L) were achieved at lower initial glycerol concentrations (∼100. g/L) employed, suggesting some inhibition exerted due to the increased initial substrate concentrations. In order to improve PD production, a fed-batch fermentation was carried out and 68.1. g/L of PD were produced (the highest PD quantity achieved by C. freundii strains so far) with yield per glycerol consumed ∼0.40. g/g and volumetric productivity 0.79. g/L/h. Aiming to perform a more economical and eco-friendlier procedure, batch and fed-batch fermentations under completely non-sterile conditions were carried out. During non-sterilized fed-batch process, 176. g/L of raw glycerol were converted to 66.3. g/L of PD, suggesting the potentiality of the non-sterile fermentation by C. freundii FMCC-B 294. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding the environmental effects of alternative fuel production is critical to characterizing the sustainability of energy resources to inform policy and regulatory decisions. The magnitudes of these environmental effects vary according to the intensity and scale of fuel production along each step of the supply chain. We compare the spatial extent and temporal duration of ethanol and gasoline production processes and environmental effects based on a literature review and then synthesize the scale differences on space-time diagrams. Comprehensive assessment of any fuel-production system is a moving target, and our analysis shows that decisions regarding the selection of spatial and temporal boundaries of analysis have tremendous influences on the comparisons. Effects that strongly differentiate gasoline and ethanol-supply chains in terms of scale are associated with when and where energy resources are formed and how they are extracted. Although both gasoline and ethanol production may result in negative environmental effects, this study indicates that ethanol production traced through a supply chain may impact less area and result in more easily reversed effects of a shorter duration than gasoline production. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).

AB  - There is an increasing demand to accurately measure the quality of biofuel products (e. g. biodiesel and bio-ethanol). This demand is driven in Europe by directives promoting the use of renewable sources of energy and worldwide by national and international legislation setting out quality requirements for these fuels. Until now, there has been no international consensus on the minimum technical specifications to ensure biofuel quality. Furthermore, it is unclear which reference materials and measurement techniques are needed to provide the quality assurance and quality control framework to underpin these legislative requirements. As part of the European Commission's 7th Framework Programme, the BIOREMA project (REference MAterials for BIOfuel specifications) demonstrated the feasibility of preparing biodiesel and bio-ethanol reference materials with reference values traceable to the international system of units for a range of parameters at levels relevant to technical specifications. However, the project concluded also that further research is needed to improve the current measurement capabilities for some parameters. Within the BIOREMA project, two global interlaboratory comparisons were carried out, using the biodiesel and bio-ethanol test materials prepared during the feasibility stage of the project, as well as two biodiesel standard reference materials from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA). The exercises showed that the measurement capabilities of the field laboratories were in many cases satisfactory, whereas for other laboratories the availability and regular use of certified reference materials would likely enhance the measurement capabilities for many of the parameters studied. A general overview of the BIOREMA project is presented in this paper. The details of the production of the two types of BIOREMA reference materials, and the results of the interlaboratory comparison for the bio-ethanol and biodiesel study materials, are discussed in parts 2 and 3 of this series of papers. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Oil extracted from Citrus reticulata (mandarin orange) seeds was investigated as a potential feedstock for the production of biodiesel. The biodiesel fuel was prepared by sodium methoxide-catalyzed transesterification of the oil with methanol. Fuel properties that were determined include cetane number, cloud, pour, and cold filter plugging points, kinematic viscosity, oxidative stability, flash point, sulfur content, ash content, density and acid value. The citrus seed oil methyl esters were found to satisfy both ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 biodiesel standards. The NMR spectra of the methyl esters of C. reticulata seed oil are reported. © 2013.

AB  - The main objective of the reference materials for biofuel specifications (BIOREMA) project is the development of two test materials (one bio-ethanol material and one biodiesel material) with well-established reference values. Of a series of three papers, this part describes the material preparation, homogeneity study, stability study, and characterisation of the bio-ethanol material. The test material thus obtained was used in an interlaboratory comparison (ILC) to assess current practices and comparability amongst laboratories providing bio-ethanol testing services. Only 13 participants provided data, resulting in a small dataset for evaluation. Further, it appeared that for a number of laboratories, there was not sufficient material for the determination of all requested parameters. In most cases, as far as the data permit, it can be concluded that the consensus values (based on participant's results) are in good agreement with the reference or the BIOREMA values (obtained by NMIs participating in the project). For three parameters, namely ethanol content, water content, and density, there is good agreement between the reference and consensus values. For these parameters, the reproducibility standard deviation is close to, or even smaller than, the expanded uncertainty associated with the reference value. A number of parameters show very poor reproducibility, for example, pHe, electrolytic conductivity, and acidity. The same applies to sodium and copper content, which are very low and therefore challenging parameters to measure accurately. The results of the ILC underpin the need for certified reference materials and demonstrate the requirement for more robust quality control to improve the precision and trueness of the results from testing laboratories. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Studies on lipid accumulation and fatty acid composition of microalgae as a feedstock for biodiesel have been reported in numerous papers in recent years. However, in contrast to microalgae, documentation on cyanobacteria such as Arthrospira platensis with regard to lipid production has been sparse thus far. In this paper, we show the relatively high lipid accumulation potential of A. platensis KMMCC CY-007 in modified Schlösser medium. Four different growth conditions [7.5 candela (cd) and 1% CO2, 15 cd and 1% CO2, 7.5 cd and air, and 15 cd and air] were examined over 7 days in order to compare the impact of light intensity. Using two different growth conditions (7.5 cd and 1% CO2 bulk bubble and 7.5 cd and 1% CO2 fine bubble), changes in growth, lipid accumulation and fatty acid composition were compared. The highest lipid content of 37.96% was obtained at 7.5 cd and 1% CO2 fine bubble after 7 days, and the maximum net production (72.56%) of long chain fatty acid methyl esters (C16:0 and C18:0) detected at 7.5 cd and 1% CO2 bulk bubble. These data suggest the potential of A. platensis for production of crude lipid as a future feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel produced mainly by the base-catalyzed transesterification of vegetable oils or animal fats with a short chain alcohol, has become an attractive alternative to petroleum-based diesel fuel. Even though high-field 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a reliable method for biodiesel quality control, it is restricted by its poor mobility and expensive superconducting coils. As an alternative, this study presents a mobile low-field 1H NMR spectrometer for the analysis of biodiesel samples derived from different feedstock oils. The low-field 1H NMR spectra of all the compounds coexisting in a typical transesterification reaction such as rapeseed oil, rapeseed biodiesel, methanol, and glycerol, could be clearly differentiated. Field-dependent characteristic parameters such as relaxation times are provided. The degree of saturation of the different biofuels samples could be reliably estimated via integration of the resolved signals of the spectra. The obtained results agreed well with those measured at high-field 1H NMR. Since this compositional information is directly related to the biodiesel properties, the presented mobile low-field 1H NMR device built from permanent magnets arrayed in a Halbach geometry, constitutes an excellent alternative tool for biodiesel quality control. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Biodiesel, an alternative diesel additive made from renewable sources, has problems associated with their cloud points when used in colder climate. One method of improving the cloud point of biodiesel is hydroisomerization which branches the saturated portion of the biodiesel and lowers the cloud point of the compound. Palmitic acid methyl ester, which is the major saturated fatty acid in vegetable oils, is hydroisomerized with a 5 g kg-1 Pt impregnated beta zeolite catalyst at reaction conditions 200-285 °C and 1.0-4.0 MPa H2 pressure. FTIR and GC/MS analyses confirmed the branching and the identity of the reaction products. The cloud point of the material was lowered from 30 °C to 20 °C under reaction conditions of 285 °C and 4.0 MPa H2 pressure at the yield of 42% after 16 h. This study reports the hydroisomerization reaction being successful in branching the starting material in order to lower the cloud points of methyl esters. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae have already been investigated as a potential resource for biofuel in many reports. In this study, the effect of phosphorus concentration on lipid content was analyzed using the freshwater microalga Chlorella sp as a model. In addition, the carbohydrate and protein content were also analyzed in order to investigate the variations of biochemical composition under different phosphorus levels. Results showed that both lipid content and lipid productivity were increased under low phosphorus conditions. Furthermore, it was also found that lipid accumulation in cells decreased by supplementing the growth media with K2HPO4 in the late growth phase. The analysis of the total protein and the carbohydrate content showed that the former remained unaffected by external phosphorus variation; while the latter was directly correlated to phosphorus concentration. In summary, lipid accumulation had significant relationship with phosphorus concentration. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Binary and ternary blends of fossil diesel fuel, conventional biodiesel and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), both derived from soybean oil, have been proposed as a means to increase the fraction of renewable energy in automotive fuels and to boost the blending possibilities depending on the desired fuel characteristics. Biofuels can be obtained in a specialized bio-refinery for a combined production of biodiesel and HVO or in a conventional refinery (with savings of costs as a consequence of the already existing installations). Two examples of these scenarios have been set out, and the most important physical and chemical properties of the final fuel blends measured and compared. The results proved that fuel properties depend greatly on the scenario considered, and consequently the biofuel production path must be carefully decided if the fuel potential is to be fully exploited. While a simultaneous production of HVO-diesel and a later blend with biodiesel fuels produced a neutral fuel in terms of cetane number and sooting tendency, the combined production of HVO-biodiesel to be afterwards blended with fossil diesel fuel is able to change the cetane number from 45 to 65, approximately, and reduce soot by roughly 30%. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Agriculture faces unique challenges as increasing world population places unprecedented demands on food, feed, and energy resources. In an effort to become more efficient and sustainable, marginal land, including regulatory brownfields prohibited for food consumption purposes could be utilized for bioenergy crop production. In 2006-2008, we evaluated soybean (Glycine Max (L.) Merr.), canola (Brassica napus L. var. napus), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) to determine crop suitability for bioenergy production on a regulatory brownfield site. Sites selected for the study included a remediated brownfield site in Rose Township, Oakland County, and a historically cropped agricultural site at East Lansing, Ingham County, serving as the control. Comparisons of biofuel quality components were conducted. The total oil yield of oilseed crops was not significantly different (p < 0.05) between locations. Concentrations of palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2), and linolenic (C18:3) fatty acids differed by location, yet oleic acid concentrations, optimal for quality biodiesel production, were not significantly different across all oilseed crops. Total crystalline cellulose levels from switchgrass were higher at the agricultural land site compared to the brownfield site in 2007 yielding 16% more crystalline cellulose; but there were no differences between locations in 2008. Detectable levels of PCB's were found in soils at the brownfield site; however, transfer to grain or biomass was not detected. Results suggest that brownfield sites have the potential to produce feedstock of suitable quality for conversion to liquid transportation fuels. © 2012.

AB  - The aim of the present work was to experimentally investigate the combustion properties of methyl-ester of rapeseed oil (RME) that was preheated for three distinct temperatures ((30, 70, 110) °C) in the study. The experiments were carried out in a water-cooled horizontal combustion chamber with a nominal thermal load of 1500 kW. The experimental results were compared to the results obtained from the combustion tests with extra light heating oil (ELHO) that was used as a comparative fuel. The fuel was atomized by means of the twin-fluid effervescent atomizer with a maximal output of 100 kg h-1 of oil at gas to liquid mass flow rate ratio (GLR) equals to 20%.Primarily the experiments were focused on the investigation of the flame characteristics and the quality of combustion at distinct heat outputs ((475, 700, 900) kW) and distinct GLR ratios ((10, 15, 20) %). Second, experiments focused on the evaluation and comparison of local wall heat fluxes along the flame length and were performed only for one setting of operating conditions, namely for the heat output of 900 kW and the GLR 15%.The results revealed that substitution of ELHO requires preheating of RME to the temperature of about 70 °C, if pneumatic atomization is to be used. The preheating of RME to higher temperature did not show any significant improvement in terms of quality of combustion. Moreover, it causes the increase in nitrogen oxides formation up to 60% in comparison with the values measured during ELHO combustion. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus) was identified as a potential cool season cover and energy crop for the southern United States. The fatty acid profile of this oil shows high levels of erucic acid (C22:1), which has been linked to health issues. Its composition makes this oil an ideal candidate for industrial application as its use as feed or food is limited. Oilseed radish oil was extracted from seed using mechanical methods and yields were determined. The extracted oil was converted to fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel) via transesterification. Fuel properties were analyzed including fatty acid profile, free and total glycerol, acid number, sulfur content, water content and cold filter plugging point (CFPP). Fuel properties of the biodiesel were found to meet or exceed ASTM standards for use in on-road vehicles. Biodiesel fuel produced here was also subjected to an engine performance stress test. The properties and engine performance of oilseed radish biodiesel were shown to be comparable with No. 2 diesel and other common biodiesel fuels. Additionally, a brief engineering based feasibility analysis was performed on the economics of on-farm production of biodiesel from oilseed radish. The analysis suggested economic feasibility of the system when priced against soybean oil, a common biodiesel feedstock. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Production of alternative fuels, such as biodiesel, from transesterification of vegetable oil driven by heterogeneous catalysts is a promising alternative to fossil diesel. However, achieving a successful substitution for a new renewable fuel depends on several quality parameters. 1H NMR spectroscopy was used to determine the amount of methyl esters, free glycerin and acid number in the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol in the presence of hydrotalcite-type catalyst to produce biodiesel. Reaction parameters, such as temperature and time, were used to evaluate soybean oil methyl esters rate conversion. Temperatures of 100 to 180 °C and times of 20 to 240 min were tested on a 1: 12 molar ratio soybean oil/methanol reaction. At 180 °C/240 min conditions, a rate of 94.5 wt% of methyl esters was obtained, where free glycerin and free fatty acids were not detected. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The Submarine Hydrothermal Alkaline Spring Theory for the emergence of life holds that it is the ordered delivery of hydrogen and methane in alkaline hydrothermal solutions at a spontaneously precipitated inorganic osmotic and catalytic membrane to the carbon dioxide and other electron acceptors in the earliest acidulous cool ocean that, through these gradients, drove life into being. That such interactions between hydrothermal fuels and potential oxidants have so far not been accomplished in the lab is because some steps along the necessary metabolic pathways are endergonic and must therefore be driven by being coupled to thermodynamically larger exergonic processes. But coupling of this kind is far from automatic and it is not enough to merely sum the ΔGs of two supposedly coupled reactions and show their combined thermodynamic viability. An exergonic reaction will not drive an endergonic one unless 'forced' to do so by being tied to it mechanistically via an organized "engine" of "Free Energy Conversion" (FEC). Here we discuss the thermodynamics of FEC and advance proposals regarding the nature and roles of the FEC devices that could, in principle, have arisen spontaneously in the alkaline hydrothermal context and have forced the onset of a protometabolism. The key challenge is to divine what these initial engines of life were in physicochemical terms and as part of that, what structures provided the first "turnstile-like" mechanisms needed to couple the partner processes in free energy conversion; in particular to couple the dissipation of geochemically given gradients to, say, the reduction of CO2 to formate and the generation of a pyrophosphate disequilibrium.

AB  - A genetic transformation system for the marine pennate diatom, Fistulifera sp. JPCC DA0580, was established using microparticle bombardment methods. Strain JPCC DA0580 has been recently identified as the highest triglyceride (60 % w/w) producer from a culture collection of 1,393 strains of marine microalgae, and it is expected to be a feasible source of biodiesel fuel. The transformation conditions for strain JPCC DA0580 were optimised using the green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) and the gene encoding neomycin phosphotransferase II (nptII). The most efficient rate of transformation was attained when tungsten particles (0.6 μm in diameter) were used for microparticle bombardment. The effect of endogenous and exogenous promoters on the expression of nptII was examined. Endogenous promoters were more efficient for obtaining transformants compared with exogenous promoters. Southern hybridisation analysis suggested that nptII integrated into the nuclear genome. This genetic manipulation technique should allow us to understand the mechanisms of high triglyceride accumulation in this strain, thereby contributing to improving BDF production. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Bioethanol and biodiesel as potential substitutes for fossil fuels in the transportation sector have been analyzed for environmental suitability. However, there could be impacts on human health during the production, therefore adverse health effects have to be analyzed. The aim of this study is to analyze to what health risk factors humans are exposed to in the production of biofuels and what the size of the health effects is. A health impact assessment expressed as disability adjusted life years (DALYs) was conducted in SimaPro 7.1 software. The results show a statistically significant lower carcinogenic impact of biofuels (p&lt;0.05) than fossil fuels. Meanwhile, the impact of organic respirable compounds is smaller for fossil fuels (p&lt;0.05) than for biofuels. Analysis of inorganic compounds like PM10, 2.5, SO2 or NOx shows some advantages of sugar beet bioethanol and soybean biodiesel production (p&lt;0.05), although production of sugarcane bioethanol shows larger impacts of respirable inorganic compounds than for fossil fuels (p&lt;0.001). Although liquid biofuels are made of renewable energy sources, this does not necessary mean that they do not represent any health hazards. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Hydrocarbon derived from fast pyrolysis of plantation wood is a potential feedstock for the production of transportation fuels. Unfortunately, the cost to produce and upgrade this feedstock is highly uncertain, and its current technological state is not competitive with crude oil. Additional R&D will be needed to achieve the significant cost reductions required for competitiveness. Significant technical hurdles must be overcome to achieve a commercially ready, cost competitive technology. This paper identifies the most promising areas for the needed future research. Identification of a stable upgrading catalyst, definition of the maximum level of oxygen that can be tolerated by the existing refining infrastructure, and improved oxygen removal during the pyrolysis step emerge as the most prospective research areas. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The kinetics of the enzymatic conversion of coconut oil to biodiesel (fatty acid alkyl esters) have been investigated using ethanol and 1% (w/v) lipase at 50°C. Coconut oil is being evaluated for biofuel production and an enzymatic process was selected to minimize side reactions (such as saponification) which can occur with the alkali-catalysed route if free fatty acid (FFA) concentration is significant. Rate data comparison showed that the NaOH-promoted conversion was about 2 orders of magnitude faster than the lipase-catalysed system but resulted in saponification/partial solidification of the reaction mixture. Analysis also revealed that the ratios of the kinetic constants for ester:glycerol (1:1.12) and that for ester:ethanol (1:3.11) during enzymatic transesterification are in agreement with reaction stoichiometry. Additionally, FFA esterification rates were higher (1.5 to 2.5) than triglyceride transesterification rates under similar conditions. Supplementation with ultrasonics at 43 kHz also permitted nearly 20-fold improvement in conversion rate. The study also demonstrated that with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the growth yield on glycerol of 0.77 g g- 1 is greater than that usually found for growth of yeast on glucose (viz. 0.4-0.45 g g- 1). Thus, opportunities for process enhancement exist through the use of increased enzyme concentrations, ultrasound techniques and growth of yeast on residual by-product glycerol. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We tested the hypothesis that the biodegradation of volatile petroleum hydrocarbons (VPHs) in aerobic sandy soil is affected by the blending with 10 percent ethanol (E10) or 20 percent biodiesel (B20). When inorganic nutrients were scarce, competition between biofuel and VPH degraders temporarily slowed monoaromatic hydrocarbon degradation. Ethanol had a bigger impact than biodiesel, reflecting the relative ease of ethanol compared to methyl ester biodegradation. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of bacterial 16S rRNA genes revealed that each fuel mixture selected for a distinct bacterial community, each dominated by Pseudomonas spp. Despite lasting impacts on soil bacterial ecology, the overall effects on VHP biodegradation were minor, and average biomass yields were comparable between fuel types, ranging from 0.40 ± 0.16 to 0.51 ± 0.22 g of biomass carbon per gram of fuel carbon degraded. Inorganic nutrient availability had a greater impact on petroleum hydrocarbon biodegradation than fuel composition. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the kinetics of ultrasound assisted-two phase oil extraction from waste coffee grounds with high moisture content. Waste coffee grounds is the wet residue which contains approximately 13% (db) oil. Ultrasound-assisted two-phase oil extraction method successfully extracted 98% of the available oil from the waste coffee grounds in 30 min. Ultrasonication reduced the amount of hexane used for the extraction. Fatty acid methyl ester compositions of the waste coffee oil and the soybean oil were similar. The kinetics of oil extraction from waste coffee grounds were modeled using a two-exponential mathematical equation. Establishing oil extraction facilities at locations where the ready-to-drink coffee products are produced and using two-phase oil extraction eliminate major challenges of collection, transportation and drying, which makes waste coffee grounds a viable feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, transesterification of soybean oil to biodiesel using KOH in different process conditions were studied. The investigated conditions were the molar ratio of methanol/oil, catalyst amount and reaction temperature. Optimal conditions were found to be methanol/oil molar ratio, 9:1; catalyst amount, 1 wt%; reaction temperature, 60 °C. Biodiesel yield for these conditions was obtained 93.2% in 1 h. In addition, the artificial neural network has been applied to estimate the biodiesel yield. The multilayer feed forward neural network with three inputs and one output has been trained with different algorithms and different numbers of neurons in the hidden layer. The accuracy of the proposed model was found to agree nearly with the experimental results over a wide range of experimental conditions. The results clearly depict that the neural network is a powerful tool to estimate the reaction rate and the designed neural network can be used instead of approximate and complex analytical equations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Feedstock supply is one of the key obstacles for cost-effective production of cellulosic biofuels. This paper proposes an assessment model to study the feedstock costs, energy consumption, and CO 2 emissions associated with collecting and transporting cellulosic biomass from farm to storage sites. To illustrate the utility of the proposed model, four logistics options for collecting and transporting corn stover are studied: (A) round bales via tractor, (B) rectangular bales via tractor, (C) round bales via tractor (on-farm) and truck (road), and (D) rectangular bales via tractor and truck. Results show that option A is the lowest-cost option when storage capacity is less than 110,000 ton. For larger storage capacity, option D is more cost-effective. In terms of energy consumption and CO 2 emissions, option A consumes the least energy and generates the least CO 2 emissions when storage capacity is less than 45,000 ton. For larger storage capacity, option D performs better. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Seashore mallow (Kosteletzkya pentacarpos) is a non-invasive perennial nonclonal halophytic oilseed-producing dicot that was investigated as a feedstock for production of biodiesel from seeds and ethanol from residual stem biomass. Seashore mallow seeds contained 19.3 mass % oil, which after extraction with hexane and pretreatment with catalytic sulfuric acid was converted into methyl esters in 94 mass % yield utilizing homogenous base catalysis. The principal components identified were methyl linoleate (48.9%), palmitate (24.4%) and oleate (18.3%). Fuel properties were characterized and compared to biodiesel standards ASTM D6751 and EN 14214. Also investigated were blends with petrodiesel. Lastly, seashore mallow stems were rich in neutral carbohydrates (51.8 mass %). After simultaneous saccharification and fermentation employing a native Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strain, the stems provided ethanol and xylose yields of 104 g/kg and 47.8 g/kg, respectively. Of the four pretreatment methodologies explored, dilute ammonium hydroxide provided the highest yield of sugars. © 2012.

AB  - Application of ultrasound-assisted biodiesel production process from Jatropha oil catalyzed by activated carbon-supported tungstophosphoric acid catalyst was studied. Influences of ultrasonic energy on different process variables were elucidated. Reaction variables i.e. reaction time (10-50 min), reactants' molar ratio (5:1-25:1), ultrasonic amplitude (30-90% of the maximum sonifier power) and catalyst amount (2.5-4.5 w/w oil) were studied. A mathematical representation for biodiesel yield was successfully generated. A yield of 91% was achieved in just 40 min at a moderate ultrasonic amplitude (∼60%), high molar ratio (25:1) and low reaction temperature (65 °C). Interactions between the variables were also validated statistically. Leaching study revealed that the reaction was predominately heterogeneous in nature. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels are nowadays considered a questionable environmental alternative to fossil fuels. In that context, this work analyses the environmental impacts when introducing rapeseed on the traditional and current wheat and barley agricultural rotation by means of a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA). The introduction of rapeseed, the correctness of its conversion to obtain straight vegetable oil and its use as self-consumption biofuel in tractors are evaluated. Life cycle assessment is used in this work to evaluate the impacts of different considered scenarios. A sensitivity analysis has also been conducted. The results presented show a modest environmental improvement (diminishment of 6 out of the 10 analyzed environmental impacts) when introducing rapeseed to local crop rotations and its partial conversion to oil to be used as fuel in existing diesel engines. Additionally, the ratio between the energy obtained and the total energy input shows moderate positive results when comparing the latter case with the current one. Results from this study can be used to support research and decision making to assess the convenience of introducing alternative fuels in agricultural exploitations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although there has been a large research effort associated with individual parts of various algal biofuel production pathways, few studies have tracked changes in product composition throughout an integrated biofuel production process. This study uses microscopy and chromatography to analyze the progression of lipid profile and cell structure of algal cells throughout a research-scale production pathway for biocrude. For the specific processing methods used in this pathway, it is shown that TAG content decreased, while DAG and FFA content increased during processing. The changes in the lipid content corresponded to cell degradation that was observed by SEM and TEM throughout processing. These results demonstrate the dynamic nature of lipid composition in an algal culture used for biofuel production and emphasize the need to monitor changes in lipid profile, as those changes can directly impact biofuel productivity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effect of biodiesel produced from waste cooking oil on the particulate emissions of a direct injection (DI) diesel engine was investigated experimentally and the results were compared with two diesel fuels, namely, an ultra low sulfur diesel fuel with less than 10-ppm-wt of sulfur (ULSD) and a low sulfur diesel fuel with 400-ppm-wt of sulfur (LSD). For each fuel, the number and mass based particle emissions, as well as the particle volatility, were evaluated and compared. The particulate mass emissions were measured with a tapered element oscillating balance (TEOM) and further divided into different size bins using a micro-orifice uniform deposition impactor (MOUDI). The particle number concentration and size distribution were measured with a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). The size-segregated samples collected with the MOUDI were further analyzed with a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) to obtain the mass of volatile substances in each size bin. The SMPS was further connected in series with a thermodenuder (TD) to obtain the number concentration and size distribution of non-volatile particles, and hence the number concentration and size distribution of the volatile particles. The results indicate that the biodiesel could effectively reduce the particle mass and number concentrations, including the volatile substances, in all the measured size range, compared with LSD. Compared with ULSD, there is also a reduction in the particle mass and number concentrations, however, a higher concentration of volatile substances was found with the use of biodiesel, which should be a concern in the application of this fuel. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.

AB  - The work reported in this article is a thermodynamic and kinetic study of the acetalization reaction between acetaldehyde and glycerol to produce glycerol ethyl acetal (GEA). A catalyst screening was performed allowing for the choice of Amberlyst-15 wet resin as the most suitable catalyst for this reaction. Through the study of the reaction thermodynamic equilibrium, it was possible to determine the value of the equilibrium constant as a function of temperature, ln(K) = 1.419 + 1055/T, and the corresponding thermodynamic parameters ΔH298 K0 = -8.77 kJ·mol-1 and ΔG298 K0 = -12.3 kJ·mol-1. Additionally, the standard enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of formation of GEA were also obtained, as -584.4 and -387.0 kJ·mol-1, respectively. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson model considering internal mass-transfer limitations presented the best fitting of the reaction kinetic behavior. The parameters estimated for this model were kc (mol· gcat-1·s-1) = 3.13 × 10 9 - 6223/T and KS,W = 1.82 × 10-3 exp(2361/T). The acetalization of glycerol with acetaldehyde presents an activation energy of 51.7 kJ·mol-1. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. is a promising natural resource which has been promoted globally for biodiesel production by policy makers and researchers in tropical and subtropical countries. However, both J. curcas seeds and oil have been found to be toxic to humans and domestic animals when consumed. A non-toxic genotype of J. curcas has been reported from some rural communities in southern Mexico, suitable for human consumption. This non-toxic germplasm has been used in traditional Totonacan cuisine in Mexico. However, increasing demand for J. curcas to be used in biofuel production is exerting pressure on the non-toxic genotype. In this work we analyze the possible origins and dispersal of non-toxic Jatropha by the Totonaca culture; the traditional uses of J. curcas seeds as a food; its status with respect to the Mexican commercial forestry regulations; and the risks associated with the demands of biofuels on this Mexican germplasm.

AB  - Legislation on biofuels production in the USA and Europe is directing food crops towards the production of grain-based ethanol, which can have detrimental consequences for soil carbon sequestration, nitrous oxide emissions, nitrate pollution, biodiversity and human health. An alternative is to grow lignocellulosic (cellulosic) crops on 'marginal' lands. Cellulosic feedstocks can have positive environmental outcomes and could make up a substantial proportion of future energy portfolios. However, the availability of marginal lands for cellulosic feedstock production, and the resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, remains uncertain. Here we evaluate the potential for marginal lands in ten Midwestern US states to produce sizeable amounts of biomass and concurrently mitigate GHG emissions. In a comparative assessment of six alternative cropping systems over 20 years, we found that successional herbaceous vegetation, once well established, has a direct GHG emissions mitigation capacity that rivals that of purpose-grown crops (-851 ± 46 grams of CO 2 equivalent emissions per square metre per year (gCO 2 e m -2 yr -1)). If fertilized, these communities have the capacity to produce about 63 ± 5 gigajoules of ethanol energy per hectare per year. By contrast, an adjacent, no-till corn-soybean-wheat rotation produces on average 41 ± 1 gigajoules of biofuel energy per hectare per year and has a net direct mitigation capacity of -397 ± 32 gCO 2 e m -2 yr -1; a continuous corn rotation would probably produce about 62 ± 7 gigajoules of biofuel energy per hectare per year, with 13% less mitigation. We also perform quantitative modelling of successional vegetation on marginal lands in the region at a resolution of 0.4 hectares, constrained by the requirement that each modelled location be within 80 kilometres of a potential biorefinery. Our results suggest that such vegetation could produce about 21 gigalitres of ethanol per year from around 11 million hectares, or approximately 25 per cent of the 2022 target for cellulosic biofuel mandated by the US Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, with no initial carbon debt nor the indirect land-use costs associated with food-based biofuels. Other regional-scale aspects of biofuel sustainability, such as water quality and biodiversity, await future study. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - Light-duty vehicles (LDV) are responsible for a large fraction of petroleum use and are a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United States. Improving conventional gasoline-powered vehicle efficiency can reduce petroleum demand, however efficiency alone cannot reach deep GHG reduction targets, such as 80% below the 1990 LDV GHG emissions level. Because the cost and availability of low-GHG fuels will impose limits on their use, significant reductions in GHG emissions will require combinations of fuel and vehicle technologies that both increase efficiency and reduce the emissions from fuel production and use. This paper examines bounding cases for the adoption of individual technologies and then explores combinations of advanced vehicle and fuel technologies. Limits on domestic biofuel production - even combined with significant conventional combustion engine vehicle improvements - mean that hydrogen fuel cell electric or battery electric vehicles fueled by low-GHG sources will be necessary. Complete electrification of the LDV fleet is not required to achieve significant GHG reduction, as replacing 40% of the LDV fleet with zero-emission hydrogen vehicles while achieving optimistic biofuel production and conventional vehicle improvements can allow attainment of a low GHG emission target. Our results show that the long time scale for vehicle turnover will ensure significant emissions from the LDV sector, even when lower emission vehicles and fuels are widely available within 15 years. Reducing petroleum consumption is comparatively less difficult, and significant savings can be achieved using efficient conventional gasoline-powered vehicles.Copyright © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - Microbially produced alkanes are a new class of biofuels that closely match the chemical composition of petroleum-based fuels. Alkanes can be generated from the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway by the reduction of acyl-ACPs followed by decarbonylation of the resulting aldehydes. A current limitation of this pathway is the restricted product profile, which consists of n-alkanes of 13, 15, and 17 carbons in length. To expand the product profile, we incorporated a new part, FabH2 from Bacillus subtilis, an enzyme known to have a broader specificity profile for fatty acid initiation than the native FabH of Escherichia coli. When provided with the appropriate substrate, the addition of FabH2 resulted in an altered alkane product profile in which significant levels of n-alkanes of 14 and 16 carbons in length are produced. The production of even chain length alkanes represents initial steps toward the expansion of this recently discovered microbial alkane production pathway to synthesize complex fuels.

AB  - Biodiesels (fatty acid methyl esters) derived from oleaginous microbes (microalgae, yeast, and bacteria) are being actively pursued as potential renewable substitutes for petroleum diesel. Here, we report the engine performance characteristics of biodiesel produced from a microalgae (Chaetoceros gracilis), a yeast (Cryptococcus curvatus), and a bacteria (Rhodococcus opacus) in a two-cylinder diesel engine outfitted with an eddy current brake dynamometer, comparing the fuel performance to petroleum diesel (#2) and commercial biodiesel from soybeans. Key physical and chemical properties, including heating value, viscosity, density, and cetane index, for each of the microbial-derived biofuels were found to compare favorably to those of soybean biodiesel. Likewise, the horsepower, torque, and brake specific fuel consumption across a range of engine speeds also compared favorably to values determined for soybean biodiesel. Analysis of exhaust emissions (hydrocarbon, CO, CO 2, O2, and NOx) revealed that all biofuels produced significantly less CO and hydrocarbon than petroleum diesel. Surprisingly, microalgae biodiesel was found to have the lowest NOx output, even lower than petroleum diesel. The results are discussed in the context of the fatty acid composition of the fuels and the technical viability of microbial biofuels as replacements for petroleum diesel. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - We examined the chemical composition and properties of several diesel fuels and blendstocks derived from Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis, hydroisomerization of lipids, and fermentation of sugar via the terpenoid metabolic pathway. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatographic analysis with nonpolar and polar columns, 13C NMR, GC-MS, and elemental analysis were used to assess fuel chemistry. Performance properties included density, heat of combustion, cetane number, and cloud point, as well as other properties. The fuels consisted almost entirely of normal and iso-paraffins. Three samples contained residual oxygen below 0.1 mass %. All of the renewable and synthetic diesel fuels have significantly lower density than is typical for a petroleum-derived diesel fuel. As a result, they have slightly higher net heat of combustion on a mass basis (2%-3% higher), but lower heat of combustion on a volume basis (3%-7% lower). Two critical diesel performance properties, cetane number and cloud point, were correlated with iso-paraffin content and chain length. The results confirm that properties of hydroisomerized fats and oils, as well as FT diesel, can be tuned by increasing the degree of isomerization to lower cloud point which also lowers the cetane number. In spite of this trade-off between cloud point, and cetane number, the cetane numbers were still over 70 for fuels with cloud points as low as -27 C. The terpenoid biofuel exhibited a cloud point below -70 C and a cetane number of 58. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Thermochemical conversion of vegetable oils has become an attractive and alternative method for the production of high-grade biofuels. In the present work, thermal and catalytic cracking reactions were studied in a 60 L scale-up reactor using soybean oil and high acid value waste oil under the catalysis of a basic catalyst. A bio-oil yield of approximately 70% was obtained at a reaction temperature of 450 C with a heating rate of 5 C/min. After the thermal and catalytic cracking reactions, upgrading of bio-oils in a continuous pilot reactor was investigated. It was found that those undesired products (carboxylic acids) were changed into their corresponding fatty acid esters efficiently by a continuous esterification operation. The upgraded oils were further fractionated into gasoline and diesel fractions via distillation processing according to the requirements of the boiling range in the China specification for petroleum fuels. The results showed that the obtained biofuels have excellent cold-flow properties superior to those of conventional petroleum-based liquid fuels. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - As a result of algae's promise as a renewable energy feedstock, numerous studies have used Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to quantify the environmental performance of algal biofuels, yet there is no consensus of results among them. Our work, motivated by the lack of comprehensive uncertainty analysis in previous studies, uses a Monte Carlo approach to estimate ranges of expected values of LCA metrics by incorporating parameter variability with empirically specified distribution functions. Results show that large uncertainties exist at virtually all steps of the biofuel production process. Although our findings agree with a number of earlier studies on matters such as the need for wet lipid extraction, nutrients recovered from waste streams, and high energy coproducts, the ranges of reported LCA metrics show that uncertainty analysis is crucial for developing technologies, such as algal biofuels. In addition, the ranges of energy return on (energy) invested (EROI) values resulting from our analysis help explain the high variability in EROI values from earlier studies. Reporting results from LCA models as ranges, and not single values, will more reliably inform industry and policy makers on expected energetic and environmental performance of biofuels produced from microalgae. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Direct-injection (DI) concepts with spray-guided mixture formation are promising methods to increase the efficiency of spark ignition (SI) engines. The fuel and temperature distribution determines evaporation and ignition behavior. However, the resulting mixture and temperature are not homogeneous through the combustion chamber. Furthermore, it is strongly affected by the fuel evaporation properties, which are different for modern biofuels compared to gasoline. The present paper demonstrates the procedure and the capability of two-line excitation LIF based on 3-pentanone for accurate planar temperature determination in DISI-sprays at late injection timing conditions. The jet temperature profiles were determined for the gasoline surrogate fuel iso-octane and the biogenic component ethanol, which have a significant difference in their heat of evaporation. The spray of a 6-hole solenoid-injector in an optically accessible combustion test rig is analyzed by quasi-simultaneous excitation by two different excimer lasers. The signals are recorded with one double-shutter ICCD-camera. From the signal ratio of the images the temperature field in the fuel spray can be calculated. The tracer is calibrated with an enhanced high temperature calibration cell for temperatures up to 700 K and pressures up to 1 MPa, which are relevant for the studied conditions. The postprocessing strategy is optimized regarding high accuracy and precision. The fuel spray behavior is evaluated at different positions in the spray and times showing larger evaporation cooling in the jet of maximum 141 K for ethanol. For a comparison of the ensemble averaged results a CFD-spray model was set up under the same boundary conditions showing very similar trends. The temperature images yielded a single-shot precision of approximately 5.6% and inaccuracies of 3.8% making this technique capable for model improvements and validation. © 2012 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - Microalgae feedstock production can be integrated with wastewater and industrial sources of carbon dioxide. This study reviews the literature on algae grown on wastewater and includes a preliminary analysis of algal production based on anaerobic digestion sludge centrate from the Howard F. Curren Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant (HFC AWTP) in Tampa, Florida and secondary effluent from the City of Lakeland wastewater treatment facilities in Lakeland, Florida. It was demonstrated that a mixed culture of wild algae species could successfully be grown on wastewater nutrients and potentially scaled to commercial production. Algae have demonstrated the ability to naturally colonize low-nutrient effluent water in a wetland treatment system utilized by the City of Lakeland. The results from these experiments show that the algae grown in high strength wastewater from the HFC AWTP are light-limited when cultivated indoor since more than 50% of the outdoor illumination is attenuated in the greenhouse.An analysis was performed to determine the mass of algae that can be supported by the wastewater nutrients (mainly nitrogen and phosphorous) available from the two Florida cities. The study was guided by the growth and productivity data obtained for algal growth in the photobioreactors in operation at the University of South Florida. In the analysis, nutrients and light are assumed to be limited, while CO2 is abundantly available. There is some limitation on land, especially since the HFC AWTP is located at the Port of Tampa. The temperature range in Tampa is assumed to be suitable for algal growth year round. Assuming that the numerous technical challenges to achieving commercial-scale algal production can be met, the results presented suggest that an excess of 71 metric tons per hectare per year of algal biomass can be produced. Two energy production options were considered; liquid biofuels from feedstock with high lipid content, and biogas generation from anaerobic digestion of algae biomass. The total potential oil volume was determined to be approximately 337,500 gallons per year, which may result in the annual production of 270,000 gallons of biodiesel when 80% conversion efficiency is assumed. This production level would be able to sustain approximately 450 cars per year on average. Potential biogas production was estimated to be above 415,000 kg/yr, the equivalent of powering close to 500 homes for a year. © 2013 Dalrymple et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The use of efficient breeding methods depends on knowledge of genetic control of traits to be improved. We estimated genetic parameters, selection gain, and genetic diversity in physic nut half-sib families, in order to provide information for breeding programs of this important biofuel species. The progeny test included 20 half-sib families in 4 blocks and 10 plants per plot. The mean progeny heritability values were: 50% for number of bunches, 47% for number of fruits, 35% for number of seeds, 6% for stem diameter, 26% for number of primary branches, 14% for number of secondary branches, 66% for plant height, and 25% for survival of the plants, demonstrating good potential for early selection in plant height, number of branches, and number of fruits per plant. In the analysis of genetic diversity, genotypes were divided into 4 groups. Genotypes 18, 19, 20, and 8 clustered together and presented the highest means for the vegetative characters and production. Lower means were observed in the 17, 12, 13, and 9 genotypes from the same group. We detected genetic variability in this population, with high heritability estimates and accuracy, demonstrating the possibility of obtaining genetic gains for vegetative characters and production at 24 months after planting. © FUNPEC-RP.

AB  - The core objective of this paper is to investigate the perspectives of “renewable fuels” mainly from an energetic point-of-view in a dynamic framework until 2050 in comparison to fossil fuels. In addition, the impact on the economic prospects of an improvement of the energetic performance is analyzed. As renewable fuels, various categories of first and second generation biofuels as well as electricity and hydrogen from renewable energy sources are considered. The most important results of this analysis are: (i) While for first generation biofuels, the relatively high share of fossil energy is the major problem, for second generation biofuels, the major problems are the low conversion efficiency and the corresponding high input of renewable feedstocks. Up to 2050, it is expected that these problems will be relieved, but only slightly. (ii) The energetic improvements up to 2050 will lead to substantial reduction of energetic losses in the well-to-tank as well as in the tank-to-wheel part of the energy service provision chain. (iii) By 2050, the total driving costs of all analyzed fuels and powertrains will almost even out. (iv) The major uncertainty for battery electric and fuel cell vehicles is how fast technological learning will take place especially for the battery and the fuel cells. © 2013 by ASME.

AB  - According to the Resolution number 7 from the Brazilian National Agency of Oil, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP), the official methodologies for free glycerin determination in biodiesel are the ASTM D 6584, EN 14105 and EN 14106 methods. However, these procedures are limited to the analysis of free glycerin in methyl esters and they are not suitable for the analysis of esters from lauric oils. In the present work, a gas chromatographic method was developed for the determination of the amount of free glycerin in ethyl esters from lauric oils, aiming at overcoming the limitations present in the official methods. Moreover, the present method can also be used for ethanol and methanol biodiesel samples from other oily sources. Besides, a methodology that ascertains the content of free glycerin by UV-Vis spectrophotometry was also applied. Both methods were sensitive enough to determine the content of free glycerin in biodiesel, below the limit specified by the ANP, fixed at 0.02 % (200 mg/L), achieving the detection limits of 5.69 mg/L and 2.17 mg/L for the chromatographic and spectrophotometric methods, respectively. © 2017 Atlantis Livros Ltda.

AB  - A two dimensional visualization of premixed combustion process was performed in a common rail (CR) Euro 5 optically accessible compression ignition engine. The effect of fuel properties on injection and combustion phenomena was evaluated by using commercial diesel fuel, as reference, rapeseed methyl ester (RME), and a paraffinic fuel, such as n-Heptane. The choice of monocomponent fuels, free of aromatic, allowed the analysis of the contribution to soot formation with respect to European diesel fuel. Evaluation of the soot volumetric fraction was made for all the fuels. The first soot occurs at the same location for the analyzed fuels but at different times. n-Heptane was the fuel which gave the lowest soot production in accordance with its better physical and chemical characteristics. The total amount of soot formed during the combustion of RME resulted to be intermediate between n-Heptane and diesel fuel. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is a biofuel that is of great importance; its good performance is associated with its purity mainly related to a high content of fatty acid alkyl esters, quantified by gas chromatography (GC), liquid chromatography (LC), hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) and infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. However, these methodologies take long a time and are relatively expensive. Herein, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and viscometry (VA) are studied as alternative methods for the quantification of alkyl esters (FAME and FAEE). Analytical curves from the viscosity and mass loss percentage (TGA) as a function of methyl and ethyl ester levels on binary mixtures (soybean biodiesel/soybean oil) were constructed. The correlations experimentally obtained were presented and used to quantify biodiesel content in the products of ethanolysis and methanolysis and in biodiesel/vegetable oil mixtures of different feedstocks. This comparative study confirmed that both alternative methods are adequate to be used. A single viscometry analytical curve could be used to analyze products, obtained by different oleaginous plants, if their oils exhibit similar viscosities. Viscometry can be the most suitable alternative technique because it is portable, fast, less sensitive to the presence of intermediates than thermogravimetric analysis, easy to work with and very inexpensive. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The increased demand for energy and the depletion of the main energy sources worldwide has led to the constant search for alternative and renewable sources of energy. Biofuels (e.g., bioethanol and biodiesel) have been configured with an important strategy to reduce dependence on nonrenewable fuels in the global energy matrix. However, the search for alternatives faces a number of technological challenges and market for its implementation and consolidation as a more sustainable energy source. NMR, as well as other analytical techniques, has contributed to the search for new biofuel sources with the potential energy required, process development, storage studies, as well as in the production quality control. The multiple application capabilities of NMR techniques throughout the production chain of biofuels, mainly because it is a noninvasive and rapid, make it ideally suited for application in the development of biofuels around the world. However, its implementation has some challenges that involve the use of inexpensive equipment and rapid analysis for fieldwork beyond integration of different analytical techniques and physical chemical measurements using statistical tools with purpose of using simple measures to obtain information about the chemical constitution and physical chemical properties in biofuels. © 2013 John Wiley &Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Present industrialization and global mobility era is an energy intensive period of the human history with an ever increasing energy demand. Unfortunately, fossil fuels are no more sustainable due to growing gap between the demand and supply. Biofuels are considered as promising alternative liquid fuels in recent global energy scenario. Food crops and ligno-cellulosic plant biomass have been widely studied as an alternative feedstock for biofuels production. After decades of research, the competition of fuel with food and recalcitrant nature of plant biomass, these feed stocks are losing their popularity. Marine macroalgae have come forward as another potential feedstock for biofuels production. Marine algae have several advantages over the traditional energy crops including absence of lignin, higher growth rates and no competition with human food. Moreover, along with several environmental benefits, they can be grown using saline and waste water and have higher abilities to sequester the atmospheric CO2 than traditional energy crops. Although there are several challenges associated with the algal biomass conversion to bioenergy yet these problems can be overcome using integrated biorefinery approach.

AB  - The transesterification of cottonseed oil and used frying oil to methyl esters (biodiesel) was studied using Sr(NO3)2 loaded onto calcium oxide as heterogeneous catalyst. Reaction parameters such as catalyst concentration, methanol/oil ratio, and reaction time on the conversion of cottonseed oil and used frying oil were investigated. The 35 % m/m Sr(NO3)2 catalyst loaded onto CaO, after being calcined at 750 °C for 6 h, was found to be the optimum catalyst. The quality of the methyl esters was tested according to the European standard ELOT EN 14214. The two types of biodiesel produced seemed to meet all the parameters of the European standard, except oxidation stability. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The European Community legislation on biofuels has been first established in 2003 with threefold objective: reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, reduction of energy dependence, and support for agricultural production in a context where a mandatory 10% of the land had to be set aside. This regulation was strengthened in 2009 under the 'Energy Package' by the introduction by the Renewable Energy Directive of a mandatory target of 10% incorporation of renewable energy in fuels by 2020. This legislation is supplemented by a Fuel Quality Directive which imposes a 6% reduction of the carbon footprint of fuels sold for transport by 2020. The high rate of diesel motorization of the personal vehicle fleet in Europe has led to a rapid increase in biodiesel consumption (11 million tons, of which 9 produced in the EU). Rapeseed oil is the main feedstock for biodiesel. A rapid increase of EU rapeseed production allowed to meet this demand, while providing a protein co-product which significantly reduced the EU protein deficit. The debate on the ILUC impact (indirect land use change) of biofuels, as well as the food vs fuel debate, led the European Commission, 3 years after setting its bioenergy policy, to make a proposal which would set a 5% cap on biofuels from food-crops (1st generation) and to introduce "ILUC factors" in the assessment of the greenhouse gas reductions. This proposal could seriously put into question the development of biodiesel... and the cultivation of rapeseed. At the time of writing of this article (July 2013), the Commission proposal is subject of difficult negotiations in Brussels, whose outcome is difficult to predict. © 2013 P.

AB  - The identification of major trends and critical parameters of the evolution of the price of crude oil and transportation fuels is one of the elements with the issue of climate change to define public policy development sectors of alternative fuels in transport. The work presented here attempts to provide an analytical framework in this direction both on the assessment of short-term market (share of geopolitical phenomena) and the possible long-term scenarios. The concepts of floor price (based on the marginal cost of production) and ceiling price (cost alternatives or alternative) are explained as part defining the window of change in crude oil prices on the international market. Scenarios of possible changes in supply (e.g. as unconventional crude) and demand (stress CO2) are presented to evaluate a possible range: $ 80 to $ 160/b in constant dollars. Scenarios of transportation fuel prices, particularly that of diesel oil are then deducted from this analysis, from which are positioned biofuel prices (here from vegetable oils) and therefore the issues of economic competitiveness apart from incentive mechanisms. © 2013 G.

AB  - As reported in literature the production of biodiesel should lead to a lower energy consumption than those obtainable with its use. So, to justify its consumption, a sustainable and “low input” production should be carried out. In order to assess the sustainability of Linum usitatissimum, Camelina sativa and Brassica carinata cultivation for biodiesel production in terms of energy used compared to that obtained, the index EROEI (Energy Return On Energy Invested) has been used. At this aim, an experimental field was realised in the south-eastern Sicilian land. During the autumn-winter crop cycle, no irrigation was carried out and some suitable agricultural practices have been carried out taking into account the peculiarity of each type of used seeds. The total energy consumed for the cultivation of oil bearing crops from sowing to the production of biodiesel represents the Input of the process. In particular, this concerned the energy embodied in machinery and tools utilized, in seed, chemical fertilizer and herbicide but also the energy embodied in diesel fuels and lubricant oils. In addition, the energy consumption relating to machines and reagents required for the processes of extraction and transesterification of the vegetable oil into biodiesel have been calculated for each crops. The energy obtainable from biodiesel production, taking into account the energy used for seed pressing and for vegetable oil transesterification into biodiesel, represents the Output of the process. The ratio Output/Input gets the EROEI index which in the case of Camelina sativa and Linum usatissimum is greater than one. These results show that the cultivation of these crops for biofuels production is convenient in terms of energy return on energy investment. The EROEI index for Brassica carinata is lower than one. This could means that some factors, concerning mechanisation and climatic conditions, were not suitable to ensure higher crop yields. © 2013, Copyright A. Restuccia et al.

AB  - Jatropha curcas has been identified as an alternate source for biofuel, and thus requires immediate establishment of plantations in areas not utilized for food production such as in mine tailings sites. Screenhouse experiments were conducted to determine the survival, growth and copper (Cu) accumulation of non-mycorrhizal or mycorrhizal J. curcas seedlings or cuttings grown in oven sterilized grassland soil from Caliraya, Laguna and in mine tailing soils from Paracale, Camarines Norte and Mogpog, Marinduque. Grassland soil was sterilized in an oven for three days at 100 °C prior to use. Seedlings or cuttings were either uninoculated or inoculated with Mykovam or MineVAM mycorrhizal inoculants. Results show that Paracale soil supported the highest survival and best growth of seedlings or cuttings. In Mogpog soil, all seedlings died before two months except those inoculated with Mykovam while all cuttings died on the third month. Non-mycorrhizal seedlings did not survive in Caliraya soil while mycorrhizal inoculation increased seedling survival and growth. Cuttings did not respond to inoculation, probably due to low mycorrhizal infection (≤14%) as compared to seedlings (≤100%). Mykovam promoted higher survival and better plant growth than MineVAM because of its higher root colonization. Cu accumulation was higher in the roots of mycorrhizal plants and the lowest was in the leaves especially in the Mykovam-inoculated plants. In conclusion, Mykovam inoculated J. curcas grew better with higher survival rate than the control thus this imply that rehabilitation of grasslands in Caliraya, Laguna and mine tailing areas in Paracale, Camarines Norte can be done for its potential for biofuel production. However, field trials should be conducted.

AB  - The paper contains description of the working principles and evaluation of the operational parameters of the commercially available fuel conversion adapter, intended to adapt gasoline fuelled spark ignition (SI) engine for use of high ethanol content blended fuel, known as E85. Commercially available gasoline and E85 fuel were used as test fuels. Production automobile, equipped with 1.8 litre 4 cylinder SI port fuel injection (PFI) engine was tested on the roll-type eddy-current chassis dynamometer in wide open throttle (WOT) constant speed mode. High precision fuel consumption measurement system AVL KMA Mobile was used. Engine operating parameters, used for evaluation of the efficiency of the fuel conversion adapter was engine torque (T), engine brake power (Pb), air/fuel equivalence ratio (λ), specific fuel consumption (SFC) and engine thermal efficiency (ηt). Analysis of engine operational parameters showed successful operation of fuel conversion adapter with E85 fuel, resulting in increase of engine peak torque by 4.4%, increase of energy efficiency in whole tested engine speed range up to 6.1% but increase of specific fuel consumption by approximately 22%, when compared with the gasoline use.

AB  - Advanced conversion processes such as gasification technology for biomass have been under development for the last 30 years. First commercial plants went into operation. Over this period, motivation for biomass gasification has changed repeatedly. At first, production of high-temperature heat was the major motivation, later generation of electricity or combined heat and power (CHP). During the last ten years production of liquid and gaseous biofuels via gasification has been intensely studied and developed, which has increased the demands on the quality of syngas. This paper focuses on gasification development within Europe. Selected examples give an impression of current status and expected developments of gasification technologies for the production of electricity, liquid or gaseous biofuels. The examples make clear that there is still a considerable potential for innovation. Therefore, in coming years further technological breakthroughs can be expected. This development is expected to be supported by the implementation of the European Industrial Bioenergy Initiative (EIBI) and the planned European Public Private Partnership of bio-based industries ("Bridge"). It will be necessary to simultaneously advance fundamentally different technological options (e.g. enzyme- and thermochemical-based processes) and to perform intensive broad-based research to increase the efficiency of processes and to optimize the yields. For the market introduction of large-scale biomass gasification plants, i.e. of at least 50 MWWood power production, framework conditions have to be adapted in order to reduce commercial risk for investors. Biomass gasification can make a significant contribution for reduction of CO2 and the use of non renewable energy sources. It has to be understood as an integral part of an overall energy system.

AB  - Petroleum is the main source of energy for internal-combustion engines, enabling its transformation into mechanical energy. Oil dependence leads to the needs of alternatives, through the cultivation of renewable raw materials. The current problems are the costs of biofuels, which are higher than those derived from petroleum, and the fact that there are few combustion engines suitable for vegetable oils. Thus, further research on the techniques of production and refining of biofuels, and the suitability of engines using vegetable oils are necessary, so that they can be a viable alternative. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize different mixtures and to evaluate the performance of an agricultural tractor drive tires, using mixtures of petroleum diesel (OD) with reused soybean oil (OSR). At first, we conducted a study of density, viscosity of the mixtures and behavior of the temperature of the OD in the system of fuel supply of the engine. After analyses, the performance of the mixtures of OD and OSR was verified by assays in the traction bar. The main conclusions of this study were: the density and viscosity of the mixtures undergo variations with increasing amount of OSR and temperature variation. Regarding the evaluations in the traction bar, the best results were observed for the yield of the tractor were verified with the increase of the mixture percentages (25% OSR to load N, 25%, 75% and 100% OSR for the fourth gear, as load and 75% and 100% OSR for third, second and first gear as load).

AB  - In this investigation, cotton seed methyl ester (CSME) was prepared by transesterification using potassium hydroxide (KOH) as catalyst. The engine performance was analysed with different blends of biodiesel and was compared with neat diesel. It was concluded that the lower blends of biodiesel are closer to diesel as far as thermal efficiency is concerned. In the lower blends, the brakes specific fuel consumption is also comparatively reduced. The smoke density also increases for the blends of methyl ester of cotton seed oil diesel compared to neat diesel operation. The oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission level are decreased with the blends of methyl ester of cotton seed oil compared to neat diesel. The results proved that the use of biodiesel (produced from cotton seed oil) in compression ignition engine is a viable alternative to diesel. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - This paper describes an application of hybrid MCDM technique for the selection of optimum blend in fish oil biodiesel among the six alternative fuel blends diesel, B20, B40, B60, B80 and B100 which is prepared by varying the amount of diesel with biodiesel. Brake thermal efficiency (BTE), exhaust gas temperature (EGT), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), smoke, hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), ignition delay (ID), combustion duration (CD) and maximum rate of pressure rise (MRPR) are considered as evaluation criteria. A single cylinder, constant speed and direct injection diesel engine with a rated output of 4.4 kW was used for exploratory analysis of evaluation criteria at different load conditions. The proposed model, fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) is integrated with elimination et and choice translating reality (ELECTRE) to evaluate the optimum blend. Here the FAHP is used to determine the relative weights of the criteria, whereas ELECTRE is used for obtaining the final ranking of alternative blends. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Increase of petroleum diesel usage and its environmental pollution necessitate the study of alternate fuel production. Vegetable oils are the viable alternate form of non-polluted, renewable fuel to diesel engines. In this work, the non-edible oil, neem (Azadirachta indica) was used to produce biodiesel by a two step transesterification process. The fuel properties of the biodiesel thus produced were determined by standard methods. It is further tested in a single cylinder diesel engine by mixing with petroleum diesel in various percentages. The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and specific fuel consumption (SFC) of the engine running with biodiesel blends (10-50%) were compared with the petroleum diesel. The results have shown that the performance of the diesel engine was similar as that of normal diesel and thus the use of biodiesel in diesel engine is viable. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - One of the current targets of European Union (EU) energy policy is to reach at least a 10% share of biofuels in fuel consumed for transportation (petrol and diesel) in 2020. However, it has not been specified how this global target should be distributed among the Member States according to its different starting points and potentials. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to propose a dynamic nonlinear target distribution method for increasing the share of biofuels in fuel consumed for transportation. We applied the proposed distribution based on the following indicators: nonbiofuels in fuel consumed for transportation, nonbiofuels per capita, nonbiofuels per gross domestic product (GDP), and GDP per capita, in the reference year (2005). In addition, a multicriteria analysis was also conducted to weigh the variables in the study. The proposed methodology is innovative, easy-to-use, and attempts to contribute to the political discussion on the importance of territorial weighing of the biofuel consumption target by the real situation in each member state. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The goal of this study was the determination of basic physical properties such as density, calorifi c value and rheological properties of liquid biofuels. Biofuels on the base of bioethanol and rapeseed methyl ester were chosen. Following control samples were selected: diesel oil without admixture of methyl esters and commercially available diesel oils with small amount of methyl ester admixture (6.2 and 6.5%). Dynamic viscosities of individual samples were measured in the range from -10°C to 50°C. Then dependence of shear rate on shear stress was measured at temperatures -10, 0, 20 and 40°C. The most of samples showed the Newtonian behaviour. However, samples with high content of methyl esters or pure methyl esters showed thixotropy behaviour at the low temperature.

AB  - The present world inevitably depends on conventional fossil fuel for a range of utilities like industrial production, electricity generation, transportation and domestic purposes. Regardless of its increased demand, the non renewable fuel resources are diminishing at an alarming rate. The environmental pollution effect of conventional diesel is frightening. The pollution effect of diesel begins from its production and lasts till its exhausts after combustion. The research work is carried on to find a suitable renewable fuel with reduced emissions as a substitute for downsized fossil fuels. The combination of Pongamia pinnata biodiesel and hydrogen is tested in experimental set up of CI engine with AVL gas analyser. The emission parameters like NOx, HC, CO and CO2 are measured. The experimental study analysis is made for various fuel combinations of hydrogen, Pongamia pinnata biodiesel and DEE comparing with conventional diesel. The emission reduction technique EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) is implemented and results are compared.

AB  - Vegetable oils offer almost the same power output with slightly lower thermal efficiency when used in diesel engines. Neem oil being non-edible could be regarded as an alternative fuel for compression ignition engines. Vegetable oils like neem oil are available in rural areas and have high cetane number and calorific value quite close to that of diesel fuel. The uses of any vegetable oils have some problems when subjected to prolonged usage in diesel engines. The problems are attributed to high viscosity, low volatility and poly unsaturated character of neat vegetable oils. Higher viscosity of vegetable oils causes improper atomization of fuels during injection and result in incomplete combustion. The viscosity of neem oil is reduced by transesterification to obtain neem oil methyl ester. Application of bio-fuel derived through transesterification of Neem oil is prevalent in diesel engines since it has fuel economy and reduction of emission of exhaust gases. In the present study necessary efforts have been made to prepare a biofuel through trans-esterification from raw neem oil to study the performance, combustion analysis and emission characteristics. The derived fuel called "NEEM OIL METHYL ESTER" (NOMEC17H34COOCH3) has been used in a single cylinder water cooled diesel engine under standard operating conditions. The experimental investigations were carried out to assess the combustion analysis, performance and emission levels of the engine using NOME and its blends with diesel. The brake thermal efficiency of NOME is found to be much higher than diesel due to improved combustion lubricity and reduced friction. The NOx level, the exhaust gas temperature and HC for NOME are found to be higher than diesel due to efficient combustion, lower viscosity and good mixture formation. The smoke is also found to be lower than diesel, because of excess oxygen present in the bio-diesel. Under combustion analysis heat release rate, rate of pressure rise, and cylinder pressure were calculated, plotted and curves were drawn for diesel fuel, NOME and its blends with diesel and compared with diesel fuel. The heat release rate is slightly higher for NOME compared to diesel because of better premixed combustion and increases NOX emissions. Adiabatic flame temperatures were also calculated for NOME and its blends with diesel. The adiabatic flame temperature is reduced drastically with excess air for diesel, NOME, B20 and B30. It is found that adiabatic flame temperature of B20 is close to diesel. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.

AB  - Brazil aims to increase palm oil production to meet the growing national and global demand for edible oil and biodiesel while preserving environmentally and culturally significant areas. As land use change (LUC) is the result of complex interactions between socio-economic and biophysical drivers operating at multiple temporal and spatial scales, the type and location of LUC depend on drivers such as neighboring land use, conversion elasticity, access to infrastructure, distance to markets, and land suitability. The purpose of this study is to develop scenarios to measure the impact of land conversion under three different enforcement scenarios (none, some, and strict enforcement). We found that converting 22.5 million hectares of land can produce approximately 29 billion gallons (110 billion liters) of biodiesel a year. Of that, 22-71% of the area can come from forest land, conservation units, wetland and indigenous areas, emitting 14-84 gCO 2e MJ-1. This direct land use emission alone can be higher than the carbon intensity of diesel that it intends to displace for lowering greenhouse gas emissions. This letter focuses narrowly on GHG emissions and does not address socio-economic-ecological prospects for these degraded lands for palm oil or for other purposes. Future studies should carefully evaluate these tradeoffs. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The potential of first generation biofuels to mitigate climate change is still largely debated in the scientific and policy-making arenas. It is currently assessed through life cycle assessment (LCA), a method for accounting for the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of a given product from "cradle-to-grave", which is widely used to aid decision making on environmental issues. Although LCA is standardized, its application to biofuels leads to inconclusive results often fraught by a high variability and uncertainty. This is due to differences in quantifying the environmental impacts of feedstock production, and the difficulties encountered when considering land use changes (LUC) effects. The occurrence of LUC mechanisms is in part the consequence of policies supporting the use of biofuels in the transport sector, which implicitly increases the competition between various possible uses of land worldwide. Here, we review the methodologies recently put forward to include LUC effects in LCAs, and examples from the US, Europe and France. These cross analysis show that LCA needs to be adapted and combined to other tools such as economic modeling in order to provide a more reliable assessment of the biofuels chains. © 2013 W.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the environmental emissions associated with the production of a typical white wine produced in Sardinia, with particular reference to CO2 emissions. The main objective is to determine the main environmental impacts of the overall production process and to identify what steps have the greatest level of criticity. Methods: An attributional and partial Life Cycle Assessment analysis was used with GaBi software. Results: The analysis shows that the main problems were the production and combustion of diesel in the viticulture phase, above all during the vine planting phase, and the production of glass bottles in the phase of wine bottling within the winery processes. Conclusions and recommendations: To overcome these critical points, some suggestions come from the most recent literature, such as the use of biofuels in the first case and the use of lighter bottles in the second. More in-depth analysis is needed to compare these alternatives in order to assess the effective reduction of environmental emissions. © 2013 UniCeSV, University of Florence.

AB  - Combo deal: Biomass furaldehydes are upgraded into oxygenated diesel and high-quality C10-12 linear alkane fuels. The first of two steps involves solvent-free self-condensation (Umpolung) through organocatalysis using an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC), yielding C10-C12 furoin intermediates. In the metal-acid tandem catalysis step, in water, the furoin intermediates are converted into oxygenated biodiesel by hydrogenation, etherification or esterification; or into premium alkane jet fuels by hydrodeoxygenation.

AB  - This work shows the performance and emissions profile of a diesel engine operating with ethanol injected into the air of the inlet manifold in time with the high-pressure injection of a mixture of diesel and biodiesel. The ethanol injection uses an electronic management system that detects the high-pressure pulse in the diesel injection line as the injection trigger. The air intake temperature reduction caused by the ethanol injection could be evaluated. The tests were made in an engine at 1800. rpm, connected to an electric generator. The high-pressure injection fuel was always a binary blend of diesel and biodiesel, which was supplemented by injected ethanol, producing 5 different fuel compositions. The first of the tested compositions was the binary blend without ethanol, while the others had increasing alcohol content. The fifth composition used 15% of ethanol but had a 0.4% of the additive di-tert-butyl peroxide mixed in the main fuel. The addition of ethanol led to a reduction in diesel fuel consumption, although the overall energy expenditure was increased. The emissions profile showed a consistent reduction in NOx emissions and opacity with the addition of ethanol, breaking up the traditional inverse relationship between NOx and PM emissions, but shown an increase in CO and THC emissions. The energy analysis showed a decrease in engine efficiency with the addition of ethanol. The use of the additive showed a slight increase of engine efficiency and the reduction of the CO and THC emissions. There was a significant reduction in the air intake temperature with the use of ethanol, suggesting that part of the reduction of NOx may be attributed to this temperature reduction. It was proven that the ethanol addition can be an important method to reduce the amount of NOx in the exhaust gases of diesel engines. © 2013 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - As production of biofuels from agricultural commodities is expanding, concerns about social and environmental implications are also rising. The production of biofuels may lead to both positive and negative socio-economic impacts. This paper analyzes the impacts of biodiesel demand on the price of oil palm and associated products using demand and supply function model. The impacts cover positive impacts i.e. currency savings and increase in farmers' income due to higher price of oil palm, and negative impacts i.e. increase in food price represented by bottled palm oil, and biodiesel for energy. The biodiesel blending ratios of 3, 5 and 10%, namely B3, B5 and B10, respectively are studied. The result reveals that the biodiesel implementation in Thailand has a minimal effect on palm oil price. Though the net socio-economic impact is negative, biodiesel has a positive contribution towards reducing fossil fuel demand and energy diversity. © 2013 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - Algae and jatropha, two types of promising and unconventional biomass, are investigated in this study for large-scale production of biodiesel. The aim is to evaluate the potential advantages and the magnitude of closeness of life cycle balances between these two biodiesel pathways compared to fossil diesel, by taking into account possible uncertainties. The geographical location of this study is India with a prospect of utilizing available wastelands in southern regions. The results indicate that the environmental performance of algal biodiesel is comparable to that of jatropha biodiesel. Both show significant GHG emission and fossil energy depletion reductions which are in the range of 36-40 and 10-25% respectively compared to fossil diesel in the studied geographic context. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The availability of about 18 million hectares of grassland in Pará State, Brazil, and the possibility of increasing the livestock density display a good perspective for the oil palm expansion in pasture land. A life cycle assessment is performed for a prospective palm-based biorefinery to view two regional and one global environmental impact and the consequences of the land-use change in terms of GHG emissions. Oil palm cultivation in an area of ~110,000hectares of land can annually produce ~39,000tons of bioethanol, ~340,000tons of biodiesel, ~268GW h net electricity and other co-products. The life cycle GHG emissions reduction for biodiesel and bioethanol as compared to fossil diesel and gasoline would be 76.9-79.3% and 83.7-88.6%. The advantage of grassland rehabilitation by oil palm plantation is the removal of ~188t CO2/ha from the atmosphere during the plant lifetime. The entire inflows and outflows for the conversion processes are schemed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An environmental assessment and a cost analysis were conducted for mobility options using electricity, hydrogen, ethanol, Fischer-Tropsch diesel and methane derived from wood. Therefore, the overall life cycle with regard to greenhouse gas emissions, acidifying emissions and fossil energy demand as well as costs is analysed. The investigation is carried out for mobility options in 2010 and gives an outlook to the year 2030.Results show that methane utilization in the car is beneficial with regard to environmental impacts (e.g. 58.5g CO2-eq./km) and costs (23.1€-ct./km) in 2010, especially in comparison to hydrogen usage (132.4g CO2-eq./km and 63.9€-ct./km).The electric vehicle construction has high environmental impacts and costs compared to conventional vehicles today, but with technical improvements and further market penetration, battery electric vehicles can reach the level of concepts with combustion engines in future applications (e.g. cost decrease from 38.7 to 23.4. €-ct./km). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Petroleum fuels are predominantly transported domestically by pipelines, whereas biofuels are almost exclusively transported by rail, barge, and truck. As biofuel production increases, new pipelines may become economically attractive. Location-specific variables impacting pipeline viability include construction costs, availability and costs of alternative transportation modes, electricity prices and emissions (if priced), throughput, and subsurface temperature. When transporting alcohol or diesel-like fuels, pipelines have a lower direct energy intensity than rail, barge, and trucks if fluid velocity is under 1. m/s for 4-inch diameter pipelines and 2. m/s for 8-inch or larger pipelines. Across multiple hypothetical state-specific scenarios, profit-maximizing design velocities range from 1.2 to 1.9. m/s. In costs and GHG emissions, optimized pipelines outperform trucks in each state and rail and barge in most states, if projected throughput exceeds four billion liters/year. If emissions are priced, optimum design diameters typically increase to reduce pumping energy demands, increasing the cost-effectiveness of pipeline projects. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Well-to-wake (WTWa) analysis of bio-based aviation fuels, including hydroprocessed renewable jet (HRJ) from various oil seeds, Fischer-Tropsch jet (FTJ) from corn-stover and co-feeding of coal and corn-stover, and pyrolysis jet from corn stover, is conducted and compared with petroleum jet. WTWa GHG emission reductions relative to petroleum jet can be 41-63% for HRJ, 68-76% for pyrolysis jet and 89% for FTJ from corn stover. The HRJ production stage dominates WTWa GHG emissions from HRJ pathways. The differences in GHG emissions from HRJ production stage among considered feedstocks are much smaller than those from fertilizer use and N2O emissions related to feedstock collection stage. Sensitivity analyses on FTJ production from coal and corn-stover are also conducted, showing the importance of biomass share in the feedstock, carbon capture and sequestration options, and overall efficiency. For both HRJ and FTJ, co-product handling methods have significant impacts on WTWa results. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The sensor is based both on the sensitivity of a long period grating to changes in the surroundings refractive index and on the thermo-optical properties of oil-biodiesel blends. The sensor response is provided by a temperature coded interrogation unit that employs an auxiliary fiber Bragg grating. The standard metrological analysis of an optimized sensor showed that is possible to detect until 0.10% v/v of oil in oil-biodiesel blends. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Membrane Fractionation of Biomass Fast Pyrolysis Oil and Impact of its Presence on a Petroleum Gas Oil Hydrotreatment—In order to limit the greenhouse effect causing climate change and reduce the needs of the transport sector for petroleum oils, transformation of lignocellulosic biomass is a promising alternative route to produce automotive fuels, chemical intermediates and energy. Gasification and liquefaction of biomass resources are the two main routes that are under investigation to convert biomass into biofuels. In the case of the liquefaction, due to the unstability of the liquefied products, one solution can be to perform a specific hydrotreatment of fast pyrolysis bio-oils with petroleum cuts in existing petroleum refinery system. With this objective, previous studies [Pinheiro et al. (2009) Energy Fuels 23, 1007-1014; Pinheiro et al. (2011) Energy Fuels 25, 804-812] have been carried out to investigate the impact of oxygenated model compounds on a Straight Run Gas Oil (SRGO) hydrotreatment using a CoMo catalyst. The authors have demonstrated that the main inhibiting effects are induced from CO and CO2 produced during hydrodeoxygenation of esters and carboxylic acids. To go further, cotreatment of a fast pyrolysis oil with the same SRGO as used in the previous studies was investigated in this present work. Firstly the bio-oil was separated into four fractions by membrane fractionation using 400 and 220 Da molecular weight cut-off membranes. The bio-oil and its fractions were analyzed by spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques. Then, one fraction (i.e. fraction enriched in compounds with molecular weight from 220 to 400 Da) was mixed with the SRGO and co-treated. Despite some experimental difficulties mainly due to the emulsion instability, the hydrotreatment was successful. An inhibition has been observed on the hydrotreating reactions of the SRGO in presence of the bio-oil fraction. The measurement of the CO/CO2/CH4 molar flowrate at the reactor outlet showed that the inhibition was due to the presence of CO and CO2 coming from HDO rather than to the oxygen compounds themselves. © 2013, IFP Energies nouvelles.

AB  - 2nd generation biofuels will have an important part to take in the energy transition as far as fuels are concerned. Using non edible biomass, they will avoid any direct competition with food usage. Within 2nd generation biofuels, the BTL route consists in the production of middle distillates (Diesel and jet fuel) via gasification and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. These fuels are called "drop in" fuels; this means that to be used they technically do not request any modification in the vehicle whatever the blending rate with conventional fuels. This route is currently at the pre-industrial phase where demonstration is required. This article presents the BioTfueL project which has been created by Axens, CEA, IFP Energies nouvelles, Sofiprotéol, ThyssenKrupp Uhde and Total. This project is focused on the original concept of co-processing (biomass can be gasified together with fossil feedstock) and proposes to develop and demonstrate a full process chain to be commercialized worldwide via licensing. © 2013, IFP Energies nouvelles.

AB  - Fischer-Tropsch (FT) based B-XTL processes are attractive alternatives for future energy production. These processes aim at converting lignocellulosic biomass possibly in co-processing with petcoke, coal, or vacuum residues into synthetic biofuels. A gasification step converts the feed into a synthesis gas (CO and H2 mixture), which undergoes the Fischer-Tropsch reaction after H2/CO ratio adjustment and CO2 removal. However synthesis gas also contains various impurities that must be removed in order to prevent Fischer-Tropsch catalyst poisoning. Due to the large feedstocks variety that can be processed, significant variations of the composition of the synthesis gas are expected. Especially, this affects the nature of the impurities that are present (element, speciation), as well as their relative contents. Moreover, due to high FT catalyst sensitivity, severe syngas specifications regarding its purity are required. For these reasons, synthesis gas purification constitutes a major challenge for the development of B-XTL processes. In this article, we focus on these major hurdles that have to be overcome.

AB  - A Short Historical Review of Fast Pyrolysis of Biomass – In this short review, we survey the historical progress of fast pyrolysis technologies for thermochemical liquefaction of biomass to produce so-called “bio-oil”. Our focus is on the potential applications of bio-oil as a liquid fuel for heat and power generation. We point out some of the inherent properties of bio-oil that create difficulties standing in the way of these applications. Finally, we take a brief look at some processes that aim to valorize bio-oil by conversion to higher value liquid fuel products. © 2013, IFP Energies nouvelles.

AB  - Access to fuels for transportation and electric power for buildings is a critical component for prosperity. Reliable sources of energy are often difficult to access in rural or underdeveloped regions. Although developing countries in tropical regions are often rich in biological resources, such as biomass and oil seeds, however, extreme poverty, lack of an educated populace and an absence of a reliable manufacturing infrastructure mean that these resources go largely untapped. This contribution will describe the design of a promising prototype for an appropriate technology for the sustainable, low-cost production of biodiesel and its required raw materials from locally available materials and feed stocks. The biodiesel processor will be fuelled by wood or charcoal, consist of no moving parts and utilize passive temperature control. This novel process will be safe, easy to operate and suitable for individual or community scale production. The project described herein has been developed in collaboration with the African Centre for Renewable Energy and Sustainable Technology (ACREST), an NGO in Cameroon. Further, the implementation of this process by a student team in Bangang Village, Cameroon in sub-Saharan Africa will be described. This project is part of a student led People, Prosperity and the Planet design project, sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

AB  - The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a goal that one billion gallons of renewable jet fuel is consumed by the US aviation industry each year from 2018. We examine the economic and emissions impacts of this goal using renewable fuel produced from a Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process from renewable oils. Our approach employs an economy-wide model of economic activity and energy systems and a detailed partial equilibrium model of the aviation industry. If soybean oil is used as a feedstock, we find that meeting the aviation biofuel goal in 2020 will require an implicit subsidy from airlines to biofuel producers of $2.69 per gallon of renewable jet fuel. If the aviation goal can be met by fuel from oilseed rotation crops grown on otherwise fallow land, the implicit subsidy is $0.35 per gallon of renewable jet fuel. As commercial aviation biofuel consumption represents less than 2% of total fuel used by this industry, the goal has a small impact on the average price of jet fuel and carbon dioxide emissions. We also find that, under the pathways we examine, the cost per tonne of CO2 abated due to aviation biofuels is between $50 and $400. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Physical and chemical properties of biodiesel are influenced by structural features of the fatty acids, such as chain length, degree of unsaturation and branching of the carbon chain. This study investigated if microalgal fatty acid profiles are suitable for biodiesel characterization and species selection through Preference Ranking Organisation Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) and Graphical Analysis for Interactive Assistance (GAIA) analysis. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles were used to calculate the likely key chemical and physical properties of the biodiesel [cetane number (CN), iodine value (IV), cold filter plugging point, density, kinematic viscosity, higher heating value] of nine microalgal species (this study) and twelve species from the literature, selected for their suitability for cultivation in subtropical climates. An equal-parameter weighted (PROMETHEE-GAIA) ranked Nannochloropsis oculata, Extubocellulus sp. and Biddulphia sp. highest; the only species meeting the EN14214 and ASTM D6751-02 biodiesel standards, except for the double bond limit in the EN14214. Chlorella vulgaris outranked N. oculata when the twelve microalgae were included. Culture growth phase (stationary) and, to a lesser extent, nutrient provision affected CN and IV values of N. oculata due to lower eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) contents. Application of a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) weighting to saturation led to a lower ranking of species exceeding the double bond EN14214 thresholds. In summary, CN, IV, C18:3 and double bond limits were the strongest drivers in equal biodiesel parameter-weighted PROMETHEE analysis. © 2013 by the authors.

AB  - The preparation, characterization and catalytic activity test of Cr/acid activated natural zeolite on palm oil hydrocracking reaction into liquid biofuels fraction were performed. Natural zeolite obtained from Klaten, Indonesia was activated with 1 M sulfuric acid to obtain a sample of acid activated natural zeolite (ZZA). The catalysts preparation was made by impregnation method of precursor salt solution of Cr(NO3) 3·9H2O into acid activated natural zeolite samples, followed by calcination, oxidation and reduction, to bring the material become Cr/acid activted natural zeolite catalyst. Catalyst characterization includes the determination of the TO4 site (T = Si or Al) in zeolite which was observed by the infrared spectrometry (FT-IR) and Brønsted-Lewis acid sites, the determination of acidity by the method of vapour adsorption of ammonia and pyridine on the internal and external surfaces of the catalyst, catalysts crystallinity was determined with the diffraction of X-ray method and the porosity of the catalyst was analyzed with a surface area analysis method. Palm oil hydrocracking reactions was carried out by using a fixed-bed reactor at 450 °C and the H2 flow rate was 20 mL/min, in the ratio variation of the feed/catalyst 1/1, 2/1 and 3/1, respectively by doing the preliminary preparation of the palm oil. Liquid product analysis by using the chromatography gas method, to calculate the fraction of gasoline, kerosene and diesel. The result shows that the acid activation and the insertion of the metal on the surface of zeolite could increased the acidity of the samples. Acid activated natural zeolite samples had specific surface area of 162.46 m2/g, meanwhile the Cr/acid activated natural zeolite catalyst was found 74.54 m 2/g. The highest conversion of liquid products was 82.05 % resulted from the ratio of the feed/catalyst of 2/1 with the preliminary preparation of the feed through the esterification reaction.

AB  - Biodiesel is a promising alternating environmentally benign fuel to mineral diesel. For the development of easier transesterification process, stable and active heterogeneous mixed metal oxide of TiO2-ZnO and ZnO nanocatalysts were synthesized and exploited for the palm oil transesterification process. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, and FE-SEM studies for their structural and morphological characteristics. It was found that TiO2-ZnO nanocatalyst exhibits good catalytic activity and the catalytic performance was greatly depends on (i) catalyst concentration (ii) methanol to oil molar ratio (iii) reaction temperature and (iv) reaction time. A highest 98% of conversion was obtained at the optimum reaction parameters with 200mg of catalyst loading and the biodiesel was analyzed by TLC and 1H NMR techniques. The TiO2-ZnO nanocatalyst shows good catalytic performance over the ZnO catalyst, which could be a potential candidate for the large-scale biodiesel production from palm oil at the reduced temperature and time. © 2013.

AB  - In order to eliminate the expense associated with solvent extraction and oil cleanup, and reduce the processing steps in biodiesel production, reactive extraction has become a focus of research in recent years. In this study, germinated castor seed was used as substrate and catalyst, dimethyl carbonate (DMC) was used as acyl acceptor and oil extractant to produce biodiesel. The optimum conditions were as follows: the germination time of castor seed was 72. h, DMC/germinated seed ratio was 12.5. ml/g, reaction temperature was 35. °C, and water content was 2.11%. The biodiesel yield could reach as much as 87.41% under the optimized conditions. This germinated oilseed self-catalyzed reactive extraction can be a promising route for biodiesel production. © 2013.

AB  - This paper studies autoignition characteristics and HCCI engine combustion of ketone fuels, which are important constituents of recently discovered fungi-derived biofuels. Two ketone compounds, 2,4-dimethyl-3-pentanone (DMPN) and cyclopentanone (CPN), are systematically investigated in the Sandia HCCI engine, and the results are compared with conventional gasoline and neat ethanol. It is found that CPN has the lowest autoignition reactivity of all the biofuels and gasoline blends tested in this HCCI engine. The combustion timing of CPN is also the most sensitive to intake-temperature (Tin) variations, and it is almost insensitive to intake-pressure (Pin) variations. These characteristics and the overall HCCI performance of CPN are similar to those of ethanol. In contrast, DMPN shows multi-faceted autoignition characteristics. On the one hand, DMPN has strong temperature-sensitivity, even at boosted Pin, which is similar to the low-reactivity ethanol and CPN. On the other hand, DMPN shows much stronger pressure-sensitivity than ethanol and CPN. This pressure-sensitivity reduces the Tin requirement for DMPN as Pin increases, in a manner similar to gasoline, and it allows the same Tin = 60ŶC for DMPN as for gasoline at Pin = 2.4 bar. At this Pin, DMPN reaches a maximum HCCI load similar to gasoline, ∼ 14 bar IMEP. Unlike gasoline, which requires significant combustion-timing retard to prevent knock at this maximum load, DMPN allows a more advanced combustion timing because its high temperature-sensitivity causes a lower heat release rate. As a result, DMPN yields a higher thermal efficiency than gasoline at comparable loads. Copyright © 2013 SAE International and Copyright © 2013 KSAE.

AB  - The strong demand for diesel fuel is producing a surplus of gasoline fractions in Europe. Despite new vehicles using less energy, the rising volume of traffic will lead to more diesel being consumed. European legislation demands that renewable fuels cover 10% of energy consumed in the transport sector. The present strategy of dividing biofuels in equal shares between diesel and gasoline does not help to improve this situation. It seems reasonable not only to add FAME but also ethanol to diesel. Unfortunately, fuel blends containing ethanol cannot be used in existing cars without hardware modifications. This is because of ethanol's characteristics and well-known from the experience gathered with gasoline cars. As such, the first part of this study investigates material compatibility, focusing on corrosion and changes to the mechanical properties of the materials used in diesel engines. Alongside tests for material compatibility with ethanol-RME blends, it also includes a comparison of RME and SME fuels. This first part concludes by explaining the modifications necessary to fuel lines and fuel-tank systems to make them safe for use with diesel-FAME-ethanol blends. In a second part, investigation characterizes the properties of the selected RME-ethanol-diesel blend, showing its potential in a single-cylinder research engine. It evaluates five operating points representative of the engine map. The aim is to assess changes in engine operation in a EU5 combustion system and define the recalibration measures needed to meet base-line performance. One aspect of investigating recalibration is to find out whether the better soot levels gained with oxygenated fuels can be translated into attaining lower NOx emission in line with the EU6 emission target.

AB  - Dwindling petroleum reserves and alarming level of air pollution has been an issue of great concern in recent times and researchers across the world are experimenting on variety of renewable fuels for meeting the future energy demands. Within the gamut of alternative fuels, biofuels are the most promising and have the potential to mitigate climate change and lease a new life to existing IC engines. The vegetable oils are having immense potential in this context and have been used either in neat or modified form by large number of researchers. Jatropha curcus is a perennial plant and bears non edible oil. The plant is drought tolerant and has been cultivated all over the arid and semi-arid areas for reforestation. In the present study, blends of jatropha oil and ethanol have been prepared in 5, 10, 15 and 20% (v/v) and evaluation of important properties of blends has been carried. The results show that properties are quite similar to diesel fuel. Performance and emission characteristics were evaluated for straight vegetable jatropha ethanol (SVJE) blends. Engine performance (brake specific energy consumption, brake thermal efficiency) and emissions (CO, HC, NOx, and smoke opacity) were measured to evaluate the behavior of the diesel engine running on SVJE blends. It has been found that at part load condition, the brake thermal efficiency and brake specific energy consumption of blends of SVJE were insignificant. HC, CO emissions and smoke opacity were reduced at part load condition. However, there was a decrease in NOx in case of SVJE diesel blends at full load condition. Copyright © 2013 SAE International.

AB  - The residue and waste streams of existing industry offer feasible and sustainable raw materials for biofuel production. All kind of biomass contains carbon and hydrogen which can be turned into liquid form with suitable processes. Using hydrotreatment or Biomass-to-Liquid technologies (BTL) the liquid oil can be further converted into transportation biofuels. Hydrotreatment technology can be used to convert bio-oils and fats in to high quality diesel fuels that have superior fuel properties (e.g. low aromatic content and high cetane number) compared to regular diesel fuel and first generation ester-type diesel fuel. UPM has developed a new innovative technology based on hydrotreatment that can be used to convert Crude Tall Oil (CTO) into high quality renewable diesel fuel. This study concentrated on determining the functionality and possible effects of CTO based renewable diesel as a blending component on engine emissions and engine performance. Tested fuels were Euro Stage IV diesel (CEC RF-06-03) as reference fuel and 30% CTO renewable diesel, blended with Euro Stage IV diesel. The results showed that CTO based renewable diesel blend properties were comparable to those of the reference diesel and fulfilled the limits set by the EN590 diesel standard. The engine performance as well as the engine emissions was similar with both fuels. For initial engine test, the renewable diesel was blended with RF-06-03 CEC reference fuel. During an intense test bench campaign engine load was varied from low load conditions up to full load. These tests revealed, that a blend of v./v. 30 % of the renewable diesel is perfectly suited for operation in a state-of-the-art diesel engine passenger car.

AB  - In order to thoroughly investigate and improve the path from biofuel production to combustion, the Cluster of Excellence "Tailor-Made Fuels from Biomass" was installed at RWTH Aachen University in 2007. Since then, a variety of fuel candidates have been investigated. In particular, 2-methyl tetrahydrofurane (2-MTHF) has shown excellent performance w.r.t. the particulate (PM) / NOx trade-off [1]. Unfortunately, the long ignition delay results in increased HC-, CO- and noise emissions. To overcome this problem, the addition of di-n-butylether (DNBE, CN ∼ 100) to 2-MTHF was analyzed. By blending these two in different volumetric shares, the effects of the different mixture formation and combustion characteristics, especially on the HC-, CO- and noise emissions, have been carefully analyzed. In addition, the overall emission performance has been compared to EN590 diesel. The results show that an addition of DNBE to 2-MTHF can lead to a reduction of HC- and CO-emissions by 75 % and noise emissions up to 4 dB. Simultaneously, none of the benefits gained with 2-MTHF with regard to the PM-emissions are not sacrificed. It could be proven, that by blending two molecules that are derived from biomass, a tailor-made fuel can be designed that allows optimizing the diesel combustion according to the desired criteria. In addition, both fuels were investigated in a High Pressure Chamber (HPC). Based on the results, new characteristic fuel numbers shall be developed in order to describe the combustion behaviour of the new fuels in a proper way, since the established ones are not sufficient to describe the combustion and emission performance of these fuels.

AB  - Fast depletion of fossil fuels with high fluctuating market prices has made the hunt for alternate resources for the production of transportation fuels mandatory. Our approach is to utilize rice straw as feedstock for the production of alcoholic biofuels. In this paper, we have compared the effect of various pretreatment processes on rice straw, viz. physical (steam under pressure) and chemical (acid) and enzymatic treatments as a precursor to ABE fermentation for production of biobutanol. Glucose analysis was done by quantification of glucose content spectrophotometrically via Glucose assay kit. The rice straw hydrolyzate produced through pretreatment was allowed to undergo anaerobic fermentation, using C. acetobutylicum MTCC 481. The yield and productivity of ABE solvents (acetone, butanol and ethanol) was calculated using HPLC. The ABE yield produced using hydrolyzate obtained through enzyme assisted acid hydrolysis, viz. acetone: 0.11, butanol: 0.861, ethanol: 0.05, was found to be the best among all experiments. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The interplay between nitrogen fertilization (N), yield, nitrous oxide emissions (N2O), and diesel fuel utilization associated with harvest and transport logistics of biomass crops remains poorly understood. In this research, we show that intensification (in terms of N) of bioenergy cropping to maximize yield supports not only minimized land use but also maximized logistics efficiency in terms of diesel use. This paradigm was examined within the scope of the billion-ton biofuels vision and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 using potential yields on marginal and prime agricultural land. Sixteen scenarios were investigated that considered the primary factors with agriculture bioenergy; biomass yield (11.2 and 22.4 Mg ha-1 yr-1), two nitrogen fertilizer application rates (50 and 100 kg N ha-1 yr-1), two Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGE) factors for synthetic nitrogen to nitrous oxide (1.5 and 5%), and three harvest/transportation efficiencies (50, 65, and 80%). These scenarios resulted in energy consumption between 747 and 1351 MJ Mg-1 and GHGE between 72 and 311 kg CO2 eq Mg-1. GHGE emissions are strongly related to the emission of nitrous oxide from soils due to nitrogen fertilization and could represent over 80% of the GHGE relative to biomass harvest logistics. These data imply that synthetic N supplementation to maximize yield could reduce the burden due to diesel fuel for harvest, but would rapidly become the most significant contributor to GHGE. Minimizing the impact of N fertilization will be critical for reducing the GHGE associated with biomass production. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.

AB  - The sustainable supply of lipids is the bottleneck for current biodiesel production. Here microbial recycling of glycerol, byproduct of biodiesel production to biodiesel in engineered Escherichia coli strains was reported. The KC3 strain with capability of producing fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) from glucose was used as a starting strain to optimize fermentation conditions when using glycerol as sole carbon source. The YL15 strain overexpressing double copies of atfA gene displayed 1.7-fold increase of FAEE productivity compared to the KC3 strain. The titer of FAEE in YL15 strain reached to 813mgL-1 in minimum medium using glycerol as sole carbon source under optimized fermentation conditions. The titer of glycerol-based FAEE production can be significantly increased by both genetic modifications and fermentation optimization. Microbial recycling of glycerol to biodiesel expands carbon sources for biodiesel production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Environmental consequences of using fossil fuels and concerns about petroleum supplies have spurred the search for renewable transportation biofuels. To solve global warming problems and ensure sustainable development of the economy, it is necessary to increase the use of renewable biomass resources. Biofuels have 2 faces: One pointing toward greenhouse gas reductions and the other toward increasing food insecurity, deforestation. The explosion in research on the production and subsequent use of biofuels has huge implications for science and future policy directions. The interdisciplinary nature of biofuels research makes the benefits open access to biologists, chemists, engineers, genomicists, and biotechnologists. Technologies to produce the first-generation liquid fuels, such as ethanol from starch and sugar and biodiesel from vegetable oils, are commercially installed. Systems integration and the integration of bioengineering with chemical engineering for cost-effective production is the road map to use second-generation fuels, such as cellulose ethanol, P-Series fuels, synthetic bio FT diesel and DME. Transportation biofuels, such as synfuel hydrocarbons or cellulosic ethanol, if produced from low-input biomass grown on agriculturally marginal land or from waste biomass, could provide much greater supplies and environmental benefits than food-based biofuels. The alternatives, like biofuels and hydrogen can be used in existing engine technologies and hydrogen can be efficiently used in upcoming technologies, such as fuel cells, which hold great potential in the forèseeable future. The biomass particularly appears to be an attractive alternative to hydrocarbons for producing both biofuels and hydrogen. © 2013 - Kalpana Corporation.

AB  - Crude bio-oil from pine chip fast pyrolysis was upgraded with olefins (1-octene, cyclohexene, 1,7-octadiene, and 2,4,4-trimethylpentene) plus 1-butanol (iso-butanol, t-butanol and ethanol) at 120 °C using a silica sulfuric acid (SSA) catalyst that possesses a good catalytic activity and stability. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) analysis showed that upgrading sharply increased ester content and decreased the amounts of levoglucosan, phenols, polyhydric alcohols and carboxylic acids. Upgrading lowered acidity (pH value rose from 2.5 to &gt;3.5), removed the unpleasant odor and increased hydrocarbon solubility. Water content dramatically decreased from 37.2% to about 7.0% and the heating value increased from 12.6 MJ·kg-1 to about 31.9 MJ·kg-1. This work has proved that bio-oil upgrading with a primary olefin plus 1-butanol is a feasible route where all the original heating value of the bio-oil plus the added olefin and alcohol are present in the resulting fuel. © 2013 by the authors.

AB  - This work reviews the current status of five selected companies at the forefront of production of liquid fuels from microalgae produced in 'closed' photobioreactors and fermenters: Algae.Tec, Algenol Biofuel, Heliae, Solazyme and Solix. All the five companies in the review have developed novel closed production systems, each with unique technology partners, capabilities and commercial strategies. Advantages of reactors include higher volumetric productivity and reduced contamination risks. Conversely, the largest challenges for reactors are minimising capital and production costs, in addition to attracting initial investment capital for non-conventional complex technical systems. This review provides a concise summary of each company's technology, background, and where available, a qualified assessment of the productivity and economics of their systems. This review demonstrates that commercially viable production systems will need to achieve sustained volumetric productivity to reduce per unit costs, and industry cross-collaboration will be essential for closed system technology developments to successfully produce cost-competitive fuels.

AB  - Botryococcus braunii GUBIOTJTBB1 was isolated from a freshwater reservoir in Assam, India and its taxonomic identity was confirmed by 18S rRNA sequence analysis. Biofuel potential of the microalga strain was assessed from batch culture under laboratory conditions, based on its lipid content and energy value of the dried biomass. Total lipid of 57.14% and hexane extractable crude hydrocarbon of 52.6% were recorded maximum at 56 and 28. days respectively, which vary upon culture durations. The energy value (54.69. kJ/g) of the strain's sundried biomass was found higher than that of petroleum diesel fuel and nearly twice than other microalgae strains compared. The strain GUBIOTJTBB1 was found superior in terms of total lipid and hydrocarbon contents comparing to the previously reported Indian strains of B. braunii. With further improvements in growth, the strain could become an ideal feedstock for potential biofuel production in the prevailing climatic conditions of the region. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, a recent simple separation technique, three-phase partitioning (TPP), was used for concentrating microalgae Chlorella spp. for the first time. More than 91.7% of the biomass precipitated in the interlayer of the system in 10. min. Temperature, initial concentration and ratio of ethanol to dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (DKP) were observed to negatively correlate with concentration factor while pH showed no significant influences. Using this method, biomass could be concentrated with much lower energy consumption and concentrated biomass could be conveniently collected. Besides, together with concentrating, TPP concentrated microalgae cells showed 26.3% increase in lipid extraction yield. Additionally, similarities in fatty acid profile indicated the avoidance of influence on lipid quality from chemicals. This study demonstrated the feasibility of TPP for microalgae biodiesel production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A major challenge for next decades is development of competitive renewable energy sources, highly needed to compensate fossil fuels reserves and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Among different possibilities, which are currently under investigation, there is the exploitation of unicellular algae for production of biofuels and biodiesel in particular. Some algae species have the ability of accumulating large amount of lipids within their cells which can be exploited as feedstock for the production of biodiesel. Strong research efforts are however still needed to fulfill this potential and optimize cultivation systems and biomass harvesting. Light provides the energy supporting algae growth and available radiation must be exploited with the highest possible efficiency to optimize productivity and make microalgae large scale cultivation energetically and economically sustainable. Investigation of the molecular bases influencing light use efficiency is thus seminal for the success of this biotechnology. In this work factors influencing light use efficiency in algal biomass production are reviewed, focusing on how algae genetic engineering and control of light environment within photobioreactors can improve the productivity of large scale cultivation systems. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this study was to develop an integrated system of biotransformation of carbon dioxide in oil refineries. The liquid and gaseous wastes from oil refining were considered for the cultivation of Aphanothece microscopica Nägeli in a bubble column photobioreactor. Growth kinetics, carbon dioxide removal and oxygen release rates, carbon balance, lipid production and biofuel quality were determined. The results showed the potential use of oil refinery wastes in microalgae-based systems under optimized culture conditions. The maximum specific growth rate was 1.4 day-1 and the maximum carbon dioxide elimination capacity was 22.9 mg/L min. Each CO 2 mass unit bioconverted resulted in approximately 0.75 O2 of mass units released. Carbon balance analyses indicated that a small fraction (3.64%) of the carbon dioxide is fixed into a biomass form. Volatile organic compounds (92.0%) were the main products of carbon dioxide transformation in the photobioreactor, in such conditions. For the production of biodiesel, it is possible to obtain 0.08 glipid/L day with this process. The quality properties of the biodiesel were an ester content of 99.7%, a cetane number of 51.3, an iodine value of 79.9 gI2/100 g, a degree of insaturation of 65.3% and a cold filter plugging point of 24.9 °C. Based on these results, the process developed could be considered a promising emerging biorefinery platform of waste-material-utilization type. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work proposes a decision-making framework for the selection of processes and unit operations for lignocellulosic bioethanol production. Process alternatives are described by its capital and operating expenditures, its contribution to process yield and technological availability information. A case study in second generation ethanol production using Eucalyptus globulus as raw material is presented to test the developed process synthesis tool. Results indicate that production cost does not necessarily decrease when yield increases. Hence, optimal processes can be found at the inflexion point of total costs and yield. The developed process synthesis tool provides results with an affordable computational cost, existing optimization tools and an easy-to-upgrade description of the process alternatives. These features made this tool suitable for process screening when incomplete information regarding process alternatives is available. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This research demonstrated hydrolysis of wet microalgal lipid and esterification of free fatty acid (FFA) using acid in one-step process. The investigation of simultaneous hydrolysis-esterification (SHE) of wet microalgal lipid was conducted by using L27 orthogonal design and the effects of water content, volume of sulphuric acid, volume of methanol, temperature and time on SHE were examined. As a result, water content was found to be the most effective factor. The effects of various parameters on fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) content and equilibrium relation between FAME and FFA were also examined under water content 80%. Equimolar amounts of sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid showed similar results. This method has great potential in terms of biodiesel production from microalgae since no organic solvents are used. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - By using pig pancreatic lipase (EC 3.1.1.3 or PPL) as a biocatalyst, covalently immobilized on amorphous AlPO4 support, a new second generation biodiesel was obtained in the transesterification reaction of sunflower oil with ethanol. The resulting biofuel is composed of fatty acid ethyl esters and monoglycerides (FAEE/MG) blended in a 2:1 molar ratio. This novel product, which integrates glycerol as monoacylglycerols (MG) into the biofuels composition, has similar physicochemical properties as conventional biodiesel and also avoids the removal step of the by-product by washing of the biodiesel with water. Immobilization of PPL was achieved by covalent attachment of the e-amino group of the lysine residues of PPL with the aldehyde groups of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde linked on a hybrid organic-inorganic functionalized AlPO4 surface. With this procedure, the PPL biocatalyst was strongly fixed to the inorganic support surface (94.3%). Nevertheless, the efficiency of the immobilized enzyme was relatively lower compared to that of the free PPL, but it showed a remarkable stability as well as a great capacity of reutilization (25 reuses) without a significant loss of its initial catalytic activity. Therefore, this enzymatic method allows the production of a biodiesel which integrates the glycerol, allows a more efficient fabrication method and minimizes the waste production as compared to the conventional alkali-catalyzed process. © 2013 by the authors.

AB  - An alternative concept is studied for third-generation biofuel production and use in low capacity self-contained cogeneration installations, making it possible to optimize the whole production cycle for conversion of biomass energy into thermal and electrical energy. It is shown that the use of contemporary steam piston engines instead of internal combustion engines in small thermal electric power plants with a capacity up to 1 MW makes it possible to use boiler biofuel prepared by simplified waste-free technology based on energy-efficient low-temperature processes with a marked (by a factor of 1.3-1.5 compared with steam turbines, and by a factor of 1.25-2 compared with diesel power stations) improvement in the efficiency of converting heat of combustion into electrical energy. Development of cogeneration systems of this class makes it possible to reduce the dependence of consumers on natural monopolies in the field of power supply due to the use of local (in this case renewable) fuel resources. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Two-step catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of fast pyrolysis oil was investigated for translating pyrolysis oil to transportation grade hydrocarbon liquid fuels. At the first mild HDO step, various organic solvents were employed to promote HDO of bio-oil to overcome coke formation using noble catalyst (Ru/C) under mild conditions (300°C, 10MPa). At the second deep HDO step, conventional hydrogenation setup and catalyst (NiMo/Al2O3) were used under severe conditions (400°C, 13MPa) for obtaining hydrocarbon fuel. Results show that the phenomenon of coke formation is effectively eliminated, and the properties of products have been significantly improved, such as oxygen content decreases from 48 to 0.5wt% and high heating value increases from 17 to 46MJkg-1. GC-MS analysis indicates that the final products include C11C27 aliphatic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons. In short, the fast pyrolysis oils were successfully translated to hydrocarbon liquid fuels using a two-step catalytic HDO process. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Transformation of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels involves multiple processes, in which thermal decomposition, hydrotreatment are the most central steps. Current work focuses on the impact of several solid acids and Keggin-type heteropolyacids on the decomposition temperature (Td) of pine wood and the characterization of the resulted products. It has been observed that a mechanical mixture of solid acids with pine wood has no influence on Td, while the use of heteropolyacids lower the Td by 100°C. Moreover, the treatment of biomass with a catalytic amount of H3PW12O40 leads to formation of three fractions: solid, liquid and gas, which have been investigated by elemental analysis, TGA, FTIR, GC-MS and NMR. The use of heteropolyacid leads, at 300°C, to a selective transformation of more than 50wt.% of the holocellulose part of the lignocellulosic biomass. Moreover, 60wt.% of the catalyst H3PW12O40 are recovered. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel has emerged as one of the most growing biofuels to replace diesel fuel. Its preference as one of the most popular alternative fuels was based on its characteristics as it is environment friendly, sustainable, biodegradable, and non-toxic. Biodiesel is mandated by many governments worldwide for incorporation into their diesel supply base. Biodiesel is easily produced through transesterification reactions of vegetable oils (triglycerides). However, current commercial usage of refined vegetable oils for biodiesel production is impractical and uneconomical due to high feedstock cost and priority as food resources. Low-grade oils, typically waste cooking oils, brown greases, crude corn oils, etc., can be better alternatives; however, the high free fatty acids (FFAs) content in such oils has become the main constrain for those potential feedstocks, and therefore pretreatment methods become necessary to prepare such feedstocks to make biodiesel. The chapter highlights the pretreatment methods to utilize and convert the FFAs from various feedstocks to biodiesel and presents the advantages and limitations of using enzymes and conventional catalysts, distillation, blending, and glycerolysis methods to lower FFAs in the feedstocks. An overview on the current status of biodiesel production, the feedstocks and the FFAs factors are also discussed. With the proper pretreatment methods, the high-FFAs feedstocks can indeed become the next ideal feedstocks for the production of biodiesel. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

AB  - Various renewable energy technologies are under considerable interest due to the projected depletion of our primary sources of energy and global warming associated with their utilizations. One of the alternatives under focus is renewable fuels produced from agricultural wastes. Malaysia, being one of the largest producers of palm oil, generates abundant agricultural wastes such as fibers, shells, fronds, and trunks with the potential to be converted to biofuels. However, prior to conversion of these materials to useful products, pre-treatment of biomass is essential as it influences the energy utilization in the conversion process and feedstock quality. This chapter focuses on pre-treatment technology of palm-based agriculture waste prior to conversion to solid, liquid, and gas fuel. Pre-treatment methods can be classified into physical, thermal, biological, and chemicals or any combination of these methods. Selecting the most suitable pre-treatment method could be very challenging due to complexities of biomass properties. Physical treatment involves grinding and sieving of biomass into various particle sizes whereas thermal treatment consists of pyrolysis and torrefaction processes. Additionally biological and chemical treatment using enzymes and chemicals to derive lignin from biomass are also discussed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

AB  - Bio-methane, a renewable vehicle fuel, is today produced by anaerobic digestion and a 2nd generation production route via gasification is under development. This paper proposes a poly-generation plant that produces bio-methane, bio-char and heat via fast pyrolysis of biomass. The energy and material flows for the fuel synthesis are calculated by process simulation in Aspen Plus®. The production of bio-methane and bio-char amounts to 15.5. MW and 3.7. MW, when the total inputs are 23. MW raw biomass and 1.39. MW electricity respectively (HHV basis). The results indicate an overall efficiency of 84% including high-temperature heat and the biomass to bio-methane yield amounts to 83% after allocation of the biomass input to the final products (HHV basis). The overall energy efficiency is higher for the suggested plant than for the gasification production route and is therefore a competitive route for bio-methane production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An experimental study was conducted on a Euro IV diesel engine to evaluate the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of pure biodiesel and its blend fuels. For each tested fuel, the performance and emissions were measured at four different engine speeds (800. rpm, 1200. rpm, 2400. rpm and 3600. rpm) under three different loads (25%, 50% and 100% load). The results showed that the use of biodiesel/blend fuels resulted in a higher brake specific fuel consumption, especially at low engine speed and partial load conditions. For example, at 25% engine load, the BSFC was found to be increased by 42% and 34.4% for biodiesel as compared to diesel at 800. rpm and 1200. rpm respectively. The brake thermal efficiency of biodiesel was found to be slightly higher compared to diesel at 50% and 100% load and the opposite tread was observed at 25% load. For combustion characteristics, a slightly shorter ignition delay and lower peak heat release rate were found for biodiesel compared to pure diesel. With respect to emissions, a slight reduction in the major emissions such as HC and NO. x were observed with the use of biodiesel. But the opposite trend was seen at low engine speed, revealing that the low engine speed had a significant effect on the engine combustion and emission formation processes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As a carbon neutral biofuel, the cold pressed Croton megalocarpus oil (CMO) has the nature of easy production without any further chemical process, but suffers for its high viscosity and poor atomisation if being applied on the compression-ignition (CI) engine generator. A micro distributed energy system comprised of a modified 6.5. kWe CI engine generator and an engine exhaust driven diffusion absorption refrigerator has been set up for domestic application, which applies both diesel and CMO. To minimise the negative impact of fuel properties of CMO, the temperature before injection has been elevated with the trace heater and the waste heat from the engine. The performance of the preheated CMO up to 90. °C on the engine generator system reflects an improvement of the atomisation and combustion in the cylinder compared to the non-preheated CMO. The particulate emission test reveals the similarity of both the total number and the total weigh of the particulates emitted from the engine generator system running on diesel and CMO in 90. °C. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been used widely to estimate the environmental implications of deploying algae-to-energy systems even though no full-scale facilities have yet to be built. Here, data from a pilot-scale facility using hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is used to estimate the life cycle profiles at full scale. Three scenarios (lab-, pilot-, and full-scale) were defined to understand how development in the industry could impact its life cycle burdens. HTL-derived algae fuels were found to have lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than petroleum fuels. Algae-derived gasoline had significantly lower GHG emissions than corn ethanol. Most algae-based fuels have an energy return on investment between 1 and 3, which is lower than petroleum biofuels. Sensitivity analyses reveal several areas in which improvements by algae bioenergy companies (e.g., biocrude yields, nutrient recycle) and by supporting industries (e.g., CO2 supply chains) could reduce the burdens of the industry. © 2013.

AB  - The preparation of a variety of sulfonated carbons and their use in the esterification of oleic acid is reported. All sulfonated materials show some loss in activity associated with the leaching of active sites. Exhaustive leaching shows that a finite amount of activity is lost from the carbons in the form of colloids. Fully leached catalysts show no loss in activity upon recycling. The best catalysts; 1, 3, and 6; show initial TOFs of 0.07s-1, 0.05s-1, and 0.14s-1, respectively. These compare favorably with literature values. Significantly, the leachate solutions obtained from catalysts 1, 3, and 6, also show excellent esterification activity. The results of TEM and catalyst poisoning experiments on the leachate solutions associate the catalytic activity of these solutions with carbon colloids. This mechanism for leaching active sites from sulfonated carbons is previously unrecognized. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The green microalga Scenedesmus acutus was cultivated in two different municipal wastewater discharges (pre- and post-treated), and was compared to a culture medium with basic nutrients (20% of N, P, K), in order to study the simultaneous potential of nutrient removal and lipid accumulation ability. The highest level of nutrient removal was found in the pretreated wastewater discharge (achieving a high removal of phosphorus [66%] and organic nitrogen [94%]). Likewise, better results on biomass productivity and lipid accumulation were found in cultures using pretreated wastewater compared to enriched medium, obtaining 79.9. mg/L, and 280. mg/L, respectively. Since the best results were found in pretreated wastewater, the biodiesel preparation was performed using said medium at small-scale. After cultivation, 249.4. mg/L of biodiesel were obtained. According to this analysis, S. acutus could be used for wastewater treatment producing biomass with a suitable content of lipids, convenient for biodiesel production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The inclusion complex of Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 with bridged bis-cyclodextrin (CsPW/B) is prepared as a highly efficient catalyst for the direct production of biodiesel via the transesterification of waste cooking oil. CsPW/B is characterized by X-ray diffraction, and the biodiesel is analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer. The conversion rate of waste cooking oil is up to 94.2% under the optimum experimental conditions that are methanol/oil molar ratio of 9:1, catalyst dosage of 3wt%, temperature of 65°C and reaction time of 180min. The physical properties of biodiesel sample satisfy the requirement of ASTM D6751 standards. The novel CsPW/B catalyst used for the transesterification can lead to 96.9% fatty acid methyl esters and 86.5% of the biodiesel product can serve as the ideal substitute for diesel fuel, indicating its excellent potential application in biodiesel production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Understanding changes in microbial structure due to biodiesel storage is important both for protecting integrity of storage systems and fuel quality management. In this work a simulated storage system was used to study the effect of biodiesel (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) on a microbial population, which was followed by community level physiological profiling (CLPP), 16s rDNA analysis and plating in selective media. Results proved that structure and functionality were affected by biodiesel. CLPP showed at least three populations: one corresponding to diesel, one to biodiesel and one to blends of diesel and biodiesel. Analysis of 16s rDNA revealed that microbial composition was different for populations growing in diesel and biodiesel. Genera identified are known for degradation of hydrocarbons and emulsifier production. Maximum growth was obtained in biodiesel; however, microbial counts in standard media were lower for this samples. Acidification of culture media was observed at high biodiesel concentration. © 2013.

AB  - Biodiesel production using microalgae is attractive in a number of respects. Here a number of pros and cons to using microalgae for biofuels production are reviewed. Algal cultivation can be carried out using non-arable land and non-potable water with simple nutrient supply. In addition, algal biomass productivities are much higher than those of vascular plants and the extractable content of lipids that can be usefully converted to biodiesel, triacylglycerols (TAGs) can be much higher than that of the oil seeds now used for first generation biodiesel. On the other hand, practical, cost-effective production of biofuels from microalgae requires that a number of obstacles be overcome. These include the development of low-cost, effective growth systems, efficient and energy saving harvesting techniques, and methods for oil extraction and conversion that are environmentally benign and cost-effective. Promising recent advances in these areas are highlighted. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - High butanol accumulation is due to feedback inhibition which leads to the low butanol productivity observed in acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation. The aim of this study is to use biodiesel as an extractant for the in situ removal of butanol from the broth. The results indicate that adding biodiesel as an extractant at the beginning of fermentation significantly enhances butanol production. No significant toxicity of biodiesel on the growth of Clostridium acetobutylicum is observed. In the fed-batch operation with glucose feeding, the maximum total butanol obtained is 31.44. g/L, as compared to the control batch (without the addition of biodiesel) at 9.85. g/L. Moreover, the productivity obtained is 0.295. g/L. h in the fed-batch, which is higher than that of 0.185. g/L. h for the control batch. The in situ butanol removal by the addition of biodiesel has great potential for commercial ABE production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Green and efficient production of biodiesel (FAME) from waste grease containing high amount of free fatty acid (FFA) was achieved by using novel magnetic nanobiocatalyst aggregates (MNA). Thermomyces lanuginosus Lipase (TLL) and Candida antartica Lipase B (CALB) were covalently immobilized on core-shell structured iron oxide magnetic nanoparticle (80. nm), respectively, followed by freeze-dry to give MNA (13-17. μm) with high yield (80-89%) and high enzyme loading (61. mg TLL or 22. mg CALB per gram MNA). MNA TL showed the best performance among immobilized enzymes known thus for the production of FAME from grease (17. wt.% FFA) with methanol, giving 99% yield in 12. h (3.3. wt.% catalyst). MNA TL was easily separated under magnetic field and reused, retaining 88% productivity in 11th cycle. MNA CA converted >97% FFA in grease (17. wt.% FFA) to FAME in 12. h (0.45. wt.% catalyst), being useful in two-step transformation of grease to biodiesel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To understand the potential of cellulosic based municipal waste as a renewable feed-stock, application of pyrolysis by biorefinery approach was comprehensively studied for its practicable application towards technical and environmental viability in Indian context. In India, where the energy requirements are high, the pyrolysis of the cellulosic waste shows numerous advantages for its applicability as a potential waste-to-energy technology. The multiple energy outputs of the process viz., bio-gas, bio-oil and bio-char can serve the two major energy sectors, viz., electricity and transportation. The process suits best for high bio-gas and electrical energy production when energy input is satisfied from bio-char in form of steam (scheme-1). The bio-gas generated through the process shows its direct utility as a transportation fuel while the bio-oil produced can serve as fuel or raw material to chemical synthesis. On a commercial scale the process is a potent technology towards sustainable development. The process is self-sustained when operated on a continuous mode. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Deoxy-liquefaction of cotton seed in husk was carried out to produce hydrocarbon oil at different temperatures (400-500°C). Results indicated that at 450°C, the obtained oil had a maximum alkanes value of 49.58% with a low oxygen content (1.4%) resulting in the increase of HHV (43.8MJkg-1), whereas the oil contained considerable nitrogenous compounds. In the presence of γ-Al2O3-CuO catalyst, at 450°C nitrogen content in the oil dropped 20%, exhibiting the activity of catalysis for denitrification, when the content of alkanes rose to 54.91%; by vacuum distillation, the oil was then separated into light/heavy fractions which showed that they both possessed rich carbon and hydrogen with low oxygen contents. The light fractions were much the same as that of gasoline, while the heavy fractions were close to diesel, which laid the foundation of further treatment and applications. © 2013 .

AB  - We developed a method for the highly efficient lipid extraction and lipase-catalyzed transesterification of triglyceride from Chlorella sp. KR-1 using dimethyl carbonate (DMC). Almost all of the total lipids, approximately 38.9% (w/w) of microalgae dry weight, were extracted from the dried microalgae biomass using a DMC and methanol mixture (7:3 (v/v)). The extracted triglycerides were transesterified into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) using Novozyme 435 as the biocatalyst in DMC. Herein, DMC was used as the reaction medium and acyl acceptor. The reaction conditions were optimized and the FAMEs yield was 293.82. mg FAMEs/g biomass in 6. h of reaction time at 60. °C in the presence of 0.2% (v/v) water. Novozyme 435 was reused more than ten times while maintaining relative FAMEs conversion that was greater than 90% of the initial FAMEs conversion. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Four thermotolerant microalgae were isolated from tropical Taiwan and classified as members of Desmodesmus based on morphological and molecular studies. A platform was established to evaluate their biodiesel production-related traits, including thermotolerance, lipid productivity, lipid oxidative stability and auto-sedimentation. The findings demonstrated thermotolerance of all four species was at the same level, as all could live at 45. °C for 24. h and 50. °C for 8. h with mortality rates below 5% of cells. The lipid productivity of Desmodesmus sp. F2 reached 113. mg/L/d. Its saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids accounted for 75% of the FAMEs, and it required only 3.1. h to achieve 85% sedimentation. Comparing these traits to those of the other three Desmodesmus and microalgae in the literature, Desmodesmus sp. F2 is one of the best candidates for biodiesel production in tropical and subtropical areas. This platform effectively assessed traits of microalgae related to biodiesel production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this experimental work, the influence of some bio-fuels on the spark-ignition engine combustion efficiency and engine-out emissions was investigated. A conventional 1.6. l port injection engine was tested over steady-states, with some bio-ethanol/gasoline blends (0, 10, 20, 30, and 85. vol% of ethanol in gasoline) and with a 10. vol% of n-butanol in gasoline. Study of combustion development was made through the heat release analysis of pressure cycles measured in combustion chamber. Regulated emissions, unregulated organics (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, carbonyl compounds and Volatile Organic Compounds) and particulate were measured. Particulate was characterized in terms of total particle number (PN) and size distribution between 7. nm up to 10. μm. The tests were carried out at stoichiometric conditions in closed loop and spark advance was optimized with a calibration tool software in order to have the same peak pressure position. By fueling the alcohol blends, the engine-out particulate emissions are strongly reduced compared to gasoline. The PN reduction percentage ranges between 60% and 90%. The benefits also concern some gaseous unregulated species very harmful for humans, such as benzene and benzo(a)pyrene (reduction of almost 50% and 70% respectively). The highest oxygen content of alcohol blends, instead, provides an increasing of the total carbonylic emissions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A series of fatty acids in microalgae oil, such as stearic acid, palmitic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, arachidic acid and behenic acid, were selected as the raw materials to produce aviation fuel via hydrothermal decarboxylation over a multi-wall carbon nanotube supported Pt catalyst (Pt/MWCNTs). It was found that Pt/MWCNTs catalysts exhibited higher activity for the hydrothermal decarboxylation of stearic acid with a 97% selectivity toward heptadecane compared to Pt/C and Ru/C under the same conditions. And Pt/MWCNTs is also capable for the decarboxylation of different fatty acids in microalgae oil. The reaction conditions, such as Pt/MWCNTs loading amount, reaction temperature and time were optimized. The activation energy of stearic acid decarboxylation over Pt/MWCNTs was calculated (114. kJ/mol). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel fuel is gradually replacing petroleum-based diesel oil use. Despite the biodiesel being considered friendlier to the environment, little is known about its effects in aquatic organisms. In this work we evaluated whether biodiesel exposure can affect oxidative stress parameters and biotransformation enzymes in armored catfish (Pterygoplichthys anisitsi, Loricariidae), a South American endemic species. Thus, fish were exposed for 2 and 7d to 0.01mLL-1 and 0.1mLL-1 of pure diesel, pure biodiesel (B100) and blends of diesel with 5% (B5) and 20% (B20) biodiesel. Lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) levels and the activities of the enzymes glutathione S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase were measured in liver and gills. Also, DNA damage (8-oxo-7, 8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine) levels in gills and 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity in liver were assessed. Pure diesel, B5 and B20 blends changed most of the enzymes tested and in some cases, B5 and B20 induced a higher enzyme activity than pure diesel. Antioxidant system activation in P. anisitsi was effective to counteract reactive oxygen species effects, since DNA damage and lipid peroxidation levels were maintained at basal levels after all treatments. However, fish gills exposed to B20 and B100 presented increased lipid peroxidation. Despite biodiesel being more biodegradable fuel that emits less greenhouse gases, the increased lipid peroxidation showed that biofuel and its blends also represent hazards to aquatic biota. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Emission modelling permits us to quantitatively assess the effects of emission abatement strategies. In urban areas, such strategies are designed mainly to reduce the emissions from the on-road traffic sector. This work analyses the impact of several mobility strategies on urban emissions in the coastal city of Barcelona, Spain, when the High Elective Resolution Modelling Emission System (HERMES) is applied at a very high resolution (1 km × 1 km and 1 h). The analysis was conducted by projecting the emissions data obtained from a base case scenario in 2004 onto three future scenarios set in 2015, where each future scenario represented a set of traffic mobility management measures. Specific developments were considered per emission sector, including power generation, industrial activities, domestic-commercial, solvents, on-road traffic, biogenic emissions, ports and airports, to best compare the present base case scenario with the future mobility scenarios generated for 2015. These emission scenarios for 2015 take into account the population projections and the variations in port and airport activities among other factors, while the main focus is on the on-road traffic sector, the types of vehicles used, such as technologically improved buses and hybrid vehicles, as well as the types of fuels used, including natural gas and biofuels. The results of the emission model indicate that the mobility management strategies, the technological improvements and the use of alternative fuels reduce the emissions from on-road traffic by approximately 75% (in terms of nitrogen oxides emission reductions in the city centre of Barcelona). This decrease leads to a 35% reduction in overall nitrogen oxides emissions, even if some sectors individually experience increases based on their specific projections. © Author(s) 2012.

AB  - Neem biodiesel is currently being explored as a future biofuel and was extracted chemically from the vegetable oil. Many of its properties are still under investigation and our aim was to study its noxious-gas emission profiles from blends with regular petroleum diesel. The distinct advantage of a real-time study is acquisition of in situ data on the combustion behavior of gas components with actual progression of time. Mixtures of neem biodiesel and petroleum diesel corresponding to neem additives of 5%, 10%, 15% and 25% were tested for combustion efficiency and emitted gases using a high-performance gas analyzer. Our study, therefore, investigated the overall efficiency of the combustion process linked to emissions of the following gases: O2, CO2, NO, NOx and SO2. The results for the 95/5% blend compared to the neat sample were most promising and showed no serious change in performance efficiency (&lt;2%). NO/NOx emission trends displayed maxima/minima, suggestive of interconvertible chemical reactivity. Declining CO and SO2 emissions were consistent with rapid chemical conversion. The CO and SO2 concentrations fell well below the toxic atmospheric limits in less than 300 s. The results are generally encouraging for blends below 10%. The potential environmental impact of the study is discussed. ©2013 by the authors.

AB  - In outdoor cultivation, screening strains adapted to a wide temperature range or suitable strains for different environmental temperatures is of great importance. In this study, triacylglycerol (TAG) content of 23 oil-producing Chlorella strains from different climate zones were analyzed by thin layer chromatography. Four selected Chlorella strains (NJ-18, NJ-7, NMX35N and NMX139N) with rather high TAG content had higher total lipid content compared with Chlorella vulgaris SAG 211-11b. In particular, NJ-18 displayed the highest TAG productivity among the four high oil-producing Chlorella strains. Accumulation of TAGs in strain NMX35N changed a little from 30 to 40. °C, showing a desirable characteristic of accumulating TAGs at high temperatures. Our results demonstrated that NJ-18 and NMX35N had suitable fatty acid profiles and good adaption to low and high temperatures respectively. Therefore, cultivation of the two Chlorella strains together might be a good option for economic biodiesel production during the whole seasons of the year. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The oil palm presents a comparatively advantageous source of feedstock for biofuels production compared to other first-generation biofuel feedstocks. Among the sources of feedstocks for biofuel production currently available and developed in the world, the oil palm is the prime option which fulfills the sustainability criteria for high productivity, efficiency, competitive price discounts, and above all it is cost effective. Biofuels produced from oil palm biomass would be considered sustainable only when all the production chains from oil palm cultivation to biofuels production (including the production of input materials and energy) are within the acceptable production criteria for sustainable oil palm and biofuels developments. In order for the oil palm industry to fully accomplish the objectives of sustainable oil palm biofuels production, Malaysia and Indonesia are currently ensuring the implementation of stringent sustainability standards via best management practices especially for the production of palm biofuels so as to improve yield and reduce the amount of input resources. This chapter highlights on some best management practices involving globally accepted initiatives for sustainable oil palm agriculture, palm oil milling, and refining as well as different production routes to palm biofuels production. Integration of different production routes for various types of palm biofuels through effective utilization of wastes for sustainable development are also elaborated in this chapter. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2013.

AB  - In spite of the benefits associated with the production and consumption of biofuels, there are some crucial debatable issues like high cost, food insecurity, etc., that put them to the negative side. However, biofuels still hold impressive market potentials in the world today though most of their production technologies are sophisticated and costly. Liquid biofuels like bioethanol and biodiesel are commonly produced from feedstocks like corn, rapeseed, soybean, etc., but there are other potential feedstocks, which are more sustainable like palm oil. This chapter discusses the major sources of biofuel feedstocks, types of biofuels, their production technologies, and global market potentials. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2013.

AB  - Algae biodiesel is a promising but expensive alternative fuel to petro-diesel. To overcome cost barriers, detailed cost analyses are needed. A decade-old cost analysis by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory indicated that the costs of algae biodiesel were in the range of $0.53-0.85/L (2012 USD values). However, the cost of land and transesterification were just roughly estimated. In this study, an updated comprehensive techno-economic analysis was conducted with optimized processes and improved cost estimations. Latest process improvement, quotes from vendors, government databases, and other relevant data sources were used to calculate the updated algal biodiesel costs, and the final costs of biodiesel are in the range of $0.42-0.97/L. Additional improvements on cost-effective biodiesel production around the globe to cultivate algae was also recommended. Overall, the calculated costs seem promising, suggesting that a single step biodiesel production process is close to commercial reality. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The production of palm biofuels provides the prospects for new economic opportunities for most people in rural communities in developing countries. Oil palm cultivation and palm oil milling provide wide avenues for people in terms of job creation, investment opportunities, etc. In spite of all the benefits of palm biofuels, they are also found to cause negative socio-economic impacts to the society. The economic impacts of oil palm and palm biofuels production are elaborated in this chapter. Oil palm biomass is a cheap source of feedstock for palm biofuels compared to other feedstocks used for biofuel production. In this chapter, biodiesel production from palm oil and palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) are found to be economically viable compared to fossil diesel and biodiesel from other oils. Bioethanol and biomethanol production from oil palm biomass are also found to be cost competitive compared to gasoline and other cellulosic ethanol. Other potential types of palm biofuels are assessed for economic sustainability and improvement options are also suggested in this chapter. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2013.

AB  - In reality, all production processes proceed with the generation of entropy and destruction of useful energy of resource inputs. In view of this, the second law of thermodynamics can be directly linked with sustainability and sustainable development. Estimation of a system's exergy status in order to know the distribution of energy and matter, especially emissions, would help identify the efficiency of the system, hence improving it for sustainable development. In this chapter, the thermodynamic sustainability of biodiesel, bioethanol, biogas, and briquettes production from oil palm biomass are investigated via exergy analysis. Most studies on exergy analysis of biofuels production systems do not consider the production of the feedstocks though these stages are materials and energy intensive. The production of oil palm biomass for palm biofuels is assessed for thermodynamic feasibility in this study in order to give a complete overview of the contributions of every single unit within the palm biofuels production systems. Aspen Plus software was used for the mathematical modeling for all the case studies considered in this chapter. Potential causes and improvement options are also discussed in this chapter for sustainable palm biofuels production. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2013.

AB  - The refinement of biodiesel or renewable diesel from bacterial lipids has a great potential to make a contribution for energy production in the future. This study provides new data concerning suitable nutrient concentrations for cultivation of the Gram-positive Rhodococcus opacus PD630, which is able to accumulate large amounts of lipids during nitrogen limitation. Enhanced concentrations of magnesium have been shown to increase the final optical density and the lipid content of the cells. Elevated phosphate concentrations slowed down the onset of the accumulation phase, without a clear effect on the final optical density and the cell's lipid content. A robust growth of R. opacus was possible in the presence of ammonium concentrations of up to 1.4 g l-1 and sucrose concentrations of up to 240 g l-1, with an optimum regarding growth and lipid storage observed in the range of 0.2 to 0.4 g l-1 ammonium and 20 to 40 g l-1 sucrose, respectively. Moreover, R. opacus showed tolerance to high salt concentrations. © 2013 Janßen et al.

AB  - Five non-toxin producing cyanobacterial isolates from the genera Synechococcus, Trichormus, Microcystis, Leptolyngbya and Chlorogloea were examined in terms of quantity and quality as lipid feedstock for biofuel production. Under the conditions used in this study, the biomass productivity ranged from 3.7 to 52.7 mg·L-1·day-1 in relation to dry biomass, while the lipid productivity varied between 0.8 and 14.2 mg·L-1·day-1. All cyanobacterial strains evaluated yielded lipids with similar fatty acid composition to those present in the seed oils successfully used for biodiesel synthesis. However, by combining biomass and lipid productivity parameters, the greatest potential was found for Synechococcus sp. PCC7942, M. aeruginosa NPCD-1 and Trichormus sp. CENA77. The chosen lipid samples were further characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), viscosity and thermogravimetry and used as lipid feedstock for biodiesel synthesis by heterogeneous catalysis. © 1996-2013 MDPI AG.

AB  - The absence of a globally-consistent and binding commitment to reducing greenhouse emissions provides a rationale for partial policies, such as renewable energy mandates, product emission standards, etc to target lifecycle emissions of the regulated products or services. While appealing in principle, regulation of lifecycle emissions presents several practical challenges. Using biofuels as an illustrative example, we highlight some outstanding issues in the design and implementation of life cycle-based policies and discuss potential remedies. We review the literature on emissions due to price effects in fuel markets, which are akin to emissions due to indirect land use change, but are, unlike the latter, ignored under all current life cycle emissions-based regulations. We distinguish the current approaches to regulating indirect emissions into hard and soft approaches and discuss their implications. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Herein we report the fast pyrolysis of dried, ground Scenedesmus sp. at two different reactor scales. Pyrolysis was performed at 480°C and 1 bar in both an isothermal spouted bed reactor and a dynamic pyrolysis-GC/MS unit, each with 2s vapor residence times. Bio-oil products were characterized on the basis of GC-MS, simulated distillation GC, elemental analysis, calorific content and total acid number. The ratio of crude oil: char obtained from the spouted bed reactor was 3.76 by weight, the average calorific content of the oil being 18.4MJ/kg. The average total acid number (68mg KOH/g) was lower than typical bio-oil produced via wood pyrolysis. Simulated distillation results indicated that a significant proportion of the oil corresponded to the boiling range typical for heavy gas oil (343°C-524°C). Elemental analysis showed the oil contained an average of 27.6wt.% oxygen and 8.6wt.% nitrogen, the relatively high nitrogen content being a consequence of the high protein content of the algae. According to GC-MS data, the oil consisted of various hydrocarbons as well as oxygenated and nitrogenous species, including indoles, fatty acids and amides. Pyrolysis-GC-MS was also performed on Scenedesmus sp. in order to provide insights into the nature of the primary pyrolysis products. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalga Chlorella protothecoides can accumulate high proportion of lipids during the heterotrophic growth with glucose as the carbon source. However, its commercial application is restricted due to the high cost of the carbon source. In this study, the wasted activated sludge (WAS) was hydrolyzed after ultrasonic pre-treatment and the hydrolyzate obtained was used as an alternative carbon source for algal biomass and biodiesel production. The results indicate that C. protothecoides can proliferate in the WAS hydrolyzate and accumulate biolipid. The final lipid content of the culture fed with the hydrolyzate was 21.5±1.44% (weight percent) after 156h cultivation in flasks and the maximum biomass obtained was 0.5gL-1. Acetic acid and isovaleric acid were favorable carbon sources for cell growth. The soluble microbial products (SMP) presents in the hydrolyzate can also be used as a carbon source for cell growth. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Access to affordable and renewable sources of energy is crucial to reducing poverty and enhancing rural development in countries of the global South. Straight vegetable oil was recently identified as a possible alternative to conventional biomass for rural energy supply. In this context, the Jatropha curcas Linn. species has been extensively investigated with regard to its potential as a biofuel feedstock. In contrast, only little is known about Jatropha mahafalensis Jum. & H. Perrier, which is an indigenous and endemic representative of the Jatropha genus in Madagascar. This paper explores the potential and suitability of J. mahafalensis as a biofuel feedstock. Seed samples were collected in the area of Soalara in south-western Madagascar in February and September 2011. Two agro-ecological zones (coastal area and calcareous plateau) and two plant age groups (below and above 10. years) were considered. These four sample groups were analyzed with regard to oil properties, element contents, and fatty acid profiles. Measured values differed greatly between the two harvests, probably owing to different climatic or storage conditions. No direct relation between age of trees or location and oil quality could be established. The analyses indicate that J. mahafalensis oil can be used in oil lamps, cooking stoves and stationary combustion engines for electrification or for biodiesel production. However, modifications in storage and extraction methods, as well as further processing steps are necessary to enable its utilization as a straight vegetable oil and feedstock for biodiesel production. If these technical requirements can be met, and if it turns out that J. mahafalensis oil is economically competitive in comparison with firewood, charcoal, paraffin and petroleum, it can be considered as a promising feedstock for rural energy supply. © 2013 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - During short term engine operation, renewable fuels derived from vegetable oils, are capable of providing good engine performance. In more extended operations, some of the same fuels can cause degradation of engine performance, excessive carbon and lacquer deposits and actual damage to the engine. Moreover, temperatures in the area of the injector tip due to advanced diesel injection systems may lead to particularly stubborn deposits at and around the injector tip. In this research, an endurance test was carried out for 250. h on 2 fuel samples; DF (diesel fuel) as baseline and PB20 (20% palm biodiesel and 80% DF) in a single cylinder CI engine. The effects of DF and PB20 on injector nozzle deposits, engine lubricating oil, and fuel economy and exhaust emissions were investigated. According to the results of the investigation, visual inspection showed some deposit accumulation on injectors during running on both fuels. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis showed greater carbon deposits on and around the injector tip for PB20 compared to the engine running with DF. Similarly, lubricating oil analysis presented excessive wear metal concentrations, decreased viscosity and increased density values when the engine was fuelled with PB20. Finally, fuel economy and emission results during the endurance test showed higher brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) and NO. x emissions, and lower HC and CO emissions, for the PB20 blend compared to DF. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this article, the effects of thermal barrier coated combustion chamber on the single cylinder direct injection diesel engine with dual biodiesel (combination of pongamia pinnata oil and neem oil) are experimentally investigated. The piston surface and cylinder head of the diesel engine are coated with Aluminium Titanate. The two biodiesels are mixed with diesel in various proportions and their performances are examined by using both base engine and low heat rejection engine. Specific fuel consumption of coated engine (CE) with diesel - pongamia pinnata - neem 1 (DPN 1) fuel (mixture of diesel 75%, pongamia pinnata oil ethyl esters 22.5%, and neem oil ethyl esters 2.5% by volume) is 13.9% lower than the baseline engine. The brake thermal efficiency of DPN 1 CE is 11.9% higher than baseline engine. Smoke opacity and hydrocarbon emission from CE are lower than the baseline engine. The DPN 1 CE emits 16.6% lower smoke than the diesel fuel in baseline engine. However, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide emission are increased in the CE. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Twenty four accessions of Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) were planted on a degraded sodic land in Lucknow, India, in which growth and yield traits were measured over five years (2006-2010). There was a large variation in growth and yield among these accessions, and the average seed yield (118 g plant -1) and oil content (30%) of JCL on the sodic land were sufficiently low to make it an economically feasible venture for biofuel production. The seed:fruit, kernel:seed ratios and the 100 seed test weight were also measured. In order to make it an economically viable proposition, some preliminary screening were done to assort the superior accessions (CSMCRI-C1, NBPGR-Urlikanchan, NBPGR-Chhatrapati, and NBPGR-Hansraj), on the basis of growth and yield traits, that have attained an average height of 264.6-344.6 cm, with an 8.5- to 10-cm collar diameter, 41-57 branches per plant, a 209- to 290-cm canopy spread, a 178-246 g plant-1 seed yield, and a 27-38% oil content at five years. Though they do not correlate well between growth/yield and gas exchange parameters (photosynthetic rate, transpiration, stomatal conductance, and water use efficiency), even then these markers are useful to screen out a large number of accessions at an early stage before the yield starts or stabilizes to increase the land use efficiency. The changes in soil properties after five years of the plantations showed reduction in soil pH and electrical conductivity, with a parallel increase in organic carbon, organic nitrogen, microbial biomass, and dehydrogenase activity, indicating that JCL had a modest ability to reclaim the sodic soils. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A microbial fuel cell coupled constructed wetland (planted with Ipomoea aquatica) system (planted CW-MFC) was used for azo dye decolorization. Electricity was simultaneously produced during the co-metabolism process of glucose and azo dye. A non-planted and an open-circuit system were established as reference to study the roles of plants and electrodes in azo dye decolorization and electricity production processes, respectively. The results indicated that plants grown in cathode enhanced the cathode potential and slightly promoted dye decolorization efficiency. The electrodes promoted the dye decolorization efficiency in the anode. The planted CW-MFC system achieved the highest decolorization rate of about 91.24% and a voltage output of about 610. mV. The connection of external circuit promoted the growth of electrogenic bacteria Geobacter sulfurreducens and Beta Proteobacteria, and inhibited the growth of Archaea in anode. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The water-tolerant and microwave absorbing solid acid catalyst - heteropolyacids supported on activated carbon (H3PW 12O40•xH2O /C) - was developed and used in the synthesis of biodiesel with low-quality tung oil that contained water (0.1-1.5 wt.%) or free fatty acid (FFA; 2.6-30.0 wt.%). Microwave radiation was adopted to enhance the transesterification. The response surface methodology (RSM) was used to design the synthesis experiments and optimize the operation conditions. Research results showed that the solid acid catalyst H 3PW12O40•xH2O /C (HPW/C) exhibited a better water-tolerance performance and catalytic activity than other catalysts such as HPW and HPW/γ-Al2O3, and a higher yield of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) could be obtained under microwave radiation than the conventional heating. The FAME yield of 67.2% could be obtained under the optimal conditions of temperature of 343 K, the methanol to oil molar ratio of 36, and catalyst to oil mass ratio of 11.5 wt.% when the tung oil contained 0.7 wt.% water and 2.6 wt.% FFA. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Results indicated that the hydrolysis process reduced the inhibition by water in FAME production; in addition, FAME obtained by esterification of hydrolysates was increased by 181.7% compared to FAME obtained by direct transesterification under the same amount of water content (80%). This method has great potential in terms of biodiesel production from microalgae since it uses no organic solvent, reduces the drying cost and lowers the operating cost compared to any other traditional method. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study provides a systematic approach to understand the water tolerance of a newly developed non-catalytic biodiesel conversion process. The influence of water on the non-catalytic biodiesel conversion process was compared directly with the conventional transesterification reaction, which uses homogenous catalysts, such as KOH and H2SO4. This study demonstrated that water had no significant impact on non-catalytic biodiesel conversion and the conversion efficiency reached approximately ~98±0.5% at a water content of 5wt.% in the biodiesel lipid feedstock (i.e., corn oil). However, this work showed that the non-catalytic biodiesel conversion using porous hydrophobic materials (i.e., charcoal) exhibited better biodiesel conversion performance compared to non-catalytic biodiesel conversion in the presence of activated alumina. This can be explained by the mechanism of the reaction between gas-phase MeOH and liquid-phase triglycerides. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The paper provides an assessment of first generation biofuel (ethanol and biodiesel) development in Thailand in terms of feedstock used, production trends, planned targets and policies and discusses the biofuel sustainability issues-environmental, socio-economic and food security aspects. The policies, measures and incentives for the development of biofuel include targets, blending mandates and favorable tax schemes to encourage production and consumption of biofuels. Biofuel development improves energy security, rural income and reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but issues related to land and water use and food security are important considerations to be addressed for its large scale application. Second generation biofuels derived from agricultural residues perform favorably on environmental and social sustainability issues in comparison to first generation biofuel sources. The authors estimate that sustainably-derived agricultural crop residues alone could amount to 10.4 × 106 bone dry tonnes per year. This has the technical potential of producing 1.14-3.12 billion liters per year of ethanol to possibly displace between 25%-69% of Thailand's 2011 gasoline consumption as transportation fuel. Alternatively, the same amount of residue could provide 0.8-2.1 billion liters per year of diesel (biomass to Fischer-Tropsch diesel) to potentially offset 6%-15% of national diesel consumption in the transportation sector. © 2013 by the authors.

AB  - The potential of microalgae as a source of renewable energy based on wastewater has received increasing interest worldwide in recent decades. A freshwater microalga Chlorello sp. was investigated for its ability to remove both nitrogen and phosphorus from influent and effluent wastewaters which were diluted in four different proportions (namely, 100%, 75%, 50% and 25%). Chlorello sp. grew fastest under 50% influent and effluent wastewaters culture conditions, and showed an maximum cell density (4.25x109 ind l1 for influent wastewater and 3.54x109 ind l-1 for effluent wastewater), indicating the levels of nitrogen and phosphorus greatly influenced algal growth. High removal efficiency for total nitrogen (17.04-58.85%) and total phosphorus (62.4397.08%) was achieved. Further, more than 83% NH4-N in 75%, 50%, 25% influent wastewater, 88% NOx-N in effluent wastewater and 90% PO4-P in all treatments were eliminated after 24 days of incubation. Chlorello sp. grew well when PO4-P concentration was very low, indicating that this might be not the limiting factor to algal growth. Our results suggest the potential importance of integrating nutrient removal from wastewater by microalgae cultivation as biofuel production feedstock. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).

AB  - The isolation of lipid-rich autochthonous strains of microalgae is a crucial stage for the development of a microalgae-based biofuel production plant, as these microalgae already have the necessary adaptations to withstand competition, predation and the temperatures observed at each production site. This is particularly important in extreme climates such as in Saudi Arabia. Resorting to fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) we screened for and isolated several microalgal strains from samples collected from the Red Sea. Relying on the fluorescence of BODIPY 505/515 (4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7- tetramethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diazasindacene) and growth performance, four promising candidates were identified and the total lipid content and fatty acid profile was assessed for biofuels production. Selected isolates were classified as chlorophytes, belonging to three different genera: Picochlorum, Nannochloris and Desmochloris. The lipid contents were assessed microscopically by means of BODIPY 505/515-associated fluorescence to detect intracellular lipid bodies, which revealed several lipid drops in all selected strains. This result was confirmed by lipid gravimetric determination, which demonstrated that all strains under study presented inner cell lipid contents ranging from 20% to 25% of the biomass dry weight. Furthermore, the fatty acid methyl esters profile of all strains seems ideal for biodiesel production due to a low degree of polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters and high amount of palmitic and oleic acids. © 2013 by the authors.

AB  - Physic nut {Jatropha curcos) is an important commercial bio-diesel |plant species and is being advocated for development of waste and dry land. The collar and root rot caused by Lasiodiplodia theobromae is an important soil borne disease which causes considerable yield loss in this crop. In this study, the effects of culture media, temperature, photoperiod, carbon and nitrogen sources and pH on mycelial growth and pycnidial production were evaluated. Among the growth media tested, potato dextrose agar supported the highest growth followed by potato sucrose agar and corn meal agar. Among several carbon sources tested, carboxy methyl cellulose and sucrose were found superior for growth and pycnidial production. The nitrogen sources viz., ammonium oxalate and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate were recorded maximum mycelial growth and pycnidial production. The fungus grows at pH 5.0-9.0 and optimum growth was observed at pH 7.0. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).

AB  - In this investigation ozonolysis in the presence of ethanol was used to depolymerise lignin, resulting in a low conversion of oxygenated aromatics over short reaction times, or a range of saturated esters over 24. h. Short chain oxygenates can be used as fuel additives, displacing a percentage of a hydrocarbon fuel while leading to improvement in some of the fuel properties. The utility of the resulting bio-oils was therefore assessed by blending with a range of fuels. Guaiacol, a potential antioxidant, was formed over short reaction times and was found to be completely miscible with low-sulphur petrol (ULSP), diesel, aviation kerosene and rapeseed methyl ester. The mainly aliphatic proportion of the bio-oil produced over 24. h could be blended with the fuels replacing a maximum of 12-17. wt.% of the hydrocarbon fuel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, the acclimation of Chlorella pyrenoidosa in diluted wastewater was studied to produce biomass and remove chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia-N and phosphorous. The results indicated that the optimal conditions (the volume ratio of wastewater, light intensity, culture temperature, CO2 concentration in feeding gas) which could influence the wastewater treatment efficiency were 0.05, 250photonsm-2s-1, 28°C and 5%, respectively. Under these conditions, the removal efficiency of COD reached up to 89.2%, while the total nitrogen and total phosphorous decreased by 64.52% and 82.20%, respectively. With the second treatment, COD in the wastewater was further reduced to less than 100mg/L while it was only reduced to 542.9mg/L after the first treatment. The treated wastewater could be discharged directly or subjected to for further treatment for recycling. In addition, 1.25g/L of the biomass and 38.27% (dry basis, w%) of lipid content were reached after microalgal cultivation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Renewable Fuel Standard 2 (RFS2) program under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 set a life-cycle emission reduction threshold to only greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; this type of single-dimensional threshold could lead to the unintended trading of one environmental problem for another. Many of the environmental impacts resulting over the life cycle of oil-crop biodiesel fuels manifest in the agricultural phase of production in the form of water quality degradation. This study investigated the extent to which different biofuels meet the RFS GHG requirement, and presents alternative strategies for minimizing unintended consequences. In addition to life-cycle global warming potential (GWP), the eutrophication potential (EP) and photochemical smog formation potential (PSP) from microalgal diesel were compared to the impacts resulting from petroleum-based diesel, soybean diesel and canola diesel. The results showed tradeoffs between GWP and eutrophication potential when microalgal diesel was compared to soybean diesel. Future RFS criteria should include EP and PSP metrics, however establishing thresholds like the GHG management approach may not be appropriate for these other impacts. Two possible strategies to setting life-cycle eutrophication standards are to establish a threshold based on first generation biofuels, as opposed to petro-fuels or to set maximum levels of EP loads for major watersheds or coastal areas. To decrease PSP, together with existing standards for tailpipe emissions, future RFSs should include the well-to-pump emissions from biofuels and petroleum fuels accounting for temporal and spatial variations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Algae-based technologies could provide a key tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from industrial processes. Microalgae can produce biocompounds that are easily converted into biofuels, depending upon growing conditions. The idea of using microalgae as a source of fuel is now being taken seriously because of the escalating price of petroleum and the emerging concern about global warming that is associated with burning fossil fuels. Microalgae-derived agar to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural conversion paves the route for algal biomass to liquid fuel transformation. Ionic liquid played a major role in direct conversion of agar to liquid fuel-additive 5-ethoxymethyl-furfural. Acidic ionic liquids and solid acids would be major components of catalysts for algal biomass transformation to fuels.

The mixed-solution of crude Jatropha oil and methanol at a stoichiometric molar ratio was supplied to the process. The free fatty acid as well as triglyceride was completely converted to biodiesel. All by-products were adsorbed on the resin and the effluent from the process was free from them. The effluent fully met the international biodiesel standard specifications without any downstream purification processes except for removing methanol. The glycerin adsorbed on the resin was completely recovered as a transparent methanol solution during regeneration of the resin. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, emissions formation process and its interaction with the combustion event are established for fossil diesel and the methyl esters of coconut (CME), palm (PME) and soy (SME) across three different engine conditions. Here, the OpenFOAM® open source CFD codes are utilised to simulate the in-cylinder events. The ignition delay (ID) period and the timing of peak pressure are accurately predicted to within ±0.2° crank angle for all the test cases. The maximum error between the experimental and computed peak pressure values across the test range is limited to below 4.5%. The change in the fuel type from fossil diesel to biodiesel alters the physical and the chemical delays, both of which affect the overall ID period. As a result, variations in the combustion behaviour and hence the emission characteristics are observed. Neat CME is found to produce both NO. x and soot reduction across all the engine loads tested. The most significant reduction in soot level is achieved at high load operation, while greatest NO. x reduction is recorded under low load condition when neat or B50 blends of the test biodiesel fuels are used. The best operating condition to result in simultaneous soot and NO. x reduction through the use of biodiesel is at mid load condition with an engine speed of 2000. rev/min. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Three most frequently used methods for fat transesterification were compared using rendering plant fat (RPF) as model. Acid-catalysed transesterification was found to be the most effective (conversion 90%) at optimum conditions (fat: methanol ratio 1:10, sulphuric acid amount of 2% v/v, temperature 95°C). Base-catalysed transesterification of RPF on the other hand, results in much lower conversion (45%) at optimum conditions (fat: methanol ratio 1:20, NaOH amount 8% w/v, optimum temperature 95°C). The difference is done (among others) by the fact that RPF has high concentration of free acid (high acidity number) compared with the fats usually used for transesterification and that free acids are not esterified in alkaline media. Enzyme-(lipase) catalysed reaction could lead to partial esterification of free fatty acids, but with much lower reaction velocity. This fact leads to higher conversion in the case of enzyme-catalysed transesterification of RPF compared with base-catalysed reaction; nevertheless, even in this case the conversion is much lower in comparison with acid-catalysed reaction. The optimum conversion in enzyme-catalysed reaction was 55%.

AB  - Combustion and emissions characteristics of a compression ignition engine with a dual fuel (biodiesel-CNG) combustion system were investigated in this study. This experiment utilized a biodiesel pilot injection to ignite a main charge of compressed natural gas (CNG). The pilot injection pressure was maintained at approximately 120MPa while the pilot injection timing was varied across the range 11-23 crank angle degrees (CAD) before top-dead-center (BTDC) to investigate the characteristics of engine performance and exhaust emissions in a single cylinder diesel engine. Results show that performance can be optimized for biodiesel-CNG dual fuel combustion (DFC) by advancing the pilot injection timing for low loads and delaying the injection timing for high loads. However, overall performance of diesel single fuel combustion (SFC) still exceeds that of biodiesel-CNG DFC. Slight cycle-to-cycle variations are observed when dual fuel is used, but remains less than 1.3% at all conditions. The combustion of biodiesel-CNG begins at a later CAD compared to that of diesel SFC due to the increase of ignition delay of the pilot fuel. The ignition delay in DFC is 1.6-4.4 CAD longer than that of the diesel SFC. Ignition delays are reduced with the increased engine load. BSEC of biodiesel-CNG DFC improves with advanced pilot injection timing at low load and with delayed pilot injection timing at full load. Smoke is decreased and NOx is increased with advanced pilot injection timing in the biodiesel-CNG DFC. Compared to the diesel SFC, however, smoke emissions are significantly reduced over the range of operating conditions and NOx emissions are also reduced except for the full load condition. DFC yields lower CO2 emissions compared to diesel SFC over all engine conditions. Biodiesel-CNG DFC results in relative high CO and HC emissions at low load conditions due to the low combustion temperature of CNG but no notable trend of HC emissions with variations of pilot injection timing were discovered. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Density is a very important fuel property because it influences production, transportation, and distribution processes as well as all processes that take place in the internal combustion engine. Elaborating models to describe the density of biodiesel-diesel-bioethanol blends with a high content of biofuel facilitates the production of blends that comply with the standard quality requirements for density and the modeling and simulation of injection and combustion processes. For predicting density of rapeseed oil biodiesel-diesel-bioethanol and used cooking oil biodiesel-diesel-bioethanol blends, 2 x 15 ternary mixtures were prepared, having a maximum amount of biofuel of 30% v/v. The concentration of biodiesel and bioethanol varies between 5% and 25%, in increments of 5%. Their density values were determined in 15 steps in the temperature range of 273.15-343.15 K. Based on experimental density values of components and blends, common linear mixing rules were evaluated, obtaining an average relative deviation under 0.125% and a regression coefficient above 0.996. In order to improve accuracy, four new mixing rules with different complexities were elaborated. The temperature dependent density of components was modeled based on experimental density values and constituents composition by linear and polynomial regression, by free version of Rackett equation and by group contribution methods. The elaborated mixing rules were tested for various combinations of component densities, yielding a very good accuracy, with an average deviation of under 0.053%. Taking into account the complexity and accuracy of the elaborated models, recommendations were made regarding their uses according to their concrete applications. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Research into novel internal combustion engines requires consideration of the diversity in future fuels that may contain significant quantities of bio-components in an attempt to reduce CO2 emissions from vehicles and contribute to energy sustainability. However, most biofuels have different chemical and physical properties to those of typical hydrocarbons; these can lead to different mechanisms of mixture preparation and combustion. The current paper presents results from an optical study of combustion in a direct-injection spark-ignition research engine with gasoline, iso-octane, ethanol and butanol fuels injected from a centrally located multi-hole injector. Methane was also employed by injecting it into the inlet plenum of the engine to provide a benchmark case for well-mixed 'homogeneous' charge preparation. Crank-angle resolved flame chemiluminescence images were acquired and post-processed for a series of consecutive cycles for each fuel, in order to calculate in-cylinder rates of flame growth and motion. In-cylinder pressure traces were used for heat release analysis and for comparison with the image-processing results. All tests were performed at 1500 RPM with 0.5 bar intake plenum pressure. Stoichiometric (φ = 1.0) and lean (φ = 0.83) conditions were considered. The combustion characteristics were analysed with respect to laminar and turbulent burning velocities obtained from combustion bombs in the literature and from traditional combustion diagrams in order to bring all data into the context of current theories and allow insights by making comparisons were appropriate. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis liquid or bio-oil has been used in engines with limited success. It requires a pilot fuel and/or an additive for successful combustion and there are problems with materials and liquid properties. It is immiscible with all conventional hydrocarbon fuels. Biodiesel, a product of esterification of vegetable oil with an alcohol, is widely used as a renewable liquid fuel as an additive to diesel at up to 20%. There are however limits to its use in conventional engines due to poor low temperature performance and variability in quality from a variety of vegetable oil qualities and variety of esterification processes. Within the European Project Bioliquids-CHP - a joint project between the European Commission and Russia - a study was undertaken to develop small scale CHP units based on engines and microturbines fuelled with bioliquids from fast pyrolysis and methyl esters of vegetable oil. Blends of bio-oil and biodiesel were evaluated and tested to overcome some of the disadvantages of using either fuel by itself. An alcohol was used as the co-solvent in the form of ethanol, 1-butanol or 2-propanol. Visual inspection of the blend homogeneity after 48 h was used as an indicator of the product stability and the results were plotted in a three phase chart for each alcohol used. An accelerated stability test was performed on selected samples in order to predict its long term stability. We concluded that the type and quantity of alcohol is critical for the blend formation and stability. Using 1-butanol gave the widest selection of stable blends, followed by blends with 2-propanol and finally ethanol, thus 1-butanol blends accepted the largest proportion of bio-oil in the mixture. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The presented work focuses on numerical and experimental analyses of biodiesel fuel's influence on the injection characteristics of a mechanically-controlled injection system, and on the operating conditions of a heavy-duty diesel engine. Addressed are mineral diesel fuel and neat biodiesel fuel made from rapeseed oil. The influence of biodiesel on mechanically controlled injection system characteristics was tested experimentally on an injection system test-bed. The injection test-bed was equipped with a glass injection chamber in order to observe the development of the fuel-spray by using a high-speed camera. The results of the experimental measurements were compared to the numerical results obtained by using our own mathematical simulation program. This program has been used to analyze the influences of different fuel properties on the injection system's characteristics. The photos taken with a high-speed camera were compared to the simulation results obtained by using the AVL FIRE 3D CFD simulation program. This software was used to simulate the fuel-spray development during different stages of the injection process. Furthermore, the influence of biodiesel fuel on the engine operating condition of a heavy-duty diesel engine and its' emission formation was tested experimentally on an engine test-bed, and numerically by using the AVL BOOST software. It was found out that the tested biodiesel could be used as an alternative fuel for heavy-duty diesel engines. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, Xanthium sibiricum Patr oil, a non-edible oil, was investigated for the first time to produce biodiesel. X. sibiricum Patr has very good environmental adaptability and thus has plenty of wild resources. Its seed has a high oil content (42.34%) which gives potential annual output of 100,000. tons just in China. And the oil acid value is pretty low (1.38. mg KOH/g). Under the optimal conditions, the FAME content and yield of X. sibiricum biodiesel were 98.7. wt.% and 92.0%, respectively. The properties of the biodiesel product were tested and most properties were in accordance with EN 14214-08, ASTM D6751-10 and GB/T 20828-07 standards, except cetane number and oxidative stability. The results indicated that X. sibiricum Patr is a promising species as a biodiesel feedstock in China. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Preparation of biodiesel from vegetable oils, such as rapeseed oil, soybean oil and sunflower oil, catalyzed by an alkaline ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium imidazolide ([Bmim]Im) was investigated in this work. The results demonstrated that [Bmim]Im exhibited high activity and the yield of biodiesel was up to 95% or more when molar ratio of methanol to vegetable oil was 6:1, ionic liquid dosage was 6. wt.%, reaction temperature was 60. °C, and reaction time was 60. min. After [Bmim]Im was used for the sixth time, the yield of biodiesel still remained at about 95%. The effects of the biodiesels on the lubricity of low-sulfur diesel fuel were also investigated using the High Frequency Reciprocating Rig method, and the results showed that sunflower biodiesel and soybean biodiesel had higher lubrication performance than that of rapeseed biodiesel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This report is the first to consider methane production energy balance from crude glycerol at a practical rather than a laboratory scale. Crude glycerol was added to the plant progressively at between 5 and 75L glycerol/30m3-day for 1.5years, and the energy balance was positive at a loading rate of 30L glycerol/30m3-day (1ml/L-day). At this loading rate over one year, an energy output equivalent to 106% of the energy input was achieved. The surplus energy was equivalent to transport for 1200km, so the proper feedstock-transportation distance was within a 12.5-km radius of the biogas plant. In addition, the digested sludge contained fertilizer components (T-N: 0.11%, P2O5: 0.036%, K2O: 0.19%) that increased grass yield by 1.2 times when applied to grass fields. Thus, crude glycerol is an attractive bioresource that can be used as both a feedstock for methane production and a liquid fertilizer. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Summary: A normalization step is widely exercised in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies in order to better understand the relative significance of impact category results. In the normalization stage, normalization references (NRs) are the characterized results of a reference system, typically a national or regional economy. Normalization is widely practiced in LCA-based decision support and policy analysis (e.g., LCA cases in municipal solid waste treatment technologies, renewable energy technologies, and environmentally preferable purchasing programs, etc.). The compilation of NRs demands significant effort and time as well as an intimate knowledge of data availability and quality. Consequently only one set of published NRs is available for the United States, and has been adopted by various studies. In this study, the completeness of the previous NRs was evaluated and significant data gaps were identified. One of the reasons for the significant data gaps was that the toxic release inventory (TRI) data significantly underestimate the potential impact of toxic releases for some sectors. Also the previous NRs did not consider the soil emissions and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) runoffs to water and chemical emissions to soils. Filling in these data gaps increased the magnitude of NRs for "human health cancer," "human health noncancer," "ecotoxicity," and "eutrophication" significantly. Such significant changes can alter or even reverse the outcome of an LCA study. We applied the previous and updated NRs to conventional gasoline and corn ethanol LCAs. The results demonstrate that NRs play a decisive role in the interpretation of LCA results that use a normalization step. © 2012 by Yale University.

AB  - A super-clean boiler system comprising a multi-fuel boiler and a reactor for plasma-chemical hybrid NOx aftertreatment is developed, and its industrial applications are examined. The purpose of this research is to optimally reduce NOx emission and utilize waste bio-oil as a renewable energy source. First, NO oxidation using indirect plasma at elevated flue gas temperatures is investigated. It is clarified that more than 98% of NO is oxidized when the temperature of the flue gas is less than 130°C. Three types of waste bio-oils (waste vegetable oil, rice bran oil, and fish oil) are burned in the boiler as fuels with a rotary-type burner for CO2 reduction considering carbon neutrality. NOx in the flue gases of these bio-oils is effectively reduced by the indirect plasma-chemical hybrid treatment. Ultralow NOx emission less than 2ppm is achieved for 450min in the firing of city natural gas fuel. The boiler system can be successfully operated automatically according to unsteady steam demand and using an empirical equation for Na2SO3 supply rate, and can be used in industries as an ideal NOx control technology. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and net energy ratio (NER) have been evaluated for the production of palm biodiesel from palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) which is a by-product in the refining process. For the case that PFAD is regarded as a processing residue, GHG emissions associated with biodiesel production in the considered process is 86.5% less than that of fossil diesel, which surpasses even the threshold of year 2018 of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) of the European Union (EU). In the present study, it is also shown that the value of the NER is 3.23, which means that the energy yield from palm methyl ester (PME) production from PFAD is around three times larger than the input of fossil energy in the production. In conclusion, the palm biodiesel from PFAD can be one of various alternatives to the 'conventional' palm biodiesel which is made of refined palm oil, and sustainability issues and ethical problems can be considerably minimized with the strategic utilization of palm biodiesel produced from PFAD. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A case study is presented for the forensic identification of several spilled biodiesels and its blends with petroleum oil using integrated forensic oil fingerprinting techniques. The integrated fingerprinting techniques combined SPE with GC/MS for obtaining individual petroleum hydrocarbons (aliphatic hydrocarbons, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and their alkylated derivatives and biomarkers), and biodiesel hydrocarbons (fatty acid methyl esters, free fatty acids, glycerol, monoacylglycerides, and free sterols). HPLC equipped with evaporative scattering laser detector was also used for identifying the compounds that conventional GC/MS could not finish. The three environmental samples (E1, E2, and E3) and one suspected source sample (S2) were dominant with vegetable oil with high acid values and low concentration of fatty acid methyl ester. The suspected source sample S2 was responsible for the three spilled samples although E1 was slightly contaminated by petroleum oil with light hydrocarbons. The suspected source sample S1 exhibited with the high content of glycerol, low content of glycerides, and high polarity, indicating its difference from the other samples. These samples may be the separated byproducts in producing biodiesel. Canola oil source is the most possible feedstock for the three environmental samples and the suspected source sample S2. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. produces seeds rich in non-edible oil suitable for biodiesel but it has been categorized as invasive. Although not scientifically verified, this allegation has resulted in a cultivation ban in several countries. In this article we report an integrated series of observations and experimental findings from invasiveness research in Zambia. We studied the impacts of J. curcas plantations on adjacent land use systems focusing on spontaneous occurrence of seedlings, seed dispersal mechanisms, seed predation by animals, and germination success of dispersed seeds. No spontaneous regeneration was observed in land use systems adjacent to J. curcas plantations. Primary seed dispersal was limited, predominantly under the canopy of the mother plant. Rodents and shrews dispersed and predated J. curcas seeds and fruits. They transported the seeds up to 23 m from the sources and repositioned them in their burrows up to 0.7 m deep, but none of these seeds could establish. Germination experiments in adjacent land use systems revealed 4% germination success at the soil surface, and 65% if buried artificially at 1-2 cm depth, yet the latter is unlikely to occur under natural conditions. These findings show that J. curcas seeds may be dispersed by animals to adjacent land use systems, but no natural recruitment was observed given low germination on the surface and none in burrows. Altogether these results suggest that the plant currently does not show an elevated risk of invasion to adjacent land use systems, at least in the investigated case study. But more long-term studies, also in other growing areas are needed to corroborate these results. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Thermal cracking experiments were carried out to promote the conversion of waste cooking oil into a biofuel which is similar to gasoline (light-naphtha). Temperature and residence time were varied in order to analyze their effects on the light-naphtha characteristics in terms of acid value and chemical composition, (paraffins, i-paraffins, olefins, naphthenes, oxygenates and aromatics). The PIONA analysis was used to determine the composition of chemical groups in the light naphtha obtained and its benzene concentration. The results show that at higher temperatures and with longer residence times the benzene concentration increases, but the values obtained are close to the limits of the regulatory specifications of European and Brazilian laws. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bio-oil is an alternative source of renewable energy produced from the pyrolysis of different biomass. However, it is not an expedient automotive fuel due to its unfavorable nature (highly oxygenate/phenolic). Due to the presence of highly oxygenate compounds in the bio-oil, it is not possible to convert the bio-oil into transport fuel easily. To prevail over these physicochemical issues, hydro treatment (HT), and fractionation would be the possible upgrading method. Attempts have been made to upgrade the bio-oil by reduction/removal of oxygenate/phenolic compounds from the bio-oil by of Pd/Al2O 3 catalyst and Hempel distillation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work investigates the measurement of the consumption rates of viscous biofuels used in internal combustion engines. Most commercial instruments are suitable for traditional petroleum-based fuels, and may exhibit material incompatibility with alternative fuels. Further, some experimental low-grade straight vegetable oils are viscous and relatively quickly degrading fuels, which often need to be heated to assure adequate flow through the fuel system as some are solid at room temperatures. In this study, fuel consumption of straight vegetable oils was measured using an electrically heated fuel tank placed on a scale, and determined as the first derivative of the instantaneous tank mass. While the data were noisy and subject to oscillations and experimental error, repeatable values of the total consumption over various cycles were obtained on diesel fuel, biodiesel and heated rapeseed oil. The measured values were compared with the fuel consumption derived from the exhaust emissions of carbon dioxide and carbon content of the respective fuels. As the advantages of each method are complementary, their parallel use might be beneficial. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Interest in using unaltered vegetable oil as a fuel in diesel engines has experienced an increase due to uncertainty in the crude oil market supply and the detrimental effects petroleum fuels have on the environment. Unaltered vegetable oil blended with petroleum fuels is less expensive, uses less energy to produce and is more environmentally friendly compared to petroleum diesel or biodiesel. Here we investigate the engine performance of unaltered waste soybean oil blended with petroleum diesel and kerosene for three vehicles. Five biofuel blends ranging from 15% to 50% oil by volume were tested on a 2006 Jeep Liberty CRD, a 1999 Mercedes E300 and a 1984 Mercedes 300TD. A DynoJet 224 × chassis dynamometer was used to test vehicle engine performance for horsepower and torque through a range of RPMs. Results for the Jeep showed a modest decrease in horsepower and torque compared to petroleum diesel ranging from 0.9% for the 15% oil blend to 5.0% lower for the 50% oil blend. However, a 30% oil blend showed statistically better performance (P < 0.05) compared to petroleum diesel. For the 1999 Mercedes, horsepower performance was 1.1% lower for the 15% oil blend to 6.4% lower for the 50% oil blend. Engine performance for a 30% blend was statistically the same (P < 0.05) compare to diesel. Finally, horsepower performance was 1.1% lower for the 15% oil blend to 4.7% lower for the 50% oil blend for the 1984 Mercedes. Overall, the performance on these oil blended fuels was excellent and, on average 1.1% lower than petroleum diesel for blends containing 40% or lower waste soybean oil content. The more significant decrease in power between the 40% and 50% oil blends indicates that oil content in these blended fuels should be no more than 40%. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As the world's fossil fuel reseverves is shown to be out of oil supply in a few years from now, efforts to finding an alternative, environmentally friendly and sustainable sources of fuel have been heightened towards on-farm biodiesel production and industrial processing of bioethanol. Jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) has been selected among other biodiesel feedstocks targeted for this on-farm biodiesel production with intensive production witnessed in India. In Kenya, however, smallholder farmers are found growing Jatropha despite the limited knowledge about its agro-ecological adaptability. The study hypothesis was that regions for biofuel production have not been properly identified in Kenya. Therefore, the objective of this research was to study the performance of Jatropha under different soil and climatic conditions within the smallholder farms in Kenya. A quantitative baseline survey was conducted from July to August, 2010 in 140 randomly selected farms in Lamu, Kibwezi, Nyando and Bondo districts of Kenya (35 per district). A qualitative in-depth study of 5 farms chosen randomly from each region was also done to verify the information obtained. Results showed that performance of Jatropha was positively linked to humid conditions, well distributed annual rainfall of 500-750 mm, moderately sandy to loam soils, neutral pH and good level of management. It was concluded that good crop management together with climatic and soil suitability are important for successful Jatropha production. Furthermore, it was evident that not all regions where Jatropha is promoted for production in Kenya, though, with suitable climate and soils, support the crop without proper crop management practices. © Knowledgia Review, Malaysia.

AB  - The combustion and emission characteristics of ethyl levulinate (EL)-diesel blended fuels were investigated using engine bench tests. Blended fuels properties, including the kinematic viscosity (KV), density, EL proportions, oxygen content, cetane number (CN), and lower heating value (LHV) were considered. The combustion and emission characteristics of brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), as well as hydrocarbon (HC), nitrogen oxide (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, as well as smoke opacity, were tested. The relationship between the blended fuel properties and the combustion-emission characteristics were analyzed using grey relational analysis (GRA). The correlation degree between the fuel properties and the combustion-emission results indicated that the BSFC was influenced most by the density of the blended fuels. NOx, CO, and CO2 emissions were influenced most by the oxygen content. The KV was the most influential parameter for HC emissions and the opacity of the blended fuels. The oxygen content was the foremost influential parameter. The results show that GRA could be used to increase the comprehensiveness of combustion-emission blended-fuel studies, by providing a reference for the reasonable use of biofuel-diesel mixtures.

AB  - The effects of various stresses on the suitability of lipid synthesized by Chlorella pyrenoidosa for biodiesel production were investigated. Lipids were characterized for detailed fatty acid methyl ester profiling and biodiesel properties like cetane number (CN), iodine value, cold filter plugging point (CFPP). Maximum biomass productivity (106.63mgL-1d-1) and lipid content (29.68%) were obtained at indoor cultivation (nitrate sufficient, pH 8-10, 24h illumination). However, compared to this condition, other nitrate sufficient cultures [pH 6-8 and 10-12 (24h illumination), and at ambient CO2 and 16:8h light:dark photoperiod (pH unadjusted)] showed ~12-14% lower lipid productivity. Upon 50% nitrate depletion (at indoor and outdoor; pH unadjusted) lipid content has increased by 7.62% and 17%, respectively. Though stress conditions helped enhancing lipid accumulation, there was two-fold increase in PUFA content compared to that observed at pH 8-10. This resulted in fuel properties which did not comply with the biodiesel standards. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this study was to use glycerol generated from the synthesis of biodiesel to study the oleaginous potential of wild yeasts. An initial selection was performed via a rapid and qualitative technique by staining with Sudan Black B. Initially 129 yeasts were present, from which 5 were selected and cultivated in liquid medium containing pure or raw glycerol. The yeast LEB-M3, isolated from the Pantanal, presented lipid content of 20.46% and 56.58% for cultivation in pure and raw glycerol, respectively. This strain was genotypically identified as Candida sp. The fatty acid profile showed predominance of oleic acid (C18:1), 57.35% for cultivation in pure glycerol, and in raw glycerol linoleic acid (C18:2) was predominant (46.0%). It was possible to select a yeast with high lipid concentrations 9.14. g/L and fatty acid profile similar to vegetable oils commonly used in the synthesis of biodiesel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effects of ethanol concentration gradients along with varied cultivation times on lipid and fatty acid accumulation and composition of Scenedesmus sp. were studied. The maximum increment of algal density, lipid productivity, lipid content and fatty acid content were 6.61, 11.75, 1.34 and 3.14 times higher than the control group under 12h photoperiod. Algal light deprivation inhibited ethanol positive effects on algal growth and lipid biomass. The cumulative quantity of C16:0 and C18:0 decreased correspondingly with the increase of ethanol concentrations and cultivation times. Besides, unsaturated fatty acids appeared early in algal cells and increased 57.02% in maximum. However, only 2.27% 14C was transferred from ethanol to fatty acids. The results indicated that adding proper amount of ethanol in algal culture medium was beneficial to biodiesel feedstock production and biodiesel properties. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A counter-rotating twin screw reactor unit was investigated for its behaviour in the pyrolysis of cassava rhizome biomass. Several parameters such as pyrolysis temperature in the range of 500-700. °C, biomass particle size of <0.6. mm, the use of sand as heat transfer medium, nitrogen flow rate of 4-10. L/min and nitrogen pressure of 1-3. bar were thoroughly examined. It was found that the pyrolysis temperature of 550. °C could maximise the bio-oil yield (50. wt.%). The other optimum parameters for maximising the bio-oil yield were the biomass particle size of 0.250-0.425. mm, the nitrogen flow rate of 4. L/min and the nitrogen pressure of 2. bar. The use of the heat transfer medium could increase the bio-oil yield to a certain extent. Moreover, the water content of bio-oil produced with the counter-rotating twin screw reactor was relatively low, whereas the solids content was relatively high, compared to some other reactor configurations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An integrated process of catalytic composite membranes (CCMs) and sodium methoxide was developed to produce biodiesel from waste chicken fat. The free fatty acids (FFAs) in the chicken oil were converted to methyl esters by esterification with methanol using a novel sulfonated polyethersulfone (SPES)/PES/non-woven fabric (NWF) CCMs in a flow-through catalytic membrane reactor. The CCM is that the NWF fibers were fully embedded in SPES/PES with a homogeneous and microporous structure. The oil obtained after esterification was carried out by transesterification of sodium methoxide. The results showed that the FFAs conversion obtained by CCMs with the acid capacity of 25.28mmol (H+) was 92.8% at the residence time 258s. The CCMs present a good stability during the continuous running of 500h. The conversion of transesterification was 98.1% under the optimum conditions. The quality of the biodiesel met the international standards. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An in situ transesterification approach was demonstrated for converting lipid-rich wet algae (Nannochloropsis salina) into fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) under microwave-mediated supercritical ethanol conditions, while preserving the nutrients and other valuable components in the algae. This single-step process can simultaneously and effectively extract the lipids from wet algae and transesterify them into crude biodiesel. Experimental runs were designed to optimize the process parameters and to evaluate their effects on algal biodiesel yield. The algal biomass characterization and algal biodiesel analysis were carried out by using various analytical instruments such as FTIR, SEM-EDS, TLC, GC-MS and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen and oxygen environments was also performed to examine the thermal and oxidative stability of ethyl esters produced from wet algae. This simple in situ transesterification process using a green solvent and catalyst-free approach can be a potentially efficient route for algal biodiesel production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the current scenario of constant power drops in Brazil and an imminent crisis in the electricity sector, the use of generators and biofuels such as biodiesel has been quite common in rural areas represents an option for diversification of the energy matrix. This study evaluated the use of soybean biodiesel in different concentrations in a diesel engine cycle under different demands of engine loads. Concentrations used were: 5% (B5), 10% (B10), 20% (B20), 50% (B50), 75% (B75) and 100% biodiesel (B100) in a diesel generator with engine of 5 Hp of four-stroke under different operating conditions of the engine, through the demands of electrical loads: 500, 1.000, 1.500, 2.000 W and off connected to the generator. Tests were conducted to quantify the hourly consumption of fuel and gas emissions. The variables suffered significant influence as the electrical charges and fuel mixtures were changed. The use of biodiesel in higher concentrations considerably reduces the emission of majority of pollutant gases and practically nullified the emission of sulfur in concentrations above 65% biodiesel.

AB  - Melon seed oil was successfully converted into biodiesel fuels via alkali catalyzed transesterification. Transesterification parameters such as base concentration, methanol to oil molar ratio, reaction time, reaction temperature, catalyst type, and step multiplicity were investigated. The results indicated that (0.75% KOH w/w of oil, a 6: 1 methanol to oil molar ratio, reaction temperature of 60°C, and a duration of 1 h) where the optimal experimental conditions for the transesterification. The Fourier transform infra red spectra of the biodiesel was also specified and found differs greatly from that of the parent oil confirming the formation of biodiesel. Properties of the produced fuels were determined and found enhanced compared to those of the parent oil. Besides, the optimal biodiesel sample was blended with petro diesel in various volume percentages. However, the results showed that biodiesel had slight influence on the original properties of petro diesel. Copyright © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study is aimed at assessing the challenge of liquid transportation fuel in Nigeria, which necessitated the entrance of the country into the biofuel race. The study found that despite being an important member of the organization of petroleum exporting countries (OPEC), Nigeria still suffers from fuel scarcities. Reasons for the short supply of refined petroleum products (particularly gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel) in Nigeria include poor capacity utilization of the nation's refineries, disruption of crude oil supply to the refineries and political instability in the Niger Delta region (Nigeria's oil province). Nigeria now relies heavily on foreign nations for the supply of these fuels. The country spends substantial part of her foreign exchange on fuel importation. The Federal Government now wishes to reverse this trend by initiating the automotive biofuel programme. The Nigerian automotive biofuel programme involved the construction of 9 plants comprising of 4 sugarcane and 2 cassava bioethanol projects and 3 biodiesel projects. These projects would involve the investment of $1.27 billion into the Nigerian economy for the production of 445 million L of ethanol, 192 MW of green electricity and 120 million L of biodiesel annually. © Maxwell Scientific Organizaation, 2013.

AB  - Jatropha (Jatropha curcas) is a tropical perennial species identified as a potential biofuel crop. The oil is of excellent quality and it has been successfully tested as biodiesel and in jet fuel mixes. However, studies on breeding and genetic improvement of jatropha are limited. Space offers a unique environment for experiments aiming at the assessment of mutations and differential gene expression of crops and in vitro cultures of plants are convenient for studies of genetic variation as affected by microgravity. However, before microgravity studies can be successfully performed, pre-flight experiments are necessary to characterize plant material and validate flight hardware environmental conditions. Such preliminary studies set the ground for subsequent spaceflight experiments. The objectives of this study were to compare the in vitro growth of cultures from three explant sources (cotyledon, leaf, and stem sections) of three jatropha accessions (Brazil, India, and Tanzania) outside and inside the petriGAP, a modified group activation pack (GAP) flight hardware to fit petri dishes. In vitro jatropha cell cultures were established in petri dishes containing a modified MS medium and maintained in a plant growth chamber at 25 ± 2 °C in the dark. Parameters evaluated were surface area of the explant tissue (A), fresh weight (FW), and dry weight (DW) for a period of 12 weeks. Growth was observed for cultures from all accessions at week 12, including subsequent plantlet regeneration. For all accessions differences in A, FW and DW were observed for inside vs. outside the PetriGAPs. Growth parameters were affected by accession (genotype), explant type, and environment. The type of explant influenced the type of cell growth and subsequent plantlet regeneration capacity. However, overall cell growth showed no abnormalities. The present study demonstrated that jatropha in vitro cell cultures are suitable for growth inside PetriGAPs for a period of 12 weeks. The parameters evaluated in this study provide the basic ground work and pre-flight assessment needed to justify a model for microgravity studies with jatropha in vitro cell cultures. Future studies should focus on results of experiments performed with jatropha in vitro cultures in microgravity. © 2012 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Assessing the extent to which all bio-fuels that are claimed to be renewable are in fact renewable is essential because producing such renewable fuels itself requires some amount of non-renewable energy (NE) and materials. Using hybrid life cycle analysis (LCA)-from raw material collection to delivery of pellets to end users-the energy cost of wood pellet production in China was estimated at 1. 35 J/J, of which only 0. 09 J was derived from NE, indicating that only 0. 09 J of NE is required to deliver 1 J of renewable energy into society and showing that the process is truly renewable. Most of the NE was consumed during the conversion process (46. 21%) and delivery of pellets to end users (40. 69%), during which electricity and diesel are the two major forms of NE used, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that the distance over which the pellets are transported affects the cost of NE significantly. Therefore the location of the terminal market and the site where wood resources are available are crucial to saving diesel. © 2013 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of direct sonication in conversion of waste cooking oil into biodiesel. Waste cooking oils may cause environmental hazards if not disposed properly. However, waste cooking oils can serve as low-cost feedstock for biodiesel production. Ultrasonics, a non-conventional process technique, was applied to directly convert waste cooking oil into biodiesel in a single step. Ultrasonics transesterify waste cooking oils very efficiently due to increased mass/heat transfer phenomena and specific thermal/athermal effects at molecular levels. Thus, energy and chemical consumption in the overall process is greatly reduced compared to conventional biodiesel processes. Specific to this research, thermal effects of ultrasonics in transesterification reaction without external conventional heating along with effects of different ultrasonic, energy intensities and energy density are reported. Optimization of process parameters such as methanol to oil ratio, catalyst concentration and reaction time are also presented. It was observed that small reactor design such as plug-flow or contact-type reactor design may improve overall ultrasonic utilization in the transesterification reaction due to increased energy density and ultrasonic intensity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Due to the increasing price of crude oil, biofuel as an alternative of fossil fuels is sought to be a global wide solution to reduce the emission of green house gas. In order to compare the influence on engine which meet euro IV emission standard by using pure fossil diesel, 2% and 5% biodiesel. A long-term operation with blended 2% and 5% biodiesel by standard engine test had been evaluated in this study. The results could be referred to the consideration of marketing promotion strategy as well as government policy in Taiwan. Both B2 B5 diesel fuel (2 and 5 vol% biodiesel) and diesel fuel were employed to the same engines for testing purpose to compare the influence. The engines were equipped with an electronically controlled common-rail fuel injection system. After 500 hours full load durability operation, the key components of the engines were analyzed and characterized by a series of inspections to identify the degree of decay and wear behavior. In addition, the engine performance which by the test procedure for SAE J1995 and emission measured which by the test procedure for FTP transient cycle were also determined at each maintenance stage. In this study, oil characteristics after durability test had also been evaluated. The results indicated that the engine components including piston rings, cylinder liners and needle valves of injector were less difference in dimensions comparison before and after durability tests. The fuel supply system of the diesel engine consists of a fuel tank, fuel pipes, fuel filters, and a low pressure pump had also been evaluated. According to microscopic characterization and engine oil analyses, the wear loss of the key components was insignificant and tribological performance of the B5 biodiesel was slightly better than that of diesel fuel. It was found that the performance and emissions were varied under ±3% when diesel engine was fueled with B5 biodiesel. © 2013 SAE International.

AB  - The limited availability of fossil fuels and the increasing environmental pollution will lead to an increased demand for sustainable biofuels. The production of bio-based diesel fuels from vegetable oils is commonly accomplished using a process known as Trans-esterification. The product of Transesterification is Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME), commonly known as Biodiesel. An alternative process is Hydro-treatment of seed oils or animal waste fats to produce highly paraffinic renewable diesel fuel called Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (HVO). Detailed investigations were carried out by the "Department of Advanced Diesel Engine Development" at FEV GmbH Aachen (Germany), to explore the potential of this biofuel compound as a candidate for future compression ignition engines. Engine results of pure HVO fuel are compared to petroleum based diesel fuel (B0) and rapeseed oil methyl ester (B100) at different part load and full load points with respect to combustion behavior, engine efficiency, combustion sound level (CSL) and emission performance. To ensure that the findings are relevant for modern automotive business, the testing program was carried out on a EURO 6 compliant High Efficiency Diesel Combustion System (HECS) designed for future passenger car applications. The results indicate that at lower part loads, the higher cetane number of HVO fuel leads to lower ignition delay periods, resulting in decreased soot reduction potential and improved CSL behavior. On the other hand, at medium and high part load operations, soot emissions with HVO reduced approximately 50% - 60% due to almost aromatic free fuel composition. Furthermore un-burnt HC and CO emissions for HVO were observed to be lowest amongst all investigated fuels. © 2013 SAE International.

AB  - The impact of biodiesel and new generation biofuels on emissions from heavy-duty diesel engines was investigated using a California Air Resources Board (CARB) certified diesel fuel as a base fuel. This study was performed on two heavy-duty diesel engines, a 2006 engine and a diesel particle filter (DPF) equipped 2007 engine, on an engine dynamometer over four different test cycles. Emissions from soy-based and animal-based biodiesel, renewable diesel fuel, and gas to liquid (GTL) diesel fuel were evaluated at blend levels ranging from 5 to 100%. Consistent with previous studies, particulate matter (PM), hydrocarbons (HC), and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions generally showed increasing reductions with increasing biodiesel and renewable/GTL diesel fuel blend levels for the non-DPF equipped engine. The levels of these reductions were generally comparable to those found in previous studies performed using more typical Federal diesel fuels. The DPF-equipped engine THC, CO, and PM emission levels were very low and did not show significant fuel impacts. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were slightly higher for biodiesel blends, and slightly lower for the renewable/GTL blends. Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) was slightly higher for biodiesel and renewable/GTL blends, consistent with their lower energy density. Copyright © 2013 SAE International.

AB  - To comply with the new regulations on particulate matter emissions, the manufacturers of light duty as well as heavy duty vehicles more commonly use diesel particulate filters (DPF). The regeneration of DPF depends to a significant extent on the properties of the soot stored. Within the Cluster of Excellence "Tailor-Made Fuels from Biomass (TMFB)" at RWTH Aachen University, the Institute for Combustion Engines carried out a detailed investigation program to explore the potential of future biofuel candidates for optimized combustion systems. The experiments for particulate measurements and analysis were conducted on a EURO 6 compliant High Efficiency Diesel Combustion System (HECS) with petroleum based diesel fuel as reference and a today's commercial biofuel (i.e. FAME) as well as a potential future biomass derived fuel candidate (i.e. 2-MTHF / DBE). Thermo gravimetric analyzer (TGA) was used in this study to evaluate the oxidative reactivity of the soot. A "Laboratory Gas Test Bench (LGB)" was used to determine the kinetics of soot oxidation mechanism considering impact of soot properties on its burning behavior inside a DPF. The kinetics of soot oxidation with O2 was studied as well as the oxidation with NO2 in order to cover thermal filter regeneration as well as CRTŴ regeneration. Experimental results from LGB and TGA suggest that the soot from future biomass derived fuel candidate has lower activation energy, thereby; lower oxidation temperatures compared to petroleum based diesel fuel.

AB  - This experimental study examines the effect on performance and emission outputs of a compression ignition engine operating on biodiesels of varying carbon chain length and the degree of unsaturation. A well-instrumented, heavy-duty, multi-cylinder, common-rail, turbo-charged diesel engine was used to ensure that the results contribute in a realistic way to the ongoing debate about the impact of biofuels. Comparative measurements are reported for engine performance as well as the emissions of NOx, particle number and size distribution, and the concentration of the reactive oxygen species (which provide a measure of the toxicity of emitted particles). It is shown that the biodiesels used in this study produce lower mean effective pressure, somewhat proportionally with their lower calorific values; however, the molecular structure has been shown to have little impact on the performance of the engine. The peak in-cylinder pressure is lower for the biodiesels that produce a smaller number of emitted particles, compared to fossil diesel, but the concentration of the reactive oxygen species is significantly higher because of oxygen in the fuels. The differences in the physicochemical properties amongst the biofuels and the fossil diesel significantly affect the engine combustion and emission characteristics. Saturated short chain length fatty acid methyl esters are found to enhance combustion efficiency, reduce NOx and particle number concentration, but results in high levels of fuel consumption. © 2013 SAE International.

AB  - The microalga Nannochloropsis sp. was used in this study, in a biorefinery context, as biomass feedstock for the production of fatty acids for biodiesel, biohydrogen and high added-value compounds. The microalgal biomass, which has a high lipid and pigment content (mainly carotenoids), was submitted to supercritical CO2 extraction. The temperature, pressure and solvent flow-rate were evaluated to check their effect on the extraction yield. The best operational conditions to extract 33glipids/100gdrybiomass were found to be at 40°C, 300bar and a CO2 flow-rate of 0.62g/min. The effect of adding a co-solvent (ethanol) was also studied. When supercritical CO2 doped with 20% (w/w) ethanol was used, it was possible to extract 45glipids/100gdrybiomass of lipids and recover 70% of the pigments. Furthermore, the remaining biomass after extraction was effectively used as feedstock to produce biohydrogen through dark fermentation by Enterobacter aerogenes resulting in a hydrogen production yield of 60.6mL/gdrybiomass. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This life cycle assessment evaluates and quantifies the environmental impacts of the production of hydrogen and transportation fuels from the fast pyrolysis and upgrading of corn stover. Input data for this analysis come from Aspen Plus modeling, a GREET (Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation) model database and a US Life Cycle Inventory Database. SimaPro 7.3 software is employed to estimate the environmental impacts. The results indicate that the net fossil energy input is 0.25 MJ and 0.23 MJ per km traveled for a light-duty vehicle fueled by gasoline and diesel fuel, respectively. Bio-oil production requires the largest fossil energy input. The net global warming potential (GWP) is 0.037 kg CO2eq and 0.015 kg CO2eq per km traveled for a vehicle fueled by gasoline and diesel fuel, respectively. Vehicle operations contribute up to 33% of the total positive GWP, which is the largest greenhouse gas footprint of all the unit processes. The net GWPs in this study are 88% and 94% lower than for petroleum-based gasoline and diesel fuel (2005 baseline), respectively. Biomass transportation has the largest impact on ozone depletion among all of the unit processes. Sensitivity analysis shows that fuel economy, transportation fuel yield, bio-oil yield, and electricity consumption are the key factors that influence greenhouse gas emissions. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - For enzymatic biodiesel production from plant oil hydrolysates, an Aspergillus oryzae whole-cell biocatalyst that expresses Candida antarctica lipase B (r-CALB) with high esterification activity was developed. Each of soybean and palm oils was hydrolyzed using Candida rugosa lipase, and the resultant hydrolysates were subjected to esterification where immobilized r-CALB was used as a catalyst. In esterification, r-CALB afforded a methyl ester content of more than 90% after 6. h with the addition of 1.5. M equivalents of methanol. Favorably, stepwise additions of methanol and a little water were unnecessary for maintaining the lipase stability of r-CALB during esterification. During long-term esterification in a rotator, r-CALB can be recycled for 20 cycles without a significant loss of lipase activity, resulting in a methyl ester content of more than 90% even after the 20th batch. Therefore, the presented reaction system using r-CALB shows promise for biodiesel production from plant oil hydrolysates. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae are a promising source for proteins, lipids and carbohydrates for the food/feed and biofuel industry. In comparison with soya and palm oil, microalgae can be grown in a more efficient and sustainable way. To make microalgae production economically feasible it is necessary to optimally use all produced compounds. To accomplish this focus needs to be put on biorefinery techniques which are mild and effective. Of the techniques described, Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) seems to be the most developed technique compared to other cell disruption applications. For separation technology ionic liquids seems most promising as they are able to both separate hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds. But additional studies need to be evolved in the coming years to investigate their relevance as novel cell disruption and separation methods. We propose a complete downstream processing flow diagram that is promising in terms of low energy use and state of the art knowledge. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Waste spent yeast from brewery industry was used as a sole growth substrate to grow an oleaginous yeast Cryptococcus curvatus for the purpose of biodiesel production. Approximately 7. g/l/d of biomass productivity was obtained using only spent yeast (30. g/l) without additional nutrients and pretreatment of any kind. To make best use of available nutrients in the spent yeast, stepwise cultivation was carried out in a batch culture mode and the highest biomass and lipid content, which were 50.4. g/l and 37.7%, respectively, were obtained at 35:1 of C/N ratio. Lipid from C. curvatus was found to be a quality-sufficient source of oil as a transportation fuel in terms of cetane, iodine values, and oxidation stability, although the values of cold filter plugging point were less desirable. Economic evaluation revealed that the use of the spent yeast could significantly reduce the unit cost of yeast-based biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The green alga Botryococcus braunii is regarded as a potential source of renewable fuel due to its high lipid and hydrocarbon contents. However, the slow growth rate damaged its feasibility for biofuel production. In this study, a novel method of 'attached cultivation' was introduced to incubate B. braunii FACHB 357 (B race). A high biomass productivity of 6.5gm-2d-1 was achieved in single layer attached system at early stage of cultivation. At day 10, the biomass, lipid and hydrocarbon productivities were 5.5, 2.34 and 1.06gm-2d-1, respectively. Under nitrogen starvation condition, both of the contents of lipid and hydrocarbon were increased, whereas the profile of hydrocarbon kept almost unchanged, while the content for oleic acid (18:1) increased and linolenic acid (18:3) decreased. With a multi-layer photobioreactor, a biomass productivity of 49.1gm-2d-1 or a photosynthetic efficiency of 14.9% (visible light) were obtained under continuous illumination of 500μmolm-2s-1. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A sensitive analytical technique based on 'white light excitation fluorescence' (WLEF) has been developed for the quantification of various fuel blends like diesel-biodiesel, biodiesel-ethanol, and petrol-ethanol. These multifluorophoric fuel blends show large variations in their electronic absorption and fluorescence characteristics. Despite these variations, the developed technique enables composition estimation without any change in the instrument configuration, just by adjusting the fluorescence intensity control parameters. The combination of WLEF and multivariate modeling has provided a fairly fast and robust method with root mean square error prediction (RMSEP) values less than 1%. The developed fiber-optic compatible analytical technique provides a low cost, easy to use and easily standardizable method for the quantification of fuel compositions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A kinetic model was developed for the hydrolysis of soybean oil in subcritical water in the temperature range of 250-300°C. The empirical model includes reversible hydrolysis reactions for the production of fatty acids from soybean oil and additional reactions for autocatalysis by fatty acid reaction products. The experimental yield of fatty acids over the time course of the batch reactions was compared to the model prediction and the sum of squared errors was minimized to estimate the kinetic parameters. The kinetic model prediction of fatty acid yield displays good agreement with experimental data. The autocatalytic phenomenon was assessed experimentally by addition of fatty acids to initial reaction mixtures to test the robustness of the kinetic model. The model predicts the increase in the fatty acid yields experimentally observed with acid addition. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study compares liquid fuel combustion characteristics of biofuels derived from camelina (POSF6152) and tallow (POSF6308) with a US domestic aviation fuel (Jet-A, POSF4658) using the spherically symmetric (one-dimensional) droplet flame configuration as the basis of comparison. A blend of camelina biofuel and Jet-A is also examined. The initial droplet diameters were fixed at 0.57 ± 0.03 mm. The biofuels studied have been considered as replacement fuels for conventional jet fuels. Results show that the evolutions of droplet, flame, and soot shell diameters for Jet-A and the bio-fuels are very similar regardless of intrinsic compositional differences among the individual fuels. Sooting behaviors were noted to be different with Jet-A forming significantly thicker soot clouds, most likely due to its higher aromatic content compared to biofuels. The broad similarities shown in this study were consistent with results reported in the literature for performance of the same fuel systems in actual turbine and flight tests where the fuel blends examined were noted to yield essentially indistinguishable differences in overall performance. The results suggest value to the spherical droplet flame configuration to assess performance of real fuels burning under far more complex transport conditions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Scale-up potential of cultivating Chlorella zofingiensis in piggery wastewater for simultaneous wastewater treatment and biodiesel production was tested. The cultivation of C. zofingiensis with autoclaved wastewater and NaClO-pretreated wastewater, cultivation of algae indoors and outdoors, and stability of semi-continuous feeding operation were examined. The results showed that C. zofingiensis cultivated in piggery wastewater pretreated by autoclaving and NaClO had no evident difference in the performance of nutrient removal, algal growth and biodiesel production. The outdoor cultivation experiments indicated that C. zofingiensis was able to adapt and grow well outdoors. The semi-continuous feeding operation by replacing 50% of algae culture with fresh wastewater every 1.5days could provide a stable net biomass productivity of 1.314gL-1day-1. These findings in this study can prove that it is greatly possible to amplify the cultivation of C. zofingiensis in piggery wastewater for nutrient removal and biodiesel production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Culturing microalgae heterotrophically for producing lipid-based biofuels such as biodiesel and renewable hydrocarbons has attracted increasing attention due to the advantages of fast growth and high lipid yield under this growth mode without being subjected to light limitation. High cell density in the culture broth is desirable for reducing downstream processing costs. Oleaginous microalga Chlorella sorokiniana was investigated for high cell density culture with glucose as the carbon source. Best growth performance was obtained first with batch culture at pH 7.0 when ammonium was the nitrogen source. Then, two-stage fed-batch fermentation was conducted under the optimal conditions. The algal biomass grew linearly in the first stage with a productivity of 24.2gL-1d-1, and the lipid content increased from 14.5% to 38.7% in the second stage. This fermentation strategy resulted in algal biomass and lipid concentrations of 103.8gL-1 and 40.2gL-1 respectively. Analysis of lipid and fatty acid profiles showed C. sorokiniana accumulated a large amount of neutral lipids (92.9% of total lipids), triacylglycerols (82.8% of neutral lipids), and high contents of palmitic, oleic and linoleic acids, which are ideal form of lipid for making biodiesel. These results suggest that heterotrophic culture of C. sorokiniana holds great potential for lipid-based biofuel production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - One mutant (HP-1) with higher growth rate was obtained from Nannochloropsis oceanica IMET1 by heavy-ion irradiation mutagenesis. Compared to the wild type, the biomass accumulation and maximum growth rate of HP-1 were individually increased by 19% and 6%, and its lipid productivity was increased by 28% from 211 to 271mgL-1d-1. Subsequently analysis indicated photosynthetic efficiency of HP-1 was higher than that of wild type during cultivation. Further, lipid composition analysis indicated TAG content of HP-1 was 14% higher, while polar lipid content was 15% lower than that of wild type. Moreover, fatty acid profiles analysis revealed no significant variation was found between the two strains. The mutant is discussed in terms of its comparative advantage over the wild type with respect to its potential utilization for biodiesel production. Owing to its higher lipid productivity and TAG content, HP-1 could be considered as a valuable candidate for microalgal biodiesel production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In view of the increasing demand for bioenergy, in this study, the techno-economic viabilities for three emerging pathways to microalgal biofuel production have been evaluated. The three processes evaluated are the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), oil secretion and alkane secretion. These three routes differ in their lipid extraction procedure and the end-products produced. This analysis showed that these three processes showed various advantages: possibility to convert the defatted microalgae into bio-crude via HTL thus increasing the total biodiesel yield; better energetic and environmental performance for oil secretion and an even increased net energy ratio (NER) for alkane secretion. However, great technological breakthroughs are needed before planning any scale-up strategy such as continuous wet biomass processing and heat exchange optimization for the HTL pathway and effective and sustainable excretion for both secretion pathways. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel production from cotton-seed cake (CSC) and the pretreatment of the remaining biomass for dark fermentative hydrogen production was investigated. The direct conversion to biodiesel with alkali free fatty acids neutralization pretreatment and alkali transesterification resulted in a biodiesel with high esters content and physicochemical properties fulfilling the EN-standards. Blends of cotton-seed oil methyl esters (CME) and diesel showed an improvement in lubricity and cetane number. Moreover, CME showed good compatibility with commercial biodiesel additives. On the basis of conversion of the remaining CSC to sugars fermentable towards hydrogen, the optimal conditions included removal of the oil of CSC and pretreatment at 10% NaOH (w/w dry matter). The extreme thermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus showed good hydrogen production, 84-112% of the control, from NaOH-pretreated CSC and low hydrogen production, 15-20% of the control, from the oil-rich and not chemically pretreated CSC, and from Ca(OH)2-pretreated CSC. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae are regarded as a promising source of lipids for bio-diesel production and bio-products. The current paper investigates the processing of microalgal slurries under controlled microwave irradiation. Microwave power was applied to reach temperatures of 80, 100, 120 and 140. °C at a constant residence time of 12. min. Microwave irradiation led to disruption of the algal cell walls which facilitated lipid extraction. The influence of inorganic material on microwave heating was assessed for three strains including, Nannochloropsis occulata, Chlorogloeopsis fritschii and Pseudochoricystis ellipsoidea. Mass balances were calculated and showed that the amount of carbon, nitrogen and total mass recovered in the residue was highly dependent on process conditions and algae strain. Hydrothermal microwave processing (HMP) was found to be an effective pre-treatment for hydrothermal liquefaction and extraction of lipids and phytochemicals. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The catalytic synthesis of biodiesel from soybean oil by transesterification over basic ionic liquid catalysts had been studied at atmospheric pressure. Choline hydroxide (ChOH) catalyst exhibited better catalytic activity compared with other basic ionic liquid catalysts, and methanol is the best alcohol for biodiesel synthesis. The suitable molar ratio of methanol and soybean oil was 9:1, and the optimum catalyst dosage existed for catalytic activity, which was about 4. wt.% (without soap formation). The study also revealed that the appropriate reaction temperature was about 60°C, and the suitable reaction time was 2.5. h on the basis of biodiesel yield. The reusability test showed that ChOH catalyst had perfect utility for repeated use. By basicity test, it was found that the basic ionic liquid ChOH possessed better basicity in methanol solution. The catalytic reaction mechanism was illuminated by the interaction between the methoxyl group after activating and the carbonyl group of the triglyceride, which has been investigated using quasi in situ infrared spectroscopy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The sequential co-production of bioethanol and biodiesel from spent coffee grounds was investigated. The direct conversion of bioethanol from spent coffee grounds was not found to be a desirable option because of the relatively slow enzymatic saccharification behavior in the presence of triglycerides and the free fatty acids (FFAs) found to exist in the raw materials. Similarly, the direct transformation of the spent coffee grounds into ethanol without first extracting lipids was not found to be a feasible alternative. However, the crude lipids extracted from the spent coffee grounds were themselves converted into fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) via the non-catalytic biodiesel transesterification reaction. The yields of bioethanol and biodiesel were 0.46gg-1 and 97.5±0.5%, which were calculated based on consumed sugar and lipids extracted from spent coffee grounds respectively. Thus, this study clearly validated our theory that spent coffee grounds could be a strong candidate for the production of bioethanol and biodiesel. © 2013.

AB  - This study was to investigate the composition and characteristics of long-straight chain alkane and fatty alcohols from the microalga Chlorella Sorokiniana 21, isolated from the coastal water of Pearl River Delta, China. Under the optimized aeration growth condition, this strain yielded up to 1.44gL-1 biomass and 24.90% extracts of dry weight. The major compounds of the extracts were identified to be alkanes (35.93%) and alcohols (53.73%). Of the extracts, long-straight chain alkanes accounted for 30.54% with heptadecane (21.13%) as a predominant component. Furthermore, a large amount of fatty alcohols (53.73%) were identified in the algal extracts with 29.09% of 3-(2-methoxyethyl)-1-nonanol. Thus, this algal species is a promising feedstock for the production of supplement for petrodiesel-like fuels and biochemicals used in the cosmetics and food industries. This study represents the first report of long-straight chain alkane and fatty alcohols from microalgae isolated from coastal water of the region. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With a target production of 1000ton of dry algae/yr, lipid content of 30wt.%, and productivity of 30g/m2-d in a 340-day annual operation, four common scenarios of microalgae bioenergy routes were assessed in terms of cost, energy, and CO2 inputs and outputs. Scenario 1 (biodiesel production), Scenario 2 (Scenario 1 with integrated anaerobic digestion system), Scenario 3 (biogas production), and Scenario 4 (supercritical gasification) were evaluated. Scenario 4 outperformed other scenarios in terms of net energy production (1282.42kWh/ton algae) and CO2 removal (1.32ton CO2/ton algae) while Scenario 2 surpassed the other three scenarios in terms of net cost. Scenario 1 produced the lowest energy while Scenario 3 was the most expensive bioenergy system. This study evaluated critical parameters that could direct the proper design of the microalgae bioenergy system with an efficient energy production, CO2 removal, and economic feasibility. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To investigate the role of phosphorus in lipid production under nitrogen starvation conditions, five types of media possessing different nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations or their combination were prepared to culture Chlorella vulgaris. It was found that biomass production under nitrogen deficient condition with sufficient phosphorus supply was similar to that of the control (with sufficient nutrition), resulting in a maximum lipid productivity of 58.39mg/L/day. Meanwhile, 31P NMR showed that phosphorus in the medium was transformed and accumulated as polyphosphate in cells. The uptake rate of phosphorus in cells was 3.8 times higher than the uptake rate of the control. This study demonstrates that phosphorus plays an important role in lipid production of C. vulgaris under nitrogen deficient conditions and implies a potential to combine phosphorus removal from wastewater with biodiesel production via microalgae. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The use of inexpensive vegetable oils as feedstock for biodiesel production is an effective way to reduce biodiesel costs. Here we report production and properties of biodiesel produced from Amygdalus pedunculata which is widespread in arid area in China. Biodiesel produced from A. pedunculata conformed EN 14214, ASTM D6751, and GB/T20828 standards, except for those cetane number and oxidative stability. Cold flow and transportation safety properties were excellent (cold filter plugging point -11. °C, flash point 169. °C). Additives and antioxidants would be required to meet cetane number and oxidative stability specifications. The addition of 500. ppm tert-butylhydroquinone resulted in a higher induction period (6.7. h), bringing oxidative stability into compliance with all three biodiesel standards. © 2012.

AB  - The yield of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) from microalgae biomass is generally low via traditional extraction-conversion route due to the deficient solvent extraction. In this study a two-step in situ process was investigated to obtain a high FAME yield from microalgae biomass that had high free fatty acids (FFA) content. This was accomplished with a pre-esterification process using heterogeneous catalyst to reduce FFA content prior to the base-catalyzed transesterification. The two-step in situ process resulted in a total FAME recovery up to 94.87. ±. 0.86%, which was much higher than that obtained by a one-step acid or base catalytic in situ process. The heterogeneous catalyst, Amberlyst-15, could be used for 8 cycles without significant loss in activity. This process have the potential to reduce the production cost of microalgae-derived FAME and be more environmental compatible due to the higher FAME yield with reduced catalyst consumption. © 2013.

AB  - In this work, 30 microalgae strains from 17 genera were investigated in regard to biomass productivity in photoautotrophic growth conditions, lipid amount, lipid quality and biomass degradability. Six strains could be identified with robust phototrophic growth properties and high biomass productivities equal or above 300mgl-1day-1. Anaerobic fermentation of the algal biomass was most efficient for the marine members of the genera Dunaliella and Navicula, while biogas production with the freshwater strains generally resulted in lower methane yields. Monoraphidium contortum was identified as promising candidate for liquid biofuel production, characterized by high biomass productivity during maximum growth (maximum increase of 896mg dry biomass weight (DW) l-1day-1) and a promising lipid profile. Neutral lipid production was strongly induced in M. contortum by nitrogen deficient conditions and accumulated to up to 20.4±2.2% of DW. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, the combustion characteristics of Diesel and biodiesel fuels are investigated and compared. Based on the experimental data obtained from a medium-duty Diesel engine, a multi-phase combustion model, which is applicable to both Diesel and biodiesel fuels, is developed and it shows satisfactory accuracy within the test range in this study. A preliminary ignition-delay correlation is established by considering not only the in-cylinder physical factors such as pressure and temperature, but also the fuel property variations. It is also capable of modeling the premixed and mixing-controlled combustion by using two cascaded Wiebe functions. Through a grey-box parameter identification approach, a set of Wiebe coefficients, which are partially physics-based, are found; then the model can have a reasonable accuracy for the range of experiments conducted. Based on the multi-phase model, prediction can be made for the CA50 (crank angle for 50% heat release), which is very important for combustion timing feedback control. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrophobic ionic liquids (ILs) based on cations with long alkyl side-chains (e.g. N-octadecyl-N′,N′′,N′′′- trimethylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([C18tma] [NTf2])) are switchable ionic liquid/solid phases with temperature that behave as sponges. As liquid phases, they are excellent monophasic reaction media for lipase-catalyzed methanolysis of triolein, resulting in fast and efficient biodiesel synthesis, e.g. up to 100% yield in 8 h at 60 °C, with exceptional enzyme stability (up to 1370 days half-life time at 60 °C). As solid phases, the reaction mixture can easily be fractionated by iterative centrifugations at controlled temperature into three phases, i.e. solid IL, glycerol and pure biodiesel. A straightforward and sustainable approach for producing biodiesel has been developed, allowing full recovery and reuse of the biocatalyst-IL system for successive cycles and suitable for scaling-up. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

AB  - To address the large energy consumption of microalgae dewatering and to simplify the conventional two-step method (cellular lipid extraction and lipid transesterification) for biodiesel production, a novel process for the direct conversion of wet microalgae biomass into biodiesel by microwave irradiation is proposed. The influences of conventional thermal heating and microwave irradiation on biodiesel production from wet microalgae biomass were investigated. The effects of using the one-step (simultaneous lipid extraction and transesterification) and two-step methods were also studied. Approximately 77.5% of the wet microalgal cell walls were disrupted under microwave irradiation. The biodiesel production rate and yield from wet microalgae biomass obtained through the one-step process using microwave irradiation were 6-fold and 1.3-fold higher than those from wet microalgae obtained through the two-step process using conventional heating. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Values of thermal expansion coefficients (b) were experimentally determined for three samples: a mineral diesel and two biodiesels constituted by either fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) or fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), from transesterification reactions using raw corn oil and ethyl or methyl alcohol. Values of b were found to be 8.36 (±0.06) 10 4 × °C 1, 8.43 (±0.09) × 10 4 °C 1 and 8.39 (±0.03) × 10 4 °C 1, respectively, within 95% of statistical confidence. The thermal expansion coefficients for biodiesels from corn are higher than that for the mineral diesel. The expansion coefficient is also a key parameter in modeling fuel injection system of internal combustion engines. Comparing the two sets of data, for fossil diesel and biodiesel provides essential information to support the design and optimization of more efficient engines. A higher value for the cubic expansion coefficient implies that less specific mass of fuel is injected at higher temperatures, which can cause a loss in engine power. This is a fundamental parameter, reinforcing further the interest to establish an algebraic model to estimate the specific mass for a biofuel as a function of temperature, which is thought to be significantly different from that more commonly used for the fossil diesel. Polynomial models for such a correction were determined in this work; resulting rates for diesel and for corn oil biodiesels, based on either fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) or fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE), were respectively -0.7089 kg m 3 T 1, -0.7323 kg m 3 T 1 and -0.7313 kg m 3 T 1. From the linear correlation between these data and those from standard EN 14214, values for the sensitivity (slope term) are seemingly small, or roughly 0.723, but are high enough to cause relatively large impacts, in financial terms, for cases involving considerably big volumes of biodiesel, in commercial transactions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A previous Iowa State University (ISU) analysis published in 2010 investigated the technical and economic feasibility of the fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing of biomass, and concluded that the pathway could produce cellulosic biofuels for a minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of $2.11/gal. The 2010 ISU study was largely theoretical in that no commercial-scale fast pyrolysis facilities were being constructed at the time of publication. The present analysis expands upon the 2010 ISU study by performing an updated techno-economic analysis of the fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing pathway. Recent advances in pathway technology and commercialization and new parameters suggested by the recent literature are accounted for. The MFSP for a 2000 MTPD facility employing fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing to convert corn stover to gasoline and diesel fuel is calculated to quantify the economic feasibility of the pathway. The present analysis determines the MFSP of gasoline and diesel fuel produced via fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing to be $2.57/gal. This result indicates that the pathway could be competitive with petroleum, although not as competitive as suggested by the 2010 ISU study. The present analysis also demonstrates the sensitivity of the result to process assumptions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of combustion phase and fuel on smoke particle emissions from a wood stove operated with three different wood fuels and from a corn stove were investigated. A singleparticle mass spectrometer (aerosol time of flight mass spectrometer (ATOFMS)) was used for time- And size-resolved chemical signatures and a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) was used for online mobility size distributions. Markers of particle phase organics and elemental carbon, PM 1.5, and CO emissions were strongly reduced for the corn stove compared to the wood stove. This is because the more controlled fuel and air supply in the corn stove result in more complete combustion. NOx emissions and particle phase phosphates showed the opposite trend.Marker ions and particle types associated with soot and alkali salts such as potassium chloride and potassium sulfates dominated during flaming combustion and were correlated with increased exhaust temperatures and reduced CO emissions. Marker ions of hydrocarbons and oxidized organics as well as a particle cluster type with a strong organic signature were associated with reduced combustion temperature and increased CO levels, observed during start up from cold stove, addition of fuel, and combustion with reduced air supply. Two different particle types were identified in corn experiments when particles were classified according to mobility before they were measured with the ATOFMS. "Less massive" particles contained mostly ash and soot and had vacuum aerodynamic diameters that were nearly independent of mobility diameter. "More massive" particles had aerodynamic diameters that increased linearly with mobility diameter, indicating approximately spherical shapes, and were hypothesized to consist of organics. © 2012.

AB  - Ca(Ac)2/ZnO was prepared by impregnation and with which CaO/ZnO was made by high temperature calcination. Effects of impregnating solution mass fraction, calcination temperature and calcination time on the catalytic activity of CaO/ZnO were investigated through orthogonal experiments. The transesterification of castor oil with methanol was studied by using CaO/ZnO as a catalyst, prepared under the optimal conditions. Ca(Ac)2/ZnO) and CaO/ZnO prepared at optimal conditions were characterized by TG-DTG, XRD, BET. The results showed that the suitable preparation conditions of CaO/ZnO was impregnating solution mass fraction 0.2, calcination temperature 973 K and calcination time 3 h. Under the conditions of alcohol/oil molar ratio 9, catalyst/oil mass ratio 0.03, reaction temperature 338 K and reaction time 4.5 h, castor oil conversion could reach 99.7%. There were two distinct weightless peaks at 690 K and 1020 K in TG-DTG curves of Ca (Ac)2/ZnO. CaO/ZnO and ZnO had the same crystalline structure, displaying CaO being utterly dispersed on ZnO. The surface area of CaO/ZnO was 6.10 m2g and its average pore radius was 2.59 nm.

AB  - Biodiesel is one of the alternative fuels which is renewable and environmentally friendly and can be used in diesel engines with little or no modifications. In the present study, experimental investigations were carried out on the effects of biodiesel types, biodiesel fraction and physical properties on the combustion and performance characteristics of a (compression ignition) CI engine. The experimental work was conducted on a four-cylinder, four-stroke, (direct injection) DI and turbo-charged diesel engine by using biodiesel of waste oil, rapeseed oil and corn oil and normal diesel. Based on the measured parameters, detailed analyses were carried out on cylinder pressure, heat release rate and (brake specific fuel consumption) BSFC. It has been seen that the biodiesel types do not result in any significant differences in peak cylinder pressure and BSFC. The results also clearly indicate that the engine running with biodiesel have slightly higher in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate than the engine running with normal diesel. The BSFC for the engine running with neat biodiesel was higher than the engine running with normal diesel by up to 15%. It is also noticed that the physical properties of the biodiesel affect significantly the performance of the engine. © 2013.

AB  - In this paper the hypothesis was tested whether TAG accumulation serves as an energy sink when microalgae are exposed to an energy imbalance caused by nutrient limitation. In our continuous culture system, excess light absorption and growth-limiting nitrogen supply rates were combined, which resulted in accumulation of TAG (from 1.5% to 12.4% w/w) in visible lipid bodies in Neochloris oleoabundans, while cell replication was sustained. A fourfold increase in TAG productivity showed that TAG indeed served as an energy sink. However, the bulk of excess energy was dissipated leading to a significantly reduced biomass productivity and yield of biomass on light. This demonstrates that when aiming at industrial TAG production, sustaining efficient light energy use under nutrient stress is an important trait to look for in potential production organisms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel production from microalgal biomass could be an alternative solution to conventional biofuels typically dependent on food and high land/water demanding crops. However, the economic and energetic viability of microalgal biofuels is limited by their harvesting processes. The finding of innovative, low cost and efficient harvesting method(s) is imperative. In this study, the Electro-Coagulation (EC) was studied as a process to harvest the marine Nannochloropsis sp. microalga. Several EC operational conditions were studied and the best EC recovery efficiency (&gt;97%) was achieved using a current density of 8.3mAcm-2 for 10min. The quality of the recovered microalgal biomass was evaluated in terms of total lipids, fatty acid and pigment profile where no significant differences were observed after EC treatment. The energy requirements of the harvesting process were estimated and the combination of EC and centrifugation processes proved to decrease significantly the energy demand when compared with the individual process. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present work aims to investigate an innovative application of natural clay as a catalyst for biofuel combustion. The mineralogical, chemical, thermal and textural characterizations of the natural clay suggest an intrinsic catalytic potential without any prior treatment. The catalytic performance was studied with respect to the combustion of n-butanol as a representative biofuel using different forms of the natural clay: fine powder, pressed pellets and extruded honeycomb monoliths. No major difference was found among these forms regarding texture, morphology and stability. In terms of performance, this clay proved competitive relative to cobalt oxide spinel, which is one of the most reactive non-noble transition metal oxides. The significant amount of naturally occurring transition metals such as iron and some elements considered as promoters in the clay were proposed to account for the catalytic properties. A systematic investigation of the catalytic performance of the clay as a function of the equivalence ratio and of the total flow rate was performed using gas-phase FTIR spectroscopy. Increase of the equivalence ratio at a fixed flow rate yielded a lower catalytic performance toward n-butanol combustion producing a consequent fraction of carbon monoxide and ethylene. At a constant equivalence ratio of 0.6, the performance of the clay was not affected by increasing the total inlet flow rate up to 30. sccm. These findings may initiate the development of a new catalyst for biofuel combustion based on relatively low-cost and abundantly available raw materials such as the natural clay investigated here. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas a member of the euphorbiaceae family is a multipurpose shrub of significant economic importance because of its several biofuel and medicinal uses. The seeds contain high oil, which can be used as fuel directly or as a substitute to diesel in the transesterified form. The seed cake can be a good protein source for humans as well as for livestock, but highly toxic to a number of animal species due to the presence of toxins and antinutrient components. There is a variation in toxic, antinutrient and nutrient components in toxic, non toxic, wild and cultivable varieties. Seed, seed cake, leaves, fruits, oil and latex samples of 15 cultivating J. curcas varieties were collected across the India for toxins, antinutrient and nutrient characterization. The average content of principal toxin phorbol esters is 7.70 mg/g in seed, 4.24 mg/g in seed cake, 2.9 mg/g in oil and 0.73 mg/g in latex. phorbol esters were not found in young leaves and concentration was found to be increasing in leaves and fruits as age increases till a month. Curcin, phytate, trypsin inhibitor, saponin and total phenols are less than the non toxic Mexican varieties. Total protein in seed is 21 to 30 %, whereas in screw pressed seed cake it is 25 to 34 %. With increase in protein content decrease in oil content was observed. Copyright © 2013 Asian Journal of Chemistry.

AB  - This paper presents measurements of the soot temperature and KL factor for biodiesel and diesel combustion in a constant volume chamber using a two-color technique. This technique uses a high-speed camera coupled with two narrowband filters (550. nm and 650. nm, 10. nm FWHM). After calibration, statistical analysis shows that the uncertainty of the two-color temperature is less than 5%, while it is about 50% for the KL factor. This technique is then applied to the spray combustion of biodiesel and diesel fuels under an ambient oxygen concentration of 21% and ambient temperatures of 800, 1000 and 1200. K. The heat release result shows higher energy utilization efficiency for biodiesel compared to diesel under all conditions; meanwhile, diesel shows a higher pressure increase due to its higher heating value. Biodiesel yields a lower temperature inside the flame area, a longer soot lift-off length, and a smaller soot area compared to diesel. Both the KL factor and the total soot with biodiesel are lower than with diesel throughout the entire combustion process, and this difference becomes larger as the ambient temperature decreases. Biodiesel shows approximately 50-100. K lower temperatures than diesel at the quasi-steady stage for 1000 and 1200. K ambient temperature, while diesel shows a lower temperature than biodiesel at 800. K ambient. This result may raise the question of how important the flame temperature is in explaining the higher NO. x emissions often observed during biodiesel combustion. Other factors may also play an important role in controlling NO. x emissions. Both biodiesel and diesel temperature measurements show a monotonic dependence on the ambient temperature. However, the ambient temperature appears to have a more significant effect on the soot formation and oxidation in diesel combustion, while biodiesel combustion soot characteristics shows relative insensitivity to the ambient temperature. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The extensive diversity of microalgae provides an opportunity to undertake bioprospecting for species possessing features suited to commercial scale cultivation. The outdoor cultivation of microalgae is subject to extreme temperature fluctuations; temperature tolerant microalgae would help mitigate this problem. The waters of the Roman Baths, which have a temperature range between 39°C and 46°C, were sampled for microalgae. A total of 3 green algae, 1 diatom and 4 cyanobacterial species were successfully isolated into 'unialgal' culture. Four isolates were filamentous, which could prove advantageous for low energy dewatering of cultures using filtration. Lipid content, profiles and growth rates of the isolates were examined at temperatures of 20, 30, 40°C, with and without nitrogen starvation and compared against the oil producing green algal species, Chlorella emersonii. Some isolates synthesized high levels of lipids, however, all were most productive at temperatures lower than those of the Roman Baths. The eukaryotic algae accumulated a range of saturated and polyunsaturated FAMEs and all isolates generally showed higher lipid accumulation under nitrogen deficient conditions (Klebsormidium sp. increasing from 1. 9% to 16. 0% and Hantzschia sp. from 31. 9 to 40. 5%). The cyanobacteria typically accumulated a narrower range of FAMEs that were mostly saturated, but were capable of accumulating a larger quantity of lipid as a proportion of dry weight (M. laminosus, 37. 8% fully saturated FAMEs). The maximum productivity of all the isolates was not determined in the current work and will require further effort to optimise key variables such as light intensity and media composition. © 2013 Smith-Bädorf et al.; licensee Springer.

AB  - We examine the community characteristics that lead to locating a biodiesel plant. Utilizing data that includes all biodiesel plants in the United States, we employ spatial econometrics to evaluate those characteristics that lead to a plant siting. While public policies associated with biofuels may be endogenous to location decisions, we find them unimportant except in the case of consumption mandates. Despite evidence of plant clusters, it does not appear that operating plants are critical to the siting of a new plant. Results provide insights for community leaders relative to actions that can increase the probability a plant will be built. © 2013 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.

AB  - Transesterification is a transformation with important industrial applications in areas related with polymers, coats, and fuels (fatty acids alkyl esters, biodiesel). This reaction occurs in the presence of catalysts and it is very important to control both the process parameters and the quality of raw materials. In this work the general remarks about transesterification and some examples of industrial processes based on this reaction are discussed, focusing on biodiesel production.

AB  - This paper evaluates the impact of alternative bus transit technologies including compressed natural gas, biodiesel, and diesel-electric hybrid on greenhouse gas emissions along a busy transit corridor using a lifecycle analysis approach. In addition, we compare the operational emissions of buses running on these technologies using an instantaneous speed and an average speed model. Our results indicate that operational emissions make-up the largest portion of lifecycle emissions. When comparing instantaneous and average speed emissions we find that both methods produce consistent results for diesel, however, the average speed method underestimates biodiesel emissions by 21% and overestimates compressed natural gas emissions by 16%. Bus technologies ranked in increasing order of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions are: hybrid, compressed natural gas, biodiesel, and conventional diesel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of low concentration biodiesel blends on the regulated, carbonyl and PAH emissions from a modern passenger vehicle. The vehicle was a Euro 4 compliant SUV type fitted with a common-rail diesel engine and a diesel oxidation catalyst. Emission and fuel consumption measurements were performed on a chassis dynamometer using a constant volume sampling (CVS) technique, following the European regulations. All measurements were conducted over the NEDC and Artemis driving cycles. Aiming to evaluate the fuel impact on emissions, a soy-based biodiesel was blended with an ultra low sulphur diesel at proportions of 10 and 30% by volume. The experimental results revealed that emissions of PM, HC and CO decreased with biodiesel over most driving conditions. Some increases were observed over the NEDC which may be attributed to the cold-start effect and to certain fuel characteristics. NOx emissions were found to be higher with biodiesel especially during Artemis operation. CO2 emissions and fuel consumption followed similar patterns and increased with biodiesel. Most carbonyl compound emissions increased with biodiesel, with the exception of aromatic aldehydes. It was found that carbonyl emissions decreased as the mean speed and load of the driving cycle was increased. Most PAH emissions were found to be lower with biodiesel, however, some increases were observed for certain toxic compounds. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This paper presents a techno-economic analysis of carbon-negative algal biodiesel production routes that use currently available technologies. The production process includes the following stages: carbon-neutral renewable electricity generation for powering the plant, algal growth in photobioreactors, algae dewatering and lipid extraction, and biofuel conversion and refining. As carbon dioxide is consumed in the algal growth process, side products are not burned (with CO2 release), and the energy supplied to the entire production process is obtained from concentrated solar power, the whole system is assumed carbon footprint negative. Under assumptions related to economics of scale, the techno-economic model is extended to account for varying industrial scales of production. Verified data from a selection of commercially available technologies are used as inputs for the model, and the economic viability of the various production routes is assessed. From the various routes investigated, one scheme involving combined gasification and Fischer-Tropsch of algal solids to produce biodiesel along with conversion of algal lipids into biodiesel through transesterification was found to be promising. Assuming a typical economic scaling factor of 0.8, an algal biodiesel process with an annual production rate of 100Mt/year is identified to achieve a biodiesel price comparable to the current conventional diesel price (approximately £1.39/litre at the pump, or $114/barrel of crude) with a discounted break-even time of 6years. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel from pure and used canola oil is produced by transesterification process in this study. Quality of biodiesel is examined according to ASTM 6751: biodiesel standards and testing methods. Important fuel properties of biodiesel, such as heating value, cetane index, viscosity, and others are also investigated. A direct injection (DI) diesel engine is tested with biodiesel-diesel and canola oil-diesel blends for performance and emissions at high idling operations. Three fuel series are examined: pure canola biodiesel, used canola biodiesel and pure canola oil series. In all the series, fuels are blended with petroleum diesel 2-20vol.%. Engine performance is examined by measuring brake specific fuel consumption and fuel conversion efficiency. The emission of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon dioxide (CO2) and others are measured. Pure and used canola biodiesel blends show very similar fuel properties, engine performance and emissions. CO and HC emissions from biodiesel-diesel blends are significantly less than neat diesel fuel. Even pure canola oil up to 5% in diesel fuel can show significantly less CO emissions than that of diesel fuel. Up to 5% biodiesel and canola oil in diesel fuel, NOx emissions either can reduce or maintain similar level to that of diesel fuel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A well-to-wheels (WTW) analysis of pyrolysis-based gasoline was conducted and compared with petroleum gasoline. To address the variation and uncertainty in the pyrolysis pathways, probability distributions for key parameters were developed with data from literature. The impacts of two different hydrogen sources for pyrolysis oil upgrading and of two bio-char co-product applications were investigated. Reforming fuel gas/natural gas for H2 reduces WTW GHG emissions by 60% (range of 55-64%) compared to the mean of petroleum fuels. Reforming pyrolysis oil for H2 increases the WTW GHG emissions reduction up to 112% (range of 97-126%), but reduces petroleum savings per unit of biomass used due to the dramatic decline in the liquid fuel yield. Thus, the hydrogen source causes a trade-off between GHG reduction per unit fuel output and petroleum displacement per unit biomass used. Soil application of biochar could provide significant carbon sequestration with large uncertainty. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Three probiotic Lactobacillus strains, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, were tested for their ability to assimilate and metabolize glycerol. Biodiesel-derived glycerol was used as the main carbon and energy source in batch microaerobic growth. Here, we show that the tested strains were able to assimilate glycerol, consuming between 38 and 48 % in approximately 24 h. L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii showed a similar growth, higher than L. plantarum. The highest biomass reached was 2.11 g L-1 for L. acidophilus, with a cell mass yield (Y X/S) of 0.37 g g-1. L. delbrueckii and L. plantarum reached a biomass of 2.06 and 1.36 g L-1. All strains catabolize glycerol mainly through glycerol kinase (EC 2.7.1.30). For these lactobacillus species, kinetic parameters for glycerol kinase showed Michaelis-Menten constant (K m) ranging from 1.2 to 3.8 mM. The specific activities for glycerol kinase in these strains were in the range of 0.18 to 0.58 U mg protein-1, with L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 showing the maximum specific activity after 24 h of cultivation. Glycerol dehydrogenase activity was also detected in all strains studied but only for the reduction of glyceraldehyde with NADPH (K m for DL-glyceraldehyde ranging from 12.8 to 32.3 mM). This enzyme shows a very low oxidative activity with glycerol and NADP + and, most likely, under physiological conditions, the oxidative reaction does not occur, supporting the assumption that the main metabolic flux concerning glycerol metabolism is through the glycerol kinase pathway. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The aim of this work was firstly to do a precise thermal analysis of microwave assisted production of biodiesel. In this paper, the effective permittivity of biodiesel synthesis was updated with two methods: a traditional method and a bivariate function of temperature and concentration of one component, then the thermal analysis of the reaction process were accomplished with multi-physics calculation. The results show that there exists large distinction in temperature between these two simulation results calculated by the two methods. The two hot spots locate in the opposite side and their temperature's difference is up to 9. °C when the reaction is just carried out for 18. s. But the temperature risings and distributions calculated by the new method are closer to the measured results. The thermal analysis based on the new method will be helpful for the industrial design of biodiesel production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Culture conditions including nitrogen source and concentration, xylose concentration, and inoculum level were evaluated for the effect on cell growth and lipid production of an oleaginous fungus, Mortierella isabellina, grown on xylose. Yeast extract and ammonium sulfate were found to be the best amongst the organic and inorganic nitrogen sources tested, respectively. Subsequent combination of these two nitrogen sources at a nitrogen ratio of 1:1 further enhanced lipid production. The highest cell biomass 28.8gL-1 and lipid 18.5gL-1 were obtained on a medium containing 100gL-1 xylose and 50.4mM nitrogen with a spore concentration of 108mL-1. Specifically, nitrogen concentration and inoculum level were demonstrated to be important for obtaining a high lipid yield on xylose consumed of 0.182gg-1. The results suggest that M. isabellina holds great potential to be a candidate for biofuel production from xylose, the second most abundant sugar from lignocellulose. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Levoglucosan is the major anhydrosugar component of bio-oil produced by fast pyrolysis. Previous research has shown that levoglucosan yield can be greatly increased if a mild acid pretreatment is applied to demineralize the feedstock prior to pyrolysis. The interest in levoglucosan production is that it provides a route to production of monomeric sugars, primarily glucose, which can be utilized to produce biochemically derived fuels (ethanol, butanol, etc.). This study developed a new method based on pyrolysis of clear pinewood particles with dilute acid pretreatment and modification in the pyrolysis process by applying a water spray injection directly into the pyrolysis vapor stream. This new method resulted in a significant 30.7% increase in levoglucosan weight percentage based on the bio-oil organic portion. The results indicated that this rapid quenching in pyrolysis vapor stream successfully suppressed the levoglucosan decomposition in both the vapor stream and during condensation. This increase may change the process economics of production of anhydrosugars via pyrolysis. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An active heterogeneous Al2O3 modified MgZnO (MgZnAlO) catalyst was prepared and the catalytic activity was investigated for the transesterification of different vegetable oils (refined palm oil, waste cooking palm oil, palm kernel oil and coconut oil) with methanol to produce biodiesel. The catalyst was characterized by using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectra, thermo gravimetric and differential thermal analysis to ascertain its versatility. Effects of important reaction parameters such as methanol to oil molar ratio, catalyst dosage, reaction temperature and reaction time on oil conversion were examined. Within the range of studied variability, the suitable transesterification conditions (methanol/oil ratio 16:1, catalyst loading 3.32 wt.%, reaction time 6h, temperature 182°C), the oil conversion of 98% could be achieved with reference to coconut oil in a single stage. The catalyst can be easily recovered and reused for five cycles without significant deactivation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel, produced by enzymatic transesterification of cottonseed oil with methanol in a green, zero waste discharge process, was purified to meet the international specifications. Glycerol was recovered by gravity separation and unutilized methanol was recycled after distillation. The methyl ester content of the purified product was found to be almost 90%. The fuel properties of the product and its blends with petroleum diesel were in well accordance with the international standards. The performance characteristics of the diesel engine with the blends (B10 and B20) were comparable to that of diesel in terms of brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The emission characteristics of the engine with the blends were such that significant environmental benefits could be accrued, as the average emissions of CO, CO2, smoke and un-burned hydrocarbons (HCs) got considerably reduced by 33.3%, 8.4%, 43.4% and 29.4% respectively. However, in case biodiesel, relatively higher levels of NOX emission can be attributed to the inherent oxygen of biodiesel. Thus, the B10 and B20 products based on biodiesel from the green process showed comparable engine performance with better green house gas emission characteristics and hence, deserve the status of an efficient environment friendly bio-additive for diesel engines. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The worldwide energy demand has been continuously increasing, thus requesting more sustainable alternatives to the rapidly depleting fossil fuels. Therefore, biofuels such as hydrogen, bioethanol and biodiesel are gaining more importance as a renewable and pollution-free solution, which might give a significant contribution to the future energy mix. In recent years, the exponential growth of biodiesel production has led to a glycerol glut, however, according to some authors, crude glycerol might represent a suitable, abundant and low-priced feedstock for fermentation technologies. In this study we performed an energetic and economic assessment of an innovative process, which is under development in our lab, for the bioconversion of crude glycerol into ethanol and hydrogen. Ongoing experiments showed the possibility to reach at least 26g/L of ethanol, together with 9L of hydrogen, in non-sterile conditions and without nutrient supplements. Since kinetics and ethanol concentration need to be further improved, we performed this study with a view to evaluate the possibility of reaching economic viability. Results showed that with 26g/L of ethanol and a retention time as high as 120h, the calculated energy cost would be about 0.019€/kWhth and 0.057€/kWhel, considering the contribution of both, hydrogen and bioethanol. Moreover, bioethanol cost would be as low as 0.21€/L, even without taking into account the possible hydrogen revenues. These results are very promising and suggest that the process has reasonable chances to achieve economic viability, thus deserving further attention. The procedure followed in this work provided a realistic and concrete target to pursue in the future lab experiments, in order to bring this technology closer to the market. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Due to the foreseen scarcity of fossil fuels and the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, renewable biofuels are the focus of several current research projects. For a fuel design process for future combustors the description of the influence of functional groups on the ignition behaviour of fuels can be an important step. The present study presents new ignition delay time data at stoichiometric conditions for n-pentanol and n-hexanol both of which can be produced from renewable sources. Investigated pressures range from 9 to 30 bar. By using a shock tube and a rapid compression machine it was possible to investigate a wide range of temperatures between 640 and 1200 K. A detailed comparison of the ignition behaviour of C4-C10 n-alkanes and C4-C6 n-alcohols shows the general trends and influence of the alcoholroup. While for the alcohol fuels the reactivity is increased at high temperatures it is decreased for low temperatures in comparison to the alkanes. Furthermore, the influence of the alcohol group at lower temperatures seems to decrease for longer carbon chains so that a negligible influence of the alcohol group can be expected for very long carbon chains. © 2012 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - The flame chemistry of tetrahydropyran (THP), a cyclic ether, has been examined using vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV)-photoionization molecular-beam mass spectrometry (PI-MBMS) and flame modeling, motivated by the need to understand and predict the combustion of oxygen-containing, biomass-derived fuels. Species identifications and mole-fraction profiles are presented for a fuel-rich (U = 1.75), laminar premixed THP-oxygen-argon flame at 2.66 kPa (20.0 Torr). Flame species with up to six heavy atoms have been detected. A detailed reaction set was developed for THP combustion that captures relevant features of the THP flame quite well, allowing analysis of the dominant kinetic pathways for THP combustion. Necessary rate coefficients and transport parameters were calculated or were estimated by analogies with a recent reaction set [Li et al., Combust. Flame 158 (2011) 2077-2089], and necessary thermochemical properties were computed using the CBS-QB3 method. Our results show that under the low-pressure conditions, THP destruction is dominated by H-abstraction, and the three resulting THP-yl radicals decompose primarily by b-scissions to two- and four-heavy-atom species that are generally destroyed by b-scission, abstraction, or oxidation. © 2012 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - Excited-state species profiles and ignition delay times were obtained under dilute conditions (99% Ar) using a heated shock tube for methyl octanoate (C9H18O2), n-nonane (n-C9H 20), and methylcyclohexane (MCH) over a broad range of temperature and equivalence ratio (φ = 0.5, 1.0, 2.0) at pressures near 1 and 10 atm. Measurements were then extended to include two ternary blends of the fuels using 5% and 20% (vol.) of the methyl ester under stoichiometric conditions. Using three independently validated chemical kinetics mechanisms, a model was compiled to assess the influence of methyl ester concentration on ignition delay times of the ternary blends. Under near-atmospheric pressure, ignition delay times were of the following order for the pure fuels: methyl octanoate &lt; n-nonane &lt; methylcyclohexane. Experimental results indicate that the ignition behavior of the higher-order methyl ester approaches that of the higherorder linear alkane with increased pressure regardless of equivalence ratio. Methyl octanoate also displayed significantly lower pressure dependence relative to the linear alkane and the cycloalkane species. Both of these results are supported by model calculations. Blending of methyl octanoate with n-nonane and methylcyclohexane impacted ignition delay time results more strongly at 1.5 atm, yet had only a small effect near 10 atm for temperatures above 1400 K. The study provides the first shock-tube data for a ternary blend of a linear alkane, a cycloalkane, and a methyl ester. Ignition delay time measurements for the C9:0 methyl ester were also measured for the first time.

AB  - This paper discusses the development of and policy towards biodiesel fuel (BDF) in the East Asia Summit (EAS) region (hereafter East Asia), with a focus on activities related to harmonizing BDF standards. To minimize problems with engines arising from the use of BDF, most EAS countries have established national BDF standards. However, these diverse standards cause barriers for BDF trade, and act against the regional interest in maximizing benefits from BDF production and utilization. Therefore, the East Asian policy-makers decided to harmonize BDF standards and a regional benchmark standard has been published. Through a comparative review of existing national standards against the benchmark, it finds that the harmonization is beneficial economically, and feasible technically, but stalled practically due to a lack of political determination. The key message from this paper is a call for political determination in East Asia to implement the harmonization. The findings of this paper may supplement the literature, enhance understanding of the East Asian case, and provide lessons and implications that may be helpful in advancing similar harmonization elsewhere. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - While often thought of as a smoking drug, tobacco (Nicotiana spp.) is now considered as a plant of choice for molecular farming and biofuel production. Here, we describe a noninvasive means of deriving both the distribution of lipid and the microtopology of the submillimeter tobacco seed, founded on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology. Our platform enables counting of seeds inside the intact tobacco capsule to measure seed sizes, to model the seed interior in three dimensions, to quantify the lipid content, and to visualize lipid gradients. Hundreds of seeds can be simultaneously imaged at an isotropic resolution of 25 mm, sufficient to assess each individual seed. The relative contributions of the embryo and the endosperm to both seed size and total lipid content could be assessed. The extension of the platform to a range of wild and cultivated Nicotiana species demonstrated certain evolutionary trends in both seed topology and pattern of lipid storage. The NMR analysis of transgenic tobacco plants with seed-specific ectopic expression of the plastidial phosphoenolpyruvate/phosphate translocator, displayed a trade off between seed size and oil concentration. The NMR-based assay of seed lipid content and topology has a number of potential applications, in particular providing a means to test and optimize transgenic strategies aimed at the manipulation of seed size, seed number, and lipid content in tobacco and other species with submillimeter seeds.

AB  - Catalytic pyrolysis is a promising thermochemical conversion route for lignocellulosic biomass that produces chemicals and fuels compatible with current, petrochemical infrastructure. Catalytic modifications to pyrolysis bio-oils are geared towards the elimination and substitution of oxygen and oxygen-containing functionalities in addition to increasing the hydrogen to carbon ratio of the final products. Recent progress has focused on both hydrodeoxygenation and hydrogenation of bio-oil using a variety of metal catalysts and the production of aromatics from bio-oil using cracking zeolites. Research is currently focused on developing multi-functional catalysts used in situ that benefit from the advantages of both hydrodeoxygenation and zeolite cracking. Development of robust, highly selective catalysts will help achieve the goal of producing drop-in fuels and petrochemical commodities from wood and other lignocellulosic biomass streams. The current paper will examine these developments by means of a review of existing literature. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Biodiesel can be produced from vegetable oils, animal fats, and waste cooking oils by transesterification with ethanol (also called ethanolysis) in order to substitute fossil fuels. In this work, we were interested in the transesterification reaction of sunflower oil with ethanol, which leads to ethyl esters, used to date for applications principally in food and cosmetic industry. To open the application field to biofuels (to substitute current fuels resulting from fossil resources), the process efficiency has to be developed to be economically profitable. The batch reaction of vegetable oil ethanolysis was transposed to a micro-scaled continuous device (PFA tube of 508 μm internal diameter), inducing better heat and mass transfer. Study of the influence of the operational conditions (reactants flow, initial ethanol to oil molar ratio, temperature. . .) revealed the favourable reaction parameters necessary to reach high conversions and yields. In these conditions, it is possible to acquire kinetics data at the first seconds of the reaction, which was not feasible in a conventional batch process. These data were used to model occurring phenomena and to determine kinetic constants and transfer coefficients. The model was subsequently used to simulate reactions with other operational conditions. To acquire these data in microreactors, an on-line analysis method by Near InfraRed (NIR) spectroscopy was developed by using gas chromatography as a reference method. PLS models were then set up to quantify on-line the major compounds contents during the reaction.

AB  - Environmental burdens for the production and utilisation of biomethane vehicle fuel or a biohydrogen/biomethane blend produced from food waste or wheat feed, based on data from two different laboratory experiments, have been compared. For food waste treated by batch processes the two stage system gave high hydrogen yields (84.2l H2kg-1 VS added) but a lower overall energy output than the single stage system. Reduction in environmental burdens compared with diesel was achieved, supported by the diversion of waste from landfill. For wheat feed, the semi continuously fed two stage process gave low hydrogen yields (7.5l H2kg-1 VS added) but higher overall energy output. The process delivers reduction in fossil fuel burdens, and improvements in process efficiencies will lead to reduction in CO2 burdens compared with diesel. The study highlights the importance of understanding and optimising biofuel production parameters according to the feedstock utilised. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Glycerine is a chemical with a wide variety of uses. There are over 2000 known applications in cosmetics, foodstuffs, fine chemicals, and other industries. With the recent boom for liquid biofuels however, glycerine - which is a by-product mainly of biodiesel production - has become abundant. New uses for the chemical are being researched, but little attention has been paid to the production and supply of glycerine. This perspective shows that the development of liquid biofuels is a key point for the future glycerine market. Glycerine could become available in large volumes from the production not only of biodiesel but also bioethanol. Second-generation biofuels, cellulose-based bioethanol, and algal biodiesel will continue to produce large quantities of glycerine. However, new technology pathways such as glycerine-to-methanol and glycerine-to-ethanol could rapidly change the market situation. Instead of viewing glycerine as a waste, biofuel producers may come to view the by-product as a valuable resource for their own production processes. This could rapidly change the market situation for other industries which now rely on the glycerine supply from the biofuels industry. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This study proposed a novel way for global greenhouse gas reduction through reusing China's waste oil to produce biofuels. Life cycle greenhouse gas mitigation potential of aviation bio-kerosene and biodiesel derived from China's waste oil in 2010 was equivalent to approximately 28.8% and 14.7% of mitigation achievements on fossil-based CO2 emissions by Annex B countries of the Kyoto Protocol in the period of 1990-2008, respectively. China's potential of producing biodiesel from waste oil in 2010 was equivalent to approximately 7.4% of China's fossil-based diesel usage in terms of energy. Potential of aviation bio-kerosene derived from waste oil could provide about 43.5% of China's aviation fuel demand in terms of energy. Sectors key to waste oil generation are identified from both production and consumption perspectives. Measures such as technology innovation, government supervision for waste oil collection and financial subsidies should be introduced to solve bottlenecks. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - For the production of alternative fuels, biogenic residues and waste materials were thermochemically converted by fast pyrolysis in a joint project between the Deutsches Biomasseforschungszentrum (DBFZ) and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). Biogenic residues and wastes which are not used so far or which could be utilized more efficiently were studied to add to the line of feedstock for future thermochemical applications. Project work includes the investigation and selection of possible residual feedstock and its potential, conversion of several feedstocks (e.g. different varieties of straw, hay, waste wood, bark, driftwood) by fast pyrolysis, and energetic use of the products to generate electricity and heat. An ecological and economic evaluation was conducted for an integral view of the process and feedstock utilized. Besides research and experimental activities of the project, a database on biomass pyrolysis tests has been established for public use. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - To augment biomass and lipid productivities of heterotrophic cultured microalgae Chlorella sorokiniana, the influence of environmental temperature and medium factors, such as carbon source, nitrogen source, and their initial concentrations was investigated in this study. The microalga C. sorokiniana could tolerate up to 42°C and showed the highest growth rate of 1.60d-1 at 37°C. The maximum dry cell weight (DCW) and corresponding lipid concentration was obtained with 80gL-1 of initial glucose and 4gL-1 of initial KNO3 at 37°C. In 5-L batch fermentation, the DCW increased dramatically from 0.9gL-1 to 37.6gL-1 in the first 72h cultivation, with the DCW productivity of 12.2gL-1d-1. The maximum lipid content of 31.5% was achieved in 96h and the lipid productivity was 2.9gL-1d-1. The results showed C. sorokiniana could be a promising strain for biofuel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Raw Jatropha curcas oil is a promising feedstock for biodiesel, and its quality assessment is essential. The phosphorus content, especially that of organic phospholipids is one of the important quality parameters. Nevertheless, there is no standard method for measuring phospholipids directly, and the existing standards for content and measurement are for total phosphorus. In this study, a new method was developed to measure the content of inorganic phosphate in oil samples, by direct injection of solvent extracted oil into ion chromatography. Meantime, the total phosphorus content in oils was measured by the ISO 10540 standard molybdate colorimetric method, and the content of organic phospholipids can be derived by the difference between the total phosphorous and phosphate content. Various J. curcas seeds were obtained from the South-East Asia regions, and the raw oil therein was extracted and separated. Oils were dissolved in acetone and an ion chromatography system with sample matrix elimination function was applied to directly determine their phosphate content against acetone based standards. The results show that the J. curcas raw oils tested had phosphate contents ranging from 3 to above 50mgkg-1, and the total P content of 30 to over 400mgkg-1. Compared to the water-oil extraction procedure previously used for phosphate measurement in oil, this new method was simple, less labor-intensive, reasonably accurate and reliable for practical applications in biodiesel industries. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The boiling point and volatility are important properties for fuels, as it is for quality control of the industry of petroleum diesel and biofuels. In addition, through the volatility is possible to predict properties, such as vapor pressure, density, latent heat, heat of vaporization, viscosity, and surface tension of biodiesel. From thermogravimetry analysis it is possible to find the kinetic parameters (activation energy, pre-exponential factor, and reaction order), of thermally simulated processes, like volatilization. With the kinetic parameters, it is possible to obtain the thermodynamic parameters by mathematical formula. For the kinetic parameters, the minor values of activation energy were found for mineral diesel (E = 49.38 kJ mol-1), followed by babassu biodiesel (E = 76.37 kJ mol-1), and palm biodiesel (E = 87.00 kJ mol-1). Between the two biofuels studied, the babassu biodiesel has the higher minor value of activation energy. The thermodynamics parameters of babassu biodiesel are, ΔS = -129.12 J mol-1 K-1, ΔH = +80.38 kJ mol-1 and ΔG = +142.74 kJ mol-1. For palm biodiesel ΔS = -119.26 J mol-1 K-1, ΔH = + 90.53 kJ mol-1 and ΔG = +141.21 kJ mol-1, and for diesel ΔS = -131.3 J mol-1 K -1, ΔH = +53.29 kJ mol-1 and ΔG = +115.13 kJ mol-1. The kinetic thermal analysis shows that all E, ΔH, and ΔG values are positive and ΔS values are negative, consequently, all thermodynamic parameters indicate non-spontaneous processes of volatilization for all the fuels studied. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - A nonlinear optimization model is developed in this work to analyze biodiesel-ethanol-diesel (BED) ternary blending processes. The model establishes optimal blends to improve the system profitability given production costs, market demand, and fuel prices while meeting multiple property criteria such as kinematic viscosity, density, lower heating value, cloud point, cetane number, fuel stability and sulfur content. Pertinent fuel mixing rules for predicting the fuel properties of BED blends were extrapolated from previous works and applied as constraints to the present model. Several dynamic and/or uncertainty factors were explored in further depth to quantify their impacts on the fuel composition of BED blends including petro-diesel supply reduction, diesel production cost, diesel blends market retail price, and policy changes on bio-fuel subsidies. By examining key optimization sensitivity analysis such as shadow prices and opportunity costs, the crucial limits or constraints on fuel specifications can be identified and used to proactively identify and promote the development of potential additives. The model also suggests the government policy of simultaneously implementing bio-fuel tax credits and mandates may not have a higher contribution to promoting bio-fuel production than the case only with tax credits for the firms with the goal of profit maximization. The firms enable 5-8% increase of the optimal profit from BED blends by utilizing ethanol derived from food waste feedstocks instead of edible biomass. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Beside their essential cellular functions, isoprenoids have value as pharmaceuticals, nutriceuticals, pesticides, and fuel alternatives. Engineering microorganisms for production of isoprenoids is relatively easy, sustainable, and cost effective in comparison to chemical synthesis or extraction from natural producers. We introduced genes encoding carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes into the haploid yeast deletion collection to identify gene deletions that improved isoprenoid production. Deletions that showed significant improvement in carotenoid production were further screened for production of bisabolene, an isoprenoid alternative to petroleum-derived diesel. Combining those deletions with other mevalonate pathway modifications increased production of bisabolene from 40. mg/L to 800. mg/L in shake-flask cultures. In a fermentation process, this engineered strain produced 5.2. g/L of bisabolene. © 2012.

AB  - Global biodiesel production is continuously increasing and it is proportionally accompanied by a huge amount of crude glycerol (CG) as by-product. Due to its crude nature, CG has very less commercial interest; although its pure counterpart has different industrial applications. Alternatively, CG is a very good carbon source and can be used as a feedstock for fermentative hydrogen production. Further, a move of this kind has dual benefits, namely it offers a sustainable method for disposal of biodiesel manufacturing waste as well as produces biofuels and contributes in greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. Two-stage fermentation, comprising dark and photo-fermentation is one of the most promising options available for bio-hydrogen production. In the present study, techno-economic feasibility of such a two-stage process has been evaluated. The analysis has been made based on the recent advances in fermentative hydrogen production using CG as a feedstock. The study has been carried out with special reference to North American biodiesel market; and more specifically, data available for Canadian province, Québec City have been used. Based on our techno-economic analysis, higher production cost was found to be the major bottleneck in commercial production of fermentative hydrogen. However, certain achievable alternative options for reduction of process cost have been identified. Further, the process was found to be capable in reducing GHG emissions. Bioconversion of 1 kg of crude glycerol (70 % w/v) was found to reduce 7.66 kg CO2 eq (equivalent) GHG emission, and the process also offers additional environmental benefits. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Purpose: Biofuels have received special research interest, driven by concerns over high fuel prices, security of energy supplies, global climate change as well as the search of opportunities for rural economic development. This work examines the production of biodiesel derived from the transesterification of crude rapeseed oil, one of the most important sources of biodiesel in Europe, paying special attention to the environmental profile-associated to the manufacture life cycle (i.e., cradle-to-gate perspective). Methods: To do so, a Spanish company with an average annual biodiesel production of 300,000 t was assessed in detail. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study covers the whole life cycle, from the production of the crude rapeseed oil to the biodiesel production and storage. The inventory data for the foreground system consisted of average annual data obtained by on-site measurements in the company, and background data were taken from databases. Seven impact categories have been assessed in detail: abiotic depletion, acidification, eutrophication, global warming, ozone layer depletion, land competition, and photochemical oxidant formation. An energy analysis was carried out based on the cumulative nonrenewable fossil and nuclear energy demand as an additional impact category. Furthermore, well-to-wheels environmental characterization results were estimated and compared per ton-kilometer for the biodiesel (B100) and the conventional diesel so as to point out the environmental drawbacks and strengths of using biodiesel as transport fuel in a 28 t lorry. Results and discussion: The results showed that the cultivation of the rapeseed was the main key issue in environmental terms (68 %-100 % depending on the category) mainly because of fertilizer doses and intensive agricultural practices required. With regard to the biorefinery production process, pretreatment and transesterification sections considerably contribute to the environmental profile mostly due to electricity and chemical requirements. Concerning the well-to-wheels comparison, using B100 derived from rapeseed oil instead of petroleum-based diesel would reduce nonrenewable energy dependence (-20 %), GHG emissions (-74 %), and ozone layer depletion (-44 %) but would increase acidification (+59 %), eutrophication (+214 %), photochemical smog (+119 %), and land competition. Conclusions: The information presented in this study could help to promote the use of renewable transport biofuels. However, the extensive implementation of biodiesel (particularly rapeseed oil-derived biodiesel) in our society is enormously complex with many issues involved not only from environmental but also economical and social points of view. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Solid wastes of organic origins are potential feedstocks for the production of liquid biofuels, which could be suitable alternatives to fossil fuels for the transport and heating sectors, as well as for industrial use. By hydrothermal liquefaction, the wet biomass is partially transformed into a water-immiscible, oil-like organic matter called bio-oil. In this study, an integrated NMR spectroscopy/mass spectrometry approach has been developed for the characterization of the hydrothermal liquefaction of bio-oil at the molecular level. 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy were used for the identification of functional groups and gauging the aromatic carbon content in the mixture. GC-MS analysis revealed that the volatile fraction was rich in fatty acids, as well as in amides and esters. High-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) has been applied in a systematic way to fully categorize the bio-oil in terms of different classes of components, according to their molecular formulas. Most importantly, for the first time, by using this technique, and for the liquefaction bio-oil characterization in particular, FT-MS data have been used to develop a methodology for the determination of the aromatic versus aliphatic carbon and nitrogen content. It is well known that, because they resist hydrogenation and represent sources of polluting species, both aromatic molecules and nitrogen-containing species raise concerns for subsequent upgrading of bio-oil into a diesel-like fuel. From waste to fuel: Liquefaction bio-oils can be used as fuel in engines to produce heat and electricity or be upgraded as replacements for diesel and gasoline fuels. An integrated approach based on NMR spectroscopy and MS data is used to characterize a bio-oil obtained from the hydrothermal liquefaction of municipal organic wastes (see picture).

AB  - Women and children in developing countries are often exposed to high levels of air pollution including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which may negatively impact their health, due to household combustion of biomass fuel for cooking and heating. We compared creatinine adjusted hydroxy-PAH (OH-PAH) concentrations in pregnant women in Trujillo, Peru who cook with wood to levels measured in those who cook with kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas or a combination of fuels. Seventy-nine women were recruited for the study between May and July 2004 in the first trimester of their pregnancy. Urine samples were collected from the subjects in the first, second and third trimesters for OH-PAH analyses. The concentrations of the OH-PAHs were compared across the type of fuel used for cooking and pregnancy trimesters. The relationships between OH-PAHs levels in the first trimester and concurrently measured personal exposures to PM2.5, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide together with their indoor and outdoor air concentrations were also investigated. Women cooking with wood or kerosene had the highest creatinine adjusted OH-PAH concentrations compared with those using gas, coal briquette or a combination of fuels. Concentrations of creatinine adjusted 2-hydroxy-fluorene, 3-hydroxy-fluorene, 1-hydroxy-fluorene, 2-hydroxy-phenanthrene and 4-hydroxy-phenanthrene were significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) in women who used wood or kerosene alone compared with women who used liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), coal briquette or a combination of fuels. An increase in the concentrations of creatinine adjusted 9-hydroxy-fluorene, 1-hydroxy-phenanthrene, 2-hydroxy-phenanthrene, 4-hydroxy-phenanthrene and 1-hydroxy-pyrene in the third trimesters was also observed. Weak positive correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient, ρ&lt;0.4; p&lt;0.05) was observed between all first trimester creatinine adjusted OH-PAHs and indoor (kitchen and living room), and personal 48-h TWA PM2.5. Women who cooked exclusively with wood or kerosene had higher creatinine adjusted OH-PAH levels in their urine samples compared to women who cooked with LPG or coal briquette. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lipase-displaying whole cells appear to be efficient biocatalysts because of their low preparation costs and simple recycling procedure. The combined utilization of. Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) and. Rhizomucor miehei lipase (RML), separately displayed on. Pichia pastoris whole cells, to produce biodiesel in co-solvent media was investigated. A response surface methodology incorporating a D-optimal design was employed to obtain the optimum reaction conditions for methyl ester (ME) synthesis. The synergistic effect of the two displayed lipases and the use of tert-butanol and isooctane as the co-solvent media were found to significantly improve the transesterification reaction. Scaled-up reactions using various types of feedstock were carried out in a 0.5-l stirred reactor under optimum conditions, affording ME yields over 90% in 12 h. Moreover, the ME yields remained above 85% after 20 repeated batch cycles. In conclusion, this biocatalyst affords a promising route to efficient biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel, an alternative diesel fuel, comprising of alkyl monoesters of fatty acids obtained from contemporary feedstock such as vegetable oils, animal fats and waste cooking oils, has been the focus of a considerable amount of recent research. This interest is based on a number of benefits including the fact that it is renewable, biodegradable, non-toxic and has the potential to reduce certain exhaust emission. It is essential, while experimenting with abiodiesel, to strike a balance between the several conflicting parameters that might exist. This may include not only the performance and emission characteristics of the engine, but also the gross life of the engine system. In an automotive fuel system, mainly ferrous alloys, non-ferrous alloys and elastomers come in contact with the fuel. The degradation behaviour, occurring in relation to fossil fuels, has been sufficiently studied and documented. However, the impact of biodiesel on the degradation behaviour of fuel system materials has been rarely investigated. This paper aims to present a systematic retrospect of a total of 52 papers from the year 1995 to 2012 related to the compatibility of automotive materials with biodiesel, including some results obtained in-house.

AB  - Mahula (Madhuca latifolia L.) is a deciduous tree commonly found in the tropical rain forests of Asian and Australian continent. The tree species, however, has been domesticated by tribal people in India for use as food (flowers), feed (leaves and flowers), wood (timber), oil (seeds) and beverage (flowers) locally called 'mahuli'. The flowers of this tree are a rich source (40-60% on dry weight basis) of fermentable sugars (glucose and fructose). The tribals in India produce traditional country liquor called 'mahuli' by mixed culture of yeast fermentation of mahula flowers at home and semi- commercial levels for their ownconsumption. The flowers and seeds of mahula tree can be employed to produce bio-ethanol (from flowers) and bio-diesel (from seeds). Therefore, this review summarizes the progress made on agro-industrial technology for production of bio-fuels from mahula plants (flowers and seeds) and further its future perspectives.

AB  - In this study, a Taguchi method is used to determine the optimal combinations of concentrations for a diesel engine with diesel/biodiesel blend using H2 and cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) at the inlet port. The authors determined the optimal operating factors for achieving good combustion performance, low NOX and smoke, at various engine loads and at 1500rpm. Furthermore, the combustion performance and emissions are compared between the optimum combination factors and original baseline diesel engine. Experimental results show that predictions by Taguchi's parameter design technique are in adequate agreement with the confirmation results, with a confidence interval of 95%, and this technique saves 67% of the time taken to perform the experiment in this research. The best brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), NOX and smoke at each load is achieved for a combination of B20 (A2), 30% hydrogen (B3) and 40% EGR ratio (C3). Furthermore, the heat release rate with a variable specific heat ratio is calculated from the experimental cylinder pressure. This combination is more suitable for obtaining various parameters that affect the combustion performance such as the BTE, cylinder pressure, and heat release rate, than those of the baseline diesel engine for various loads. In addition, the best combination reduces the BSFC and inhibits both NOX and smoke emissions. At a load of 60%, the reduction rate is 25.4% for BSFC, 74.1% for NOX and 29.6% for smoke. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, diesel fuel, biodiesel, and biodiesel-ethanol blends (BEBs) were tested in a single cylinder direct-injection (DI) diesel engine to investigate the combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of the engine at the maximum torque and an engine speed of 1500 rpm. The results indicate that when compared with biodiesel, the combustion characteristics of BE blends changed; the engine performance has improved slightly with 5% ethanol in biodiesel (BEB5). The brake thermal efficiency increases slightly with lower blends and no significant improvement with higher ethanol blends. The effectiveness of NOx and smoke density increases with increasing ethanol in the blends. With a high percentage of ethanol in the BE blends, the hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions could increase. But the use of BEB5 could reduce the HC and CO emissions as well. In general, the BE blends have lower NOx emissions, compared with biodiesel and diesel fuel. The smoke density decreases for lower ethanol blends compared with diesel and biodiesel fuel. On the whole, the BE blends give lower HC, CO, smoke density, and NOx emission compared with diesel fuel. But the additions of more ethanol with biodiesel have no significant improvement in the emission levels. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Fatty acid methyl esters derived from renewable sources such as vegetable oils has gained importance nowadays as an alternative fuel for diesel engines. The present study is aimed to produce biodiesel from non-edible oil (Karanja oil of Indian origin) both in batch and continuous reactors. The purpose of the study is the comparison of Karanja biodiesel production with different reactor types under variable reaction characteristics. Therefore, two types of continuous reactors were used: helical tube reactor and reactive distillation (RD) column. Experiments were carried out to obtain suitable operating parameters in batch-and continuous-flow reactors. For batch reactor, suitable operating conditions obtained are: 7:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, 0.8% (by weight of oil) catalyst (KOH), 65C reaction temperature, and 1-h reaction time, at which the maximum yield obtained is 96%. In continuous helical tube reactor, maximum yield of 92.6% was obtained at 6.6 mL/min of flow rate at the same operating conditions of batch reactor. In continuous RD column, maximum yield of biodiesel 96.6% was obtained at the same operating conditions except methanol-to-oil molar ratio (5:1) because of recycling of methanol into the column. The residence times in the helical tube reactor and RD column were 4 and 8 min, respectively, as compared to 1 h in the batch reactor for almost the same yield. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Oil-rich biomass has been produced from heterotrophic fed-batch and semi-continuous cultures of Chlorella protothecoides in conventional 2-L stirred-tank bioreactors (STBs). The process pH is controlled by injection of CO2 and pure glycerol is the main carbon source in the culture medium. Whereas a maximum biomass concentration of 64gL-1 was achieved in fed-batch mode, semi-continuous culture at a dilution rate of 0.2day-1 yielded the best average results, with biomass and saponifiable lipid (oil) productivities of 8.7 and 4.3gL-1day-1, respectively. Both operational modes resulted in a high saponifiable oil content (&gt;35% of dry biomass), with the highest value (around 50% of dry biomass) being obtained in semi-continuous mode. The unsaponifiable lipid content was always less than 8% (of dry biomass). These results are superior to those reported in the literature for glycerol but practically identical to those achieved with glucose. The major fatty acids (FAs) in the saponifiable lipid fraction were oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2), and palmitic (C16:0), which together accounted for around 89% of the total FA content. Oleic acid was the most abundant FA, accounting for &gt;60% of total FAs. Biodiesel was obtained using a modified process based on transesterification of wet biomass paste, with a recovery of nearly 97%. The biodiesel obtained complies with the specifications defined in current standards (ASTM Biodiesel Standard D6751in US and Standard EN 14214 in EU). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is being proposed as an efficient replacement for fossil fuels. However, because of the difference in chemical compositions between biodiesel and fossil fuels, the resistance of polymeric materials to biodiesel may not be the same as that of fossil fuels. Thus, the aim of this work is to evaluate the resistance of different nitrile rubber (NBR) samples when in contact with biodiesel samples obtained separately from coconut oil and castor bean oil. The samples with lower acrylonitrile compositions (28 and 33%) exhibited low resistance to both pure biofuels. On the other hand, the mechanical properties of the NBR sample comprising 45% acrylonitrile appeared unchanged even after immersion in biodiesel oils. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In a bid to increase the cost competitiveness of biodiesel production against mineral diesel, process intensification has been studied for numerous biodiesel processing technologies. Subsequently, reactive extraction or in situ transesterification is actively being explored in which the solid oil-bearing seeds are used as the reactant directly with short-chain alcohol. This eliminates separate oil extraction process and combines both extraction and transesterification in a single unit. Supercritical reactive extraction takes one step further by substituting the role of catalyst with supercritical conditions to achieve higher yield and shorter processing time. In this work, supercritical reactive extraction with methanol was carried out in a high-pressure batch reactor to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from Jatropha curcas L. seeds. Material and process parameters including space loading, solvent to seed ratio, co-solvent (n-hexane) to seed ratio, reaction temperature, reaction time and mixing intensity were varied one at a time and optimized based on two responses i.e. extraction efficiency, Mextract and FAME yield, Fy. The optimum responses for supercritical reactive extraction obtained were 104.17% w/w and 99.67% w/w (relative to 100% lipid extraction with n-hexane) for Mextract and Fy respectively under the following conditions: 54.0ml/g space loading, 5.0ml/g methanol to seeds ratio, 300°C, 9.5MPa (Mega Pascal), 30min reaction time and without n-hexane as co-solvent or any agitation source. This proved that supercritical reactive extraction is rather promising as another alternative for biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas has been widely planted without knowing its standard package of practice for optimizing the yield. Therefore, a standardized agro-technology of Jatropha is required. With this purpose, in this study an elite accession of Jatropha was planted at seven sites in India, covering a range of edapho-climatic conditions. Three experimental trials (spacing, pruning and irrigation and fertilizer) were carried out wherein its growth and yield performance were assessed for five years (2007-2012) at all the sites. The growth characters like plant height and number of branches showed significant variations among the sites and the effects of treatments were not uniform across the sites, indicating that site-specific package of practices should be followed instead of adopting the general recommendations. The seed yield was disappointing to recommend it randomly for large scale plantations on degraded lands in India. But results from the multi-location trials have shown good prospects at semi-arid (Bhavnagar) and drylands (Hyderabad); where plants in close spacing (2 × 2 m) produced significantly higher seed yield per unit area upto 1.4 t ha-1 (Bhavnagar) in comparison to wide spacing. Pruning showed a negative effect on seed yield during initial five years. We found that the following prescription was sufficient to optimize the yield on India's degraded soils: irrigation at a 30 day interval, and for each planting hole 2 kg of Farm Yard Manure (organic manure) and nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium at 10 g, 20 g, and 10 g, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bio-oil produced via fast pyrolysis of biomass has the potential to be processed in a FCC (fluid catalytic cracking) unit to generate liquid fuel. However, this oil requires a significant upgrade to become an acceptable feedstock for refinery plants due to its high oxygen content. One promising route to improve the quality of bio-oil is to pyrolyse the parent biomass in the presence of a catalyst. This work investigates the influence of faujasite catalysts on the pyrolysis of pinewood. Pyrolysis process with Na-faujasite, Na0.2H0.8-faujasite, and H-faujasite (Na-FAU, Na0.2H0.8-FAU, and H-FAU) were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor at 500 °C. It is shown that, in the same condition, catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis vapour is superior to in-situ catalytic pyrolysis of biomass when it comes to quality of bio-oil. The yields of coke, gas and water increase while that of organic phase decreases proportional with the concentration of protons in catalysts. Compared to the other two catalysts, Na0.2H0.8-FAU removes the most oxygen from bio-oil, reduces amount of acids and aldehydes/ketones which result in a higher energy-contained and more stable oil with less corrosive property. However, the biggest contribution to the oxygen removal is via the formation of reaction water, which is not an optimum path. This leaves space for future development. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The production of biofuels from microalgae, especially biodiesel, has become a topic of great interest in recent years. However, many of the published papers do not consider the question of scale up and the feasibility of the various processes to be operated at the very large scale required if algal biofuels are to make a meaningful contribution to renewable fuels. All the steps in the process must also be very low cost. This paper discusses the unit processes required for algal biofuels production (i. e., growing the algae, harvesting, dewatering, extraction and conversion to biofuel) and their scalability. In many cases, especially in the lipid extraction step, little is known as yet as to the scalability and economic feasibility of the various processes proposed. We also highlight the key engineering and biological issues which must be resolved for the production of biofuels from microalgae to become an economic reality. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This work reviews retrofitting new waste energy, carbon and water intensive technologies into existing industrial facilities (including electricity generators) to increase net energy, carbon, and water use efficiencies. The three applications reviewed are microalgal ponds consuming flue gasses and providing thermal power station cooling services, thermally driven membrane distillation desalination, and hydrometallurgical solution mining processes to indirectly remove water contaminants, and additional power station cooling. The aim of this work is to explore the unique challenge of site-specificity of retrofitting any or all of the reviewed technologies within existing facilities for commercial operations. The theoretical basis behind higher aggregated efficiencies is essentially vertical integration of infrastructure, energy, and material flows, reducing total costs, net waste, and associated potential environmental contamination. Whilst solution mining and some thermal desalination technologies are not necessarily new in isolation, new technical developments enable these technologies to use waste heat and waste water by operating in parallel with industrial facilities, and effectively subsidise microalgae biofuel water pumping and dewatering. This research determines three fundamental developments are required to enable wide-scale industrial co-located vertical integration efficiencies: (1) fundamental engineering, (2) monitoring system innovation, and (3) technology/knowledge transfer. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Initial process studies carried out in Aspen Plus on an integrated thermochemical conversion process are presented herein. In the simulations, a hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) plant is combined with a biogas plant (BP), such that the digestate from the BP is converted to a biocrude in the HTL process. This biorefinery concept offers a sophisticated and sustainable way of converting organic residuals into a range of high-value biofuel streams in addition to combined heat and power (CHP) production. The primary goal of this study is to provide an initial estimate of the feasibility of such a process. By adding a diesel-quality-fuel output to the process, the product value is increased significantly compared to a conventional BP. An input of 1000kgh-1 manure delivers approximately 30-38kgh-1 fuel and 38-61kgh-1 biogas. The biogas can be used to upgrade the biocrude, to supply the gas grid or for CHP. An estimated 62-84% of the biomass energy can be recovered in the biofuels. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Algae biomass is an attractive biofuel feedstock when grown with high productivity on marginal land. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) produces more oil from algae than lipid extraction (LE) does because protein and carbohydrates are converted, in part, to oil. Since nitrogen in the algae biomass is incorporated into the HTL oil, and since lipid extracted algae for generating heat and electricity are not co-produced by HTL, there are questions regarding implications for emissions and energy use. We studied the HTL and LE pathways for renewable diesel (RD) production by modeling all essential operations from nutrient manufacturing through fuel use. Our objective was to identify the key relationships affecting HTL energy consumption and emissions. LE, with identical upstream growth model and consistent hydroprocessing model, served as reference. HTL used 1. 8 fold less algae than did LE but required 5. 2 times more ammonia when nitrogen incorporated in the HTL oil was treated as lost. HTL RD had life cycle emissions of 31,000 gCO2 equivalent (gCO2e) compared to 21,500 gCO2e for LE based RD per million BTU of RD produced. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increased when yields exceeded 0. 4 g HTL oil/g algae because insufficient carbon was left for biogas generation. Key variables in the analysis were the HTL oil yield, the hydrogen demand during upgrading, and the nitrogen content of the HTL oil. Future work requires better data for upgrading renewable oils to RD and requires consideration of nitrogen recycling during upgrading. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - Animal fat residues (AFR) from waste water were used as feedstock to produce biodiesel by a two-step acid-catalyzed process. Treatment of the AFRs with 5.4% (w/w) of 17M H2SO4 at a methanol/AFR ratio of 13:1 (50%w/w) at 60°C converted more than 95% of the triglycerides into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) with an acid value (AV) of 1.3mgKOH/gbiodiesel. Response surface methodology indicated that a lower AV cannot be reached using a one-step acid catalyzed process. Thus a two-step acid catalyzed process was employed using 3.6% catalyst and 30% methanol for 5h for the first step and 1.8% catalyst and 10% methanol for 1h in the second step, resulting in a yield higher than 98% and an AV of 0.3mgKOH/gbiodiesel. The product thus conforms to the European norm EN14214 concerning biodiesel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An optimization-based process synthesis framework is proposed for the thermochemical conversion of biomass to liquid fuels (BTL). Gasification of biomass is used to generate synthesis gas which can be converted to raw hydrocarbons either directly using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis or indirectly using catalytic conversion of methanol over ZSM-5. Multiple technologies are considered for generation of the raw hydrocarbons including (i) six types of Fischer-Tropsch units with different temperatures, catalyst types, and hydrocarbon effluent compositions, (ii) methanol conversion using methanol-to-gasoline, and (iii) methanol conversion using methanol-to-olefins. The hydrocarbons are upgraded into the final liquid fuel products (i.e., gasoline, diesel, and kerosene) using one or more technologies including ZSM-5 catalytic conversion, oligomerization, hydrocracking, isomerization, alkylation, and hydrotreating. A simultaneous heat, power, and water integration is included within the process synthesis framework to directly examine the costs associated with utility production and wastewater treatment with a particular topological design. A rigorous global optimization branch-and-bound strategy is implemented to mathematically guarantee the development of a BTL refinery that is economically and environmentally superior to all competing designs. Twenty-four case studies are investigated to determine the effect of refinery capacity, liquid fuel composition, and biomass feedstock on the overall system cost, the BTL refinery topological design, the process material/energy balances, and the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

AB  - Ethanol production from sugarcane under Brazilian conditions has resulted in positive economic, energetic and environmental indicators, primarily due to a high agro-industrial yield, recycling of by-products and bagasse utilization for power generation. Following the trends of improvement in the overall processes and increasing environmental constraints, the extensive use of labor and previous burning in sugarcane harvesting has been progressively replaced by mechanical harvesting without the need for burning. Currently, this operation is performed in three ways: manual harvesting with previous burning, mechanical harvesting with previous burning, and mechanical harvesting of green sugarcane. Generally, the main reason for use of previous burning in sugarcane fields is the elimination of straw to facilitate manual cutting. However, studies indicate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and, mainly, other pollutants. associated with this practice. In Brazil, specific environmental laws and protocols have established a progressive reduction in previous burning aimed at total elimination in the next decade. In addition, an increase in the use of mechanical harvesting due to high productivity compared with manual cutting has been observed. In this context, this study has estimated the specific GHG emissions (tonCO2eq/ha) in sugarcane harvesting as a function of the simultaneous reduction of previous burning and increase in the use of mechanization. The estimates were applied to the sugarcane harvesting area of the São Paulo State, which is responsible for approximately half of Brazilian production. Considering the period between 1990 and 2009, the GHG emissions from sugarcane fields were estimated considering the shares of areas with mechanical harvesting and previous burning use, agricultural yield, diesel consumption by machinery, and straw/stalk ratio. The estimation was carried out using two approaches: an estimation that considered only the share of areas with harvesting practices, and a complete estimation, in which all parameters were accounted for over the years. In a Business as Usual scenario (BAU), the specific GHG emissions progressed from 1.015 to 0.633tonCO2eq/ha using the first approach, and from 1.053 to 0.639tonCO2eq/ha with the second. The reduction represented a change of 37.6% and 39.3% in the last 20years, respectively. The progressive decrease in previous burning was determining factor for this observation, responsible for an average of 80% of total emissions from harvesting operations. Two additional Reference Scenarios were considered: the sugarcane was manually harvested in the first scenario and mechanically harvested in the second. When compared with the BAU scenario, the average reduction of GHG emissions was 17.4% and 26.7%, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study is performed to investigate the combustion characteristics and emissions formation processes of biodiesel fuels in a light-duty diesel engine. A compact reaction mechanism with 80 species and 303 reactions is used to account for the effects of chemical kinetics. Here, the mechanism is capable of emulating biodiesel-diesel mixture of different blending levels and biodiesel produced from different feedstock. The integrated CFD-kinetic model was validated against a test matrix which covers the entire saturated-unsaturated methyl ester range typical of biodiesel fuels, as well as the biodiesel-diesel blending levels. The simulated cases were then validated for in-cylinder pressure profiles and peak pressure values/timings. Errors in the peak pressure values did not exceed 1%, while the variations in peak pressure timings were kept within 1.5 crank angle degree (CAD). For this reported work, in-cylinder formation mechanisms of nitrogen monoxide (NO) and soot from the combustion of biodiesel fuels such as coconut methyl ester (CME), palm methyl ester (PME) and soybean methyl ester (SME) were simulated and compared against that of the baseline diesel fuel. It is established here that an increase in the degree of unsaturation in biodiesel fuels can have detrimental effects on engine-out NO and soot concentrations. Biodiesel fuel with greater unsaturation level such as SME has the predisposition to produce greater thermal NO due to larger regions of high temperature achieved during combustion. Besides, the highly unsaturated SME has greater tendencies to produce acetylene which are precursors for prompt NO and soot, leading to higher engine-out emissions of these pollutants. In all, this study has demonstrated the feasibility of integrating a compact multi-component surrogate fuel mechanism with CFD to elucidate the in-cylinder combustion and emissions characteristics of biodiesel fuels. The knowledge acquired here is useful for the development of biodiesel usage strategies in light-duty diesel engines for mass adoption. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - According to directives 2003/30/EC and 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and the Council, Member States should promote the use of biofuel. Consequently, since 2011 all fuels on the market used for transport purpose must contain a fraction of 5.75% renewable energy sources. Ethanol in gasoline is a promising solution to reach this objective. In addition to decrease the dependence on fossil fuel, ethanol contributes to reducing air pollutant emissions during combustion (carbon monoxide and total hydrocarbons), and has a positive effect on greenhouse gas emissions. These considerations rely on numerous emission studies performed in standard conditions (20-30 °C), however, very few emission data are available for cold ambient temperatures, as they prevail in winter times in e.g., Northern Europe. This paper presents a chassis dynamometer study examining the effect of ethanol (E75-E85) versus gasoline (E5) at standard and low ambient temperatures (22 °C and -7 °C, respectively). Emissions of modern passenger cars complying with the latest European standards (Euro4 and Euro5a) were recorded over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the Common Artemis Driving Cycle (CADC). Unregulated compounds such as methane, ammonia, and small chain hydrocarbons were monitored by an online Fourier Transformed Infra-Red spectrometer. In addition, a number of ozone precursors (carbonyls and volatile organic hydrocarbons) were collected and analyzed offline by liquid and gas chromatography in order to evaluate the ozone formation potential (OFP) of the exhaust. Results showed higher unregulated emissions at -7 °C than at 22 °C, regardless of the ethanol content in the fuel blend. More carbonyls were associated with oxygenated fuel, and acetaldehyde emissions were found particularly enhanced at -7 °C with E75. In addition, elevated methane emission was measured at low ambient temperature when ethanol fuel was used. Moreover, the OFP of the exhaust gas at -7 °C increased with the amount of ethanol in gasoline when the cold start excess emissions were included. However, regardless of the ambient temperature, the ammonia and toluene emissions associated to E75-E85 were lower than with E5. © 2012.

AB  - In order to accurately simulate the fuel spray, atomization, combustion and emission formation processes of a diesel engine fueled with biodiesel, adequate knowledge of biodiesel's physical properties is desired. The objective of this work is to do a detailed physical properties prediction for the five major methyl esters of biodiesel for combustion modeling. The physical properties considered in this study are: normal boiling point, critical properties, vapor pressure, and latent heat of vaporization, liquid density, liquid viscosity, liquid thermal conductivity, gas diffusion coefficients and surface tension. For each physical property, the best prediction model has been identified, and very good agreements have been obtained between the predicted results and the published data where available. The calculated results can be used as key references for biodiesel combustion modeling. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Over decades, Thailand energy consumption has been concentrated in three main sectors, namely manufacturing, power and transportation. Energy consumption in transportation sector has also been dominated by road transport due to limited coverage by rail and water transportation. Hence, road transport has been a major contributor for greenhouse gas emission in Thailand over recent years. Along with global warming concern throughout the world, Thailand has taken various adaptation and mitigation measures, especially the strong policy push to use carbon-neutral biofuel in transportation sector due to Thailand competitive advantage in agriculture sector. National Renewable Energy Plan (2008-2022) has set challenging targets of 9 and 4.5 million liters/day of ethanol and biodiesel consumption by 2022, respectively. Various blends of ethanol in gasoline (10%, 20% and 85%) and biodiesel in diesel (up to 5%) have been commercially available. However, since current consumption of diesel is twice as much of gasoline, ethanol blend in gasoline would widen the imbalance consumption of gasoline and diesel. The present study however offers an insight into a possibility to use ethanol as diesel substitute. A case study of ethanol bus technology was investigated by recourse to energy demand modeling. Necessary data, such as a number of vehicles (NVs) for various vehicle types, vehicle kilometer of travel (VKT) and fuel economy (FE) were collected, with reasonable assumptions made for those unavailable data, to construct predicative energy demand model. Scenario analysis on ethanol bus introduction was conducted to assess reduction of fossil fuel and greenhouse gas emission by increasing the use of ethanol to achieve ethanol consumption target in 2022. Successful demonstration of ethanol bus operation in Thailand will be briefly mentioned to give confidence for larger project implementation in the future. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The biorefinery of the future will be an integrated complex that makes a variety of products (e.g., biofuels, chemicals, power and protein) from a variety of feedstocks. The objective of this work was to evaluate the environmental benefits, compared to the traditional sugarcane ethanol system, of the integrated production of ethanol and biodiesel through a sugarcane-soybean biorefinery concept in Brazil. The environmental aspects considered here were the fossil energy use and the greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions associated with ethanol production. In the Integrated System, soybean would be cultivated in part of the sugarcane reforming areas, which represents ∼17% of the total sugarcane area. Sugarcane and soybean oil would be processed in a combined ethanol-biodiesel plant, which would use only bagasse as fuel. All the demand for utilities of the biodiesel plant would be provided by the distillery. The output products of the combined plant would comprise sugarcane ethanol, soybean biodiesel (which would be used as diesel (B5) substitute in the sugarcane cultivation), bioelectricity and glycerin. The results indicate that the Integrated System can reduce the fossil energy consumption from 75 to 37kJ/MJ of ethanol, when compared to the traditional system. For GHG emissions, the value would drop from 22.5 to 19.7g CO2eq/MJ of ethanol. This analysis shows that the Integrated System is an important option to contribute to ethanol's life cycle independence from fossil resources. This is an attractive environmental aspect, but socio-economic (as well as other environmental) aspects should also be analyzed in order to assess the sustainability of such systems in a broader perspective. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The paper describes the results of a co-operative research project aimed at the energetic exploitation of the biodiesel derived glycerol. The research objective is the definition and validation of a synthesis process for conversion of glycerol in an oxygenated fuel additive (glycerol alkyl-ether) suitable for blending with diesel and biodiesel. The employed facilities, methodologies and first results from engine tests are described, including a preliminary Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).Etherification of glycerol with tert-butyl alcohol and isobutylene allowed to identify the suitable experimental conditions required to obtain a mixture predominantly composed of higher glycerol ethers (GEM). Novel catalysts, based on perfluorosulphonic ionomers as active species and spherical silica as support, were found to be stable and easy reusable allowing to obtain mixtures containing very low amount of monoethers and oligomers considered as undesired products. Engine tests with blends of GEM in diesel fuels revealed good combustion and emission performances when compared both to neat diesel fuel and a blend diesel/biodiesel. LCA analysis indicates that the GEM/diesel blend generates an environmental impact which is lower than the one of neat diesel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The main objective of rapeseed oil hydrogenation tests was the production of liquid bio-chemicals to be used as renewable raw material for the production of several chemicals and in chemical synthesis to substitute petroleum derived stuff. As, hydrogenation of vegetable oils is already applied for the production of biofuels, the work done focused in producing aromatic compounds, due to their economic value. The effect of experimental conditions on rapeseed oil hydrogenation was studied, namely, reaction temperature and time with the aim of selecting the most favourable conditions to convert rapeseed oil into liquid valuable bio-chemicals. Rapeseed oil was hydrogenated at a hydrogen initial pressure of 1.10. MPa. Reaction temperature varied in the range from 200 °C to 400 °C, while reaction times between 6 and 180. min were tested. The performance of a commercial cobalt and molybdenum catalyst was also studied. The highest hydrocarbons yields were obtained at the highest temperature and reaction times tested. At a temperature of 400 °C and at the reaction time of 120. min hydrocarbons yield was about 92% in catalyst presence, while in the absence of the catalyst this value decreased to 85%. Hydrocarbons yield was even higher when the reaction time of 180. min was used in the presence of catalyst, as the yield of 97% was observed. At these conditions hydrocarbons formed had a high content of aromatic compounds, around 50%. For this reason, the viscosity values of hydrogenated oils were lower than that established by EN590, which together with hydrogenated liquids composition prevented its use as direct liquid fuel to substitute fossil gas oil for transport sector. However, hydrocarbons analysis showed the presence of several valuable compounds that encourages their use as a raw material for the production of several chemicals and in chemical synthesis. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The latest European regulations require the use of biofuels by at least 10% as energy source in transport by 2020. This goal could be reached by means of the use of different renewable fuels; bioethanol (BE) is one of the most interesting for its low production cost and availability. BE usually replaces gasoline in petrol engines but it can be also blended in low concentrations to feed diesel engines. In this paper the results of an experimental activity aimed to study the impact of a BE/biodiesel/mineral diesel blend on performance and emissions in a last generation automotive diesel engine are presented. The tests were performed in steady-state in eight partial load engine conditions and at 2500. rpm in full load. Two fuel blends have been compared: the Rapeseed Methyl Ester (RME)/diesel with 10% of biodiesel by volume (B10), and the BE/RME/diesel with 20% of BE and 10% of biodiesel by volume (E20B10).The experimental campaign was carried out on a 2.0. L diesel engine compliant with Euro5 regulation. The engine features the closed loop combustion control (CLCC), which enables individual and real-time control of injection phasing and cylinder inner torque by means of in-cylinder pressure sensors connected with the Electronic Control Unit (ECU).As expected, the results showed a strong smoke emissions reduction for E20B10 in all tested conditions, mainly due to the high oxygen content of BE. Also a reduction of NOx emissions were observed with BE addiction. The results confirm that the CLCC adoption enables a significant improvement in the robustness of the engine performance and emissions when blends with low heat content and very low cetane number (as BE blends) are burnt. Nevertheless, high CO and HCs emissions for BE blends still remain a critical issue, even with the CLCC technology. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With more than 95% of India's surface transport dependent on imported fossil fuel, India has made a concerted effort to promote biofuel. The newly announced biofuel policy of India stipulates a blending target of 20% for both bioethanol and biodiesel. In the case of biodiesel, complement to fossil fuel diesel, India's predominant transport fuel, this target is to be achieved by cultivating non-edible oil seed plants in wastelands and fallow land. In spite of best effort, very little progress has been made on the ground. As the result, the deadline for blending target of 20% for biodiesel has been postponed from 2011-2012 to 2006-2017. This paper makes an attempt to understand the factors behind the tardy progress in India's biodiesel scene and suggests policy remedies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Acid-treatment of the bio-oil from the pyrolysis of mallee leaves in methanol over a solid acid catalyst Amberlyst 70 has been investigated in this study. The reactivities of the carboxylic acids with methanol were quite different over the solid acid catalyst, which was closely related to their distinct molecular structures. The linear alkyl substituted groups, the branched alkyl substituted groups, and the aromatic carbon chain of the acids created the different steric hindrances, which negatively affected their accessibility to the catalytic sites on/in the solid acid catalyst. Similar steric effects were found in the conversion of the heavy esters into small esters via transesterification. In addition to the esterification/transesterification, the methanolysis of the olefin and decomposition of the oligomers in bio-oil occurred simultaneously during the acid treatment, which converted the reactive components into the relatively volatile and stable ones and improved the quality of the bio-oil. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This reduction was conducted using certain oxygenated additives (methane, ethane and acetone). It was found that soot concentration is maximum when pure diesel was burned, followed by emulsified fuels and the lease concentration was obtained when biofuel was burned. Further, methanol has the most significant effect on the reduction of soot once added to each fuel, while acetone has the lease effect on soot reduction. The results gave good indication of the effect for oxygenated additives in reduction the soot formation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Residual fish oil, which is basically a by-product of fish processing industry, was tested pure and in 50% v/v blend with conventional low-sulfur marine gas oil in a direct-injection heavy-duty diesel engine. Experiments were performed at various operating conditions under standard propulsion and generator mode marine cycles. Engine performance, exhaust smokiness, gaseous emissions together with particulate matter (PM) size distribution and corresponding total particle number and mass concentrations were measured in all of the tests performed. In general, fish oil showed fairly good combustion and ignition properties, which were very similar to that of marine gas oil. Only slight difference was observed in NOx and CO2 levels, while emissions of CO and THC were significantly decreased at all operating conditions. Fish oil also allows reducing smoke (soot) and both total number and PM mass emissions up to 70-90% with the biggest particles being most affected. Such positive impact on pollutants can be explained by high oxygen content in fish oil fuel and its lack of aromatic compounds, which is promoting more complete fuel oxidation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this investigation, Enteromorpha compressa algal oil with high free fatty acids (FFA) used as a feedstock for biodiesel production. Two step process was developed and kinetic study executed to obtain reaction rate constant for the transesterification reaction. The acid esterification was carried out to reduce FFA from 6.3% to 0.34% with optimized parameters of 1.5% H2SO4, 12:1 methanol-oil ratio, 400rpm at 60°C and 90min of reaction time. The maximum biodiesel yield 90.6% was achieved from base transesterification through optimum conditions of 1% NaOH, 9:1 methanol-oil ratio, 600rpm and 60°C temperature for 70min. The algal biodiesel was characterized by GC-MS, HPLC and NIR. This transesterification follows first order reaction kinetics and the activation energy was determined as 73,154.89J/mol. The biodiesel properties were analyzed and found to be within the limits of American standards. Hence, E. compressa serves as a valuable renewable raw-material for biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A methodology that integrates life cycle assessment (LCA) with thermodynamic analysis is developed and applied to evaluate the environmental impacts of producing biofuels from waste biomass, including biodiesel from waste cooking oil, ethanol from corn stover, and compressed natural gas from municipal solid wastes. Solid oxide fuel cell-based auxiliary power units using bio-fuel as the hydrogen precursor enable generation of auxiliary electricity for idling heavy-duty trucks. Thermodynamic analysis is applied to evaluate the fuel conversion efficiency and determine the amount of fuel feedstock needed to generate a unit of electrical power. These inputs feed into an LCA that compares energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of different fuel pathways. Results show that compressed natural gas from municipal solid wastes is an optimal bio-fuel option for SOFC-APU applications in New York State. However, this methodology can be regionalized within the U.S. or internationally to account for different fuel feedstock options. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The paper looks at changes in Sweden's new car fleet between 2002 and 2010. Between 2002 and 2007 consumer amenities such as acceleration capacity and passenger space continued to increase while fuel consumption steadily decreased. During these years the main technological and market change was a shift toward diesel and flex-fuel ethanol vehicles. After 2007 the average weight and power of the vehicles were more or less constant, while fuel consumption decreased by 13% between 2007 and 2010. The developments after 2007 suggest that 77% of the technological development between 2002 and 2010 resulted in reductions in fuel consumption compares to previous years when 35% of any technology change resulted in a net reductions. The shift can partly be attributed to the increased share of diesels and an engine downsizing. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biobutanol has recently emerged as a potential alternate liquid fuel for gasoline and diesel. In this work, we have studied clostridial fermentation of stress assisted-acid hydrolyzed rice straw that exhibited a typical trend of acidogenesis followed by solventogenesis. Acid hydrolysis of 5% (w/v) mixture of rice straw in water with simultaneous application of shearing stress resulted in release of 3.9% (w/v) total sugar out of which 3.1% (w/v) was reducing sugar. Glucose formed major fraction (75%) of the reducing sugar (or 2.3% w/v total sugar). Thus, essentially, 5% (w/v) of rice straw solution released nearly 46% (w/w) (i.e. 23gL-1 glucose for 50gL-1 rice straw solution) glucose. Anaerobic fermentation of rice straw hydrolyzate using Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIM 2337 resulted in production of 6.24gL-1 of acetone, 13.5gL-1 of butanol and only 0.82gL-1 of ethanol. The net consumption of substrates was as follows: glucose 12.86gL-1 (i.e. ∼55%), total reducing sugar 18.32gL-1 (∼57%) and total sugar 24.5gL-1 (∼61%). Thus, higher solvents yield and significant sugar utilization makes rice straw a potential feedstock for biofuels production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The growing expansion of biofuel production in the European Union is a direct consequence of the political framework specifically implemented to reduce the impact of oil price rises and to achieve fuel security and environmental goals. These policies have activated a new relationship between fossil fuel and vegetable oil prices. Combining a multiple structural change approach with rolling cointegration, the article identifies four structural breaks in the relationships between the price of mineral and vegetable oils. Results show that policy instruments are responsible for these structural changes in the long-run relationships between prices. The analysis also shows that from the implementation of the directive 2003/30/EC the price dynamic of rapeseed oil has shifted from its own market to the diesel market, making it subject to interactions with the more complex reality of mineral oil. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Use of waste cooking oil derived biodiesel (WCOB) as an alternative fuel in diesel engines has increased significantly in recent years. The impact of WCOB on particulate emissions from diesel engines needs to be investigated thoroughly. This study was conducted to make a comparative evaluation and size-differentiated speciation of the particulate bound elements from ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) and WCOB and a blend of both of the fuels (B50). Particle mass and their elemental size distributions ranging from 0.01-5.6. μm were measured. It was observed that more ultrafine particles (UFPs, < 100 nm) were emitted when the engine was fueled with WCOB. Fifteen particulate-bound elements such as K, Al, Mg, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Cd, Ni, As, Ba, Pb, Zn and Sr were investigated and reported in this study. Potential health risk associated with these particulate bound elements upon inhalation was also evaluated based on dose-response assessments for both adults and children. The findings indicate that the exposure to PM of the B100 exhaust is relatively more hazardous and may pose adverse health effects compared to that of ULSD. Also, investigations on human health risk due to exposure to UFPs indicate that UFPs contribute a major fraction (>70%) of the total estimated health risk. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, a gas engine system capable of stable operation at any mix ratio of city gas 13A and biogas was developed. The gas engine system consists of a spark-ignition gas engine, an additional electric throttle valve for fuel and our own control algorithm. The engine is a 3-cylinder 1.6-l engine that was originally used for co-generation, and the fuel throttle valve was added to respond to different fuel compositions. The control algorithm was also designed to adjust the fuel and air ratio to attain a higher generation efficiency and lower NOx emission with different mix ratios of city gas 13A, biogas and load. Before developing the controller, the effect of the mix ratio on generation efficiency and NOx emission was investigated under various load conditions. The following summarizes the experimental results: a control algorithm using the Wobbe index for mixed fuels was formulated; this index determines the target fuel-to-air ratio. Next, operation tests were performed under varying fuel mix ratios and loads by applying the control algorithm to the gas engine. The target engine rotational speed and exhaust O2 concentration was realized in 5s when the biogas fraction varied from 20% to 40% and from 70% to 40%. When the load was also varied from 9.4kW to 0.5kW and from 0.5kW to 9.4kW at a constant rate, the rotational speed and exhaust O2 concentration achieved the target values in 20s. Under both transient operation conditions, the engine system met the NOx emission requirement, and the results indicate that the simple hardware modification to a conventional gas engine and our original control algorithm are capable of achieving stable engine operation at any mix ratio of city gas 13A and biogas. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As fossil fuels are depleting day by day, it is necessary to find an alternative fuel to fulfill the energy demand of the world. Biodiesel is considered as an environmentally friendly renewable diesel fuel alternative. The interest in using Jatropha curcas as a feedstock for the production of biodiesel is rapidly growing. On the one hand, J. curcas' oil does not compete with the food sector due to its toxic nature and to the fact that it must be cultivated in marginal/poor soil. On the other, its price is low and stable.In the last decade, the investigation on biodiesel production was centered on the choice of the suitable raw material and on the optimization of the process operation conditions. Nowadays, research is focused on the improvement of the energetic performance and on diminishing the inefficiencies in the different process components. The method of exergy analysis is well suited for furthering this goal, for it is a powerful tool for developing, evaluating and improving an energy conversion system.In this work, we identify the location, magnitude and sources of thermodynamic inefficiencies in a biodiesel production process from J. curcas by means of an exergy analysis. The thermodynamic properties were calculated from existing databases or estimated when necessary. The higher exergy destruction takes places in the transesterification reactor due to chemical reactions. Almost 95% of the exergy of the fuel is destroyed in this reactor. The exergetic efficiency of the overall process is 63%. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel production from microalgae has recently increased on interest. The objective of this work is to explore the potential of biodiesel production from the microalgae Isochrysis galbana (T-ISO). For that reason, this microalgae was cultivated for biodiesel production. The culture system equipment consisted of two methacrylate ponds, 11. mm thick. The pond has a base of 1.40. ×. 0.40. m and a height of 0.4. m. The influence of initial concentration of inoculum, stirring and carbon dioxide supply on the growth of algae were analyzed. The obtained results indicate that stirring improves the algae growth rate. The other two factors have no significant effect on final cell density. Obtained biomass was used to produce oil by extraction to use for biodiesel synthesis by means of basic-catalyzed reaction. For transesterification, microalgae oil was mixed with methanol (12:1 methanol to oil molar ratio), and sodium hydroxide (1%. g NaOH/g oil) for 3. h in a reactor at 62. °C. The best harvest shows a biomass concentration of 0.305. g/L with a FAME content of 12.5%. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Micro gas turbine units are reliable and versatile units for on-site combined heat and power production (CHP). Compared to internal combustion engines, CHP units based on micro gas turbines offer several advantages, among which the compactness, the high power-to-weight ratio, the lower pollutant emissions and maintenance costs. Depending on the specific type of gas turbine, also fuel flexibility could be better than diesel engines, as the fuel is continuously burnt in a hot environment and there is not possible mixing among fuel and lubricating oil. Within the framework of the EU-Russian Federation FP7 cooperative and specifically the Bioliquids-CHP project, a Garrett GTP 30-67 liquid fuel (diesel) micro gas turbine was characterised with diesel and then tested with different first generation biofuels, such as vegetable oil and biodiesel. An in-house test bench was designed, engineered, instrumented and built. In this research work, exhaust emissions from experimental campaign on the micro gas turbine run with diesel oil and biofuels are presented. Emissions were measured at various load. The experiments demonstrated that the MGT can be successfully operated with these biofuels, with emissions comparable to the standard diesel oil. The experiences gained on the operation of the micro gas turbine on first generation biofuels will serve as a basis for modifying the MGT to be operated with bio-oil from fast pyrolysis. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The recovery of 1-butanol from fermentation broth is energy-intensive since typical concentrations in fermentation broth are below 20gL-1. To prevent butanol inhibition and high downstream processing costs, we aimed at producing butyl esters instead of 1-butanol. It is shown that it is possible to perform simultaneously clostridial fermentation, esterification of the formed butanol to butyl butyrate, and extraction of this ester by hexadecane. The very high partition coefficient of butyl butyrate pulls the esterification towards the product side even at fermentation pH and relatively low butanol concentrations. The hexadecane extractant is a model diesel compound and is nontoxic to the cells. If butyl butyrate enriched diesel can directly be used as car fuel, no product recovery is required. A proof-of-principle experiment for the one-pot bio-ester production from glucose led to 5gL-1 butyl butyrate in the hexadecane phase. The principle may be extended to a wide range of esters, especially to longer chain ones. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Biodiesel production by non-catalytic supercritical methyl acetate (SCMA) reaction has been developed and optimized in previous study using Jatropha oil as oil feedstock. The reaction produces fatty methyl acid esters (FAME) as well as triacetin as the co-product. Due to the requirement of high reaction temperatures in SCMA treatment, thus the thermal stability of methyl oleate and methyl linoleate which are the major FAME in SCMA was investigated at temperature ranging from 330. °C to 420. °C. In addition, thermal stability of triacetin which was utilized as fuel additive in biodiesel was also investigated. The results revealed that the thermal stability of poly-unsaturated methyl linoleate decreases dramatically as temperature is increased from 330. °C to 420. °C while degradation of methyl oleate was only significant at 390. °C and above. Similar behaviour was also observed for triacetin which was found to degrade at high temperatures, resulting in low yield of biodiesel fuel even at optimum conditions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels are an emerging solution for the present-day concerns about rising oil prices and depletion of crude oil resources the world over. The justification for developing biofuels as alternate fuels in the world is manifold; rising crude oil prices and vulnerability in terms of energy security are the two biggest reasons. Moreover, production and usage of biofuels will strengthen the agricultural sector, provide energy to remote areas where conventional energy cannot be taken, contribute towards grassroots poverty alleviation, and increase industrial activity. In the world over the environmental damage by fossil fuel generation and combustion, as well as the depletion of fossil fuel resources, are very major concerns that justify a shift to renewable fuels. This article contains policy recommendations on different concerns that come across in introducing biofuels at global level. In order to move towards commercial deployment of biofuels, there are a number of policy areas that need attention throughout the world. These include industry awareness, decentralized production, consumer awareness, a one- window operation at the government level, recognition, by the Ministry of Environment, of biofuels as environment-friendly fuels, development of a supply chain mechanism, mass-scale planting of biodiesel producing trees and crops, blending and distribution issues, development of quality standards, involvement of the automobile sector, industry-academia collaboration and development of human resource in this discipline, public-private sector partnership and involvement of state-owned industries in the biodiesel project, and steps to make biodiesel a cost-competitive product through government regulation and subsidies. The recommendations are based upon the internationally practiced models transformed and customized into a feasible solution for suitability in the local environment. The policy recommendations, after iterations, shall become concrete inputs to make a law or a set of laws for using biofuels at a global level. These policies cover all concerned areas that have to be looked into and made part thereof while formulating the possible legislation. Thus the resulting legislation will be practicable and comprehensive. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Long-term operation of the biomass-to-liquid (BTL) process was conducted with a focus on the production of bio-syngas that satisfies the purity standards for the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process. The integrated BTL system consisted of a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) gasifier (20kWth), gas cleaning unit, syngas compression unit, acid gas removing unit, and an FT reactor. Since the raw syngas from the gasifier contains different types of contaminants, such as particulates, condensable tars, and acid gases, which can cause various mechanical problems or deactivate the FT catalyst, the syngas was purified by passing through cyclones, a gravitational dust collector, a two-stage wet scrubber (packing-type), and a methanol absorption tower. The integrated system was operated for 500h over several runs, and stable operating conditions for each component were achieved. The cleaned syngas contained no sulfur compounds (under 1ppmV) and satisfied the requirements for the FT process. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A continuous process involving gasification, syngas cleaning, and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis was developed to efficiently produce synthetic aviation turbine fuels (SATFs). Oak-tree wood chips were first gasified to syngas over a commercial pilot plant downdraft gasifier. The raw wood syngas contains about 47% N2, 21% CO, 18% H2, 12% CO2, 2% CH4 and trace amounts of impurities. A purification reaction system was designed to remove the impurities in the syngas such as moisture, oxygen, sulfur, ammonia, and tar. The purified syngas meets the requirements for catalytic conversion to liquid fuels. A multi-functional catalyst was developed and tested for the catalytic conversion of wood syngas to SATFs. It was demonstrated that liquid fuels similar to commercial aviation turbine fuels (Jet A) was successfully synthesized from bio-syngas. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present work demonstrates the application of a hydrodynamic cavitation reactor for the synthesis of biodiesel with used frying oil as a feedstock. The synthesis involved the transesterification of used frying oil (UFO) with methanol in the presence of potassium hydroxide as a catalyst. The effect of geometry and upstream pressure of a cavitating orifice plate on the rate of transesterification reaction has been studied. It is observed that the micro level turbulence created by hydrodynamic cavitation somewhat overcomes the mass transfer limitations for triphasic transesterification reaction. The significant effects of upstream pressure on the rate of formation of methyl esters have been seen. It has been observed that flow geometry of orifice plate plays a crucial role in process intensification. With an optimized plate geometry of 2 mm hole diameter and 25 holes, more than 95% of triglycerides have been converted to methyl esters in 10 min of reaction time with cavitational yield of 1.28 × 10-3 (Grams of methyl esters produced per Joule of energy supplied). The potential of UFO to produce good quality methyl esters has been demonstrated. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A cost estimation study was performed for a biological butanol production plant with a capacity of 150 × 106 kg butanol/year. Wheat straw (WS) was used as a feedstock. In addition to butanol, acetone (78.05 × 106 kg/year) and ethanol (28.54 × 106 kg/year) would also be produced. The total capital cost for this plant was $193.07 × 106. This exercise was based in part on data generated in our laboratory and in part on data obtained from literature. The design, mass balance, and energy balance simulations were performed using SuperPro Designer (Version 8.5003, 2012). For butanol production wheat straw would be pretreated with dilute (1% v/v) sulfuric acid at 121 °C for 1 h followed by separate hydrolysis (using enzymes), fermentation and recovery. Enzyme cost for wheat straw hydrolysis was adapted from literature ($0.16/kg butanol). Utilities which included steam/high pressure steam, cooling/chilling water, and electricity represented the major cost of the operation (49.18%) followed by raw materials (26.81%). Based on batch fermentation of wheat straw hydrolysate and distillative recovery of acetone butanol ethanol (ABE), butanol production cost was estimated to be $1.30/kg for a grass-rooted/green-field plant. Application of a membrane recovery process could reduce this price to $1.00/kg for a plant annexed to an existing distillery. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This report includes assessments of comparative studies on the physical, chemical, and motor properties of stored biofuels produced from Camelina sativa oil. The properties of biofuel containing C. sativa oil methyl esters (CMEs) were compared with the properties of fossil diesel fuel and standardized rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) and fossil diesel fuel blends. To ensure compliance with the requirements for fatty acid methyl esters established by the EN 14214 standard, pure CMEs were blended with methyl esters of animal origin, the content of which accounted for 32% of the blend. Motor studies were carried out in the VALMET 320 DMG diesel engine while using fuel blends consisting of 30% of a mixture of C. sativa oil and pork lard methyl esters and 70% fossil diesel fuel. Environmental and energy indicators were compared with indicators related to RME and fossil diesel fuel. In the course of the experiments, it was established that when no anti-oxidant was used, the C. sativa oil and pork lard methyl ester mixtures met the requirements of the oxidation standard only during the first month of storage, whereas the physical properties did not change considerably during the whole storage period. Due to the properties of fuels containing C. sativa oil methyl esters, they can be used in cold climate areas in summertime. As a result of performing measurements of emissions of hazardous components, it was observed that throughout the storage period, the maximum reduction of CO reached 7-10%, whereas the decrease in HC was - 5-8% and that of NOx was approximately 4%. The most significant effect was detected in the case of smoke intensity, where the reduction reached 20-25%, and the useful effect increased to 4%. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to the chemical and physical properties of castor oil (Ricinus communis) that make it a valuable raw material for numerous industrial applications, including the production of biofuel, interest to develop more and better varieties has been increased. However, despite this interest, México does not currently have any varieties of enhanced castor for which yield and adaptation have been optimized to justify sizeable production. Although some varieties have been introduced, there are problems with adaptation. Given the need to develop castor bean varieties with outstanding agronomic characteristics and good adaptation, a collection of local R. communis seeds has been initiated. However, there has been wide phenotypic variation among collections. The objective of this study was to assess the diversity and genetic relationships among accessions of R. communis from the state of Chiapas, México using AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) and SSR (simple sequence repeat) markers. In this research 53% of the AFLP markers were polymorphic; additionally, we detected high levels of genetic diversity (71%). The combinations E-AAC. +. M-CAG and E-ACG. +. M-CAG presented a PIC value of 0.415 and 0.425 and an RP of 41.98 and 46.11, respectively, indicating that these combinations are useful in studies of genetic characterization. Additionally, 100% of the SSR primers were polymorphic, with an average of 5.5 alleles per locus. The SSR primer Rco23 generated a PIC value of 0.812, an SI of 1.919 and four uncommon alleles (0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.07), indicating that this SSR primer was particularly informative for this study. A dendrogram was generated with the markers obtained from these studies, allowing for the identification of two main groups of accessions. Collectively, these studies will allow for the development of at least two different populations through the recombination of genotypes by genetic similarity and will provide a foundation for the breeding program. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Depletion of fossil fuels warrants the use of biofuels as an alternate source to minimize the usage of petroleum reserves. Biodiesel fuels are renewable source of energy derived from plant oils or animal fats. They are mono alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids formed by transesterification of oils/fats. Efficiency of transesterification of oils from four sources (safflower, cottonseed, castor, used cottonseed oil) was determined in this study with both methanol and ethanol as alcohols and sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide as catalysts. Methanol was found to be a better solvent and sodium hydroxide a better catalyst. The highly viscous nature of raw vegetable oils has been shown to decrease through transesterification process. In our experiments, the highest viscosity reduction was observed for castor oil even though it was the most viscous among four oils, both methyl and ethyl esters of safflower was shown to have a similar viscosity as No. 2 diesel. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Palm biodiesel from crude palm oil (CPO) was prepared via transesterification in a two-stage process using acidic ionic liquid as first step catalyst as opposed to using directly the alkaline-catalyzed transesterification which was found to be unsuitable. The esterification of the free fatty acids (FFA) of the CPO was carried out using triethylammonium hydrogensulfate (Et 3NHSO 4) as the pre-catalyst in the first stage, in which the acid value was reduced from 6.98 to 1.24mgKOH/g of oil followed by the use of KOH-catalyzed transesterification in the second stage. The effects of molar ratio of methanol to crude palm oil feed, the amount of ionic liquid and the reaction temperature were evaluated for the percent conversion of FFA. The conversion rate of FFA attained was 82.1% when 5.2wt.% of Et 3NHSO 4 was used for the reaction of methanol with CPO at a ratio of 15:1 respectively, and at reaction temperature of 170°C for 3h. The second alkali-catalyze step was performed under agitation with stirrer speed of 600rpm at 60°C using 1.0% KOH for 50min. The final biodiesel product was analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) with a reaction yield of 96.9%. The density, kinematic viscosity, acid value, ester content and other properties of the biodiesel sample were also measured and compared to the ASTM and the European biodiesel specifications. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In order to more fully utilize pennycress, a potentially viable bio-diesel source, the proteinaceous components were extracted from pennycress seeds and press cake. The amino acid composition of the proteins present in pennycress was typical for proteins derived from plants, with glycine, glutamic acid and alanine being prevalent. Water, 0.5. M sodium chloride, 60% acetic acid, 0.1. M sodium hydroxide and ethanol were used in sequential order to remove the protein from pennycress seeds and press cake and determine the various soluble protein fractions. Extraction temperature was varied from 5 to 77. °C. The highest yield of material (35%) was obtained by extracting pennycress seeds with water at 77. °C. However, this material had only moderate levels of protein (25%) with the remainder being carbohydrates and oil (as determined by infrared spectroscopy). The use of 0.5. M sodium chloride to remove protein from press cake at 5. °C produced material with the highest protein content (83%), but extraction yield was 25%. When extractions were carried out at 77. °C, oil typically began to be a major impurity in the protein. Using bomb calorimetry, the material remaining after extraction was found to have some value as a fuel source. © 2012.
