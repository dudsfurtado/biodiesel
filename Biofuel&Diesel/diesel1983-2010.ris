AB  - A highly efficient biocatalytic process for biodiesel synthesis in 1-methyl-3-octadecylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide is shown. This ionic liquid (IL) is able to dissolve triolein/methanol mixtures in many proportions, providing an homogeneous monophasic media suitable for the enzymatic synthesis of biodiesel (up to 96% yield in 6 h at 60°C). The enzyme/IL system can be reused for seven operation cycles without any loss in IL phase or enzyme activity. Copyright © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, coupled with the increasingly competitive price of biomass fuels against rising oil prices, have given impetus to the use of renewable biofuels in energy production. However, conventional biomass combustion systems produce significant air pollution making them undesirable particularly for public buildings such as schools. Thus, there has been growing interest in advanced wood combustion (AWC) technologies that have higher energy efficiencies and lower emissions. However, achieving increasingly stringent source emission regulations that serve to protect the public health may necessitate the application of pollution control technology on AWC systems. In the present work, the effectiveness of a model electrostatic precipitator (ESP) in capturing the emissions from a 150 kW wood pellet boiler was assessed. Stack gas sampling was performed using the EPA conditional test method CTM-039. Ash resistivity values were estimated using the Bickelhaupt model and measured ash composition, and were found to be consistent with the observed ESP performance. Size-dependent particle collection characteristics of the ESP revealed a slightly reduced collection in the size range of 0.2-1 μm and was independent of the boiler load. The ESP reduced particle mass to approximately 3 mg/m3 (0 °C, 101.325 kPa, dry gas and 13% O2) representing mass collection efficiencies of approximately 96-98%. It was concluded that ash resistivity would not be problematic for an ESP collecting dust from a typical AWC boiler. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Natural oil from non-food oil seeds, such as camelina, jatropha, and pennycress, is increasingly becoming the feedstock of choice for biodiesel production through transesterification to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and green diesel via catalytic hydrotreating. Unlike the presscakes from food-based feedstocks, such as soy and palm fruits, the residual oil-extracted presscakes are often not suitable for consumption as animal feed. However, their abundance and the fact that these feedstocks are already collected give them a logistic advantage as a bioenergy resource over conventional lignocellulosic biomass, which is yet to be harvested. Vegetable oil-seed presscakes make an ideal thermochemical conversion feedstock because of their inherently high initial calorific value. We carried out fast pyrolysis of the entire value chain of two of the mustard family oil seeds, pennycress and camelina, and found that, at the optimum fast pyrolysis conditions, not only can high-carbon, high-energy liquid fuel intermediates be produced but also these liquids are low-oxygen, stable intermediates that do not oligomerize over time to higher molecular weight or increase in viscosity over time according to the accelerated aging test. Liquid fuel quality was high, with gross calorific value ranging between 29.0 MJ/kg for defatted oil to 34.7 MJ/kg for the whole seed on a dry basis. The corresponding carbon conversion efficiency, defined as feed carbon converted to the liquid pyrolysate, ranged between 60 and 80%. It is envisioned that co-location of a fast pyrolysis process with a green-diesel plant that uses these feedstocks could provide additional gallons of renewable biofuels and a reliable source of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds needed for the formulation of renewable jet fuels. © This article not subject to U.S. Copyright.

AB  - Researchers, policy makers and civil society organizations have been discussing the potential of biofuels as partial substitutes for fossil fuels and thereby as a simultaneous solution for climate change and rural poverty. Research has highlighted the ambiguity of these claims across various dimensions and scales, focusing on ethanol-producing or oilseed crops in agricultural lands or Jatropha-type crops on common lands. We studied the agronomic and economic viability and livelihood impacts of Jatropha curcas plantations on private farms in Tamil Nadu, India. We found that Jatropha yields are much lower than expected and its cultivation is currently unviable, and even its potential viability is strongly determined by water access. On the whole, the crop impoverishes farmers, particularly the poorer and socially backward farmers. Jatropha cultivation therefore not only fails to alleviate poverty, but its aggressive and misguided promotion will generate conflict between the state and the farmers, between different socio-economic classes and even within households. The water demands of the crop can potentially exacerbate the conflicts and competition over water access in Tamil Nadu villages. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Certain undesirable characteristics are associated with the use of soy methyl esters as a direct replacement for petroleum diesel fuel. When compared to petroleum diesel, soy methyl esters have higher NOx emissions, poorer cold flow, and a shorter shelf life. This article investigates whether the careful choice of alcohol and triglyceride feedstocks can improve these fuel properties. Three different triglyceride feedstocks with three different levels of oleic acid were examined. It was determined that a high amount of oleic acid in the triglyceride feedstock eliminates the tradeoff between cold flow and oxidative stability. The study also examined the role of three different alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl, and isopropyl) on the high-oleic feedstock. In NOx emissions testing, no significant difference was found between the alkyl groups. Isopropyl esters had the best cold flow properties, while methyl esters had the poorest cold flow properties for the three different alkyl groups. The induction periods for the methyl and ethyl esters from the high-oleic feedstock were 14 and 26 h, respectively, according to the Rancimat method. These numbers are in close agreement with the oxidative stability index. Isopropyl esters from the high-oleic feedstock had an induction period of less than an hour, which was unexpected. Further investigation revealed that the high-oleic isopropyl esters had no vitamin E in the form of α-tocopherol, and it was speculated that the washing step in the manufacture of the fuel removed all vitamin E content. © 2008 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - High utilization of fossil fuel increases the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and results in global warming phenomenon. These things establish the world's thought to look for the other alternative energy that can reduce the use of fossil fuel even to be replaced by the substitute. Recently, Indonesia has been doing the research of microalgae as a feedstock of an alternative biofuel. Fatty acid content that microalgae have is also high to produce biofuel. The steps used in this research is a 7 days cultivation, harvesting, extraction using hexane, and fatty acid identification using Gas Chromatography of microalgae species. Fatty acid component in some species such as Chlorella sp., Scenedesmus sp., Nannochloropsis sp., and Isochrysis sp. is between 0.21-29.5%; 0.11-25.16%; 0.30-42.32%; 2.06-37.63%, respectively, based on dry weight calculation. The high content of fatty acid in some species of microalgae showed the potential to be the feedstock of producing biofuel in overcoming the limited utilization from petroleum (fossil fuel) presently. © 2010 Institut Pertanian Bogor

AB  - We report here on the characterization of a cDNA library from seeds of Jatropha curcas L. at three stages of fruit maturation before yellowing. We sequenced a total of 2200 clones and obtained a set of 931 non-redundant sequences (unigenes) after trimming and quality control, ie, 140 contigs and 791 singlets with PHRED quality $10. We found low levels of sequence redundancy and extensive metabolic coverage by homology comparison to GO. After comparison of 5841 non-redundant ESTs from a total of 13193 reads from GenBank with KEGG, we identified tags with nucleotide variations among J. curcas accessions for genes of fatty acid, terpene, alkaloid, quinone and hormone pathways of biosynthesis. More specifically, the expression level of four genes (palmitoyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterase, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase B, lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase and geranyl pyrophosphate synthase) measured by real-time PCR proved to be significantly different between leaves and fruits. Since the nucleotide polymorphism of these tags is associated to higher level of gene expression in fruits compared to leaves, we propose this approach to speed up the search for quantitative traits in selective breeding of J. curcas. We also discuss its potential utility for the selective breeding of economically important traits in J. curcas. © the author(s), publisher and licensee Libertas Academica Ltd.

AB  - Problem statement: The use of vegetable oils as a fuel in diesel engines causes some problems due to their high viscosity compared with diesel. Various techniques and methods are used to solve the problems resulting from high viscosity. Approach: One of the techniques is the preparation of a microemulsion fuel, called a hybrid fuel. In this study, hybrid fuels consisting of coconut oil, ethanol and octan-1-ol were prepared with an aim to test their suitability as a fuel for diesel engines. Density, viscosity and gross calorific values of these fuels were determined and the fuels were used to run a direct injection diesel engine. The engine performance and exhaust emissions were investigated and compared with that of diesel and coconut oil. Results: The experimental results show that the engine efficiency of the hybrid fuels is comparable to that of diesel. As the percentage of ethanol and/or octan-1-ol increased, the viscosity of the hybrid fuels decreased and the engine efficiency increased. The exhaust emissions were lower than those for diesel, except carbon monoxide, which increased. Conclusion/Recommendations: Hence, it is concluded that these hybrid fuels can be used successfully as an alternative fuel in diesel engines without any modifications. Their completely renewable nature ensures that they are environmentally friendly. © 2010 Science Publications.

AB  - Bioethanol and biodiesel are two alternative fuels promoted with potential to reduce dependence on fossil fuel imports. Biofuels production costs can vary widely by feedstock, conversion process, scale of production and region. The major economic factor to consider for input costs of biodiesel production is the feedstock, which is about 75-80% of the total operating cost. Other important costs are labor, methanol and catalyst, which must be added to the feedstock. The biofuel policy aims to promote the use in transport of fuels made from biomass, as well as other renewable fuels. Biofuels provide the prospect of new economic opportunities for people in rural areas in oil importer and developing countries. Policy drivers for renewable liquid biofuels have attracted particularly high levels of assistance in some countries given their promise of benefits in several areas of interest to governments, including agricultural production, greenhouse gas emissions, energy security, trade balances, rural development and economic opportunities for developing countries. © Sila Science.

AB  - Liquid scintillation spectrometry of 14C in gasoline/ethanol and diesel oil was carried out using Quantulus® and straight mixtures of fuel and an organic scintillation cocktail. A linear correlation was found between the concentration of carbon that originates from the bioethanol (biocarbon) and the fuel mixture's 14C activity in the range 0-100% (m/m) bioethanol content. Because of these good linear correlations, quantitative determination of a fuel's biocarbon content can be made by 14C analysis. The direct method is also applicable to analysis of the bio-based materials dissolvable in solvents, which can be mixed with scintillation cocktails.

AB  - While production of the easy-to-recover petroleum and natural gas declines worldwide, several adjustments will be made: (1) The rich countries will continue to limit their total energy consumption; (2) the United States in particular will have to cut its primary energy consumption by a factor of two to the level of the most affluent West European countries; (3) the poor countries will be helped to produce and deploy passive solar devices for cooking and heating, and will gain access to the clean burning, locally produced biofuels for local transportation and other local uses; (4) all other countries will have to limit their reliance on coal for most of modernization; (5) several alternative energy systems that rely on the sun will be developed and deployed; and (6) electricity generation by nuclear fission will grow as old coal-fired power stations are decommissioned. The world will have three other environmentally unfriendly alternatives: (1) Produce massive amounts of biofuels; (2) recover, process and burn more ultra heavy oil or tar; and (3) burn more coal. For the next several decades the world will have only one environmentally acceptable option to fuel a majority of the required changes: clean natural gas. Natural gas will come from conventional deposits and, increasingly, from unconventional tight sands, shales, and coal seams. The United States of America is endowed with the huge unconventional gas - and oil - resources. In 2009, the technically recoverable unconventional gas is energy-equivalent to producible oil in 5-10 Prudhoe Bays or 1-2 Ghawars. The Prudhoe Bay in Alaska is the largest oil field in North America. The Ghawar giant in Saudi Arabia is the largest oil field on the Earth. Major unconventional gas resources in Texas and the U.S. are discussed. Comments are made on the major technical, environmental and political difficulties of producing these resources.

AB  - The use of butanol as an alternative biofuel blend component for conventional diesel fuel has been under extensive investigation. However, some fuel properties such as cetane number and lubricity fall below the accepted values as described by the ASTM D 975 diesel specifications. Blending 10% butanol with #2 ULSD decreases the cetane number by 7% (from 41.6 to 39.0). At higher butanol blend levels, i.e., 20% v/v, the cetane number decrease cannot be compensated for; even with the addition of a 2000 ppm level commercial cetane improver. The decreased cetane number, or in other words, increased ignition delay, can be attributed to the increased blend level of low cetane butanol as well as the critical physical properties for better atomization of fuels during auto ignition such as viscosity. The kinematic viscosity dropped sharply with increasing butanol blend level up to 25 % v/v, then increased with further increase of butanol blend level. Also, the addition of butanol decreases the lubricity properties of conventional diesel. Interestingly, blending biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters) with butanoldiesel mixtures restores the required properties of diesel fuel for compression ignition. In this study, biodiesel and butanol were blended with commercial diesel fuel at different ternary mixture compositions to characterize the key fuel properties of the blends such as cetane number, viscosity, lubricity, flash point and cold filter plugging point. An optimum ternary mixture of biodiesel-butanol-diesel will be developed based on the physical properties which can be used in CI engines without altering engine parameters or the addition of performance enhancers. In addition the feasibility of using green diesel (hydrotreated animal fats) as a matrix for butanol blending was also investigated. © 2010 SAE International.

Since ignition is a vital property in the choice of an engine combustion concept, the ability to tailor the ignition behavior of various fuel sources by means of fuel additives is expected to aid the development of fuel-flexible engines. Ethanol is one of the biofuels with a potential to play an important role in the transportation fuel mix of the future. One of the final processes during ethanol production involves distillation in order to minimize the water content. Using wet ethanol in combustion engines could lead to a reduction in the energy consumption during fuel processing. An understanding of fundamental combustion properties of ethanol in the presence of water vapor such as ignition behavior is expected to aid in the design of efficient engine combustion processes. In this work, the effect of two esters, isopropyl nitrate (IPN) and isopropyl formate (IPF), on the high temperature shock ignition of ethanol is investigated. Furthermore, the ignition of wet ethanol is investigated in order to shed light on the effect of water vapor content on the ignition chemistry of ethanol. New ethanol ignition data at 10 atm are also reported. Experiments are carried out in a shock tube at average pressures of 2, 10 and 12 atm over a temperature range of 949-1650 K. The ethanol and ethanol/additives are mixed with oxygen and argon. Ignition delay times are obtained behind reflected shock waves by means of pressure and light emission profiles. It is observed that while IPN addition to ethanol results in shorter ignition delay times, IPF addition leads to longer delay times. In case of water addition, it is found that for the same post-reflected temperatures and pressure, shorter ignition delay times are observed. However, this effect must be considered together with other physical processes of wet ethanol combustion such as heating and vaporization. © 2010 SAE International.

AB  - Diversifying energy resources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are key priorities in the forthcoming years for the automotive industry. Currently, among the different solutions, sustainable biofuels are considered as one of the most attractive answer to these issues. This paper deals with the vehicle application of an innovative Diesel fuel formulation using Ethanol to tackle these future challenges. The main goal is to better understand the impact of using biofuel blends on engine behavior, reliability and pollutants emissions. This alternative oxygenated fuel reduces dramatically particulate matter (PM) emissions; this paves the way to improve the NOx/PM/CO 2 trade-off. Another major interest is to avoid adding a particulate filter in the exhaust line and to avoid modifying powertrain and vehicle hardware and therefore to minimize the overall cost to fulfill upcoming emission regulations. After a first part devoted to a description of the fuel properties, the paper focuses on some combustion analysis pointing out the effects of the new formulation. Then the fuel/ engine compatibility and its optimization on a production turbocharged Diesel multi-cylinder engine with high pressure exhaust gas recirculation are investigated. Owing to advanced calibration methods such as design of experiments, new maps are provided to fully take advantage of the ethanol/diesel blend properties and to enhance the engine behavior. It leads to a simultaneous decrease of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emissions with a potential CO 2 emissions reduction and combustion noise decrease. The main drawbacks could be an increase of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions. Furthermore, after having successfully validated the new settings on the test bench, some vehicle results on a chassis dynamometer are presented on the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) to illustrate the effectiveness of this innovative fuel formulation and the calibration adaptation. Finally the recalibrated vehicle, integrating only Euro 4- compliant technologies (not equipped with a Diesel particulate filter device), with this new fuel satisfies potentially Euro 5 emissions standards without sacrificing drivability and service life. © 2010 SAE International.

AB  - Long chain alcohols possess major advantages over the currently used ethanol as bio-components for gasoline, including higher energy content, better engine compatibility, and less water solubility. The rapid developments in biofuel technology have made it possible to produce C 4 -C 5 alcohols cost effectively. These higher alcohols could significantly expand the biofuel content and potentially substitute ethanol in future gasoline mixtures. This study characterizes some fundamental properties of a C 5 alcohol, isopentanol, as a fuel for HCCI engines. Wide ranges of engine speed, intake temperature, intake pressure, and equivalence ratio are investigated. Results are presented in comparison with gasoline or ethanol data previously reported. For a given combustion phasing, isopentanol requires lower intake temperatures than gasoline or ethanol at all tested speeds, indicating a higher HCCI reactivity. Similar to ethanol but unlike gasoline, isopentanol does not show two-stage ignition even at very low engine speed (350 rpm) or with considerable intake pressure boost (200 kPa abs.). However, isopentanol does show considerable intermediate temperature heat release (ITHR) that is comparable to gasoline. Our previous work has found that ITHR is critical for maintaining combustion stability at the retarded combustion phasings required to achieve high loads without knock. The stronger ITHR causes the combustion phasing of isopentanol to be less sensitive to intake temperature variations than ethanol. With the capability to retard combustion phasing, a maximum IMEP g of 5.4 and 11.6 bar was achieved with isopentanol at 100 and 200 kPa intake pressure, respectively. These loads are even slightly higher than those achieved with gasoline. The ITHR of isopentanol depends on operating conditions and is enhanced by simultaneously increasing pressures and reducing temperatures. However, increasing the temperature seems to have little effect on ITHR at atmospheric pressure, but it does promote hot ignition. Finally, the dependence of ignition timing on equivalence ratio, here called? -sensitivity, is measured at atmospheric intake pressure, showing that the ignition of isopentanol is nearly insensitive to equivalence ratio when thermal effects are removed. This suggests that partial fuel stratification, which has been found effective to control the HRR with two-stage ignition fuels, may not work well with isopentanol at these conditions. Overall, these results indicate that isopentanol has a good potential as a HCCI fuel, either in neat form or in blend with gasoline. © 2010 SAE International.

AB  - The behavior of the engine-out UHC and CO emissions from a light-duty diesel optical engine operating at two PPCI conditions was investigated for fifteen different fuels, including diesel fuels, biofuel blends, n-heptane-iso-octane mixtures, and n-cetane-HMN mixtures. The two highly dilute (9-10% O 2) early direct injection PPCI conditions included a low speed (1500 RPM) and load (3.0 bar IMEP) case-where the UHC and CO have been found to stem from overly-lean fuel-air mixtures-and a condition with a relatively higher speed (2000 RPM) and load (6.0 bar IMEP)-where globally richer mixtures may lead to different sources of UHC and CO. The main objectives of this work were to explore the general behavior of the UHC and CO emissions from earlyinjection PPCI combustion and to gain an understanding of how fuel properties and engine load affect the engine-out emissions. The UHC and CO emissions from an emissions certification diesel fuel and several soy- and palm-based biofuel blends were found to partially collapse when plotted as a function of the premixed burn duration for the low speed and load condition. Significant reductions in both UHC and CO were observed with the biofuel blends. The engine-out UHC and CO emissions and premixed burn duration, which directly correlates with the magnitude of the peak heat-release, were shown to depend on three general parameters: (1) the injection timing, which controls the targeting and the initial thermodynamic state of the ambient gases; (2) the mixing time between the fuel and ambient gases during the ignition delay period; and (3) the premixed combustion phasing, which controls the temperature, pressure, and mixture state during premixed combustion. In order to investigate the effects of ignition quality and volatility in greater detail, a controlled parametric study involving nine different fuels was conducted. The fuels were selected to provide an orthogonal fuel matrix in which ignition quality and volatility were varied independently. The advancement of the combustion phasing for fuels with higher ignition quality was found to significantly decrease the UHC and CO emissions, while fuel volatility was determined to have a much smaller effect on the engine-out emissions. The emissions from the higher speed and load condition were found to be mainly dependent on the injection timing and were less sensitive to fuel-type. This is consistent with previous studies that have attributed the behavior of the UHC and CO emissions at higher loads to bulk mixing processes controlled by the targeting of the injected fuel spray. © 2010 SAE International.

The second stage (transesterification) was made using potassium carbonate catalyst. The behavior in the crystallization of the product using differential scanning calorimetry, cloud point ASTM D2500 (2005) and pour point ASTM D97 (2005) was evaluated. The obtained biofuels fulfill the requirements of the American standards for biodiesel and the propose methodology for the synthesis presents environmental advantages and of increase in the reactivity, as opposed to the traditional methods of heating.

AB  - The impact of fuel properties on engine-out emissions and performance was studied using a range of diesel, kerosene, and gasoline-like fuels in a single-cylinder diesel engine optimized for advanced combustion. The center of combustion was matched for each fuel by adjusting the fuel injection timing. The warmed-up engine could be run successfully on a wide range of diesel, kerosene, and gasoline-like fuels, including part-load and full-load operation, with diesel-like efficiency. NOx emissions at or below Euro 6 emissions limits were achieved without using a NOx aftertreatment system. Particulate matter (PM) emissions were low but a diesel particulate filter would be needed to reach Euro 6 limits and below. Hydrocarbon and CO emissions increased but were within the range that could be treated with a diesel oxidation catalyst. PM emissions decreased with increasing ignition delay, higher volatility, and lower aromatics levels of the fuel but the relative effects varied depending upon the engine operating conditions.

AB  - A mixed-integer programming model is developed to assess the economic feasibility of siting a woody biomass-based ethanol facility in the central Appalachian hardwood region. The model maximizes the net present value (NPV) of a facility over its economic life. Model inputs include biomass availability, biomass handling system type, plant investment and capacity, transportation logistics, feedstock and product pricing, project financing, and taxes. Four alternative woody biomass handling systems, which include all processes from stand to plant, are considered. Eleven possible plant locations were identified based on site selection requirements. Results showed that the optimal plant location was in Buckhannon, West Virginia. The NPV of the plant with a demand of 2,000 dry tons of woody biomass per day varied from $68.11 million to $84.51 million among the systems over a 20-year plant life. Internal rate of return (IRR) of the facility averaged 18.67% for the base case scenario. Average ethanol production costs were approximately $2.02 to $2.08 per gallon. Production costs were most impacted by biomass availability, mill residue purchase price, plant investment and capacity, ethanol yield, and financing. Findings suggest that a woody biomass-based ethanol facility in central Appalachia could be economically feasible under certain operational scenarios.

AB  - Biofuels are being investigated as potential substitutes for current high pollutant fuels obtained from the conventional sources. The primary problem associated with using straight vegetable oil as fuel in a compression ignition engine is caused by viscosity. The process of transesterifiction of vegetable oil with methyl alcohol provides a significant reduction in viscosity, thereby enhancing the physical properties of vegetable oil. The Kirloskar HA394 compression ignition, multi cylinder diesel engine does not require any modification to replace diesel by karanja methyl ester. Biodiesel can be used in its pure form or can be blended with diesel to form different blends. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the potential of karanja oil methyl ester and its blend with diesel from 20% to 80% by volume. Engine performance and exhaust emissions were investigated and compared with the ordinary diesel fuel in a diesel engine. The experimental results show that the engine power of the mixture is closed to the values obtained from diesel fuel and the amounts of exhaust emissions are lower than those of diesel fuel. Hence, it is seen that the blend of karanja ester and diesel fuel can be used as an alternative successfully in a diesel engine without any modification and in terms of emission parameters; it is an environmental friendly fuel.

AB  - Governments around the world are implementing programs to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transportation sector. The targeted GHG emission reductions will require major transformations in the areas of vehicles and fuel; however, little effort has been made to systematically compare the costs of efficiency and alternative fuel options under consistent assumptions. This study analyzes the cost-effectiveness-or cost per tonne (metric ton) of GHG emission reduction-of near-term technology options for vehicle efficiency, biofuel usage, battery electric vehicles, and hydrogen fuel cells for GHG reduction in the light-duty vehicle sector within the 2020 time frame. The costs and GHG impacts of emerging technologies are evaluated to develop a marginal GHG abatement cost curve for a technology deployment scenario that complies with the adopted vehicle regulation and low-carbon fuel standard in California. The findings indicate large variation in estimates for cost per tonne across technologies and high uncertainty because of the price of petroleum.

AB  - The present numerical study on spray characteristic of biofuels, which is the blend of Refined, Bleached and Deodorized Palm olein (RBDPO) and Commercial Diesel Fuel (CDF) in gas turbine, is important. This type of study is a major concern all over the world due to global issues for example pollution, shortage of fuel and economic crisis. This study is mainly focused on spray characteristic for various palm olein biofuel blends. Spray characteristic of various biofuel blends will be analyzed and compared to pure diesel. Biofuel blends that have different blending ratio - B5, B10, B15, B20, and diesel will be studied and the chemical properties of various biofuel blends can be determined after having several measurements in laboratory. Numerical study was conducted by using Gambit and FLUENT software to observe the spray characteristic such as Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) and penetration for different biofuel blends. Verification and validation is an important way to ensure that the mathematical model can be used in this case studies. The k-epsilon model has successfully predicted the spray characteristic of all biofuel blends such as Sauter Mean Diameter and penetration of droplet particle and a correlation has been established.

AB  - In this study, sunflower oil was investigated for biodiesel production. Sunflower is one of the leading oil seed crop, cultivated for the production of oil in the world. It has also been considered as an important crop for biodiesel production. Seeds for biodiesel production were procured from local farmers of Attock and Rawalpidni divisions. Electric oil expeller was used for the extraction of crude oil. Base catalyzed transesterifiction process is applied for optimum yield (80%) of biodiesel. Fuel properties of sunflower oil biodiesel were compared with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). Engine efficiency of biodiesel with reference to power, efficiency and consumption of biodiesel blends (B100, B20 and B5) were determined. It was concluded that sunflower oil is one of the option for biodiesel production at a large scale depending on its mass cultivation. © 2010 Academic Journals.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa L.) is a promising sustainable alternative energy crop belonging to the Brassicaceae (mustard) family. Camelina has several favorable agronomic characteristics which give it potential to significantly enhance domestic biofuels production. With high seed oil content as well as high yield of oil per hectare, camelina can be efficiently processed into high quality renewable fuels such as biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters) as well as renewable diesel and jet fuels using existing technologies. This review summarizes the attributes of camelina along with conversion of the lipid fraction into advanced renewable biofuels. © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - A reduction of oil reserves and an augmented production of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels have increased the use of biodiesel in internal combustion engines. Although physical and chemical properties of biodiesel and diesel are similar enough that allow the use of pure biodiesel in a traditional engine without considerable adjustments, differences in chemical structure of diesel and biodiesel change vaporization and combustion rates and can affect engine performance. In this study a model that can predict the evaporation rate of palm and castor oil biodiesel droplets at atmospheric pressure was developed. The model was validated with experimental data from the literature for the evaporation of n-heptane-droplets. The model estimates thermo-physical properties of biofuels using contribution group theory and was used to determine that castor oil biodiesel presents a lower evaporation rate than palm oil biodiesel due to differences in their physical properties (mainly density and vaporization enthalpy) which can be explained by a longer molecule and the presence of a hydroxyl groups in methyl ricinoleate, its main component.

AB  - There is increasing demand for renewable energy and the use of biodiesel in traffic is a major option when implying this increment. We investigated the toxicological activities of particulate emissions from a nonroad diesel engine, operated with conventional diesel fuel (EN590), and two biodiesels: rapeseed methyl ester (RME) and hydrotreated fresh vegetable oil (HVO). The engine was operated with all fuels either with or without catalyst (DOC/POC). The particulate matter (PM1) samples were collected from the dilution tunnel with a high-volume cascade impactor (HVCI). These samples were characterized for ions, elements, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds. Mouse RAW264.7 macrophages were exposed to the PM samples for 24h. Inflammatory mediators, (TNF-α and MIP-2), cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species [ROS]) were measured. All the samples displayed mostly dose-dependent toxicological activity. EN590 and HVO emission particles had larger inflammatory responses than RME-derived particles. The catalyst somewhat increased the responses per the same mass unit. There were no substantial differences in the cytotoxic responses between the fuels or catalyst use. Genotoxic responses by all the particulate samples were at same level, except weaker for the RME sample with catalyst. Unlike other samples, EN590-derived particles did not significantly increase ROS production. Catalyst increased the oxidative potential of the EN590 and HVO-derived particles, but decreased that with RME. Overall, the use of biodiesel fuels and catalyst decreased the particulate mass emissions compared with the EN590 fuel. Similar studies with different types of diesel engines are needed to assess the potential benefits from biofuel use in engines with modern technologies. © 2010 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - The Patagonian fungal endophyte NRRL 50072 is reported to produce a variety of medium-chain and highly branched volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that have been highlighted for their potential as fuel alternatives and are collectively termed myco-diesel. To assess the novelty of this observation, we determined the extent to which ten closely related Ascocoryne strains from commercial culture collections possess similar VOC production capability. DNA sequencing established a high genetic similarity between NRRL 50072 and each Ascocoryne isolate, consistent with its reassignment as Ascocoryne sarcoides. The Ascocoryne strains did not produce highly branched medium-chain-length alkanes, and efforts to reproduce the branched alkane production of NRRL 50072 were unsuccessful. However, we confirmed the production of 30 other products and expanded the list of VOCs for NRRL 50072 and members of the genus Ascocoryne. VOCs detected from the cultures consisted of short- and medium-chain alkenes, ketones, esters and alcohols and several sesquiterpenes. Ascocoryne strains NRRL 50072 and CBS 309.71 produced a more diverse range of volatiles than the other isolates tested. CBS 309.71 also showed enhanced production compared with other strains when grown on cellulose agar. Collectively, the members of the genus Ascocoryne demonstrated production of over 100 individual compounds, with a third of the short- and medium-chain compounds also produced when cultures were grown on a cellulose substrate. This comparative production analysis could facilitate future studies to identify and manipulate the biosynthetic machinery responsible for production of individual VOCs, including several that have a potential application as biofuels. © 2010 SGM.

AB  - The extractive acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentations of Clostridium acetobutylicum were evaluated using biodiesel as the in situ extractant. The biodiesel preferentially extracted butanol, minimized product inhibition, and increased production of butanol (from 11.6 to 16.5 gL-1) and total solvents (from 20.0 to 29.9 gL-1) by 42% and 50%, respectively. The fuel properties of the ABE-enriched biodiesel obtained from the extractive fermentations were analyzed. The key quality indicators of diesel fuel, such as the cetane number (increased from 48 to 54) and the cold filter plugging point (decreased from 5.8 to 0.2 °C), were significantly improved for the ABE-enriched biodiesel. Thus, the application of biodiesel as the extractant for ABE fermentation would increase ABE production, bypass the energy intensive butanol recovery process, and result in an ABE-enriched biodiesel with improved fuel properties. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Multi-parameter flow cytometry was used to monitor cell intrinsic light scatter, viability, and lipid content of Rhodotorula glutinis CCMI 145 cells grown in shake flasks. Changes in the side light scatter and forward light scatter were detected during the yeast batch growth, which were attributed to the different yeast growth phases. A progressive increase in the proportion of cells stained with PI (cells with permeabilized cytoplasmic membrane) was observed during the yeast growth, attaining 79% at the end of the fermentation. A high correlation between the Nile Red fluorescence intensity measured by flow cytometry and total lipid content assayed by the traditional gravimetric lipid analysis was found for this yeast, making this method a suitable and quick technique for the screening of yeast strains for lipid production and optimization of biofuel production bioprocesses. Medium growth optimization for enhancement of the yeast oil production is now in progress. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Free fatty acids content plays an important role in selecting the appropriate route for biodiesel production. Oils with high content of free fatty acids can be treated by acid esterification where an alcohol reacts with the given oil in the presence of acid catalyst. In the current study, an equivolume blend of crude rubber seed oil and crude palm oil is fed to the reaction with methanol as the alcohol of choice and sulfuric acid. Selected reaction parameters were optimized, using Taguchi method for design of experiments, to yield the lowest free fatty acid content in the final product. The investigated parameters include alcohol to oil ratio, temperature and amount of catalyst. The effect and significance of each parameter were then studied based on the fractional factorial design and verified by additional experiments. The optimum conditions for acid esterification which could reduce the free fatty acid content in the feedstock to lower than 0.6% (95% reduction) were 65 °C, 15:1 methanol to oil ratio (by mole) and 0.5 wt% H2SO4 after 3 h of reaction time. Temperature had been found to have the most effect on the reduction of free fatty acids followed by reactants ratio while increasing catalyst amount had nominal effect. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel derived from palm oil has been recognized as a high-productivity oil crop among the first generation of biofuels. This study evaluated and discussed the net energy balance for biodiesel in Indonesia by calculating the net energy ratio (NER) and net energy production (NEP) form the total energy input and output. The results of the calculation of energy input for the default scenario demonstrated that the primary energy inputs in the biodiesel production lifecycle were the methanol feedstock, energy input during the biodiesel production process, and urea production. These three items amounted to 85% of the total energy input. Next, we considered and evaluated ways to potentially improve the energy balance by utilizing by-products and biogas from wastewater treatment in the palm oil mill. This result emphasized the importance of utilizing the biomass residue and by-products. Finally, we discussed the need to be aware of energy balance issues between countries when biofuels are transported internationally. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, the exhaust emissions of an unmodified diesel engine fueled with methyl ester of waste frying palm-oil (biodiesel) and its blends with petroleum based diesel fuel (PBDF) were investigated at the full load-variable speed condition. The relationships between the fuel properties and the air-fuel equivalence ratio, fuel line pressure, start of injection (SOI) timing, and ignition delay were also discussed to explain their effects on the emissions. The obtained test results were compared with the reference values which were determined by using PBDF. The results showed that when biodiesel was used in the test engine, the fuel line pressure increased while air-fuel equivalence ratio and ignition delay decreased. These behaviors affected the combustion phenomena of biodiesel which caused to reduction 57% in carbon monoxide (CO) emission, about 40% in unburned hydrocarbon (HC) emission and about 23% in smoke opacity when compared with PBDF. However, NOx and CO2 emissions of the biodiesel have showed different behaviors in terms of the engine speed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The leather industry is an industry which generates a large amount of solid and liquid wastes. Most of the solid wastes originate from the pre-tanning processes while half of it comes from the fleshing step. Raw fleshing wastes which mainly consist of protein and fat have almost no recovery option and the disposal is costly. This study outlines the possibility of using the fleshing waste as an oil source for transesterification reaction. The effect of oil/alcohol molar ratio, the amount of catalyst and temperature on ester production was individually investigated and optimum reaction conditions were determined. The fuel properties of the ester product were also studied according to the EN 14214 standard. Cold filter plugging point and oxidation stability have to be improved in order to use the ester product as an alternative fuel candidate. Besides, this product can be used as a feedstock in lubricant production or cosmetic industry. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With vegetable oil as fuel in diesel engines there is a significant enrichment of the motor fuel with engine oil. This leads to thinning of the oil. With progressive thinning of the oil especially at high thermal loads there is the danger of polymerization of reactive motor fuel components. The lubricating oil thickens suddenly, the result of colloidal chemical processes. It threatens heavy engine damage as a result of a lack of lubrication. Up to now there has been no technical approach to impede the entry of the motor fuel into the engine lubricating oil. To determine optimal oil change intervals and for early recognition of critical oil conditions, an analytical observance of the lubricating oil is urgently needed. For safety reason, the lubricating oil change interval of vegetable oil motors must be reduced to half. There are two analytical methods from which to choose, the one IR spectrometry and the other gas chromatography. They enable qualitative and quantitative determination of vegetable oil infiltration. The discussion covers policy framework conditions for bio motor fuel; motor fuel relevant properties of vegetable oils; analytical methods based on IR spectrometry; analytical methods based on gas chromatography; and summary. The IR spectrometry method is described n DIN 51639-4. This is the method of choice for rapid determination of multi range oils. Factors that unfavorably influence this method are high soot contents, motor oils with ester-containing additives or ester based base oils, additional operation with bio-diesel fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), oil mixtures, and strongly thermal loading of the motor oils (oxidation). The advantage of the chromatographic method is that separate determinations of the impurities in the motor oil with diesel motor fuel, FAME, and vegetable oil fractions are possible but the accuracy is limited. In the GC distillation method, there may be overlapping of the boiling of the motor oil with the boiling range of the vegetable oil. The large number of individual hydrocarbon compounds prevent complete separation.

AB  - The spray atomization and combustion characteristics of canola methyl ester (CME) biofuel are compared to those of petroleum based No. 2 diesel fuel in this paper. The spray flame was contained in an optically accessible combustor which was operated at atmospheric pressure with a co-flow of heated air. Fuel was delivered through a swirl-type air-blast atomizer with an injector orifice diameter of 300 μm. A two-component phase Doppler particle analyzer was used to measure the spray droplet size, axial velocity, and radial velocity distributions. Radial and axial distributions of NO, CO, CO2 and O2 concentrations were also obtained. Axial and radial distributions of flame temperature were recorded with a Pt-Pt/13%Rh (type R) thermocouple. The volumetric flow rates of fuel, atomization air and co-flow air were kept constant for both fuels. The droplet Sauter mean diameter (SMD) at the nozzle exit for CME biofuel spray was smaller than that of the No. 2 diesel fuel spray, implying faster vaporization rates for the former. The flame temperature decreased more rapidly for the CME biofuel spray flame than for the No. 2 diesel fuel spray flame in both axial and radial directions. CME biofuel spray flames produced lower in-flame NO and CO peak concentrations than No. 2 diesel fuel spray flames. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mixed oxides of TiO2-MgO obtained by the sol-gel method were used to convert waste cooking oil into biodiesel. Titanium improved the stability of the catalyst because of the defects induced by the substitution of Ti ions for Mg ions in the magnesia lattice. The best catalyst was determined to be MT-1-923, which is comprised of an Mg/Ti molar ratio of 1 and calcined at 923K, based on an assessment of the activity and stability of the catalyst. The main reaction parameters, including methanol/oil molar ratio, catalyst amount, and temperature, were investigated. The catalytic activity of MT-1-923 decreased slowly in the reuse process. After regeneration, the activity of MT-1-923 slightly increased compared with that of the fresh catalyst due to an increase in the specific surface area and average pore diameter. The mixed oxides catalyst, TiO2-MgO, showed good potential in large-scale biodiesel production from waste cooking oil. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The feasibility of biodiesel production from tung (Vernicia montana) oil was investigated with respect to the transesterification yield and biodiesel properties. Tung oil has poor oxidation stability due to the instability of the conjugated carbon-carbon double bonds in the α-elaeostearic acid. The methyl elaeostearate is the predominant component (82.2wt.%) of the tung oil biodiesel. The tung oil biodiesel has the low cold filter plugging point of -11°C, ester content of 94.9wt.%, and oxidation stability (110°C) of 0.3h. Moreover, the tung oil biodiesel exhibits the high density of 903kg/m3at 15°C, kinematic viscosity of 7.84mm2/s at 40°C, and iodine value of 161.1g I2/100g. The properties of the tung oil biodiesel can be improved by blending with canola and palm oil biodiesels to satisfy the biodiesel specifications. In addition, multiple linear correlations between biodiesel properties and its methyl ester composition were established. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper describes a new scheme to convert anhydrosugars found in pyrolysis oils into ethanol and lipids. Pyrolytic sugars were separated from phenols by solvent extraction and were hydrolyzed into glucose using sulfuric acid as a catalyst. Toxicological studies showed that phenols and acids were the main species inhibiting growth of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The sulfuric acids, and carboxylic acids from the bio-oils, were neutralized with Ba(OH)2. The phase rich in sugar was further detoxified with activated carbon. The resulting aqueous phase rich in glucose was fermented with three different yeasts: S. cerevisiae to produce ethanol, and Cryptococcus curvatus and Rhodotorula glutinis to produce lipids. Yields as high as 0.473g ethanol/g glucose and 0.167g lipids/g sugar (0.266g ethanol equivalent/g sugar), were obtained. These results confirm that pyrolytic sugar fermentation to produce ethanol is more efficient than for lipid production. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Triglycerides obtained from animals and plants have attracted great attention from researchers for developing an environmental friendly and high-quality fuel, free of nitrogen and sulfur. In the present work, the production of biofuel by catalytic cracking of soybean oil over a basic catalyst in a continuous pyrolysis reactor at atmospheric pressure has been studied. Experiments were designed to study the effect of different types of catalysts on the yield and acid value of the diesel and gasoline fractions from the pyrolytic oil. It was found that basic catalyst gave a product with relatively low acid number. These pyrolytic oils were also further reacted with alcohol in order to decrease their acid value. After esterification, the physico-chemical properties of these biofuels were characterized, and compared with Chinese specifications for conventional diesel fuels. The results showed that esterification of pyrolytic oil from triglycerides represents an alternative technique for producing biofuels from soybean oils with characteristics similar to those of petroleum fuels. © 2010.

AB  - For economic reasons, multi-feedstock plants are preferred to produce biodiesel. However, the optimal conditions of the transesterification reaction depend on the raw material, thus making difficult the achievement of a high yield of biodiesel when different types of feedstock are used under the same operational settings. In the present work, a response surface methodology is proposed to both predict biodiesel yield when different raw materials are used to produce biodiesel and to determine the optimal operational conditions of a multi-feedstock plant. The optimization of the transesterification reaction of five vegetable oils consisting in a wide range of fatty acid profiles has been carried out. Results provided a compromise zone where all the experimental responses satisfied the imposed specifications to achieve the goals, where the best optimal combination of parameters was selected. According to this model, the tested properties of the produced biodiesel are within the limits of the EN 14214 standard. It can be concluded that this methodology provides the most suitable operational conditions to achieve the highest biodiesel yield in a multi-feedstock biodiesel plant, also considering the economics of the process. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The importance of the economical production and usage of new generation biofuels, the so-called bio gas oil (paraffins from triglycerides) and the results of the investigation for their productability on the CoMo/Al2O3 catalyst, which was activated by reduction, are presented. The conversion of triglycerides, the yield of total organic fractions and the target product, furthermore the type and ratio of deoxygenation reactions were determined as a function of process parameters. The advantageous process parameters were found (380°C, 40-60bar, 500-600Nm3/m3 H2/sunflower oil ratio, 1.0h-1), where the conversion of triglycerides was 100% and the yield of the target fraction [high paraffin containing (&gt;99%) gas oil boiling range product] was relatively high (73.7-73.9%). The deoxygenation of triglycerides the reduction as well as the decarboxylation/decarbonylation reactions took place. The yield of the target fractions did not achieve the theoretical values (81.4-86.5%). That is why it is necessary to separate the target fraction and recirculate the heavy fraction. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is a promising non-toxic and biodegradable alternative fuel used in the transport sector. Nevertheless, the higher viscosity and density of biodiesel poses some acute problems when it is used it in unmodified engine. Taking this into consideration, this study has been focused towards two objectives. The first objective is to identify the effect of temperature on density and viscosity for a variety of biodiesels and also to develop a correlation between density and viscosity for these biodiesels. The second objective is to investigate and quantify the effects of density and viscosity of the biodiesels and their blends on various components of the engine fuel supply system such as fuel pump, fuel filters and fuel injector. To achieve first objective density and viscosity of rapeseed oil biodiesel, corn oil biodiesel and waste oil biodiesel blends (0B, 5B, 10B, 20B, 50B, 75B, and 100B) were tested at different temperatures using EN ISO 3675:1998 and EN ISO 3104:1996 standards. For both density and viscosity new correlations were developed and compared with published literature. A new correlation between biodiesel density and biodiesel viscosity was also developed. The second objective was achieved by using analytical models showing the effects of density and viscosity on the performance of fuel supply system. These effects were quantified over a wide range of engine operating conditions. It can be seen that the higher density and viscosity of biodiesel have a significant impact on the performance of fuel pumps and fuel filters as well as on air-fuel mixing behaviour of compression ignition (CI) engine. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Emissions from land transport, and from road transport in particular, have significant impacts on the atmosphere and on climate change. This assessment gives an overview of past, present and future emissions from land transport, of their impacts on the atmospheric composition and air quality, on human health and climate change and on options for mitigation.In the past vehicle exhaust emission control has successfully reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter. This contributed to improved air quality and reduced health impacts in industrialised countries. In developing countries however, pollutant emissions have been growing strongly, adversely affecting many populations. In addition, ozone and particulate matter change the radiative balance and hence contribute to global warming on shorter time scales. Latest knowledge on the magnitude of land transport's impact on global warming is reviewed here.In the future, road transport's emissions of these pollutants are expected to stagnate and then decrease globally. This will then help to improve the air quality notably in developing countries. On the contrary, emissions of carbon dioxide and of halocarbons from mobile air conditioners have been globally increasing and are further expected to grow. Consequently, road transport's impact on climate is gaining in importance. The expected efficiency improvements of vehicles and the introduction of biofuels will not be sufficient to offset the expected strong growth in both, passenger and freight transportation. Technical measures could offer a significant reduction potential, but strong interventions would be needed as markets do not initiate the necessary changes. Further reductions would need a resolute expansion of low-carbon fuels, a tripling of vehicle fuel efficiency and a stagnation in absolute transport volumes. Land transport will remain a key sector in climate change mitigation during the next decades. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae have long been recognized as potentially good sources for biofuel production because of their high oil content and rapid biomass production. The oil productivity of many microalgae exceeds the best producing oil crops. In recent years, use of microalgae as an alternative biodiesel feedstock has gained renewed interest from researchers, entrepreneurs, and the general public. Biodiesel produced from microalgae is being investigated as an alternative. The lipid and fatty acid contents of microalgae vary in accordance with culture conditions. The average fatty acid contents of the algal oils are 36% oleic (18:1), 15% palmitic (16:0), 11% stearic (18:0), 8.4% iso-17:0, and 7.4% linoleic (18:2). © Sila Science.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to discuss present challenges and future prospects for production and use of biofuels as alternative energy pathways to sustainable development. The dramatic increase in the price of petroleum, the finite nature of fossil fuels, increasing concerns regarding environmental impact, especially related to greenhouse gas emissions, and health and safety considerations are forcing the search for new energy sources and alternative ways to power the world's motor vehicles. Interest in the use of biofuels worldwide has grown strongly in recent years due to the high oil prices, concerns about climate change from GHG emissions and the desire to promote domestic rural economies. Developing countries have a comparative advantage for bio-fuel production because of greater availability of land, favorable climatic conditions for agriculture and lower labor costs. In developed countries there is a growing trend towards employing modern technologies and efficient bio-energy conversion using a range of bio-fuels, which are becoming cost-wise competitive with fossil fuels. © Sila Science.

AB  - In order to determine whether the production of biofuels in Chile is economically feasible, an evaluation at farmer and plant production level was carried out, considering five species grown in different productive systems. Analysis of results showed that agricultural profitability ranged between -43.2 % and 30.4 %, that is, some options would be unsustainable. In plant, the ethanol and biodiesel production was profitable by using corn (Zea mays L.) and rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) as an input. However, only the domestic production of rapeseed-based biodiesel could provide a 2 % substitution of fossil fuels by biofuels. Finally, by June 2008, WTI oil prices required to justify the production of ethanol and biodiesel would be US$144.6 barrel-1 and US$184.6 barrel-1.

AB  - This paper addresses a problem of locating warehouses and plants producing ethanol and biodiesel in Chile. A facility location model that minimizes the costs involved from the production of agricultural crops to the distribution of biofuels to major consumption centers was proposed. Scenarios of 2, 5, and 10% substitution of gasoline demand and 2, 5, and 8% diesel projected to 2010 were evaluated. Three plant sizes were considered: 40 000, 80 000 and 100 000 m3 year -1 for those producing ethanol and 20 000, 40 000 and 60 000 m3 year-1, for those producing biodiesel. Potential locations of biofuel plants were mostly from Region VII to Region X, due to the availability of crops, distance to centers of consumption and soil value.

AB  - This study evaluates the energy and carbon footprints and land, water, and labor requirements of biodiesel production from canola in Western Australia (WA). The results show that canola-based biodiesel leads to limited energy profit and CO2 equivalent (CO2-e) emissions savings. Even when all byproduct are utilized, a relatively low output/input energy ratio of 1.72 and a CO2-e emissions savings of only 0.52 kg of CO 2-e/L of biodiesel are obtained under the WA conditions considered in this study. A land requirement of 1.66 - 10-3 ha/L of biodiesel means that canola-based biodiesel seems to also be limited to &lt;2% replacement of total diesel consumption in WAs transport sector to avoid significant competition with food production for arable land. When some of the biodiesel is invested back into the production process to make the process independent of nonrenewable fuels, the competition for arable land use is even more severe, rendering it unfeasible to replace diesel fuel by the net biodiesel. Also, there would not be enough net biodiesel to support the transport activities that are usually supported by diesel fuel in the WA transport sector, and no CO 2-e emissions savings would be achieved from replacing diesel fuel by net biodiesel. Overall, canola-based biodiesel is not sustainable to replace a significant fraction of diesel consumption in the WA transport sector. It can only play a limited role by offering some energy and CO2-e emissions savings and by providing immediate opportunities for introducing new transport fuels in the marketplace and developing familiarity among the consumers in our transition to a future sustainable biofuel supply. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This analysis presents a comparison of life-cycle GHG emissions from synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) produced as jet fuel substitute from jatropha curcas feedstock cultivated in Brazil against a reference scenario of conventional jet fuel. Life cycle inventory data are derived from surveys of actual Jatropha growers and processors. Results indicate that a baseline scenario, which assumes a medium yield of 4 tons of dry fruit per hectare under drip irrigation with existing logistical conditions using energy-based coproduct allocation methodology, and assumes a 20-year plantation lifetime with no direct land use change (dLUC), results in the emissions of 40 kg CO2e per GJ of fuel produced, a 55% reduction relative to conventional jet fuel. However, dLUC based on observations of land-use transitions leads to widely varying changes in carbon stocks ranging from losses in excess of 50 tons of carbon per hectare when Jatropha is planted in native cerrado woodlands to gains of 10-15 tons of carbon per hectare when Jatropha is planted in former agro-pastoral land. Thus, aggregate emissions vary from a low of 13 kg CO 2e per GJ when Jatropha is planted in former agro-pastoral lands, an 85% decrease from the reference scenario, to 141 kg CO2e per GJ when Jatropha is planted in cerrado woodlands, a 60% increase over the reference scenario. Additional sensitivities are also explored, including changes in yield, exclusion of irrigation, shortened supply chains, and alternative allocation methodologies. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - An assessment of the sensitivities of the critical parameters in the ASTM D6423 documentary standard method for the measurement of pHe in (bio)ethanol has been undertaken. Repeatability of measurements made using the same glass electrode and reproducibility between different glass electrodes have been identified as the main contributors to the uncertainty of the values produced. Strategies to reduce the uncertainty of the measurement have been identified and tested. Both increasing the time after which the pHe measurement is made following immersion in the sample, and rinsing the glass electrode with ethanol prior to immersion in the sample, have been shown to be effective in reducing the uncertainty of the numerical value produced. However, it is acknowledged that the values produced using these modified approaches may not be directly compared with those obtained using the documentary ASTM method since pHe is defined operationally by the process used to measure it. © 2010 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Microalgae-derived biodiesel is considered a highly promising next-generation biofuel, as current fossil fuel reserves are being depleted and combusted causing GHG emissions. Microalgae are arguably the most efficient renewable biofuel source to cover our current and future demand without competing for arable land or natural areas rich in biodiversity. Microalgae are sunlight-driven organisms that convert CO2 to starch and a variety of lipids with applications such as biofuels, foods, animal feeds and high-value bioactive products. The critical parameters affecting species selection for biodiesel production are growth rate, lipid content, lipid productivity and fatty acid composition. Previous research papers and review articles commonly discuss growth parameters of single species, but few report a comprehensive comparison of several microalgae and provide data for lipid productivity in terms of g m-2 day-1 as done by Huerlimann et al. This allows for a direct comparison of microalgal lipid productivity to terrestrial production systems; thus making comparisons between volumetric and area productivity of lipids possible, which is necessary for large-scale production. Distinctively, Huerlimann et al. also study the effects of different growth media on lipid production and composition during different growth phases. © 2010 Future Science Ltd.

AB  - Different geographic seed sources (80) of Jatropha curcas L. were collected in South China and planted in a germplasm resource garden to study their biological and agricultural properties. The average ground diameter, tree height and crown size of two-year old plants of the 80 sources was 7.6 cm, 167 cm and 114 cm, respectively, the average 1000-seed weight was 0.676 (0.477-0.876) kg. The trees grew further to the average size of 12.6 cm diameter, 2.69 m height and 2.1 m crown at the 4th year. Among the 80 sources, six sources had higher oil yield (seed oil content of 40%-42%) and better behaving in expression of phenotype were selected for a small-scale trial of forestation to determine oil yield. Among them a provenance with outstand in expression of phenotype yielded 964.3, 2000.6 and 2858.7 kg/ha was achieved for two- three- and four-year old trees, respectively. Additionally, a new Jatropha mutant was found in the wild and hybridization experiments showed that its oil content increased by 6%. © 2010 CJB, All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodisel is a type of biofuel having similar properties of diesel fuel but lacks substances (undesirable emissions) such as sulfur, nitrogen and aromatic polycyclic. Upon filtration of waste oil, the biodiesel fuel was produced via carrying out transestrification reaction of triglycerides followed by conducting viscosity, density, flash point, cloud point, pour point and copper strip corrosion tests on the samples and comparing with EN14214 and ASTM 6751 standards and all results were found in the permitted limit. The highest yield of biodiesel production reaction was found 46.6435 g when Sodium Hydroxide catalyst in amount of 0.375g was employed, 44.2347 g when Sodium methoxide catalyst in amount of 0.5g was employed and 56.5124 g when acid sulfuric catalyst in amount of 1g was employed and 47.3290 g when two stage reaction was done.

AB  - Biodiesel, known as fatty acid methyl ester, has become increasingly important due to the following advantages: it is renewable, biodegradable, non-toxic, and eco-friendly. At present, the main hurdle for its commercialization is high feedstock price. Crude soybean oil may be a cheap source for biodiesel production. However, it contains high amount of phosphorus, which can inhibit the action of the catalyst during transesterification. The degumming process can remove most of phosphorus in the crude soybean oil. In this paper, different degumming methods were investigated and an optimal method was determined based on phosphorus content, free fatty acid, and bound glycerin tests. Crude soybean oil degummed by the optimal method was further transesterified, and the fuel properties, including acid number, water and sediment, flash point, soap, moisture, methanol content, and free and total glycerin, etc., were further evaluated. It was found that the fuel properties were within ASTM D 6751 specifications. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper discusses the synthesis of biodiesel catalyzed by solid base of K2CO3/HT using Jatropha curcas oil as feedstock. Mg-Al hydrotalcite was prepared using co-precipitation methods, in which the molar ratio of Mg to Al was 3:1. After calcined at 600 °C for 3 h, the Mg-Al hydrotalcite and K2CO3 were grinded and mixed according to certain mass ratios, in which some water was added. The mixture was dried at 65 °C, and after that it was calcined at 600 °C for 3 h. Then, this Mg-Al hydrotalcite loaded with potassium carbonate was obtained and used as catalyst in the experiments. Analyses of XRD and SEM characterizations for catalyst showed the metal oxides formed in the process of calcination brought about excellent catalysis effect. In order to achieve the optimal technical reaction condition, five impact factors were also investigated in the experiments, which were mass ratio, molar ratio, reaction temperature, catalyst amount and reaction time. Under the best condition, the biodiesel yield could reach up to 96%. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Purvin & Gertz Inc has released a report on the effect low-carbon-fuel standards (LCFS) on oil sands. The report notes that LCFS programs are being implemented in California, Oregon, and British Columbia. They are under consideration in many other states and provinces and are becoming regional in nature. LCFS programs differ by jurisdiction, but have in common mandated reductions in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels. By targeting petroleum-derived gasoline and diesel and promoting low-carbon alternative energy forms such as electricity, hydrogen, natural gas and next generation biofuels, LCFS programs are intended to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions on a well-to-wheels basis. In effect, LCFS programs contribute to an off-oil strategy.

AB  - An endophytic fungus of Persea indica was identified, on the basis of its anamorphic stage, as Nodulosporium sp. by SEM. Partial sequence analysis of ITS rDNA revealed the identity of the teleomorphic stage of the fungus as Hypoxylon sp. It produces an impressive spectrum of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), most notably 1,8-cineole, 1-methyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene, and tentatively identified (+)-.alpha.-methylene-.alpha.-fenchocamphorone, among many others, most of which are unidentified. Six-day-old cultures of Hypoxylon sp. displayed maximal VOC-antimicrobial activity against Botrytis cinerea, Phytophthora cinnamomi, Cercospora beticola, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum suggesting that the VOCs may play some role in the biology of the fungus and its survival in its host plant. Media containing starch- or sugar-related substrates best supported VOC production by the fungus. Direct on-line quantification of VOCs was measured by proton transfer mass spectrometry covering a continuous range with optimum VOC production occurred at 6 days at 145 ppmv with a rate of production of 7.65 ppmv/h. This report unequivocally demonstrates that 1,8-cineole (a monoterpene) is produced by a microorganism, which represents a novel and important source of this compound. This monoterpene is an octane derivative and has potential use as a fuel additive as do the other VOCs of this organism. Thus, fungal sourcing of this compound and other VOCs as produced by Hypoxylon sp. greatly expands their potential applications in medicine, industry, and energy production. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Willingness to pay (WTP) for E85 (automotive fuel blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) was estimated from a contingent choice exercise contained in a national survey of consumers. The choice exercise included E85 blends from three different feedstock sources (corn grain, switchgrass, and wood wastes) and an E10 blend (10% ethanol and 90% gasoline) with corn grain as the ethanol feedstock. Results from the study indicate willingness to pay a premium for E85 from switchgrass compared with E10 from corn. Concerns about land use for "food versus fuel" had a negative impact on WTP for E85 from corn grain, while greater concerns about fuel security relative to the environment had a positive impact. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel is a sustainable, non-toxic, biodegradable diesel fuel substitute that can be employed in current diesel car infrastructure without major modifications in the engines. It has a significant added value compared to petroleum-based diesel, reflected in a series of improved properties including fewer carcinogenic particulate matter emissions, increased lubricity and biodegradability as well as ease of handling, transport and storage. Nevertheless, it is essential that the biodiesel life-cycle is environmentally sustainable, economically viable, and socially acceptable; views that can only be properly analysed by means of a multi-angle approach. In this contribution, we aim to provide a multidisciplinary perspective on key issues for the successful implementation of biodiesel as a petrol fuel replacement including green chemistry methods to improve production and quality, the use of energy crops and feedstocks for second-generation biodiesel as well as socio-economic studies and the importance of governmental regulatory issues. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The aim of the research was to evaluate the influence of biodiesel on the microorganisms biomass and dehydrogenase activity. Biodiesel was introduced into the soil at a concentration of 1.5 and 10%. The influence of biofuel on the amount of biomass of living microorganisms was various and depended on the dose which was used. Stimulation of dehydrogenases activity was observed in 1% dose of biodiesel (about 60-300% higher than the values in non-contaminated soil). Higher doses, within a longer period of time, had a negative influence on microorganisms (reduction of their activity up to 35-92% compared to the control).

AB  - Microalgal oil is a potential energy source because it can be easily converted to fatty acid methyl ester or hydrocarbon type of diesel, and it is produced with relatively higher productivity compared with oil from plants and animals. Heterotrophic growth of microalgae is superior due to its high final product concentration; however, the cost of the raw materials is unacceptable if sugar is utilized as the carbon source. The aim of this study is to optimize the lipid accumulation of Chlorella protothecoides by using carbon sources other than glucose in heterotrophic and mixotrophic cultures. Different factors such as different carbon sources, carbon to nitrogen ratio, initial pH level, salinity, and rotational speed are studied in affecting the cell growth and the oil accumulation. Our experiments revealed that the heterotrophic and mixotrophic cultures of C. protothecoides grew better than autotrophic cultures. C. protothecoides can grow on glycerol or acetate, as well as on glucose. Several stress factors were confirmed or discovered to significantly increase the lipid content of microalgae cells. The replacement of glycerol and acetate as carbon sources for microalgae cultivations provides potential for waste utilization: glycerol from biodiesel industry and acetate from biohydrogen production. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Biofuels are set to play an important role in the future strategy of automotive fuel suppliers, and therefore the study of using alcohols in spark ignition engines has become a necessity. A simple thermodynamic model was developed for calculating air-fuel mixture parameters for port injection engines fueled with gasoline-isobutanol blends, and theoretical results were compared to experimental values. For simulating the evaporation process, gasoline was considered a mixture of four components, with isobutanol added in different proportions. As all engine components are at ambient temperature during cold starts, mixture formation was considered an adiabatic process, with the fuel breaking up into droplets and evaporating, thus resulting in a temperature drop. A port injection engine fitted to a passenger car was used to validate the model for calculating air-fuel mixture parameters. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This techno-economic study examines fast pyrolysis of corn stover to bio-oil with subsequent upgrading of the bio-oil to naphtha and diesel range fuels. Two 2000 dry tonne per day scenarios are developed: the first scenario separates a fraction of the bio-oil to generate hydrogen on-site for fuel upgrading, while the second scenario relies on merchant hydrogen. The modeling effort resulted in liquid fuel production rates of 134 and 220 million liters per year for the hydrogen production and purchase scenarios, respectively. Capital costs for these plants are $287 and $200 million. Fuel product value estimates are $3.09 and $2.11 per gallon of gasoline equivalent ($0.82 and $0.56 per liter). While calculated costs of this biofuel are competitive with other kinds of alternative fuels, further research is required to better determine the effect of feedstock properties and process conditions on the ultimate yield of liquid fuel from bio-oil. Pioneer plant analysis estimates capital costs to be $911 and $585 million for construction of a first-of-a-kind fast pyrolysis and upgrading biorefinery with product values of $6.55 and $3.41 per gge ($1.73 and $0.90 per liter). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this study is to evaluate a select set of financial incentive instruments that can be employed by the Norwegian government for encouraging early investment and production experience in wood-based Fischer-Tropsch diesel (FTD) technologies as a means to accelerate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) stemming from road-based transport. We start by performing an economic analysis of FTD produced from Norwegian forest biomass at a pioneer commercial plant in Norway, followed with a cost growth analysis to estimate production costs after uncertainty in early plant performance and capital cost estimates are considered. Results after the cost growth analysis imply that the initial production cost estimates for a pioneer producer may be underestimated by up to 30%. Using the revised estimate we then assess, through scenarios, how various financial support mechanisms designed to encourage near-term investment would affect production costs over a range of uncertain future oil prices. For all policy scenarios considered, we evaluate trade-offs between the levels of public expenditure, or subsidy, and private investor profitability. When considering the net present value of the subsidy required to incentivize commercial investment during a future of low oil prices, we find that GHG mitigation via wood-FTD is likely to be considered cost-ineffective. However, should the government expect that mean oil prices in the coming two decades will hover between $97 and 127/bbl, all the incentive policies considered would likely spur investment at net present values ≤$-100/tonne-fossil-CO2-equivalent avoided. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With energy security, economic stabilization, and environmental sustainability being at the forefront of US policy making, the development of biodiesel production and use within the United States has been growing at an astonishing rate. According to the latest DOE energy report, biodiesel production and consumption in the US has decreased since its peak in 2008, but still remains an important factor in the US energy mix. However, despite recent studies showing that B5 has similar performance qualities to that of the currently used ultra-low-sulfur petroleum diesel (ULSD) fleet managers and corporations still remain hesitant regarding a switch to B5. This research examined the major areas of concern that arise with transitioning fleets from ULSD to B5 with the goal of alleviating those concerns with quantitative results from an actual fleet implementation and transition. In conjunction with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) a comparison of cost, cold weather fuel properties, engine performance, fuel economy, and maintenance and repairs was conducted using data obtained over 3 years from a pilot study. The results found that B5 performed as well or better than ULSD in all performance metrics. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study assesses the security of feedstock supply to satisfy the increased demand for bio-ethanol production based on the recent 15 years biofuels development plan and target (year 2008-2022) of the Thai government. Future bio-ethanol systems are modeled and the feedstock supply potentials analyzed based on three scenarios including low-, moderate- and high-yields improvement. The three scenarios are modeled and key dimensions including availability; diversity; and environmental acceptability of feedstocks supply in terms of GHG reduction are evaluated through indicators such as net feedstock balances, Shannon index and net life cycle GHG emissions. The results show that only the case of high yields improvement scenario can result in a reliable and sufficient supply of feedstocks to satisfy the long-term demands for bio-ethanol and other related industries. Cassava is identified as the critical feedstock and a reduction in cassava export is necessary. The study concludes that to enhance long-term security of feedstocks supply for sustainable bio-ethanol production in Thailand, increasing use of sugarcane juice as feedstock, improved yields of existing feedstocks and promoting production of bio-ethanol derived from agricultural residues are three key recommendations that need to be urgently implemented by the policy makers. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Following the global trend, India declared its biofuel policy in which biodiesel, primarily from jatropha, would meet 20% of the diesel demand beginning with 2011-2012. To promote biofuel, Indian government has announced biodiesel purchase price as well as compulsory blending ratio. But, these measures have not worked to create large scale biodiesel production in India. With this backdrop, this paper highlights about the importance of a sound pricing policy focusing on the entire value chain of biodiesel production. The analysis is based on field level data from Chhattisgarh, the leading state in the production of jatropha. Such a sound pricing policy has to deal with the prices of feedstock, by-products and final product like biodiesel. It would also have to reflect on the business model of production of biodiesel. The simulation exercises in our model shows that the business returns from the production of biodiesel and the minimum support price (MSP) of the feedstock for biodiesel (i.e. jatropha seeds in this case) are sensitive to various parameters like seed yields, technological efficiency, by product and petro-diesel prices. An effective price policy framework has to consider all these factors to create a platform for sustainable biodiesel production in India. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The problems related to our strong dependency on fossil fuels, i.e. greenhouse effect, energy dependency, urban pollution, are of growing importance in recent years. European Union (EU) Action plan of 2003, which had originated from Kyoto Agreement, defined a strategy for substitution of 20% of conventional fuel with the alternative one by 2020. Proved advantages of biodiesel usage in the system of public transport of passengers, with regard to exhaust gases emission above all, have been the decisive determinants for the actual promotion of biodiesel as ecologically "clean" fuel, while its wider usage gives important contribution to sustainable development of cities. This paper presents results of biodiesel-test run in Belgrade, as a part of the project BIO-PEX, which relates to the usage of this alternative fuel in real operating conditions in urban public transport system, with special emphasis on technical, ecological and operational aspects of biofuel usage. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Tung oil, produced from seeds of the tung tree (Vernicia fordii), is a valuable industrial oil. Genetic engineering can improve the oil content, making it more suitable for use in biodiesel, and the pivotal role of DGAT2 in triacylglycerol synthesis has been extensively studied. Our data indicated, however, that DGAT2 expression decreases rapidly during the late period of oil accumulation, which raises the possibility that other key genes might play important roles in triacylglycerol synthesis. Construction of a tung kernel cDNA library and related biochemical analyses was carried out. Notably, F-BOX genes and oleosin-coding genes responsible for oil body structure were the most abundant ESTs in our cDNA library. All the results indicate that F-BOX and oleosin might be actively involved in tung lipid metabolism and serve as additional candidate genes for genetic engineering of the tung tree. © 2010.

AB  - Numerical modeling of the vaporization characteristics of multi-component fuel mixtures is performed in this study. The fuel mixtures studied include those of binary components, biodiesel, diesel-biodiesel, and gasoline-ethanol. The use of biofuels has become increasingly important for reasons of environmental sustainability. Biofuels are often blended with petroleum fuels, and the detailed understanding of the vaporization process is essential to designing a clean and efficient combustion system. In this study, a hybrid vaporization model is developed that uses continuous thermodynamics to describe petroleum fuels and discrete components to represent biofuels. The model is validated using the experimental data of n-heptane, n-heptane-n-decane mixture, and biodiesel. Since biodiesel properties are not universal due to the variation in feedstock, methods for predicting biodiesel properties based on the five dominant fatty acid components are introduced. Good levels of agreement in the predicted and measured drop size histories are obtained. Furthermore, in modeling the diesel-biodiesel drop, results show that the drop lifetime increases with the biodiesel concentration in the blend. During vaporization, only the lighter components of diesel fuel vaporize at the beginning. Biodiesel components do not vaporize until some time during the vaporization process. On the other hand, results of gasoline-ethanol drops indicate that both fuels start to vaporize once the process begins. At the beginning, the lighter components of gasoline have a slightly higher vaporization rate than ethanol. After a certain time, ethanol vaporizes faster than the remaining gasoline components. At the end, the drop reduces to a regular gasoline drop with heavier components. Overall, the drop lifetime increases as the concentration of ethanol increases in the drop due to the higher latent heat. © 2010 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - In this work, water-in-oil emulsions (W/O) and ethanol-in-oil emulsions (E/O) emulsions were prepared successfully by membrane emulsification. The emulsifiers selected were PGPR and MO-750 for the W/O and E/O emulsions, respectively. For W/O emulsions prepared with an oil pre-filled membrane, the dispersed flux was lower and the droplet size sharper than that obtained with a water pre-filled membrane. On the contrary, for E/O emulsions prepared with the membrane pre-filled with oil, the dispersed phase (ethanol) rapidly pushed out the oil from the membrane pores. Therefore, the pre-treatment of the membrane had almost no effect on the dispersed phase flux and on the droplet size. The droplet size distribution of the E/O emulsion was close to that obtained with a classical homogenizer. The dispersed phase fluxes were high and no fouling was observed for our experimental conditions (1.6 l emulsion, 10 wt% ethanol). These results confirm that membrane emulsification could be an interesting alternative for the preparation of E/O emulsions for the purpose of biodiesel fuels, considering the scale-up ability of membranes and their potentiality for industrial processes. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study focuses on biodiesel production from residues in particular tallow and used cooking oil (UCO). Ireland has 8% of the EU cattle herd with less than 1% of the EU population. Thus a significant quantity of slaughter residues is available for energy production. The total energy potential associated with slaughter wastes and UCO is estimated to be 7.07 PJ/a; 61% of which is suitable for biodiesel production. The potential quantity of biodiesel is equivalent to 2.1% of predicted transport fuel use in 2010; three quarters of the 2010 biofuels target. Biodiesel production from these two residue streams may be expressed as equivalent to 22% of arable land in Ireland under oilseed rape. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present paper describes a method of controlling the time of ignition in homogeneous-charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion. In the described experiments some control of ignition timing in HCCI combustion is achieved through alteration of the fuel molecular structure using a chemical reaction of the fuel with ozone, prior to introduction of the fuel into the combustion chamber. Controlling ignition timing is essential, in achieving high thermal efficiency and low pollutant emission in HCCI engine operation. To this end, ignition should occur in the vicinity of piston top-dead-centre (TDC), the point of maximum compression of the fuel-air charge. The present paper proposes a method of controlling the time of ignition of the fuel-air charge by adapting the ignitability of the fuel through prior chemical reaction of the fuel with ozone. Ozone can be readily produced using air in conjunction with a corona discharge ozoniser and may be brought into contact with the fuel in a reaction chamber before its injection into the engine. It was shown through experiments that an acetal fuel which has undergone treatment with ozone, ignites earlier during the engine cycle in HCCI combustion, than fuel which has not undergone treatment with ozone, as a result of changes in its molecular structure prior to combustion. The observed changes in molecular structure consisted primarily in the formation of peroxides within the fuel. This method can be used to operate an engine in HCCI combustion mode with some control over the point of ignition of the fuel-air charge by varying the proportions of fuel previously treated with ozone and fuel not treated with ozone. The experiments showed that the time of ignition could be controlled, whilst keeping other parameters such as the load and speed of the engine, and pressure and temperature of the intake air and fuel, constant. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of refuse derived fuels with different catalysts had been conducted in a two stages process due to its important potential value as fuel. The first stage was a pure thermal pyrolysis in a horizontal tubular reactor with feed rate of 0.5kg hourly. The second stage was a semi-batch process in the presence of catalysts. Results showed that the tested catalysts significantly have affected the quantity of products. E.g. gas yield could be increased with 350% related to the catalyst free case using ZSM-5, while that of pyrolytic oil was 115% over Y-zeolite. Gases consisted of mainly CO and CO2 obtained from the tubular reactor, while dominantly hydrocarbons from the second stage. Ni-Mo-catalyst and Co-Mo-catalyst had shown activity in pyrolytic oil upgrading via in-situ hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reactions. Sulphur, nitrogen and chlorine level in pyrolytic oils could be significantly declined by using of catalysts. © 2010.

AB  - This study aimed to achieve higher CO2 consumption ability and lipid productivity of an indigenous microalgal isolate Scenedesmus obliquus CNW-N by a two-stage cultivation strategy. The microalga strain was first cultivated with 10% CO2 using a nutrient-rich medium to promote cell growth, which was followed by a nutrient-deficient condition to trigger lipid accumulation. The optimal biomass productivity, lipid productivity, and CO2 consumption rate were 292.50mgL-1d-1, 78.73mgL-1d-1 (38.9% lipid content per dry weight of biomass), and 549.90mgL-1d-1, respectively. This performance is superior to the results from most of the related studies. Under the nutrient-deficient condition, the microalgal lipid was mainly composed of C16/C18 fatty acids (accounting for 89% of total fatty acids), which is suitable for biodiesel synthesis. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The search for alternatives to fossil fuels is boosting interest in biodiesel production. Among the crops used to produce biodiesel, palm trees stand out due to their high productivity and positive energy balance. This work assesses life cycle emissions and the energy balance of biodiesel production from palm oil in Brazil. The results are compared through a meta-analysis to previous published studies: Wood and Corley (1991) [Wood BJ, Corley RH. The energy balance of oil palm cultivation. In: PORIM intl. palm oil conference - agriculture; 1991.], Malaysia; Yusoff and Hansen (2005) [Yusoff S, Hansen SB. Feasibility study of performing an life cycle assessment on crude palm oil production in Malaysia. International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment 2007;12:50-8], Malaysia; Angarita et al. (2009) [Angarita EE, Lora EE, Costa RE, Torres EA. The energy balance in the palm oil-derived methyl ester (PME) life cycle for the cases in Brazil and Colombia. Renewable Energy 2009;34:2905-13], Colombia; Pleanjai and Gheewala (2009) [Pleanjai S, Gheewala SH. Full chain energy analysis of biodiesel production from palm oil in Thailand. Applied Energy 2009;86:S209-14], Thailand; and Yee et al. (2009) [Yee KF, Tan KT, Abdullah AZ, Lee KT. Life cycle assessment of palm biodiesel: revealing facts and benefits for sustainability. Applied Energy 2009;86:S189-96], Malaysia. In our study, data for the agricultural phase, transport, and energy content of the products and co-products were obtained from previous assessments done in Brazil. The energy intensities and greenhouse gas emission factors were obtained from the Simapro 7.1.8. software and other authors. These factors were applied to the inputs and outputs listed in the selected studies to render them comparable. The energy balance for our study was 1:5.37. In comparison the range for the other studies is between 1:3.40 and 1:7.78. Life cycle emissions determined in our assessment resulted in 1437kgCO2e/ha, while our analysis based on the information provided by other authors resulted in 2406kgCO2e/ha, on average. The Angarita et al. (2009) [Angarita EE, Lora EE, Costa RE, Torres EA. The energy balance in the palm oil-derived methyl ester (PME) life cycle for the cases in Brazil and Colombia. Renewable Energy 2009;34:2905-13] study does not report emissions. When compared to diesel on a energy basis, avoided emissions due to the use of biodiesel account for 80gCO2e/MJ. Thus, avoided life cycle emissions associated with the use of biodiesel yield a net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. We also assessed the carbon balance between a palm tree plantation, including displaced emissions from diesel, and a natural ecosystem. Considering the carbon balance outcome plus life cycle emissions the payback time for a tropical forest is 39 years. The result published by Gibbs et al. (2008) [Gibbs HK, Johnston M, Foley JA, Holloway T, Monfreda C, Ramankutty N, et al., Carbon payback times for crop-based biofuel expansion in the tropics: the effects of changing yield and technology. Environmental Research Letters 2008;3:10], which ignores life cycle emissions, determined a payback range for biodiesel production between 30 and 120 years. © 2010.

AB  - A fast pyrolysis process produces a high yield of liquid (a.k.a. bio-oil) and has gained a lot of interest among various stakeholders. Nonetheless, some of the properties inherent by the bio-oil create significant challenges for its wider applications. Quality of the bio-oil and its yield are highly dependent on process parameters, such as temperature, feedstock, moisture content and residence time. In this study, the effect of temperature on bio-oil quality and its yield were examined using pine wood, an abundant biomass source in the southeastern part of the United States. Physical properties of bio-oil such as pH, water content, higher heating value, solid content and ash were analyzed and compared with a recently published ASTM standard. Bio-oil produced from pine wood using an auger reactor met specifications suggested by the ASTM standard. Thirty-two chemical compounds were analyzed. The study found that the concentration of phenol and its derivatives increased with the increase in pyrolysis temperature whereas the concentration of guaiacol and its derivatives decreased as the temperature increased. Concentration of acetic and other acids remained almost constant or increased with the increase in temperature although the pH value of the bio-oil decreased with the increase in temperature. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A kinetic model was employed to represent biodiesel production via transesterification of vegetable oils. Reaction rate constants found in the open literature were used in order to compare the behavior of batch and continuous processes. A single continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) under the usual operation conditions was not capable of achieving the same productivity as a batch process. However, when reactors in series were used, the continuous process presented a behavior similar to batch processes. As a result, it was evidenced that a series of CSTRs can be an industrially feasible choice for replacing batch transesterification reactors in large scale biodiesel plants. Further, it was shown that the loss in productivity caused by changing from batch to continuous process can be compensated by means of using higher catalyst concentrations. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Camelina sativa, an oilseed crop in the Brassicaceae family, has inspired renewed interest due to its potential for biofuels applications. Little is understood of the nature of the C. sativa genome, however. A study was undertaken to characterize two genes in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, fatty acid desaturase (FAD) 2 and fatty acid elongase (FAE) 1, which revealed unexpected complexity in the C. sativa genome.Results: In C. sativa, Southern analysis indicates the presence of three copies of both FAD2 and FAE1 as well as LFY, a known single copy gene in other species. All three copies of both CsFAD2 and CsFAE1 are expressed in developing seeds, and sequence alignments show that previously described conserved sites are present, suggesting that all three copies of both genes could be functional. The regions downstream of CsFAD2 and upstream of CsFAE1 demonstrate co-linearity with the Arabidopsis genome. In addition, three expressed haplotypes were observed for six predicted single-copy genes in 454 sequencing analysis and results from flow cytometry indicate that the DNA content of C. sativa is approximately three-fold that of diploid Camelina relatives. Phylogenetic analyses further support a history of duplication and indicate that C. sativa and C. microcarpa might share a parental genome.Conclusions: There is compelling evidence for triplication of the C. sativa genome, including a larger chromosome number and three-fold larger measured genome size than other Camelina relatives, three isolated copies of FAD2, FAE1, and the KCS17-FAE1 intergenic region, and three expressed haplotypes observed for six predicted single-copy genes. Based on these results, we propose that C. sativa be considered an allohexaploid. The characterization of fatty acid synthesis pathway genes will allow for the future manipulation of oil composition of this emerging biofuel crop; however, targeted manipulations of oil composition and general development of C. sativa should consider and, when possible take advantage of, the implications of polyploidy. © 2010 Hutcheon et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Woody biomass can be used for the generation of heat, electricity, and biofuels. In many cases, the technology for converting woody biomass into energy has been established for decades, but because the price of woody biomass energy has not been competitive with traditional fossil fuels, bioenergy production from woody biomass has not been widely adopted. However, current projections of future energy use and renewable energy and climate change legislation under consideration suggest increased use of both forest and agriculture biomass energy in the coming decades. This report provides a summary of some of the existing knowledge and literature related to the production of woody biomass from bioenergy with a particular focus on the economic perspective. The most commonly discussed woody biomass feedstocks are described along with results of existing economic modeling studies related to the provision of biomass from short-rotation woody crops, harvest residues, and hazardous-fuel reduction efforts. Additionally, the existing social science literature is used to highlight some challenges to widespread production of biomass energy.

AB  - Biofuels derived from microalgae have the potential to replace petroleum fuel and first-generation biofuel, but the efficacy with which sustainability goals can be achieved is dependent on the lifecycle impacts of the microalgae-to-biofuel process. This study proposes a detailed, industrial-scale engineering model for the species Nannochloropsis using a photobioreactor architecture. This process level model is integrated with a lifecycle energy and greenhouse gas emission analysis compatible with the methods and boundaries of the Argonne National Laboratory GREET model, thereby ensuring comparability to preexisting fuel-cycle assessments. Results are used to evaluate the net energy ratio (NER) and net greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) of microalgae biodiesel in comparison to petroleum diesel and soybean-based biodiesel with a boundary equivalent to "well-to-pump". The resulting NER of the microalgae biodiesel process is 0.93 MJ of energy consumed per MJ of energy produced. In terms of net GHGs, microalgae-based biofuels avoids 75 g of CO 2-equivalent emissions per MJ of energy produced. The scalability of the consumables and products of the proposed microalgae-to-biofuels processes are assessed in the context of 150 billion liters (40 billion gallons) of annual production. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The depletion of oil resources as well as the stringent environmental regulations has led to the development of alternate energy sources. In this work the combustion, performance and emission characteristics of a single cylinder diesel engine when fuelled with blends of neem and diesel oil are evaluated. Experiments were conducted with different blends of neem oil and diesel at various loads. The results show that the variations in the peak pressures of all the blends at full load are marginal. There is an increase in the ignition delay with biodiesel because of its high viscosity and density. It is found that the brake thermal efficiency of diesel is higher at all loads followed by blends of neem oil and diesel. The maximum brake thermal efficiency and minimum specific fuel consumption were found for blends upto B20. The specific fuel consumption, exhaust gas temperature, smoke opacity and NOx were comparatively higher. However, there is an appreciable decrease in HC and CO2 emissions while the decrease in CO emission is marginal. It was observed that the combustion characteristics of the blends of esterified neem oil with diesel followed closely with that of the base line diesel. © 2006-2010 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

AB  - The transport sector is the dominant source of nanoparticles in the urban atmosphere. It is also responsible for about 20-25% of current global CO2 emissions, a figure that is expected to grow to about 30-50% by 2050 (Fuglestvedt et al., 2008). One option to counter this trend and contribute to the attainment of carbon emission reduction targets is the use of biofuels in road vehicles. This leads to a reduction in CO, CO2 and particle mass emissions, though particle number emissions may increase. This article discusses the potential impact of the particle number concentrations derived from biofuel vehicles on existing regulatory concerns over atmospheric nanoparticles.

AB  - For the comprehensive analysis of energy consumption(EC) and greenhouse gas(GHG) emissions of China's bio-liquid fuel pathways, the life-cycle-analysis(LCA) of 6 pathways, which are corn-, cassava-, and sweet sorghum-derived ethanol (EtOH) and soybean-, jatropha fruit-, and waste cooking oil(WCO)- derived bio-diesel(BD) is analyzed. The tool utilized is the WTW(Well-to-Wheels) module of Tsinghua-CA3EM model covering all stages including raw materials cultivation (or feedstock collection), fuel production, transportation and distribution, and application in automotive engines, accompanied with comparison with Conventional Petroleum-based gasoline and diesel Pathways(CPP). The results based on case-study show: 1) the fossil energy inputs are larger than the energy contained in the fuel obtained in these pathways except making ethanol from cassava pathway; 2) compared with CPP, the fossil energy consumption be reduced, but the GHC emissions can be increased to some extent; 3) the main factors induced high EC and GHG emission include high EC level during the fuel production stage and high fertilizer application rate during the raw feedstock plantation. The results show that these bio-fuel path ways is fuitable to the country with rich coal and poor oil.

AB  - Biodiesel production is worthy of continued study and optimization of production procedures because of its environmentally beneficial attributes and its renewable nature. Non-edible vegetable oils such as Jatropha oil, produced by seed-bearing shrubs, can provide an alternative and do not have competing food uses. However, these oils are characterized by their high free fatty acid contents. Using the conventional transesterification technique for the production of biodiesel is well established. In this study an alternative energy stimulant, " microwave irradiation" , was used for the production of the alternative energy source, biodiesel. The optimum parametric conditions obtained from the conventional technique were applied using microwave irradiation in order to compare the systems. The study showed that the application of radio frequency microwave energy offers a fast, easy route to this valuable biofuel with the advantages of enhancing the reaction rate (2. min instead of 150. min) and of improving the separation process. The methodology allows for the use of high free fatty acid content feedstock, including Jatropha oil. However, this emerging technology needs to be further investigated for possible scale-up for industrial application. © 2010 Cairo University.

AB  - A slightly fuel-rich (Φ = 1.3) premixed laminar flat morpholine/oxygen/argon flame at 40 mbar was studied with cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS). Morpholine as a secondary amine was considered as a prototypical nitrogenated biofuel. To contribute to the investigation of fuel-nitrogen conversion chemistry in this flame, absolute mole fraction profiles of CH, CN, and NH2 were determined. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting quantitative mole fractions of these radicals from CRDS in a low-pressure flame of a model biofuel. The species profiles are discussed in combination with some relevant intermediates from molecular beam mass spectrometry, determined in this flame very recently (Lucassen et al., Proc Combust Inst 32(1):1269-1276, 2009). Some relative species profiles were also determined in flames of further amines to facilitate comparison. The results demonstrate that NH3- and HCN-related chemistry occurs in different regions of this flame. HCN production is considerable, and NO is found in the exhaust gases in percent-level concentrations. To monitor the combustion status, chemiluminescence is increasingly being applied as an intrinsic low-cost sensor. We believe to present the first chemiluminescence measurements in a flame of a prototypical nitrogenated biofuel, reporting relative emission intensities for five excited-state species. The shapes and maximum positions of the ground- and excited-state profiles show interesting differences, especially for the CN radical, which must be the consequence of different reaction pathways. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Oleaginous yeasts (18 strains) were grown in ethanol media under various cultivation conditions (33 biomass samples). It was found that lipid and lipid-free fractions of dry biomass have elemental composition and biomass reductivity very close to values which can be considered as biological constants. The energy content of dry biomass strongly depended on the total lipid content. When the lipid content was 64%, the energy value of dry biomass reached 73% of diesel oil; therefore, oleaginous microorganisms can be a promising source of biodiesel fuel. The approach used in this work makes it possible to determine the energy value of biomass by its elemental composition without application of laborious and expensive calorimetric measurements of combustion heats. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

AB  - The Thai Government has committed to promoting the production and use of biodiesel in place of petro-diesel oil, with the objective of reducing the country's dependence on imported oil. However, biodiesel production generates large amounts of waste and wastewater. This research aspires to adopt industrial ecology measures to alleviate environmental problems encountered in the biodiesel industry in Thailand. The proposed implementation options included clean technology and waste exchange measures. Five biodiesel production factories were selected to analyse material flow and balance in the production processes. The results show that 1 m3 biodiesel production generated 8kg of spent bleaching earth, 140kg of glycerine and 0.50m3 of wastewater with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) content of up to 170,000mg/L. The postulated options, on the basis of clean technology, included methanol recovery from the methyl ester and glycerine mixture, substitution of the hydroxide catalyst by methoxide, and reuse of the final washing water used in the methyl ester purification step. These options are expected to reduce raw material and water use in the production processes. The wastes or by-products generated from the biodiesel production process can be utilised as raw material for other industries. Crude glycerine, which is produced in large quantities from the trans-esterification process, can be reused or recycled by a value-added conversion for other industries. In addition, the biodiesel wastewater mostly obtained from the methyl ester washing process can be treated in an anaerobic digestion system to produce biogas for electricity generation. © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis.

AB  - This article examines the economic aspects for the production and utilization of a sustainable form of biodiesel derived from waste cooking oil (WCO) in Marikina City, Philippines. An estimated 35,000 liters of WCO per month can be recovered from the household and commercial sectors of the city. The WCO from the household sector can be recovered using a combination of disincentives via appropriate legislation, and moral and remunerative incentives that target the lower socio-economic classes. Remunerative incentives for the household sector need not be tantamount to the market value of WCO. In contrast, the commercial sector will require remunerative incentives against the competitive market value of WCO. Assuming the household sector as the only source of WCO, the cost-benefit analysis shows positive economic returns. However, external capitalization should be secured if the expected WCO recovery level is 80% or lower, unless the disbursement of remunerative incentives is deferred for at least one year.

AB  - Recently, an isoparaffin-rich jet fuel derived from camelina, a low-input nonfood oilseed crop, was flight-tested by a commercial airline. To date, all test results indicate that this hydrotreated renewable jet fuel (HRJ) not only meets stringent engine fuel and performance specifications but also reduces environmental emissions. Several scenarios are now being considered for camelina as a sustainable feedstock for advanced biofuel production. For example, growth of camelina in the Northern Plains of the United States on either marginal lands or as a rotation crop during fallow periods on existing lands already in food crop production can avoid the conflict with food cultivation and concerns with indirect land use change impacts. Updated estimates of camelina cultivation requirements and commercial scale oil recovery and refining were used to calculate life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy demand for both HRJ and renewable diesel (green diesel, GD). GHG life cycle emissions for GD and HRJ are 18.0 and 22.4 g CO2 equiv/MJ fuel, which represent savings relative to petroleum counterparts of 80% and 75%, respectively. Scenario analyses were conducted to determine response to model assumptions and data uncertainty, including allocation methodology, N fertilizer application rate, N2O emission factor, source of H2, and farm diesel consumption. © 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Production of biodiesel is currently limited due to lack of economically beneficial feedstocks. Suitability of municipal wastewater sludge and olive mill waste as feedstocks for biodiesel production was evaluated. The various bio-waste sources were analyzed for their oil content and fatty acid composition using conventional analyses complemented with time domain (TD)-NMR analysis. TD-NMR, a rapid non-destructive method newly applied in this field, yielded good correlations with conventional methods. Overall biodiesel yields obtained by TD-NMR analysis were 7.05% and 9.18% (dry wt) for olive mill pomace and liquid wastes, and 11.92%, 7.07%, and 4.65% (dry wt) for primary, secondary, and anaerobically stabilized sludge, respectively. Fatty acid analysis indicated fundamental suitability of these agro-industrial waste resources for biodiesel production. Evaluation of bio-waste materials by TD-NMR revealed the potential of this tool to identify waste-oil sources cost effectively and quickly, supporting expansion of a sustainable biodiesel industry in Israel and other regions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The low temperature operability, kinematic viscosity, and acid value of poultry fat methyl esters were improved with addition of ethanol, isopropanol, and butanol with increasing alcohol content. The flash point decreased and moisture content increased upon addition of alcohols to poultry fat methyl esters. The alcohol type did not result in a statistically significant difference in low temperature performance at similar blend ratios in poultry fat methyl esters. In addition, blends of ethanol in poultry fat methyl esters afforded the least viscous mixtures, whereas isopropanol and butanol blends were progressively more viscous, but still within specifications contained in ASTM D6751 and EN 14214. Blends of alcohols in poultry fat methyl esters resulted in failure of the flash point specifications found in ASTM D6751 and EN 14214. Flash points of butanol blends were superior to those of isopropanol and ethanol blends, with the 5. vol.% butanol blend exhibiting a flash point (57°C) superior to that of No. 2 diesel fuel (52°C). Blends of alcohols in poultry fat methyl esters resulted in an improvement in acid value with increasing content of alcohol. An increase in moisture content of biodiesel was observed with increasing alcohol content, with the effect being more pronounced in ethanol blends versus isopropanol and butanol blends. Finally, none of the alcohol-methyl ester samples exhibited a phase separation at sub-ambient temperatures. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In recent time, environmental awareness and concern over the rapid exhaustion of fossil fuels have led to an increased popularity of biodiesel as an alternative fuel for automobiles. However, there are concerns over enhanced degradation of automotive materials in biodiesel. The present study aims to investigate the impact of palm biodiesel on the degradation behavior of elastomers such as nitrile rubber (NBR), polychloroprene, and fluoro-viton A. Static immersion tests in B0 (diesel), B10 (10% biodiesel in diesel), B100 (biodiesel) were carried out at room temperature (25 °C) and at 50 °C for 500 h. At the end of immersion test, degradation behavior was investigated by measuring mass, volume, hardness as well as tensile strength and elongation. The exposed elastomer surface was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was carried out to identify the chemical and structural changes. Results showed that the extent of degradation was higher for both polychloroprene and NBR while fluoro-viton exhibited good resistance to degradation and was least attacked. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this article the high lipid accumulation potential of Candida lipolytica, Candida tropicalis and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa cells were shown in molasses medium. Four different pH values were examined (4-7) to discover the optimum lipid accumulation medium. Varied concentrations of (NH4)2SO4 (0.5, 1.0, 1.5g/L) and molasses (6%, 8%, 10%) were tested to find the optimum carbon and nitrogen amounts for the highest cellular lipid production. It is shown that the maximum lipid content could be achieved in the medium containing 8% molasses solution and 1.0g/L (NH4)2SO4 at pH 5 after four days of incubation time. The maximum lipid contents and methyl ester yields were measured as 59.9% and 84.9% for C. lipolytica, 46.8% and 93.2% for C. tropicalis, 69.5% and 92.3% for R. mucilaginosa. Because of the dominant fatty acids were C16 and C18 in the lipids of yeast cells, these crude lipids could be promising feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Out of various non-edible oil resources, Jatropha curcas oil (JCO) is considered as future feedstock for biodiesel production in India. Limited work is reported on the kinetics of transesterification of high free fatty acids containing oil. The present study reports the results of kinetic study of two-step acid base catalyzed transesterification process carried out at an optimum temperature of 65 °C and 50 °C for esterification and transesterification respectively under the optimum methanol to oil ratio of 3:7 (v/v), catalyst concentration 1% (w/w) for H2SO4 and NaOH. The yield of methyl ester (ME) has been used to study the effect of different parameters. The results indicate that both esterification and transesterification reaction are of first order with reaction rate constant of 0.0031min-1 and 0.008min-1 respectively. The maximum yield of 21.2% of ME during esterification and 90.1% from transesterification of pretreated JCO has been obtained. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, biodiesel was produced from sludge palm oil (SPO) using tolune-4-sulfonic monohydrate acid (PTSA) as an acid catalyst in different dosages in the presence of methanol to convert free fatty acid (FFA) to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), followed by a transesterification process using an alkaline catalyst. In the first step, acid catalyzed esterification reduced the high FFA content of SPO to less than 2% with the different dosages of PTSA. The optimum conditions for pretreatment process by esterification were 0.75% (w/w) dosage of PTSA to SPO, 10:1. M ratio, 60°C temperature, 60. min reaction time and 400. rpm stirrer speed. The highest yield of biodiesel after transesterification and purification processes was 76.62% with 0.07% FFA and 96% ester content. The biodiesel produced was favorable as compared to EN 14214 and ASTM 6751 standard. This study shows a potential exploitation of SPO as a new feedstock for the production of biodiesel. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass can be converted into useful bio-fuels and bio-chemicals via biomass upgrading and biorefinery technologies. Biomass upgrading processes include fractionation, liquefaction, pyrolysis, hydrolysis, fermentation, and gasification. The benefits of an integrated biorefinery are numerous because of the diversification in feedstocks and products. There are currently several different levels of integration in biorefineries, which adds to their sustainability, both economically and environmentally. Economic and production advantages increase with the level of integration in the biorefinery. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Jatropha curcas is promoted internationally for its presumed agronomic viability in marginal lands, economic returns for small farmers, and lack of competition with food crops. However, empirical results from a study in southern India revealed that Jatropha cultivation, even on agricultural lands, is neither profitable, nor pro-poor. We use a political ecology framework to analyse both the discourse promoting Jatropha cultivation and its empirical consequences. We deconstruct the shaky premises of the dominant discourse of Jatropha as a 'pro-poor' and 'pro-wasteland' development crop, a discourse that paints a win-win picture between poverty alleviation, natural resource regeneration, and energy security goals. We then draw from fieldwork on Jatropha plantations in the state of Tamil Nadu to show how Jatropha cultivation favours resource-rich farmers, while possibly reinforcing existing processes of marginalisation of small and marginal farmers. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This study explores the spread of Jatropha in Kenya and some implications of its trajectory. Proponents of biodiesel in Kenya have adopted a near-singular focus on Jatropha but attach it to a wide variety of goals, including climate change mitigation, poverty reduction, and clean development. The priorities of actors who promote the crop often differ from those of smallholder farmers who grow it. The persistence of multiple discourses of development linked to Jatropha creates tensions between competing perspectives, manifested through allegations of exclusion and shady business, but it also allows actors to deploy strategic flexibility by invoking Jatropha to pursue different ends. A case study of an internationally funded project in Mpeketoni, Coast Province highlights disconnects between the initial objectives of donors, coordinators, and farmers and explores the project's potential to produce outcomes that are satisfactory to all three. The paper contributes to wider debates about biofuels and discourses of development: Jatropha shares many features with past agricultural development interventions, but as a biofuel it exhibits additional layers of contested meaning because of the politics of energy and the environment that are involved. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This article presents an analysis of the two major components of Brazil's biofuels initiatives - ethanol from sugarcane and biodiesel from a variety of raw material sources. With the crisis unleashed at the end of 2008, huge question marks hang over the timetable and the scope of future investments in the sector. Even prior to the current crisis the biofuels debate was suffering a sharp volte-face with earlier euphoria being replaced by sustained critiques from NGOs, social movements, influential representatives of the techno-bureaucracy, and global agrifood firms. As a result governments are currently reviewing their policies, further exacerbating the uncertainties surrounding biofuels. Brazil is already assuming a protagonist role in the promotion of biofuels and its biofuels programs occupy a central place both in global debates on this issue and in the eventual emergence of global biofuels markets. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - An increase in glycerol production is a consequence of the rapid growth in bio-diesel production and makes it attractive to utilize glycerol as feedstock, e.g., for production of hydrogen. Here we report integrating the glycerol steam reforming and CO2 capture reaction in one single reactor as a potential approach to enhance the efficiency of hydrogen production. A thermodynamic analysis comparing glycerol steam reforming with or without CO2 capture was made, highlighting that integration of CO2 removal allows high efficiency in the hydrogen production and energy utilization. The experimental assessment on the integrated reaction was carried out with Co-Ni reforming catalysts derived from hydrotalcite-like material (HTls) and dolomite as CO2 acceptor. The applied operating window was at a steam-to-glycerol ratio in a range of 3- 9 and a temperature of 500-650 °C. The obtained hydrogen content or purity was close to the theoretical boundary at temperatures above 575 °C or steam-to-glycerol ratio no less than 4. Particularly, both the hydrogen yield and purity were at approx. 99% with a steam-to-glycerol ratio of 9. At a lower steam-to-glycerol ratio of 3 and temperature lower than 550 °C, hydrogen production was compromised due to the low efficiency of steam reforming and a high tendency of pyrolysis. The elimination of non-catalytic reactions, sufficient methane steam reforming and water gas shift reaction have been identified as critical factors to maximize hydrogen yield in sorption enhanced reforming of glycerol. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The impacts of biodiesel and a continuously regenerated (catalyzed) diesel particle filter (DPF) on the emissions of volatile unburned hydrocarbons, carbonyls, and particle associated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and nitro-PAH, were investigated. Experiments were conducted on a 5.9 L Cummins ISB, heavy-duty diesel engine using certification ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD, S ≤15 ppm), soy biodiesel (B100), and a 20% blend thereof (B20). Against the ULSD baseline, B20 and B100 reduced engine-out emissions of measured unburned volatile hydrocarbons and PM associated PAH and nitro-PAH by significant percentages (40% or more for B20 and higher percentage for B100). However, emissions of benzene were unaffected by the presence of biodiesel and emissions of naphthalene actually increased for B100. This suggests that the unsaturated FAME in soy-biodiesel can react to form aromatic rings in the diesel combustion environment. Methyl acrylate and methyl 3-butanoate were observed as significant species in the exhaust for B20 and B100 and may serve as markers of the presence of biodiesel in the fuel. The DPF was highly effective at converting gaseous hydrocarbons and PM associated PAH and total nitro-PAH. However, conversion of 1-nitropyrene by the DPF was less than 50% for all fuels. Blending of biodiesel caused a slight reduction in engine-out emissions of acrolein, but otherwise had little effect on carbonyl emissions. The DPF was highly effective for conversion of carbonyls, with the exception of formaldehyde. Formaldehyde emissions were increased by the DPF for ULSD and B20. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The present study investigated the influence of two Brazilian environments on the physico-chemical and physiological properties of Jatropha curcas L. (physic nut) an oilseed plant of great potential in biodiesel production. Fruits and seeds of plants grown in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest (AF) and in the semiarid climate of Caatinga (SA) were compared. Fruits from the SA were longer, wider and heavier than those from the AF. In contrast, the AF seeds were larger and heavier than the SA seeds. Soluble sugars, protein, relative water content and electrical conductivity of the SA seeds significantly exceeded that of the AF seeds by 28%, 23%, 32% and 94%, respectively. Seeds of the AF had a significantly greater percentage germination (17.5%) and needed less time to germinate (10%) than did the SA seeds. Shoot dry biomass of seedlings grown from the AF seeds significantly exceeded that of the SA by 18.5%. Results suggest this pattern may be due to the higher carbon storage (i.e. sugars, proteins and oil) in the AF than SA seeds. Further studies are warranted to verify whether the differences observed between the seed sources investigated in the present study could be due to varietal or biotype factors. © 2010 CSIRO.

AB  - The use of renewable energy sources (biofuels), either as a component in the conventional fossil fuels, gasoline and diesel, or as a pure biofuel, contributes to energy saving and decrease of total CO2 emission. The use of bioethanol mixed with gasoline significantly decreases gasoline consumption and contributes to environment protection. One of the problems in the production of bioethanol is the availability of sugar and starch based feedstock used for its production. However, lignocellulosic feedstocks are becoming more significant in the production of bioethanol due to their availability and low cost. The aim of this study is to point out the advantages and shortcomings of pretreatment processes and hydrolyses of lignocellulosic feedstocks that precede their fermentation to bioethanol.

AB  - To quantify the effect of biofuel on global oil markets, we extend the optimal export tax model to the global fuel market (henceforth, denoted as the Cartel-of-Nations model), recognizing that crude oil extraction and production are concentrated in a few countries (namely, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), and that there is a wedge between fuel prices in oil-exporting and oil-importing countries. We calibrate the Cartel-of-Nations model to include biofuel using 2007 data. We show that the introduction of biofuel reduces international fuel prices by between 1.07 and 1.10%, as well as reduces the quantity of fossil fuel (i.e., gasoline and diesel) consumed by oil-importing countries by between 0.3% and 0.7%. The global amount of fuel consumed (gasoline, diesel, and biofuels), however, increases by 1.5-1.6%. This outcome suggests that although the introduction of biofuels changes the composition of the fuel consumed (resulting in less carbon emissions per gallon of fuel consumed), it also increases global fuel consumption (resulting in more carbon emissions). The magnitude of these two opposing forces, and therefore the environmental benefits from biofuels, depends on the supply elasticity of fossil fuel and on the pollution intensity of the biofuel feedstock used. Finally, the introduction of biofuels causes welfare in oil-exporting countries to decline by 1.05-1.76%, but it causes welfare in oil-importing countries to increase by 2.92-4.10%. © 2010 AgBioForum.

AB  - Biomass has received considerable attention as a sustainable feedstock that can replace diminishing fossil fuels for the production of energy, especially for the transportation sector. The overall strategy in the production of hydrocarbon fuels from biomass is (i) to reduce the substantial oxygen content of the parent feedstock to improve energy density and (ii) to create C–C bonds between biomass-derived intermediates to increase the molecular weight of the final hydrocarbon product. We begin this review with a brief overview of first-generation biofuels, specifically bioethanol and biodiesel. We consider the implications of utilizing starchy and triglyceride feedstocks from traditional food crops, and we provide an overview of second-generation technologies to process the major constituents of more abundant lignocellulosic biomass, such as thermochemical routes (gasification, pyrolysis, liquefaction) which directly process whole lignocellulose to upgradeable platforms (e.g., synthesis gas and bio-oil). The primary focus of this review is an overview of catalytic strategies to produce biofuels from aqueous solutions of carbohydrates, which are isolated through biomass pretreatment and hydrolysis. Although hydrolysis-based platforms are associated with higher upstream costs arising from pretreatment and hydrolysis, the aqueous solutions of biomass-derived compounds can be processed selectively to yield hydrocarbons with targeted molecular weights and structures. For example, sugars can be used as reforming feedstocks for the production of renewable hydrogen, or they can be dehydrated to yield furfurals or levulinic acid. For each of the platforms discussed, we have suggested relevant strategies for the formation of C–C bonds, such as aldol condensation of ketones and oligomerization of alkenes, to enable the production of gasoline, jet, and Diesel fuel range hydrocarbons. Finally, we address the importance of hydrogen in biorefining and discuss strategies for managing its consumption to ensure independence from fossil fuels. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to discuss some scientific challenges related to the sustainability of the production and use of biomass for transport with specific focus on liquid biofuels. Specific attention is paid to the interaction between the European Union and tropical countries (examples of Brazil, Malaysia and India) in relation to biofuels and bioenergy. This work is performed within the context of the preparation of the implementation of the European Union Renewable Energy Directive, with perspectives of increased imports by the European Union Member States. This assessment is also performed considering at longer term International Energy Agency 2050 scenarios (Energy Technology Perspectives), the expected development of international trade of biofuels as well as the development of biofuels programmes mainly for rural development and internal use as in the case of India. Some considerations are related not only to liquid biofuels for transport, but also to other uses of biomass for bioenergy (such as bio-heat and bio-electricity) since they are directly or indirectly interconnected. Five main topics are taken as examples in order to illustrate the complexity of the sustainability assessment of biofuels and the difficulty to reduce uncertainties: (1) agro-environmental impact of bioethanol from Brazil and biodiesel from Malaysia and India. (2) N2O (Nitrous oxide) emissions related to the feedstock production for biofuels and possible land use change, (3) GHG emissions and Life Cycle Assessment LCA of biodiesel from palm oil in Malaysia, (4) water footprint of biofuels, (5) biomass and competition of uses (based on the example of Germany). These five topics are discussed and complemented by considerations about biomass conversion issues. Perspectives in the field of biorefineries for second generation biofuels from ligno-cellulosic material are discussed. Recommendations are formulated in order to reduce scientific uncertainty and to improve biofuels sustainability.

AB  - Energy has become a part and parcel of human survival and societal progress. In fact, per capita energy consumption has become a measure of a nation's progress. Just as air, water and food are the most important materials required for the survival of human life on earth, energy is essential for sustenance of the human race. Fear of depletion of fossil fuels, the main source of energy until now, has invigorated research for finding alternate sources. At the same time, fear of climate change and global warming is attracting attention of scientists to cleaner sources of energy. This paper presents a discussion of the various sources, the status of technology and their merits and demerits for application to daily life. The present day popular sources like solar, wind, biomass and geothermal are discussed in greater detail. The authors also present arguments to dub geothermal as the best renewable and clean energy source.

AB  - It is believed that in the absence of appropriate policies, commercial production of traditional crops for biofuels are likely to target high-quality lands, due to better profit margins and high soil requirements of first generation crops. As a result, a number of studies have started to look at the potential of production on "poor quality soils," based on the argument that biofuels compete with other agricultural land uses only if grown on fertile soil. This paper provides a preliminary assessment of the potential for producing liquid biofuels from alternative feedstocks, grown on degraded land and saline soils. First, it reviews some of the projections for world liquid biofuels production under a business-as-usual scenario, and assesses where they are likely to be grown based on existing policies and incentives. Among the different options for feedstocks production, the paper focuses on planting on degraded land, and estimates this potential in the developing world. Secondly, the paper assesses some alternative feedstock options and best farming practices capable of maximising environmental benefits, with particular emphasis on Jatropha L. and Short rotation coppice (SRC) willow. In addition, the potential of salt-tolerant crops as feedstocks for lignocellulosic second generation biofuels is also considered. Thirdly, the paper presents some initiatives in the developing world, aimed at exploiting degraded land for biofuels cultivation while overlapping social and environmental goals, and stresses the environmental risk of restoring degraded land and returning it to intensive production, particularly where land use is/should be aimed at ecosystem services provisions i.e., biodiversity. Finally, the paper raises several issues of concern for the alternative biofuels feedstocks covered here, particularly when cultivation is combined with high yield production, and concludes that more research is necessary in order to determine which crops and management practices can best minimise impacts and maximise benefits.

AB  - Catalytic deoxygenation of triglycerides and related feedstocks for production of biofuels is reviewed in this paper. Green diesel, triglyceride-based hydrocarbons in diesel boiling range, is an attractive alternative to biodiesel- a product of transesterification of vegetable oils, particularly due to its superior fuel properties and full compatibility with current diesel fuels. Two basic approaches to production of green diesel-(i) hydrodeoxygenation of triglycerides and related compounds over metal sulfide catalysts and (ii) deoxygenation over supported noble metal catalysts are thoroughly discussed from the point of view of reaction conditions, catalyst composition and reaction pathways and products. Furthermore, catalytic cracking of triglycerides and related feedstocks over microporous and mesoporous catalysts is reviewed as well. It constitutes an interesting alternative to deoxygenation using hydrotreating and noble metal catalysts as it does not consume hydrogen. It provides a wide spectrum of products reaching from olefins to green gasoline and diesel. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.

AB  - India's energy dependence on oil imports has led to energy security becoming a prime concern for policy makers and has thus warranted an exploration of alternative energy sources. Globally rising oil prices have led to greater interest in the development of bioenergy from plant based systems. This paper examines various policy options and mechanisms with respect to biofuel oilseed crops like Jatropha curcas and Pongamia pinnata, the potential of the expansion of sugarcane as a source of bioethanol and the emergence of the increased inclination towards afforestation of wastelands and associated implications and challenges. Historical land use data indicates that the agricultural area in India has stabilized over the last decades and has little opportunities of expansion. Considering India's still fast growing population, it is expected that land use conversions due to new bioenergy cropping systems are likely to intensify the already existing competition between residential/industrial land, and land required for food and energy generation. The paper reviews national and sub-national scale case studies, which are addressing a number of different topics related to bioenergy production, such as intensity of land use, crop yields, potential land demands or scenarios blending petrol with bioethanol.

AB  - HRH is aiming to promote and encourage a more sustainable way of living while traveling extensively on the biofuel-driven royal train. The tour starts in Glasgow and continues through to Edinburgh, Carmarthen, Bristol, Newcastle, Todmorden, Manchester, Birmingham and concludes in London. The Engineer has some good news for Prince Charles in the form of a publication from the Rail Safety and Standards Board which last week disclosed the latest results of research into using bio-diesel fuel on Britain's railways. Research on behalf of the Diesel Metering Group (DMG) investigated the impact of using bio-fuel in the diesel engines of locomotives and diesel multiple units. The DMG has also concluded that there are two important barriers to bio-diesel use. The first barrier is sustainability of the source fuel. This is a political/environmental decision and requires verification of the source of the fuel. Secondly the research has shown that, for biodiesel blends up to B20 the concern is an economic one and not an engineering one.

AB  - The TCE-degrading poplar endophyte Pseudomonas putida W619-TCE was inoculated in poplar cuttings, exposed to 0, 200 and 400 mg l-1 TCE, that were grown in two different experimental setups. During a short-term experiment, plants were grown hydroponically in half strength Hoagland nutrient solution and exposed to TCE for 3 days. Inoculation with P. putida W619-TCE promoted plant growth, reduced TCE phytotoxicity and reduced the amount of TCE present in the leaves. During a mid-term experiment, plants were grown in potting soil and exposed to TCE for 3 weeks. Here, inoculation with P. putida W619-TCE had a less pronounced positive effect on plant growth and TCE phytotoxicity, but resulted in strongly reduced amounts of TCE in leaves and roots of plants exposed to 400 mg l-1 TCE, accompanied by a lowered evapotranspiration of TCE. Dichloroacetic acid (DCAA) and trichloroacetic acid (TCAA), which are known intermediates of TCE degradation, were not detected. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Currently, the biodiesel industry is investigating non-food crops with high oil content. The industry is also evaluating oil sources from deeper into the industrial or commercial waste streams. Spent coffee grounds could be a feedstock that qualifies for both as a non-food crop and a waste product. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using coffee oil extracted from spent coffee grounds as raw material to produce ASTM standard biodiesel. The two biodiesel production methods that were used are acid-catalyzed esterification followed by alkali-catalyzed transesterification and lipase catalyzed transesterification. It was found that the high level of free fatty acids (FFA) in the coffee oil was reduced from 16.3% to 2.64% by acid-catalyzed esterification with 40/1 molar ratio of methanol to FFA in the presence of 5% (v/v, based on FFA) hydrochloric acid. However, poor conversion was obtained for the further alkali-catalyzed transesterification. In comparison, 98.5% conversion was achieved by using enzymatic catalysis, demonstrating the feasibility of using this approach to process low quality coffee oil from spent coffee grounds for biodiesel production.

AB  - We demonstrated ethanolysis of rapeseed oil to produce biodiesel fuel using lipase-producing filamentous fungi immobilized on biomass support particles (BSPs) as a whole-cell biocatalyst. We prepared two types of whole-cell biocatalyst: wild-type Rhizopus oryzae producing triacylglycerol lipase (w-ROL) and recombinant Aspergillus oryzae expressing Fusarium heterosporum lipase (r-FHL). Both w-ROL and r-FHL successfully catalyzed the ethanolysis of rapeseed oil, and the fatty acid ethyl ester yield was as high as 79% (w-ROL) or 94% (r-FHL). In the case of r-FHL, the residual monoglycerides (MGs) and diglycerides (DGs) were no more than 0.73 and 0.18%, respectively. In addition, r-FHL could be recycled for the ethanolysis of rapeseed oil, retaining over 85% fatty acid ethyl ester yield by the fifth cycle. r-FHL was revealed to be a promising catalyst for biodiesel production using rapeseed oil and ethanol. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Density measurements have long been used to monitor petrochemical distillation. The density of the petrochemicals decreases as one moves up the distillation column. Measuring the density or specific gravity of biodiesel has been reported to be the preferred method of blending biodiesel fuel for both accuracy and ease of use. To see widespread use, a measurement technology must not only be capable of accurately monitoring a parameter, but it must do so in an economical way. This paper explores the application of microelectromechanical systems technology to fuel monitoring, quality control, and blending. This microfluidic sensor has on-chip density/specific gravity, temperature, and viscosity measurement capabilities, as will be demonstrated in the experimental results. The ability to differentiate between gasoline, ethanol, diesel, biodiesel, butanol, Fischer-Tropsch fuel, water, and air contamination with a density measurement and in some cases a viscosity measurement will be demonstrated. Using gravimetric measurements, based on fluid density, concentrations of fuel blends like ethanol-gasoline can be measured. Contamination levels of water in ethanol can also be measured in this manner. The density of fuel over temperature can be made with this sensing technology and applied to custody transfer. Potential microfluidic clogging issues are addressed by filtration and by adding the capability of sensing flow through the sensor. Measuring fluids under high flow rates is accommodated with a bypass design. An intrinsically safe circuit has been developed to enable use of this technology with flammable liquids. Vibration testing has been undertaken to show that these micromachined devices, with their high resonant frequencies, are immune to vehicular and aviation vibration, unlike conventional density metres made using larger resonating steel tubing.

AB  - Feedstock logistics, as dictated by biomass physical properties, location, and distribution, as well as transportation infrastructure, were shown to be a primary determinant of the scale, location, and technology selection of any future biorefineries. The maximum capacity of both biochemical-and thermochemical-based second-generation biofuel facilities was established based on feedstock logistics including delivery mode (road, rail, or ship), maximum number of deliveries by mode, feedstock type (whole logs, chips, pellets, or bio-oil), and biofuel yield from those feedstocks. The world's largest ethanol plant, pulp mill, coal-based power plant, and oil refinery were used to approximate maximum plant size for different technologies, and to set an upper limit on the number of deliveries logistically possible for each transport mode. It was apparent that thermochemical conversion to transportation biofuels was favored for large, multimodal coastal facilities that are able to receive imported biomass in the form of feedstock intermediates, such as pellets and bio-oil (maximum capacities of 2844 and 6001 million liters gasoline equivalent (MLGE) respectively). Biochemically-based conversion processes, primarily due to smaller economies of scale and the typical use of higher moisture content and undensified feedstocks, such as whole logs and chips, are better suited for smaller facilities (maximum 1405 and 1542 MLGE, respectively) that rely on local feedstocks delivered by truck and/or rail. It was also apparent that optimization of the feedstock-intermediate-product chain, including biomass densification for transportation and high conversion yield, is essential if the scale of the any second-generation biofuels facility is to be maximized. © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel fuels (methyl or ethyl esters derived from vegetables oils and animal fats) are currently being used as a means to diminish the crude oil dependency and to limit the greenhouse gas emissions of the transportation sector. However, their physical properties are different from traditional fossil fuels, this making uncertain their effect on new, electronically controlled vehicles. Density is one of those properties, and its implications go even further. First, because governments are expected to boost the use of high-biodiesel content blends, but biodiesel fuels are denser than fossil ones. In consequence, their blending proportion is indirectly restricted in order not to exceed the maximum density limit established in fuel quality standards. Second, because an accurate knowledge of biodiesel density permits the estimation of other properties such as the Cetane Number, whose direct measurement is complex and presents low repeatability and low reproducibility. In this study we compile densities of methyl and ethyl esters published in literature, and proposed equations to convert them to 15 °C and to predict the biodiesel density based on its chain length and unsaturation degree. Both expressions were validated for a wide range of commercial biodiesel fuels. Using the latter, we define a term called Biodiesel Cetane Index, which predicts with high accuracy the Biodiesel Cetane Number. Finally, simple calculations prove that the introduction of high-biodiesel content blends in the fuel market would force the refineries to reduce the density of their fossil fuels. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Aim of the present study was to assess and evaluate the impact of various kinds of impurities of biodiesel-derived raw glycerol feedstock, upon microbial growth and 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) production by Clostridium butyricum. Preliminary trials in 200-mL anaerobic bottles revealed that the presence of NaCl at a concentration of 4.5% (w/w of glycerol) in growth medium imposed an evident inhibitory effect, in contrast with phosphoric salts. However, the application of NaCl at elevated quantities during batch bioreactor experiments [up to 30% (w/w of glycerol)], did neither affect the microbial growth, nor the 1,3-PDO production. Moreover, when oleic acid was added into the growth medium at 2% (w/w of glycerol), a total preclusion of the strain was observed. In order to further investigate whether the nature of oleic acid itself or the presence of the double bond induced the inhibitory phenomenon, stearic acid was added into the medium at the same concentration (2%, w/w, of glycerol). Indeed, no inhibitory effect was observed in the fermentor, suggesting that the presence of the double bond may play a key role in the growth behavior of the microorganism. Finally, methanol effect was tested in batch and continuous bioreactor operations. Interestingly enough, the alcohol addition did not affect the microbial bioconversion of glycerol into 1,3-PDO, even when imposed at relatively high concentrations (10%, w/w, of glycerol) in batch-bioreactor operations. In continuous experiments, methanol was added when steady state had been achieved, and although in one case high concentration was added into the chemostat (5 g/L), the system re-obtained a steady state without indications of negative effect upon biomass production due to the alcohol. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The main objective of this research is to analyze the impact of the market share increase of hydrogen based road vehicles in terms of energy consumption and CO2, on today's Portuguese light-duty fleet. Actual yearly values of energy consumption and emissions were estimated using COPERT software: 167112 TJ of fossil fuel energy, 12213 kton of CO2 emission and 141 kton of CO, 20 kton of HC, 46 kton of NOx and 3 kton of PM. These values represent 20-40% of countries total emissions. Additionally to base fleet, three scenarios of introduction of 10-30% fuel cell vehicles including plug-in hybrids configurations were analysed. Considering the scenarios of increasing hydrogen based vehicles penetration, up to 10% life cycle energy consumption reduction can be obtained if hydrogen from centralized natural gas reforming is considered. Full life cycle CO2 emissions can also be reduced up to 20% in these scenarios, while local pollutants reach up to 85% reductions. For the purpose of estimating road vehicle technologies energy consumption and CO2 emissions in a full life cycle perspective, fuel cell, conventional full hybrids and hybrid plug-in technologies were considered with diesel, gasoline, hydrogen and biofuel blends. Energy consumption values were estimated in a real road driving cycle and with ADVISOR software. Materials cradle-to-grave life cycle was estimated using GREET database adapted to Europe electric mix. The main conclusions on CO2 full life cycle analysis is that light-duty vehicles using fuel cell propulsion technology are highly dependent on hydrogen production pathway. The worst scenario for the current Portuguese and European electric mix is hydrogen produced from on-site electrolysis (in the refuelling stations). In this case full life cycle CO 2 is 270 g/km against 190 g/km for conventional Diesel vehicle, for a typical 150,000 km useful life. A brief energy price analysis was presented. We conclude that hydrogen price equivalent to gasoline energy price (/MJ) is important to the consumer preference of hydrogen based vehicles. It is also possible a fuel cell cost comparable with internal combustion engine cost if sufficient market penetration and power density increase are attained. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Professor T.

AB  - The influence of three cold flow improvers, namely, olefin-ester copolymers (OECP), ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EACP) and polymethyl acrylate (PMA), on the low-temperature properties and viscosity-temperature characteristics of a soybean biodiesel was evaluated on a low-temperature flow tester and a rotatory rheometer. The crystal morphologies of the biodiesel at low temperatures were investigated through a polarizing microscope. The results indicated that the ability of the cold flow improvers differed in improving the cold flow properties of soybean biodiesel, of which OECP was the best candidate. OECP can significantly reduce pour point (PP) and cold filter plugging point (CFPP) of biodiesel and retard viscosity increase of biodiesel at low temperatures when incorporated into biodiesel at the additive contents of 0.03%. On the other hand, OECP functioned by inhibiting the wax crystals from growing to a larger size and provided a barrier to crystal agglomeration at low temperatures, thus improving the cold flow properties of soybean biodiesel. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The influence of crude glycerin on biogas production and methane content of the produced biogas was studied, when added to cattle slurry. The experimental design consisted of 5% wt (Gli 5), 10% wt (Gli 10), and 15% wt (Gli 15) of crude glycerin added to cattle slurry, and one control digester without addition of crude glycerin. Anaerobic digestion was carried out in 4 laboratory size CSTR-type biogas digesters with a working volume of 3L, in semi-continuous regime at mesophilic conditions, over a period of 10 weeks. The highest biogas yields (825.3mLg-1 and 825.7mLg-1, respectively) relative to mass of volatile compounds added, were produced by the treatments Gli 5 and Gli 10. The control treatment produced 268.6mLg-1, whereas the treatment Gli 15 produced 387.9mLg-1. This low value was due to the breakdown of the process. Compared to the control, methane contents was increased by 9.5%, 14.3%, and 14.6%, respectively, for the treatments Gli 5, Gli 10, and Gli 15. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The solid base catalyst KF/Ca-Al hydrotalcite was obtained from Ca-Al layered double hydroxides and successfully used in the transesterification of methanol with palm oil to produce biodiesel. With the load of KF, the activity of Ca-Al mixed-oxides had been improved much. For the mass ratio 80wt.%(KF·6H2O to Ca-Al mixed-oxides) catalyst, under the optimal condition: 338K, catalyst amount 5%(wt./wt. oil) and methanol/oil molar ratio 12:1, after 5h reaction, the fatty acid methyl esters yield could reach 97.98%; for the mass ratio 100wt.%(KF·6H2O to Ca-Al mixed-oxides) ones, under the same reaction condition, only needed 3h to get the FAME yield of 99.74%, and even only reacted 1h, the FAME yield could obtain 97.14%. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Next generation hydrocarbon biofuels have the potential to fulfill not only the biofuels production mandate of the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007, but also would not have to be exempted from the EISA-mandated increase in the corporate average fuel economy. Producing "green gasoline"," green diesel" and "green jet fuel" from non-food lignocellulosic feedstocks such as forest waste and agricultural residue, and energy crops such as short rotation trees and perennial grasses grown on marginal or abandoned cropland will substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions and will not affect food prices. In this paper the development of the new paradigm of green gasoline from lignocellulose will be reviewed, the potential pathways to these infrastructure-compatible fuels will be discussed, and critical process design needs will be outlined. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - By the method of data collation, research into changes in life histories (ignition delay plus time of combustion) of the compounded fuel droplets (diesel fuel-biodiesel fuel (RME)-bioethanol), as well as diesel engine D-144 brake specific fuel consumption rates was performed and obtained results being compared to diesel fuel by an analogous manner. An optimum composition of the multi-component blend B30+7.5E demonstrating specific fuel consumption rates and droplet combustion characteristics very similar to diesel fuel was derived. In comparison to B30, a newly derived combustible blend demonstrated fairly improved emissions of exhaust gases. For low load mode: smoke opacity (-10%), NOX (-2%), CO (-20%), and HC (-12.5%). For average load mode: smoke opacity (-10%), NOX (-2%), CO (-22%), and HC (-14.5%). For high load mode: smoke opacity (-18%), NOX (-2%), CO (-22%), and HC (-18%). © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper reports an electroanalytical method developed for determining the antioxidant tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) in biodiesel, based on the enhancement effect of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). In pH 6.5 Britton-Robinson buffer, a poorly defined oxidation peak was observed for TBHQ at a carbon paste electrode (CPE). In the presence of low concentrations of CTAB, however, the oxidation peak current was markedly increased. Several parameters were studied and optimized for the development of this methodology, and under optimal conditions the oxidation peak current was proportional to TBHQ concentration in the range of (1.05-10.15) ×10-6molL-1, with limits of detection and quantification of 7.11×10-8molL-1 and 2.37×10-7molL-1, respectively, by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The method was applied to TBHQ determination in soybean biodiesel samples. The results were satisfactory in comparison with those obtained using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ionic liquids (ILs) are being explored as solvents for the enzymatic methanolysis of triglycerides. However, most available ILs (especially hydrophobic ones) have poor capability in dissolving lipids, while hydrophilic ILs tend to cause enzyme inactivation. Recently, we synthesized a new type of ether-functionalized ionic liquids (ILs) carrying anions of acetate or formate; they are capable of dissolving a variety of substrates and are also lipase-compatible (Green Chem., 2008, 10, 696-705). In the present study, we carried out the lipase-catalyzed transesterifications of Miglyol® oil 812 and soybean oil in these novel ILs. These ILs are capable of dissolving oils at the reaction temperature (50 °C); meanwhile, lipases maintained high catalytic activities in these media even in high concentrations of methanol (up to 50% v/v). High conversions of Miglyol oil were observed in mixtures of IL and methanol (70/30, v/v) when the reaction was catalyzed by a variety of lipases and different enzyme preparations (free and immobilized), especially with the use of two alkylammonium ILs 2 and 3. The preliminary study on the transesterification of soybean oil in IL/methanol mixtures further confirms the potential of using oil-dissolving and lipase-stabilizing ILs in the efficient production of biodiesels. © 2009 Humana Press.

AB  - In late 1990's some microalgae were found to be capable of producing lipids from carbon dioxide via photosynthesis with thirty times the efficiency of plants in terms of the amount of oil produced per unit area of the land allocated. This process raised hope in the fight against environmental problems caused by carbon dioxide accumulation in the atmosphere. In the present paper, exergetic efficiency of the environment friendly algal biodiesel production process and renewability of the algae-biodiesel-carbon dioxide cycle are assessed. If any process is not feasible thermodynamically, it can never be used in the real world; however, thermodynamic feasibility does not imply the immediate use of the process either. If the limits offered in thermodynamic analysis cannot be attained immediately with the present technology, they may still be used to understand the area where new technology is needed. This paper points the direction for the development of new technology to decrease the carbon dioxide accumulation in the atmosphere. The renewability indicator is found to be positive, showing that the algae-biodiesel-carbon dioxide cycle is indeed renewable. Any increase in the lipid content of the algae will improve the efficiency of the process. Genetic engineering techniques may be helpful to improve this efficiency drastically. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, hybrid fuels consisting of coconut oil, aqueous ethanol and a surfactant (butan-1-ol) were prepared and tested as a fuel in a direct injection diesel engine. After determining fuel properties such as the density, viscosity and gross calorific values of these fuels, they were used to run a diesel engine. The engine performance and exhaust emissions were investigated and compared with that of diesel. The experimental results show that the efficiency of the hybrid fuels is comparable to that of diesel. As the viscosity of the hybrid fuels decreased and approached that of diesel, the efficiency increased progressively towards that of diesel. The exhaust emissions were lower than those for diesel, except carbon monoxide emissions, which increased. Hence, it is concluded that these hybrid fuels can be used successfully as an alternative fuel in diesel engines without any modifications. Their completely renewable nature ensures that they are environmentally friendly with regard to their emissions characteristics. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work investigates and compares the reaction performance of soybean oil transesterification under supercritical methanol and ethanol, in a continuous catalyst-free process, as a cleaner alternative to conventional chemically catalyzed process. Reactions were performed in a tubular reactor, at 20 MPa, with oil to alcohol ratio of 1:40, varying the temperature in the range from 250 °C to 350 °C, and at two levels of water concentrations, 0 and 10 wt%. Although both processes proceeded with a relatively high reaction rate, conversion achieved by methanolysis was higher than that obtained by ethanolysis. Water positively affected both process: higher ester content and triacylglycerols depletion occurred when 10 wt% water was used compared with anhydrous conditions. Temperature increase favored the conversion of soybean oil to the corresponding methyl or ethyl esters, although temperatures above 300 °C increased the fatty acid degradation degree, a phenomenon responsible for the low ester contents obtained at the highest temperatures and lowest flow rates studied. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In Taiwan, millions of tons of waste cooking oil are produced each year, and less than 20% of it, about 150,000 ton/a, is reclaimed and reused. Most waste oil is flushed down the drain. Utilizing waste cooking oil to make biodiesel not only reduces engine exhaust gas pollution, but also replaces food-derived fuels, and reduces ecologic river pollution. This study employed two-stage transesterification to lower the high viscosity of waste oil, utilized emulsion to reduce the methyl ester NOx pollution, and used methanol to enhance the stability and viscosity of emulsified fuel. To further analyze spray characteristics of fuels, this experiment built a constant volume bomb under high temperature, used high speed photography to analyze spray tip penetration, spray angle, and the Sauter mean diameter (SMD) of fuel droplets, and compared the results with fossil diesel. The experimental results suggested that, two-stage transesterification can significantly lower waste oil viscosity to that which is close to fossil diesel viscosity. At a temperature above 300 °C, waste cooking oil methyl esters had a water content of 20%, spray droplet characteristics were significantly improved, and NOx emission dropped significantly. The optimal fuel ratio suggested in this experiment was waste cooking oil methyl ester 74.5%, methanol 5%, water 20%, and composite surfactant Span-Tween 0.5%. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The ethanol productivity of cassava crop was investigated in a laboratory experiment by correlating volumes and masses of ethanol produced to the masses of samples used. Cassava tubers (variety TMS 30555) were peeled, cut and washed. 5, 15, 25 and 35 kg samples of the tubers were weighed in three replicates, soaked in water for a period of a day, after which each sample was dried, crushed and the mash mixed with 500 ml of N-hexane (CC6H6). This crushed mash was then allowed to ferment for a period of 8 days and afterwards pressed on a 0.6 mm aperture size and sieved to yield the alcohol contained in it. The alcohol was heated at 79°C for 10 h at intervals of 2 h followed by an h cooling. Ethanol yield was at average volumes of 0.31, 0.96, 1.61 and 2.21 litres, respectively, for the selected masses of cassava samples. Quantitative relationships were obtained to relate the masses of cassava used to the masses and volumes of ethanol produced. These were used to relate known production values of cassava from tropical countries to ethanol that can be potentially produced. The ethanol had boiling point of 78.5°C and relative density of 0.791. The dried mash was found to contain 61.8 calories of food energy per 100 g. This study found that a total of 6.77 million tonnes or 1338.77 million gallons of ethanol are available from total cassava production from tropical countries. The production and use of ethanol from cassava crop is recommended in the cassava-growing tropical countries of the world. © 2010 Academic Journals.

AB  - In recent years, biofuel development and use has risen significantly. This undergraduate laboratory experiment educates students on the various alternative fuels that are being developed for automotive applications and the advantages and disadvantages of each. Students replicate commercially available alternative fuels, E85 and biodiesel, as well as create an experimental fuel blend of waste vegetable oil and petroleum products referred to as "VeggieDiesel". Each fuel is evaluated in the lab for energy content and viscosity. Students use laboratory information as well as literature to assess the production energy requirements and environmental impact for each fuel. In addition, students theoretically model heat of combustion and viscosity and compare the predicted values to the experimental results. On the basis of laboratory results and literature findings, students draw conclusions on which fuel they believe is the best "alternative" and most sustainable. The experiment is easily adaptable for organic, analytical, and physical chemistry laboratory courses by inclusion or exclusion of the various tasks and topics covered. Its timely relevance is of interest to anyone interested in environmental chemistry or engineering. © 2010 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.

AB  - The use of alternative fuels to reduce pollutant emissions in the atmosphere is an increasingly frequent trend. Thus, it becomes necessary to research the efficiency of theses mixtures in various proportions and different conditions. To diesel oil, under the legislation, are being added 3% of biodiesel. The values of specific weight and the flashpoint of the samples of commercial diesel tested, containing 2 and 3% of biodiesel, were within the established parameters set by Brazilian legislation. The values of the peroxide index for B100 biodiesel increased with light and storage time. Nevertheless, analyzing the chromatographic profile, there were no considerable changes in the chemical composition of B100 diesel under different conditions of storage. The aim of this work was examine fossil fuels in blends with biodiesel to determine their stability as well as some physical-chemical properties.

AB  - The use of Jatropha curcas oil as a source of biofuel has been well-explored. However, the physiological and growth studies of J. curcas have received considerably lesser attention. In this study, leaf gas exchange measurements and leaf nitrogen content were determined for four varieties of J. curcas, grown in the field or in pots. Based on stable carbon isotope analysis (δ13C) and gas-exchange studies, J. curcas is a C3 sun plant and the range of leaf photosynthetic rates (or CO2 assimilation rates, PNmax) were typically between 7 and 25 μmol(CO2) m-2 s-1 and light saturation generally occurred beyond 800 μmol(quanta) m-2 s-1. Higher rates of leaf photosynthesis were generally obtained with the mature leaves. In addition, increased foliar PNmax were recorded in potted J. curcas variety Indiana with increasing nitrogen (N) nutrition levels. These plants also showed greater growth, increased leaf N content, higher maximum CO2 assimilation capacity (PNhighCO2) and chlorophyll (Chl) content, indicating the potential of optimizing the growth of Jatropha by varying fertilizer nutrient levels. A rapid assessment for leaf N using a nondestructive and portable Chl meter had been established for J. curcas. This approach will allow repeated sampling of the same plant over time and thus enable the monitoring of the appropriate levels of soil fertility to achieve good Jatropha plantation productivity. High N nutrition improved the overall plant oil yield by increasing the total number of fruits/seeds produced per plant, while not affecting the intrinsic seed oil content. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Lipomyces starkey were able to survive and proliferate in the presence of olive oil mill wastewaters (OMW), a medium difficult to process by biological treatments, due to the antimicrobial activities of their phenolic components. The microorganisms were grown in the presence of undiluted OMW, without external organic supplements, producing a significant reduction of both the total organic carbon (TOC) and the total phenols content. The OMW treated by L. starkey showed a significant increase of the germination index. The preliminary dilution of OMW enhanced the reduction of polluting components of OMW, leading to a complete TOC removal, as well as to lower levels of residual phenols. The activities of extracellular lipases and esterases significantly increased in the course of the OMW fermentation. A significant increase in lipid yield was observed in L. starkey in the course of the OMW treatment, particularly enhanced when the feedstock was preliminarily diluted. The fatty acid distribution showed a prevalence of oleic acid, demonstrating the potential of L. starkeyi as a source of lipids to be used as a feedstock for the synthesis of II generation biodiesel. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Density functional theory (DFT)/BMK and CBS-QB3 ab initio calculations have been carried out to study the structures and energetics of unimolecular decomposition reactions of isopropyl butanoate (IPB, C3H 7C(O)OCH(CH3)2) as a model biofuel. The results show a good performance of the BMK method. Among seven different dissociation channels of IPB, formation of butanoic acid and propene via a six-membered ring transition state is the most favorable reaction. On the other hand, formation of lower esters is hindered by high-energy barriers and unlikely occurs except at elevated temperatures. Simple bond scission costs less energy than lower ester formation. A comparison with methyl and ethyl esters indicates faster decomposition of IPB. The changes in bond lengths along minimum energy paths are discussed. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The synthesis of 1,1-dibutoxyethane or acetaldehyde dibutylacetal was studied in a batch reactor by reacting butanol and acetaldehyde in a liquid phase, using Amberlyst-15 as the catalyst. The reaction equilibrium constant was experimentally determined in the temperature range 20-40 °C at 6 atm, where Ka = 0.00959 exp[1755.3/T (K)]. The standard properties of the reaction at 298.15 K were estimated: ΔH° = -14.59 kJ mol-1, ΔG° = -3.07 kJ mol-1, and ΔS° = -38.64 J mol-1 K-1. Kinetic experiments were performed in the temperature range 10-50 °C at 6 atm. A two-parameter kinetic law based on a Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate expression, using activity coefficients from the UNIFAC method, was used. The kinetic parameters are kc = 2.39 × 109 exp[-6200.9/T (K)] (mol gcat-1 min -1) and ks,D = 2.25 × 10-4 exp[3303.1/T (K)]. The activation energy of the reaction is 51.55 kJ mol-1. This work is an important step for further implementation of an integrated reaction-separation process, such as a simulated moving-bed reactor. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Today's biofuels require large amounts of energy in the production process for the conversion from biomass into fuels with conventional properties. To reduce the amounts of energy needed, future fuels derived from biomass will have a molecular structure which is more similar to the respective feedstock. Butyl levulinate can be gained easily from levulinic acid which is produced by acid hydrolysis of cellulose. Thus, the Institute for Combustion Engines at RWTH Aachen University carried out a fuel investigation program to explore the potential of this biofuel compound, as a candidate for future compression ignition engines to reduce engine-out emissions while maintaining engine efficiency and an acceptable noise level. Previous investigations identified most desirable fuel properties like a reduced cetane number, an increased amount of oxygen content and a low boiling temperature for compression ignition engine conditions. Depending on the chain length, fuel compounds vary in cetane number and boiling temperature. Therefore different blends of butyl levulinate and n-tetradecane, a long-chain alkane, were investigated in this study. To gain knowledge about the combustion process with biofuels, experiments on a single cylinder diesel research engine were performed. Engine results with blends of butyl levulinate and n-tetradcanee are compared to regular diesel fuel and rapeseed oil methyl ester (B100) with respect to all regulated emissions. With the use of butyl levulinate the soot emissions can be significantly reduced up to 100% depending on the load point. Furthermore, the experimental results indicate an additional potential for future diesel combustion concepts such as HCCI with respect to soot and NOx emissions in the part load range when using oxygenated fuels derived from biomass. Overall, the low particulate matter emissions provide justification for the consideration of butyl levulinate as a candidate for a fuel or fuel compound in future diesel engines. As a drawback malfunctions in various components of the fuel system like fuel hoses and fuel sealings can occur with the standard engine equipment. © 2010 SAE International.

AB  - Active regeneration experiments were performed on a production diesel aftertreatment system containing a diesel oxidation catalyst and catalyzed particulate filter (CPF) using blends of soy-based biodiesel. The effects of biodiesel on particulate matter oxidation rates in the filter were explored. These experiments are a continuation of the work performed by Chilumukuru et al. in SAE Technical Paper No. 2009-01-1474, which studied the active regeneration characteristics of the same aftertreatment system using ultra- low sulfur diesel fuel. Experiments were conducted using a 10.8 L 2002 Cummins ISM heavy duty diesel engine. Particulate matter loading of the filter was performed at the rated engine speed of 2100 rpm and 20% of the full engine load of 1120 Nm. At this engine speed and load the passive oxidation rate is low. The 17 L CPF was loaded to a particulate matter level of 2.2 g/L. Active regeneration was then performed using fuel dosing in the exhaust, which was oxidized at 75-80% conversion efficiency in the diesel oxidation catalyst. Temperatures from 475°C to 550°C at the inlet of the CPF were examined. Experiments were performed using ultra-low sulfur diesel, 5 and 20% biodiesel blends in order to determine the particulate matter oxidation dependence upon biofuel percentage and to compare with the previous results with ultra-low sulfur diesel. A method was developed to produce more accurate measures of the particulate matter loading in the CPF and improve the estimation of the thermal oxidation rate during active regeneration. In addition to the particulate matter mass, measured parameters included pressure drop, filtration efficiency, particle size distribution, and gaseous emissions. Results with 20% biodiesel show a reaction rate five times higher in the particulate filter for active regeneration as compared to ultra low sulfur diesel. For example, for a CPF inlet temperature of 525 °C, 19.6 minutes was required to oxidize 70% of the particulate matter with ultra-low sulfur diesel, as compared to 9.8 minutes with 5% biodiesel and 3.4 minutes with 20% biodiesel at the same conditions. This, combined with the lower particulate matter production from biodiesel blends, shows a significant benefit from the use of biodiesel in terms of minimizing the fuel needed to actively regenerate the particulate filter. Regenerations are not required as often, and due to the higher reactivity, more particulate matter is oxidized per gallon of dosing fuel at lower temperatures. © 2010 SAE International.

AB  - The goal of this paper is to quantitatively assess the implications of congressionally mandated biofuel targets on requirements for ethanol blending, distribution, and usage in spark ignition engines in the U.S. light-duty vehicle fleet. The "blend wall" is a term that refers to the maximum amount of ethanol that can be blended into the gasoline pool without exceeding the legal volumetric blend limit of 10%. Beyond the blend wall, the additional ethanol fuel must be used in higher blends of ethanol like E85. Once the blend wall is reached, the existing fleet of flex fuel vehicles (FFVs) will be required to use E85 for some percentage of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in order to achieve the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) targets. The feasibility of this requirement will depend on several major variables including (i) the total amount of ethanol to be used; (ii) the volumetric blend limit of ethanol in gasoline; (iii) the annual sales and fleet accumulation of FFVs; (iv) the availability of retail stations offering E85; (v) a measure of the attractiveness of E85 relative to gasoline relative to the price; and (iv) whether engine technology can be deployed to take advantage of the antiknock advantages of ethanol. A fleet model has been developed by several researchers in the Sloan Automotive Laboratory at MIT that can simulate the interaction of these variables in the US light-duty vehicle (LDV) fleet. Different scenarios can be adjusted individually or as a set of coordinated policies to observe the effect on the total energy equivalent fuel demand. Results from the model show that in order to meet current biofuel targets the retail availability of E85 will need to increase drastically, and at a faster rate than the current trends indicate. The certification of E15 can delay the blend wall by a few years, but results still show likely shortfalls in reaching current biofuel targets even with aggressive deployment of FFVs. © 2010 SAE International.

AB  - The influence of soy- and palm-based biofuels on the incylinder sources of unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) and carbon monoxide (CO) was investigated in an optically accessible research engine operating in a partially premixed, low-temperature combustion regime. The biofuels were blended with an emissions certification grade diesel fuel and the soy-based biofuel was also tested neat. Cylinder pressure and emissions of UHC, CO, soot, and NOx were obtained to characterize global fuel effects on combustion and emissions. Planar laser-induced fluorescence was used to capture the spatial distribution of fuel and partial oxidation products within the clearance and bowl volumes of the combustion chamber. In addition, late-cycle (30° and 50° aTDC) semiquantitative CO distributions were measured above the piston within the clearance volume using a deep-UV LIF technique. Compared with neat diesel fuel, the palm-based biofuel blends produced the largest decrease in UHC (38-56%) and CO (28-44%), but generated significant increases in both NOx (17-37%) and soot (41-43%). With soy-based blends, however, UHC decreased by 30-43% and CO by 17-22%, while NOx (-1-2% increase) and soot (0.8-8.5% increase) emissions varied slightly. The UHC and CO emissions were found to correlate well with the combustion phasing of each fuel at a given injection timing. The UHC PLIF measurements demonstrated several differences in the evolution of the UHC distributions throughout the cylinder volume during the mixture formation, premixed heat-release, and mixing-controlled heat-release portions of the engine cycle. However, the late-cycle UHC PLIF and spectrally resolved CO LIF measurements showed no significant differences in the main sources of UHC and CO when fueling the engine with either diesel fuel or biofuel blends. © 2010 SAE International.

AB  - The use of biofuels in internal combustion engines changes the composition of the engine exhaust gas. When burning a biofuel blend, significant amounts of oxygenated hydrocarbons such as alcohols, ethers and aldehydes are present in the exhaust gas. It is known, that these compounds influence catalytic processes in exhaust gas converters. In this work we propose a global kinetic model for ethanol and acetaldehyde oxidation on commonly used Pt, PtPd and Pd-based catalytic oxidation converters of automobile exhaust gases. The mechanism is based on two steps: (i) partial oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde, and (ii) complete oxidation of acetaldehyde to CO2 and H2O. Kinetic parameters of ethanol and acetaldehyde reactions are evaluated on the basis of laboratory light-off experiments with several catalytic monolith samples (noble metal loading 9-140 g/cft; Pt, Pd, and PtPd; at space velocity 30 000-240 000 h-1). Net formation of acetaldehyde from ethanol is observed around the light-off temperature. The Pd-based catalysts exhibit slightly higher selectivity to acetaldehyde. At higher temperatures both ethanol and acetaldehyde are almost fully oxidized, however, internal diffusion effects in 50 μm washcoat layer significantly affect the selectivity of ethanol oxidation and acetaldehyde conversions. The calibrated model is then used for simulation of the NEDC (New European Driving Cycle) test driving cycle for different converter configurations (monolith size, noble metal loading). With very low noble metal activity (low loading or aged catalyst) the acetaldehyde conversion is negative, i.e., more acetaldehyde is produced in the converter by partial oxidation of ethanol. For medium to higher activity of noble metals the net effect of the catalyst is positive - acetaldehyde is oxidized to CO2 and H2O. © 2010 SAE International.

AB  - The growing availability of different biofuels and synthetic fuels is leading to increased diversity of automotive fuels. Understanding how fuel properties affect combustion and how engine calibration strategies can compensate for variations in fuel composition is crucial for ensuring proper engine operation in this world of increased fuel diversity. This study looks at the ability to compensate for wide changes in cetane quality. Four different fuels with variations in cetane number, volatility and composition have been tested in a single cylinder engine and compared to diesel fuel. The selected operating conditions represent the entire engine map of a passenger car diesel engine. In part load the effects were investigated for conventional and premixed Diesel combustion. The results show that part load operation is especially relevant for the detection and compensation of varying fuel properties and that, depending on engine load, different control strategies have to be applied. © 2010 Shell Global Solutions.

AB  - New European emissions legislation (Euro5) specifies a limit for Particle Number (PN) emissions and therefore drives measurement of PN during vehicle development and homologation. Concurrently, the use of biofuel is increasing in the marketplace, and Euro5 specifies that reference fuel must contain a bio-derived portion. Work was carried out to test the effect of fuels containing different levels of Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) on particle number, size, mass and composition. Measurements were conducted with a Cambustion Differential Mobility Spectrometer (DMS) to time-resolve sub-micron particles (5-1000nm), and a Horiba Solid Particle Counting System (SPCS) providing PN data from a Euro5-compliant measurement system. To ensure the findings are relevant to the modern automotive business, testing was carried out on a Euro4 compliant passenger car fitted with a high-pressure common-rail diesel engine and using standard homologation procedures. It was found that using FAME decreased total PN emissions, by 16% over the Type I drive cycle (NEDC) for a 30% biodiesel (B30) compared to mineral fuel (B0). FAME also decreased accumulation mode PN and carbonaceous mass, by 20-30% for B30 versus B0, with a consequent reduction in Diesel Particulate Filter loading rate. A 25% increase in the nucleation mode PN was found when using B30 versus B0, and the higher molecular-weight organic mass fraction also increased. Increases in nitrogen oxides when using FAME- containing fuels were also confirmed. © 2010 SAE International.

AB  - The topic of CO2 and fuel consumption reductions from vehicles is a very broad and complex issue, encompassing vehicle regulations, biofuel mandates, and a vast assortment of engine and vehicle technologies. This paper attempts to provide a high-level review of all these issues. Reducing fuel consumption appears not to be driven by the amount of hydrocarbon reserves, but by energy security and climate change issues. Regarding the latter, a plan was proposed by the United Nations for upwards of 80% CO2 reductions from 1990 levels by 2050. Regulators are beginning to respond by requiring ~25% reductions in CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles by 2016 in major world markets, with more to come. The heavy-duty sector is poised to follow. Similarly, fuel policy is aimed at energy diversity (security) and climate change impacts. Emerging biofuel mandates require nominally 5-10% CO2 life cycle emissions reductions by 2020. Processes that utilize plant cellulose and waste products show the best intermediate term potential for meeting these goals, but long term trends are towards biofeedstocks for refineries. Vehicle technologies are emerging to meet the regulatory mandates. Light-duty engine efficiency gains will result in about 30% fuel and CO2 reductions by 2015. Many of the reductions will come from the use of direct injection technology in gasoline engines, and downsizing diesel and gasoline engines for more specific power. CO2 savings shows a general linear relationship with cost. Diesel hybrids offer the greatest CO2 reduction potential. Plug in hybrids can lead to heavy electrification of the fleet for energy diversity and greenhouse gas reductions, but their CO2 reductions are moderate and expensive. Battery performance is generally acceptable, but cost will be a recurring issue. Most light-duty efficiency technologies return money to the consumer over the life of the vehicle, so the CO2 reductions also come with an economic gain to the owner. In the heavy-duty sector vehicle and operational improvements offer the best gains at 16 to 28% fuel reductions. Engine technology trends are indicating nominally 15% reductions using advancements in currently utilized technologies. Research is shifting to gasoline engines, wherein upwards of 20-25% CO2 reductions might be realized. Heavy duty hybridization is emerging for vocational and urban vehicles, and can offer a 2 to 4 year payback period. Black carbon reductions from vehicles can have a profound effect on GHG impact, accounting for upwards of ~20% of CO2 reductions proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) by 2050. © 2010 SAE International.

AB  - The quasi-stationary (Q-S), spherically symmetric combustion of the isolated multi-component droplets of oxygenated diesel fuel has been modelled using a variable mechanism, which has been developed and validated against several independent data sets. The composition of three-component motor fuel, consisting of fossil diesel (DF), rapeseed oil methyl ester (hereinafter RME; B100) and dehydrated ethyl alcohol (DEA), closing to DF by its ignition delay characteristic is established. Numerical simulation results show that in contrast to RME, the additive of dehydrated ethyl alcohol to DF/RME blend tends to increase a time of ignition delay. Striving for improving of the combustion process strained by bigger volumes of fossil diesel being replaced by oxygenated biofuels to meet ecological behavior and economical independence on imported fuels, as well as simultaneously omitting any regulatory adjustment, leads to combining of dehydrated ethyl alcohol and rapeseed oil methyl ester to compound the conventional diesel fuel.

AB  - Background, aim, and scope Algae biomass has great promise as a sustainable alternative to conventional transportation fuels. In this study, a well-to-pump life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed to investigate the overall sustainability and net energy balance of an algal biodiesel process. The goal of this LCA was to provide baseline information for the algae biodiesel process. Materials and methods The functional unit was 1,000 MJ of energy from algal biodiesel using existing technology. Systematic boundary identification was performed using relative mass, energy, and economic value method using a 5% cutoff value. Primary data for this study were obtained from The USLCI database and the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy use in Transportation model. Carbohydrates in coproducts from algae biodiesel production were assumed to displace corn as a feedstock for ethanol production. Results and discussion For every 24 kg of algal biodiesel produced (1,000 MJ algae biodiesel), 34 kg coproducts are also produced. Total energy input without solar drying is 3,292 and 6,194 MJ for the process with filter press and centrifuge as the initial filtering step, respectively. Net CO2 emissions are -20.9 and 135.7 kg/functional unit for a process utilizing a filter press and centrifuge, respectively. In addition to the -13.96 kg of total air emissions per functional unit, 18.6 kg of waterborne wastes, 0.28 kg of solid waste, and 5.54 Bq are emitted. The largest energy input (89%) is in the natural gas drying of the algal cake. Although net energy for both filter press and centrifuge processes are -6,670 and -3,778 MJ/functional unit, respectively, CO2 emissions are positive for the centrifuge process while they are negative for the filter press process. Additionally, 20.4 m3 of wastewater per functional unit is lost from the growth ponds during the 4-day growth cycle due to evaporation. Conclusions and recommendations This LCA has quantified one major obstacle in algae technology: the need to efficiently process the algae into its usable components. Thermal dewatering of algae requires high amounts of fossil fuel derived energy (3,556 kJ/kg of water removed) and consequently presents an opportunity for significant reduction in energy use. The potential of green algae as a fuel source is not a new idea; however, this LCA and other sources clearly show a need for new technologies to make algae biofuels a sustainable, commercial reality. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

AB  - Rapeseed is the most important energy crop in Europe. The basic idea of the presented work was to add vegetable oils to the standard FCC-feed in order to meet requirements on the increasing demand for climate-friendly produced fuels. The experimental test program was conducted in a fully continuously operated FCC pilot plant with internal CFB-design at Vienna University of Technology. Rapeseed oil was added in steps of 20m% to the conventional feedstock, up to 100m% addition. The influence on the process was observed. The obtained product spectrum at 550°C was slightly modified in relation to standard feed VGO. The gasoline yield stayed roughly constant while the crack-gas yield decreased at higher ratios of rapeseed oil. Due to the oxygen content of rapeseed oil the additional lumps water and CO2 are formed. Using pure rapeseed oil as feedstock for FCC leads to a total fuel yield on total feed of approximately 65m% (23m% gaseous hydrocarbons plus 42m% gasoline). The gasoline achieved is oxygen free at high octane numbers of approximately RON 100 and MON 86. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A suitable process comprising acid pretreatment followed by main base transesterification reaction was developed to produce biodiesel from mixture of Mahua (M) and Simarouba (S) oils with high free fatty acids (FFA). The acid pretreatment reduced the high FFAs of the mixture of oils to around 1% which were then transesterified with methanol and KOH as catalyst at a reaction temperature of 60°C. A genetic algorithm coupled with artificial neural network (ANN-GA) model to obtain the best pretreatment process parameters for bringing down the FFA level of individual vegetable oils to around 1% was modified to include the wide range of oils and validated for mixtures of M and S oils. The quality of biodiesel produced was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC), which indicated above 90% ester conversion. The fuel properties of biodiesel were found to be comparable to diesel and were conforming to the latest biodiesel standards. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Several research works have been carried out on biodiesel combustion, performance and emissions till today. But very few studies have been made about the chemistry of biodiesel that affects the diesel engine operation. Biodiesel is derived from vegetable oil or animal fats, which comprises of several fatty acids with different chain length and bonding. The present work focuses on the effect of biodiesel molecular weight, structure (Cis & Trans), and the number of double bonds on the diesel engine operation characteristics. Three types of biodiesel with different molecular weight and number of double bond were selected for the experimental studies. The biodiesels were prepared and analyzed for fuel properties according to the standards. A constant speed diesel engine, which develops 4.4 kW of power, was run with biodiesels and its performance was compared with diesel fuel. The results show that Linseed oil methyl ester with high linolenic (unsaturated fatty acid ester) does not suit best for diesel engine due to high oxides of nitrogen emission and low thermal efficiency. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative to petroleum diesel fuel. It is a renewable, a biodegradable, and also a non-toxic fuel. The general interest to produce biodiesel from Jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) seeds oil has increased but its ability to grow on drought-prone areas has barely been investigated. The objective of this work was to identify some physiological processes that allow the Jatropha to produce in severe arid conditions by studying its leaf gas exchange and antioxidant systems under drought stress and recovering. It measured the activity of antioxidant enzymes involved in the scavenge of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutamine synthetase (GS), as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) content. It was also analyzed the chlorophyll (CHL), carotenoids, amino acids and soluble proteins contents. Net photosynthesis (A) and stomata conductance (gs) decreased associate with drought stress and dropped to zero in soil water beneath 5%. Drought induced decrease in stomatal and non-stomatal photosynthetic activity. The activities of SOD, CAT, APX and GS and MDA content in leaves were significantly higher in the water-stressed plants compared to well-watered plants and decreased when the plants were rewatered. These observations suggest that oxidative stress resulting from drought deficit in Jatropha could result in the production of antioxidative enzymes to counteract the oxidative damage, and the enzymes may contribute to its ability to survive in the adverse arid environment. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - 3-Hydroxybutyrate methyl ester (HBME) was prepared from hydrolysis of bacterial poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) using methanol as an esterification agent in the presence of sulfuric acid. Physicochemical and fuel related properties of HBME were studied for the possibility of using HBME as a gasoline additive. When HBME was blended with 97# gasoline in volume ratios of 5%, 8.5%, 10%, 15% and 20%, respectively, it was found that HBME had similar or better properties as a fuel additive compared with ethanol in terms of oxygen content, dynamic viscosity, flash point and boiling point. The blending of HBME and gasoline showed only little difference compared with the 97# gasoline in terms of octane number (RON) and distillation ranges, especially for the HBME 8.5% and 10% blends, which demonstrated an over 93% combustion heat of gasoline with less than 5% reduction in RON. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The chemical diversity of the components in bio-oil has a significant effect on its evaporation. The low boiling point compounds, such as simple acids and water, evaporate away from the surface at a faster rate than the internal diffusion. As a result a significant proportion still remains in the droplet core late in the evaporation process. As the droplet temperature increases, these trapped chemicals, in the centre of the droplet, can reach a sufficiently high temperature to cause them to vapourise resulting in rapid expansions, which can fracture the droplet. In this study a numerical model of a stationary, spherically symmetric evaporating bio-oil droplet, in a hot ambient atmosphere, is used to investigate the effect of the rate of diffusion on the evaporation process. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With depletion of solid biomass fuels and their rising costs in recent years, there has been a shift towards using kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for domestic cooking in Kenya. However, the use of kerosene is associated with health and safety problems. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a clean, safe and sustainable liquid bio-fuel. Plant oil derivatives fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) present such a promising solution. This paper presents the performance of a wick stove using FAME fuels derived from oil plants: Jatropha curcus L. (Physic nut), Croton megalocarpus Hutch, Calodendrum capense (L.f.) Thunb., Cocos nucifera L. (coconut), soyabeans and sunflower. The FAME performance tests were based on the standard water-boiling tests (WBT) and compared with kerosene. Unlike kerosene all FAME fuels burned with odorless and non-pungent smell generating an average firepower of 1095 W with specific fuel consumption of 44.6 g L-1 (55% higher than kerosene). The flash points of the FAME fuels obtained were typically much higher (2.3-3.3 times) than kerosene implying that they are much safer to use than kerosene. From the results obtained, it was concluded that the FAME fuels have potential to provide safe and sustainable cooking liquid fuel in developing countries. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Intensive measurements of aerosol (PM10) and associated water-soluble ionic and carbonaceous species were conducted in Guangzhou, a mega city of China, during summer 2006. Elevated levels of most chemical species were observed especially at nighttime during two episodes, characterized by dramatic build-up of the biomass burning tracers levoglucosan and non-sea-salt potassium, when the prevailing wind direction had changed due to two approaching tropical cyclones. High-resolution air mass back trajectories based on the MM5 model revealed that air masses with high concentrations of levoglucosan (43-473 ng m-3) and non-sea-salt potassium (0.83-3.2 μg m-3) had passed over rural regions of the Pearl River Delta and Guangdong Province, where agricultural activities and field burning of crop residues are common practices. The relative contributions of biomass burning smoke to organic carbon in PM10 were estimated from levoglucosan data to be on average 7.0 and 14% at daytime and nighttime, respectively, with maxima of 9.7 and 32% during the episodic transport events, indicating that biomass and biofuel burning activities in the rural parts of the Pearl River Delta and neighboring regions could have a significant impact on ambient urban aerosol levels. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A unique perfusion process was developed to maintain high concentrations of marine alga, Chlorella minutissima. This method is based on recycling cells by continuous feeding with warm spent sea water from nuclear power plants, which has very similar properties as sea water. A temperature of at least 30 °C in a 200 L photo-bioreactor was maintained in this system by perfusion of the thermal plume for 80 days in the coldest season. The maximum cell concentration and total lipid content was 8.3 g-dry wt./L and 23.2 %, w/w, respectively, under mixotrophic conditions. Lipid production was found to be due to a partially or non-growth related process, which implies that large amounts of biomass are needed for a high accumulation of lipids within the cells. At perfusion rates greater than 1.5 L/h, the temperature of the medium inside the reactor was around 30 °C, which was optimal for cell growth. For this system, a perfusion rate of 2.8 L/h was determined to be optimal for maintaining rapid cell growth and lipid production during outdoor cultivation. It was absolutely necessary to maintain the appropriate perfusion rate so that the medium temperature was optimal for cell growth. In addition, the lipids produced using this process were shown to be feasible for biodiesel production since the lipid composition of C. minutissima grown under these conditions consisted of 17 % (w/w) of C 16 and 47% (w/w) of C 18. The combined results of this study clearly demonstrated that the discharged energy of the thermal plume could be reused to cultivate marine alga by maintaining a relatively constant temperature in an outdoor photo-bioreactor without the need for supplying any extra energy, which could allow for cheap production of biodiesel from waste energy. © 2010 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

AB  - Glycerol acetals from butanal, pentanal, hexanal, octanal and decanal were prepared with the use of Amberlyst-15 acid resin as catalyst. The glycerol conversion decreases with the size of the hydrocarbon chain. This fact has been associated with formation of micelles and aggregates of the aldehyde to minimize the interaction between the polar glycerol molecule with the hydrocarbon chain. The Z + E mixture of the acetals with five and six-member rings were produced in all cases. The distribution of the acetal isomers varied with the reaction time, especially for the long chain aldehydes. Addition of 5 vol.% of the butanal-glycerol acetal reduced the pour point of animal fat biodiesel (methyl ester) from 18 to 13 °C. The decrease in the pour point of the glycerol acetals-biodiesel mixtures were dependent on the size of the hydrocarbon chain and the percent blended. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present work describes a theoretical investigation concerning the performance of a four strokes compression engine, which is powered by alternative fuels in the form of diesel-ethanol and diesel-ether mixtures, the properties of which were sited from literature. The amount of each alcohol added was 5%, 10% and 15% by volume. The engine speed during the experimental work was within the range from 1000 to 4000 rpm, with engine was set at full throttle opening and hence the engine was operating under full load conditions. Several parameters were calculated namely: engine torque, brake mean effective pressure, brake power, specific fuel consumption and the thermal efficiency, this was carried out using DIESEL-RK software. It was found that the engine is of highest thermal efficiency when it is powered by a 15% ethanol-diesel blend, wile it is of minimum thermal efficiency when it is powered by pure diesel fuel. Further, it was found that both the thermal efficiency of the engine and the specific fuel consumption increases with the percentage of either ethanol or ether in the fuel blend. However, the power was found to decrease with the amount of either ethanol or ether in the fuel blends. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes the use of Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) to evaluate the impact of varying mix ratios of bio-oil (pyrolysis oil) and bio-diesel on the oxidation stability and on some cold flow properties of resulting blends. The bio-oils employed were produced from the semi-continuous Auger pyrolysis of pine pellets and the batch pyrolysis of pine chips. The bio-diesel studied was obtained from poultry fat. The conditions used to prepare the bio-oil/bio-diesel blends as well as some of the fuel properties of these blends are reported. The experimental results suggest that the addition of bio-oil improves the oxidation stability of the resulting blends and modifies the crystallization behavior of unsaturated compounds. Upon the addition of bio-oil an increase in the oxidation onset temperature, as determined by DSC, was observed. The increase in bio-diesel oxidation stability is likely to be due to the presence of hindered phenols abundant in bio-oils. A relatively small reduction in DSC characteristic temperatures which are associated with cold flow properties was also observed but can likely be explained by a dilution effect. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A one-pot process combining transesterification and selective hydrogenation was established to produce biodiesel from hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) seed oil which is eliminated as a potential feedstock by a specification of iodine value (IV; 120 g I2/100 g maximum) contained in EN 14214. A series of alkaline earth metal oxides and alkaline earth metal supported copper oxide were prepared and tested as catalysts. SrO supported 10 wt.% CuO showed the superior catalytic activity for transesterification with a biodiesel yield of 96% and hydrogenation with a reduced iodine value of 113 and also exhibited a promising selectivity for eliminating methyl linolenate and increasing methyl oleate without rising methyl stearate in the selective hydrogenation. The fuel properties of the selective hydrogenated methyl esters are within biodiesel specifications. Furthermore, cetane numbers and iodine values were well correlated with the compositions of the hydrogenated methyl esters according to degrees of unsaturation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this research was to develop a cost-effective pilot-scale fermentation process for lipid production by Rhodotorula glutinis using starch wastewater. A temperature range of 30-37 °C, and an initial chemical oxygen demand (COD) higher than 30,000 mg/L, were optimal for growth and lipid synthesis in flask culture. Cultivation in a 5-L fermenter yielded more than 60 g/L biomass with a 30% (w/w) lipid content after 60 h. Pilot-scale production of microbial lipid in a 300-L fermenter using starch wastewater without sterilization and pH adjustment yielded 40 g/L biomass and 35% lipid content with 80% COD degradation after only 30-40 h of cultivation. Transesterification experiments demonstrated that lipids can be used for biodiesel production. © 2010.

AB  - During Rhizopus oryzae-mediated methanolysis of triglycerides for biodiesel production, the amount of 1,2-DG and 2-MG as well as the ratio of 1,2-DG/1,3-DG and 2-MG/1-MG differed significantly in different reaction medium, which indicated that solvent might be a crucial factor that would influence the acyl migration rate, leading to varied biodiesel yield. In this paper, the influence of solvent and their properties on acyl migration kinetics of both 1,2-diglyceride and 2-monoglyceride were investigated systematically. It was found that decreasing solvent polarity would give increasing acyl migration rate constants in general. Solvent polarity influenced the acyl migration rate through the influence of the charge dispersion of the transition state. High polarity of the solvent was unfavorable to the transition state charge dispersion, which would increase its energy state, and thus decreased the acyl migration rate and then led to relatively lower methyl ester yield. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The hydrogenation of biodiesel was investigated in presence of thermoregulated phase-transfer catalysts to produce fatty alcohols. The thermoregulated catalytic system Pd/IV (IV: P-ligand, tri-(methoxyl polyethylene glycol)-phosphite) exhibited an efficient catalytic performance for the hydrogenation. It was also found that the steric resistance of the P-ligand, to a large extent, affected the performance of catalytic system. Using Pd/IV as catalyst, the product could be easily separated from the catalytic system and the catalyst was of good reusability. Thus, a clean and environmentally friendly strategy for the production of fatty alcohol is provided. © 2010.

AB  - In this study free fatty acids present in Azadirachta indica (Neem) oil were esterified with our synthesized phosphoric acid modified catalyst. During the esterification, the acid value was reduced from 24.4 to 1.8 mg KOH/g oil. Synthesized catalyst was characterized by NH3 TPD, XRD, SEM, FTIR and TGA analysis. During phosphoric acid modification hydrophobic character and weak acid sites of the mordenite were increased, which lead to better esterification when compared to H-mordenite. A kinetic study demonstrates that the esterification reaction followed pseudo-first order kinetics. Thermodynamic studies were also done based on the Arrhenius model. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pyrolysis of industrial fatty wastes (soybean soapstock, beef tallow, and poultry industry waste) was carried out in the absence of catalysts. In all cases, organic mixtures of hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds were obtained. These mixtures were distilled and diesel-like fractions were isolated and characterized by GC-FID, GC-MS and FT-IR, showing the formation of olefins, paraffins, and some oxygenated compounds such as carboxylic acids and esters. The main physical-chemical properties of those isolated diesel-like fuels (density, viscosity, distillation curve, carbon residue, copper corrosion test, cetane index, cold finger plugging point, acid index and heating value) were determined using ASTM standard methods and matched the Brazilian specification for diesel fuel. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Coconut oil having 12.8% free fatty acid (FFA) was used as a feedstock to produce biodiesel by a two-step process. In the first step, FFA level of the coconut oil was reduced to 0.6% by acid-catalyzed esterification. In the second step, triglycerides in product from the first step were transesterified with methanol by using an alkaline catalyst to produce methyl esters and glycerol. Effect of parameters related to these processes was studied and optimized, including methanol-to-oil ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, and reaction time. Methyl ester content of the coconut biodiesel was determined by GC to be 98.4% under the optimum condition. The viscosity of coconut biodiesel product was very close to that of Thai petroleum diesel and other measured properties met the Thai biodiesel (B100) specification. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recently, it has been reported that in the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of palm oil derived biodiesel, Palm Methyl Ester (PME), direct land use change process is one of the important factors. Since most previous researches were targeted on direct land use changes from tropical rain forest to oil palm plantations in Indonesia or Malaysia, in this study, especially targeted on Thailand case, lifecycle emissions of PME including direct land use changes from rubber, tropical fruit plantations and paddy are also estimated. The lifecycle emissions are estimated at 1.01 (Degraded land), 0.64±1.45 (Grassland), 7.68 (Rubber), 4.39 (Mixed orchard), -2.20 (Paddy), 12.53 ± 1.55 (Tropical rain forest), 13.08 ± 7.03 (Tropical lowland forest), 31.39 ± 2.75 (Tropical rain forest (Peat)), 23.66 ± 12.05 (Tropical lowland forest (Peat)) tCO2e/tPME. Even though these estimations are based on limited data, it is indicated that PME production including conversions from rubber, tropical fruit plantations and paddy to oil palm plantation may have less lifecycle GHG emissions than the cases of tropical rain forest conversions, and also indicated that lifecycle emissions of the cases except for conversions from degraded land, grassland and paddy are higher than that of petroleum diesel (3.25 tCO2e).

AB  - We investigated the behaviour of siloxanes, which adversely affect biogas engines, as well as their concentration levels in sewage sludge biogas in Japan. We also performed experiments on the absorptive removal of siloxanes using various adsorbents and determined the main adsorbent characteristics required for the removal of siloxanes. The results of our study on the concentration and composition of siloxanes in biogas were similar to previous reports. Moreover, we found that the concentration of siloxanes changes in relation to the outside air temperature based on real-time measurements of siloxanes using a continuous analyser. We further speculated that the continuous analyser would accurately indicate the siloxane concentration in model biogas but overestimate the siloxane concentration in actual biogas because of positive interference by VOCs and other biogas components. In the siloxane adsorption experiment, the equilibrium uptake of both cyclic siloxanes, D4 and D5, was positively related to the BET-specific surface area of the adsorbents and the fraction of the external surface area taken up by relatively large diameter pores. We attributed the adsorption results to the fact that the siloxane molecules are generally larger than micropores; therefore, they are less susceptible to adsorption to micropores. Based on these results, we concluded that adsorbents with large BET-specific surface areas, especially those with a high external specific surface area and pores of relatively large diameters, are desired for the removal of siloxanes. © IWA Publishing 2010.

AB  - In a solar economy, sustainably available biomass holds the potential to be an excellent nonfossil source of high energy density transportation fuel. However, if sustainably available biomass cannot supply the liquid fuel need for the entire transport sector, alternatives must be sought. This article reviews biomass to liquid fuel conversion processes that treat biomass primarily as a carbon source and boost liquid fuel production substantially by using supplementary energy that is recovered from solar energy at much higher efficiencies than the biomass itself. The need to develop technologies for an energy-efficient future sustainable transport sector infrastructure that will use different forms of energy, such as electricity, H2, and heat, in a synergistic interaction with each other is emphasized. An enabling template for such a future transport infrastructure is presented. An advantage of the use of such a template is that it reduces the land area needed to propel an entire transport sector. Also, some solutions for the transition period that synergistically combine biomass with fossil fuels are briefly discussed. Copyright © 2010 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is renewable and cheap, and it has the potential to displace fossil fuels in the production of fuels and chemicals. Biomass-derived carboxylic acids are important compounds that can be used as platform molecules for the production of a variety of important chemicals on a large scale. Lactic acid, a prototypical biomass derivative, and levulinic acid, an important chemical feedstock produced by hydrolysis of waste cellulosic materials, can be upgraded using bifunctional catalysts (those containing metal and acid sites), which allows the integration of several transformations (e.g., oxygen removal and C-C coupling) in a single catalyst bed. This coupling between active sites is beneficial in that it reduces the complexity and cost of the biomass conversion processes. Deoxygenation of biomass derivatives is a requisite step for the production of fuels and chemicals, and strategies are proposed to minimize the consumption of hydrogen from an external source during this process.

AB  - The 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) has attracted renewed global interest since its improved production methods were published in Nature and Science in 2007. Its high energy density makes it a promising biofuel and a possible alternative to gasoline. Consequently, a series of studies, led by the University of Birmingham, aims to assess the potential of DMF as an automotive energy carrier. These studies will include an analysis of the spray properties, the laminar flame characteristics, the engine performance, and the subsequent emissions. This paper examines the laminar flame characteristics from a quiescent homogeneous air-fuel mixture. The experiments were conducted using a constant volume vessel and were recorded by high speed schlieren visualization. By measurement of the flame growth following ignition, the laminar flame speed was determined. The calculation of flame stretch yielded the Markstein lengths and the laminar burning velocities. This paper presents the results of DMF combustion for a range of equivalence ratios (0.6-2.0) and initial temperatures (50-100 °C). The flame performance when using DMF is compared to EN228 gasoline and to the most commonly used biofuel substitute for gasoline, ethanol. The data shows that ethanol has the highest laminar burning velocity, followed by gasoline, and then DMF. In the 0.9-1.1 equivalence ratio range, the laminar burning velocity of DMF was very similar to gasoline and the difference was within 10%. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The development of economic processes for the production of liquid fuels from biomass requires large investments. Therefore, the search of new catalysts for the enhancement of both the yields and the quality of biofuels is the key to improve the efficiency and reduce costs. In this scenario, acid and base catalysis plays a crucial role in most of the processes used for the production of biofuels, such as the transesterification of vegetable oils with methanol in the biodiesel process and the hydrolysis of cellulose to fermentable sugars for bioethanol production. An overview of some of the technologies currently used commercially or tested at pilot and laboratory scale, based on acid and base catalysts, is presented in this paper. © 2010.

AB  - Model-free kinetic studies for volatilization of Brazilian sunflower oil and its respective biodiesel were carried out. The biodiesel was obtained by the methylic route using potassium hydroxide as catalyst. Both sunflower oil and biodiesel were characterized by physicochemical analyses, gas chromatography, simulated distillation and thermogravimetry. The physicochemical properties indicated that the oil and biodiesel samples are in accordance with the specifications of the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP). Gas chromatography indicated that the biodiesel was obtained with a content of ester of ca. 97.35 wt%. The TG curves indicated that the temperatures for volatilization of biodiesel are lower than for sunflower oil, which is explained by their different compositions and properties. The value of the apparent activation energy for the volatilization process, as determinated by the Vyazovkin Method, was higher for sunflower oil than for biodiesel. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A resource assessment and biorefinery siting optimization model was developed and implemented to assess potential biofuel supply across the Western United States from agricultural, forest, urban, and energy crop biomass. Spatial information including feedstock resources, existing and potential refinery locations and a transportation network model is provided to a mixed integer-linear optimization model that determines the optimal locations, technology types and sizes of biorefineries to satisfy a maximum profit objective function applied across the biofuel supply and demand chain from site of feedstock production to the product fuel terminal. The resource basis includes preliminary considerations of crop and residue sustainability. Sensitivity analyses explore possible effects of policy and technology changes. At a target market price of 19.6 $ GJ-1, the model predicts a feasible production level of 610-1098 PJ, enough to supply up to 15% of current regional liquid transportation fuel demand. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Alternative fuel is currently an important issue all over the world due to the efforts on reducing global warming which is contributed by the combustion of petroleum or petrol diesel. Biodiesel is non-toxic, biodegradable, produced from renewable sources and contributes a minimal amount of net green house gases, such as CO2, SO2 and NO emissions to the atmosphere. The study was carried out to produce biodiesel from waste/recycled oils to reduce the cost of biodiesel, waste and pollution. Some important variables such as volumetric ratio, types of reactants and catalytic activities were selected to obtain a high quality biodiesel fuel within the specifications of the American Standard for Biodiesel Testing Method (ASTM D 6751) and European Norm (EN 14214). The highest biodiesel yield was obtained (71.2%) under the conditions of 1:1 volumetric oil-to-methanol weight ratio, 0.5% NaOH catalyst at 50°C reaction temperature and 320 rpm stirring speed. The results showed that biodiesel produced from different oil to methanol ratios, alcohol types and shaking time exhibited considerable differences. There was also a considerable difference of biodiesel yield produced by using methanol, ethanol and 1-butanol. The biodiesel yield increased in the order of 1-butanol &lt; ethanol &lt;methanol. There was a little difference in viscosity, acid value and chemical elements (Fe, Mg, Ca, Na, P etc.) at different parameters. The research showed that biodiesel obtained under optimum conditions from completely waste oil was of good quality and could be used as a diesel fuel which is considered as potential use of waste cooking oil. In addition, bioenergy could be renewed and environmental recycling process could be maintained potentially using waste soybean cooking oil. © 2010 Academic Journals.

AB  - Biofuels are one of the most promising alternatives to conventional petroleum based fuels. Biodiesel has become more attractive recently because of its environmental benefits and because of its availability from renewable sources. Non-edible oils have been explored to make biodiesel (long chain fatty alkyl ester), in order to substitute the uncertain supplies of conventional diesel fuel. In the present study, non-edible oils - linseed oil, mahua oil and neem oil - have been transesterified to produce their methyl esters (biodiesel). These oils have been studied using alkali and acid catalyst depending on free fatty acids (FFA) content of the oil. Linseed oil is transesterified with methanol in presence of sodium hydroxide as catalyst whereas neem and mahua oil are transesterified using a two-stage procedure, namely, methylation of FFA portion of the oils using an acid catalyst in the first stage and later completing the methanolysis of the remaining triglycerides in the second stage using an alkali catalyst. The maximum yield of methyl ester for linseed oil is 96.56% and for mahua and neem oil, 86.21% and 83.04% respectively. The best methanol to oil ratio required has been found to be 8:1, 30:1 and 30:1 and optimum temperature conditions as 70°C, 75°C and 70°C for linseed oil, mahua oil and neem oil, respectively. The fatty acid methyl esters produced by these oils have been analysed to ensure their suitability as diesel fuel. © 2010 Copyright Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Background: The use of grain for food and biofuels is of high international interest amid rising fossil energy costs, energy security and climate change. Energy efficiency must be improved in high-input agriculture in order to provide net benefits from biofuels. Results: Options for reducing energy inputs into selected examples of Australian grain farms were investigated. Nitrogen fertilizer and diesel accounted for the bulk of nonrenewable energy use (over 73%) and targeted options for reducing their consumption can save from 25 to over 70% in energy use. Conclusion: Strategies to implement energy efficiency improvements into grain farming and improve the sustainability of agricultural production systems are effective but usually incur some production penalties. The trade-offs between energy use and production are discussed. © 2010 CSIRO.

AB  - We have selected Thailand, which has set ethanol and bio-diesel as priority alternative energy sources, and made measurements using the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to identify how policies for promoting and popularizing bio-fuels have favorably contributed to farmers' income. The results have revealed that in the case of bio-fuels as domestic goods and exports, the growth rate of farming household income is 3% to 5% higher than the income of other households. If the bio-fuel industry can be developed from fossil fuels substituting into the bio-fuel export sector, farmer household income will increase even more. The disparity among income brackets and regions will further narrow. In addition, the negative effects on agriculture food processing industries will remain small. If the Thai government can carry out its bio-fuel usage promotion policies as planned, it is possible to use the bio-fuel industry to reduce income disparity. © The Applied Regional Science Conference (ARSC)/Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd. 2011.

AB  - Physic nut species has shown great potential for biofuel production. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of inoculation with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus clarum and the application of organic compost on the growth and phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) absorption, in physic nut seedlings. a randomized experimental blocks design, in a 5x2 factorial scheme, was used, with the evaluation of organic compost levels (0 t ha-1, 15 t ha -1, 30 t ha-1, 60 t ha-1, and 120 t ha -1) and presence or absence of Glomus clarum, with four replications. Physic nut seedlings inoculated with Glomus clarum presented, at levels of 15 t ha-1 of organic compost, the lowest height (20%), 120 days after sowing. However, the basal diameter increased, at levels of 30 t ha-1 (21%) and 120 t ha-1 (33%) of organic compost, 60 days after sowing. Only in the treatment with Glomus clarum, physic nut seedlings showed increasing linear regression adjustment in the dry matter of stem (R2 = 0.99), aerial part (R2 = 0.98), roots (R2 = 0.95), and whole plant (R2 = 0.97), depending on the organic compost levels. Physic nut seedlings inoculated with Glomus clarum showed increases in P content of the aerial part of 93%, 37%, 57%, and 51%, for levels of 15 t ha -1, 30 t ha-1, 60 t ha-1, and 120 t ha -1 of organic compost, respectively. For the N content, such increases were 50% and 45%, at levels of 0 t ha-1 and 60 t ha -1 of organic compost, respectively.

AB  - Low bulk density of corn stover and associated transportation needs have been recognized as an obstacle for large-scale utilization of corn stover for biofuel feedstock. Densification of corn stover reduces transportation needs, while it also demands additional energy and incurs costs. The merit of densification is also subject to the mode of transportation and distance, which in turn depends on the size of biorefineries. In this study, cost and CO 2 emission implications of grinding and pelletizing corn stover for ethanol production are examined. Five different logistics scenarios are compared based on conditions in Minnesota, where truck/rail transportation, handling, and processing costs and associated CO 2 emissions are calculated for various biorefinery capacities. Pelletizing options are the least-cost option for biorfineries larger than 277million liters of annual capacity (MLY), while the round bales via truck option is the least-cost option for biorfineries smaller than 277 MLY. However, pelletizing options generally exhibit poorer performance in terms of their CO 2 emissions. Ground corn stover via rail generates the least CO 2 emissions for biorefineries larger than 130 MLY. For smaller ethanol plants, the round bales via truck option is found to be the most favorable option from the CO2 emission perspective. The results show that pelletizing is economically attractive for mid-size to larger biorefineries, while environmentally unattractive due to its large electricity use regardless of the size of biorefinery. The analysis shows a clear trade-off between environmental and economic objectives, and highlights the needs of addressing the high energy consumption of the pelletizing process. © 2010 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers ISSN 2151-0032.

AB  - Purpose Ambitious targets for the use of renewable energy have recently been set in the European Union. To reach these targets, a large share of future energy generation will be based on the use of woody biomass. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in the cultivation of fast-growing tree species on agricultural land outside forests. Intensive crop production is always considered to harm the environment. The study explores the environmental burdens of the cultivation of fast-growing tree species on agricultural land and their subsequent energetic conversion in comparison to the fossil reference energy system. Methods Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology according to the ISO 14040 and 14044 is used. Input data were partly collected within the German joint research project AGROWOOD. Two utilization paths of short rotation poplar chips are analyzed: heat and power generation in a cogeneration plant and the production of Fischer-Tropsch (FT) diesel. Subsequently, the bioenergy systems are compared with their fossil references. Results and discussion The production and distribution of 1 oven dry tonne (odt) of short-rotation poplar chips require 432 MJ non-renewable energy. This equals an output-input ratio of 43:1, which includes all process steps from field preparation to road transport. Emissions of this energy use amount to a global warming potential of 38.4 kg CO2 eq odt-1, an acidification potential of 0.24 kg SO2 eq odt-1, and a eutrophication potential of 0.04 kg PO 4 eq odt-1. The greatest reductions of environmental impacts can be achieved by substituting power from lignite with cogenerated power from short-rotation coppice (SRC). Compared with the average German power generation mix GWP and AP of power generation from short rotation poplar chips are lower by 97% and 44%, respectively, while eutrophication potential is about 26% higher. FT diesel made from shortrotation poplar chips has an 88% lower global warming potential and a 93% lower acidification potential than fossil diesel. But, the eutrophication potential of FT diesel is twice as high as of fossil diesel. Conclusions It was found that even intensively produced wood from SRC can reduce environmental burdens if it is used for biofuel instead of fossil fuel. The utilization of the same amount of short-rotation poplar chips for heat and power production causes fewer environmental impacts than its use for FT diesel. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Yarrowia lipolytica A-101-1.22 produces high citric acid (112 g l 1-) with a yield of 0.6 g g-1 and a productivity of 0.71 g l-1 h-1 during batch cultivation in the medium with glycerol-containing waste of biodiesel industry. However, it was observed that the specific citric acid production rate, which was maximal at the beginning of the biosynthesis, gradually decreases in the late production phase and it makes continuation of the process over 100 h pointless. The cell recycle and the repeated batch regimes were performed as ways for prolongation of citric acid synthesis by yeast. Using cell recycle, the active citric acid biosynthesis (96-107 g l-1) with a yield of 0.64 g g-12 and a productivity of 1.42 g l-1 h-1 was prolongated up to 300 h. Repeated batch culture remained stable for over 1000 h; the RB variant of 30% feed every 3 days showed the best results: 124.2 g l-1 citric acid with a yield of 0.77 g g-1 and a productivity of 0.85 g l -1 h-1. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

AB  - Fast depletion of the fossil fuels and stringent emission norms direct us to search for some alternative fuel which can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Vegetable oil is a promising alternative fuel for CI engine because it is renewable, environment friendly, and can be produced easily in rural areas. The use of non-edible vegetable oils when compared with edible oils is very significant in developing countries. In this direction, it has already been proved that thevetia peruviana seed oil can be a good alternative fuel for CI engine. In this study, an attempt has been made to study the effect of injection timing and injection pressure on diesel engine fuelled with methyl ester of thevetia peruviana seed oil. A fully automated, single cylinder, constant speed, direct injection diesel engine was operated with the methyl ester of thevetia peruviana seed oil. Advancing the injection timing from the base diesel value and increasing the injector opening pressure has been found to increase the brake's thermal efficiency and reduce CO, HC and smoke emissions significantly. Also, optimum injection time and injection pressure were found as 27° before TDC and 225 bar respectively. Copyright © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Populus euramevicana cv leaves acid hydrolysate has been utilized as a substrate for microbial oil production using Rhodotorula glutinis. Uniform design principles and single-factor experiments were employed to investigate the optimal culture conditions of the biodiesel production, which were pH 6.0, inoculum concentration 15%, yeast extract 7 g/L, peptone 3 g/L, hydrolytic saccharide concentration 40 g/L, KH2PO4 0.1%, 50 mL liquid volume in 150 mL shaking flask, and temperature 28°C. Under the optimized conditions, yeast accumulated lipids up to 28.55% on cellular biomass basis with lipid yield 4.62 g/L in 5L bioreactor without detoxification, and R. glutinis accumulated lipids up to 34.16% with lipid productivity reaching 6.18 g/L after detoxification. The analysis of composition of R. glutinis lipid revealed that R. glutinis could be an ideal host for high-quality biodiesel production. The properties of biodiesel produced by this process comply with the standards established by government institute. Copyright © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The cold flow properties of biodiesel from various feedstocks have been a challenge in adapting the use of biodiesel in diesel engines, especially in cold regions. The use of cold flow improvers for biodiesel helps using biodiesel in a wide range of temperature conditions. In this study, cold flow properties of biodiesel produced from non-edible feedstocks such as croton megalocarpus, jatropha curcas, and moringa oleifera oils were investigated. The evaluated properties were kinematic viscosity, cloud point, and pour point. Different transesterification methods were used to produce biodiesel from these feedstocks due to their difference in the level of free fatty acids (FFA). Croton and moringa oils were found with FFA levels of 1.68% and 0.6%, respectively; thus, one-step transesterification method was chosen for their methyl esters conversion. Jatropha oil was found with FFA level of 8.14% making a two-step acid-base transesterification method to be employed for its methyl esters conversion. The effect of water in the two-step acid-base transesterification process was also investigated for jatropha biodiesel production. The presence of water after acid pretreatment process of jatropha oil was found to reduce both product and methyl esters yield, the best option was to preheat the pretreated jatropha oil to 110°C for 10 min to evaporate water that remain during gravity separation of methanol-water phase. Blending of biodiesels from these three feedstocks with kerosene improved their cold flow properties. The reduction of cloud and pour points from -4°C and -9°C to -11°C and -15°C, respectively, of croton biodiesel was observed when blended with 20% kerosene while cloud and pour points reduction from 1°C and -2°C to -7°C and -12°C, respectively, of jatropha biodiesel was observed when blended with 20% kerosene. Similarly, the reduction of cloud and pour points from 10°C and 3°C to -3°C and -7°C, respectively, of moringa biodiesel was observed when blended with 20% kerosene.

AB  - The possibility of using biomass as a source of energy in reducing green-house gas emissions is a matter of great interest. In particular, biomasse from agriculture represent one of the largest and most diversified sources to be exploited and more specifically, ethanol and diesel deriving from biomass have the potential to be a sustainable means of replacing fossil fuels for transportation. Nevertheless, the cultivation of dedicated energy crops does meet with some criticism (competitiveness with food crop cultivation, water requirements, use of fertilizers, etc.) and the economical and environmental advantages of this activity depend on accurate evaluations of the total efficiency of the production system. This paper illustrates the production potential of two energy crops, sunflower (Helianthus annuus) and maize (Zea mais), cultivated with different water and fertilization supplies in the region of Tuscany, in central Italy. A 50-year climatic series of 19 weather stations scattered around Tuscany was used to run the crop model CropSyst for obtaining crop biomass predictions. The effect of climate change and variability was analyzed and the potential production of bioenergy was investigated in terms of pure vegetable oil (sunflower) and bioethanol (maize). The results demonstrated that despite a reduction in crop yields and an increase of their variability due to climate change, the cultivation of maize in the regional set-aside areas would be capable of supplying approximately 50% of the energy requirements in terms of biofuel for transportation obtained, while the cultivation of a sunflower crops would supply less than 10%. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We compare different options for the use of lignocellulosic biomass to reduce CO2 emission and oil use, focusing on polygeneration of biomass-based motor fuels and electricity, and discuss methodological issues related to such comparisons. The use of biomass can significantly reduce CO2 emission and oil use, but there is a trade-off between the reductions in CO2 emission and oil use. Bioelectricity from stand-alone plants replacing coal-based electricity reduced CO2 emission by 99 kg per GJ biomass input but gave no oil use reduction. Stand-alone produced methanol replacing diesel reduced the CO2 emission with 38 kg and the oil use with 0.67 GJ per GJ biomass, indicating that a potential CO2 emission reduction of 90 kg is lost per GJ oil reduced. CO2 emission and oil use reduction for alternatives co-producing fuel and electricity fall between the stand-alone alternatives. Plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles using bioelectricity reduced CO2 emission by 75-88 kg and oil use by 0.99-1.2 GJ, per GJ biomass input. Biomass can also reduce CO2 emission and/or oil use more efficiently if fossil-fuel-fired boilers or electric heating is replaced by district heating from biomass-based combined heat and power generation. This is also true if electricity or motor fuel is produced from black liquor gasification in pulp mills or if wood is used instead of concrete in building construction. Biomass gasification is an important technology to achieve large reductions, irrespective of whether CO2 emission or oil use reduction is prioritised. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A study was performed to evaluate the use of thermal cracking to overcome cold flow and stability limitations of current biodiesel. Experiments were conducted in a batch cracking reactor system using soy methyl ester and canola methyl ester feedstocks. The amount of high-MW C16-C24 FAMEs was reduced from nearly 100% in the original feedstock by an order of magnitude. Yields of desirable cracking product ranged from 70 to 85% while cloud and pour points decreased around 20°C and 15°C, respectively. The stability of the fuel was improved by converting all of the unsaturated esters into lower-MW saturated esters. This method may lead to an attractive process to produce an improved biodiesel that is more conductive to cold temperature utilization and more stable during storage. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Vegetable oils and animal fats in their raw form have high viscosities that makes them unsuitable as fuels for diesel engines. Transesterification is one of the well-known processes by which fats and oils are converted into biodiesel. The reaction often makes use of acid/base catalyst. If the material possesses high free fatty acid then acid catalyst gives better results. In the present investigation, Mahua oil having 14% free fatty acid was transesterifed to obtain biodiesel using acid catalysts with different alcohols. The alcohols used were Methanol, Ethanol and Butanol. The objective of using higher alcohol is to find their effect on ester yield. The process optimization was made based on the maximum ester yield. The results show that transesterification with butanol gives a better yield compared to methanol and ethanol. The transesterification results show that higher catalyst concentration by 6-10% Vol. produces biodiesel with lower viscosity, lower specific gravity with a higher yield (short reaction time of 5. hours). The best process condition with butanol was found to be 6% Vol. of sulfuric acid with 150% excess butanol, which gave an yield of around 95.4% in a reaction time of 5. hours. The prepared biodiesels were tested as per the standard and were found to be satisfactory. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The paper presents in the first part, step by step, the necessary procedures to be accomplished in order to produce the alternative fuel bio-diesel, starting from waste animal fats with high free fatty acid concentration, and applying the transesterification. Based on the experimental results, one performed further a comparative study concerning the generated impact on air quality, bio-fuel versus normal diesel, when they would be utilized as main fuel for the vehicles in real traffic. The CALROADS software was used. The simulation scenarios were conducted to 2 major crossroads in the city of Timisoara. The simulation results demonstrate clearly that air quality is improved when biofuel is used.

AB  - This paper investigates the effects of biodiesel blends on regulated and unregulated emissions from a Euro 4 diesel passenger car, fitted with a diesel oxidation catalyst and a diesel particle filter (DPF). Emission and fuel consumption measurements were conducted for the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the Artemis driving cycles. Criteria pollutants, along with carbonyl, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and nitrate PAH and oxygenate PAH emissions, were measured and recorded. A soy-based biodiesel and an oxidized biodiesel, obtained from used frying oils, were blended with an ultra low sulfur diesel at proportions of 20, 30, and 50% by volume. The results showed that the DPF had the ability to significantly reduce particulate matter (PM) emissions over all driving conditions. Carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions were also reduced with biodiesel; however, a notable increase in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions was observed with biodiesel blends. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and fuel consumption followed similar patterns and increased with biodiesel. The influence of fuel type and properties was particularly noticeable on the unregulated pollutants. The use of the oxidized biodiesel blends led to significant increases in carbonyl emissions, especially in compounds which are associated with potential health risks such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein. Sharp increases in most PAH compounds and especially those which are known for their toxic and carcinogenic potency were observed with the oxidized blends. The presence of polymerization products and cyclic acids were the main factors that influenced the PAH emissions profile. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The straws of two high-biomass soybean lines developed at ARS for bioenergy were subjected to thermochemical conversion by fast pyrolysis. The objective was to evaluate the potential use of the straw for the production of liquid fuel intermediates. The immediate goal was to demonstrate production of pyrolysis liquid that can be burned "as is" and/or potentially be upgraded to transportation grade fuel and at the same time produce biochar that can be deployed as a soil amendment. The goal supports the concept of onfarm biorefinery where food and bioenergy can be sustainably produced in a soybean farm system. The study shows that high yields of pyrolysis liquids (biooil) can be efficiently produced from the soybean straws using the fluidized-bed fast pyrolysis technology. Free flowing biooils with heating values in excess of 20 MJ/kg were produced in yields of approximately 70 wt %. Accompanying this was 22 wt % mineralrich biochar that can be returned to the soil and up to 10 wt % combustible gas with the potential to partially power the pyrolysis system. A sustainable farm system may be enhanced by the synergy between production of extra biomass in soybean cultivation, lignocellulosic biofuel production, production and use of carbon sequestering, soil-amending biochar in addition to nitrogen fixation by rhizobial bacteria. Although the findings are encouraging, actual data over several years will be necessary to fully evaluate a potential soybean farm biorefinery system by comprehensive life-cycle analysis. © 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog.

AB  - Fatty acids are central hydrocarbon intermediates in the biosynthesis of diesel from renewable sources. We have engineered an Escherichia coli cell line that produces 4.5 g/L/day total fatty acid in a fed-batch fermentation. However, further enhancement of fatty acid biosynthesis in this cell line proved unpredictable. To develop a more reliable engineering strategy, a cell-free system was developed that enabled direct, quantitative investigation of fatty acid biosynthesis and its regulation in E. coli. Using this system, the strong dependence of fatty acid synthesis on malonyl-CoA availability and several important phenomena in fatty acid synthesis were verified. Results from this cell-free system were confirmed via the generation and analysis of metabolically engineered strains of E. coli. Our quantitative findings highlight the enormous catalytic potential of the E. coli fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, and target specific steps for protein and metabolic engineering to enhance the catalytic conversion of glucose into biodiesel. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - An attempted has been made to recover high-calorific fuel gas and useful carbonaceous residue by the electric arc pyrolysis of waste lubricating oil. The characteristics of gas and residues produced from electric arc pyrolysis of waste lubricating oil were investigated in this study. The produced gas was mainly composed of hydrogen (35-40%), acetylene (13-20%), ethylene (3-4%) and other hydrocarbons, whereas the concentration of CO was very low. Calorific values of gas ranged from 11,000 to 13,000kcalkg-1 and the concentrations of toxic gases, such as NOx, HCl and HF, were below the regulatory emissions limit. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of liquid-phase residues showed that high molecular-weight hydrocarbons in waste lubricating oil were pyrolyzed into low molecular-weight hydrocarbons and hydrogen. Dehydrogenation was found to be the main pyrolysis mechanism due to the high reaction temperature induced by electric arc. The average particle size of soot as carbonaceous residue was about 10μm. The carbon content and heavy metals in soot were above 60% and below 0.01ppm, respectively. The utilization of soot as industrial material resources such as carbon black seems to be feasible after refining and grinding. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Five alternative waste-derived fuels obtained from municipal solid waste and different post-consumer packaging were fed in a pilot-scale bubbling fluidized bed gasifier, having a maximum feeding capacity of 100. kg/h. The experimental runs utilized beds of natural olivine, quartz sand or dolomite, fluidized by air, and were carried out under various values of equivalence ratio. The process resulted technically feasible with all the materials tested. The olivine, a neo-silicate of Fe and Mg with an olive-green colour, has proven to be a good candidate to act as a bed catalyst for tar removal during gasification of polyolefin plastic wastes. Thanks to its catalytic activity it is possible to obtain very high fractions of hydrogen in the syngas (between 20% and 30%), even using air as the gasifying agent, i.e. in the most favourable economical conditions and with the simplest plant and reactor configuration. The catalytic activity of olivine was instead reduced or completely inhibited when waste-derived fuels from municipal solid wastes and aggregates of different post-consumer plastic packagings were fed. Anyhow, these materials have given acceptable performance, yielding a syngas of sufficient quality for energy applications after an adequate downstream cleaning. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It is widely acknowledged that Russia possesses enormous biomass resources (Hoogwijk et al., 2005). Its vast areas devoted to agricultural production and plentiful timber resources suggest good prospects for the development of liquid biofuel production. However, no significant advances in this direction have been reported till now. None of the numerous investment projects announced at the heydays of biofuel excitement in Russia (2006-2008) are at the moment commercially operating. There are no specialised plants for the production of bioethanol and biodiesel in Russia. Little is known of the reasons for this discrepancy between biofuel potential and actual development. In investigating this discrepancy, this article analyses national developments and investigates local dynamics through a case-study in the Omsk region. It is found that the reasons for this discrepancy are not related to technological incapabilities, but are to be found in the low policy and institutional priority given to non-fossil fuel exploitation and lack of market opportunities. Sprouts of second generation liquid biofuel technologies can be identified within the state system, but it remains to be seen how strong and how long these will be supported by the Russian state. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The public acceptance of biofuels in Greece is examined in this work. The analysis of 571 face to face interviews shows that 90.7% of the respondents believe that climatic changes are related to fossil fuel consumption, while only 23.8% know the difference between biodiesel and bioethanol. 76.1% believe that energy saving should precede the use of an alternative source of energy. Only 27.3% believe that priority must be given to biofuels over other renewable energy sources. Only 49.9% think that the use of biofuels can be an effective solution against climatic changes and 53.9% believe that the use of biofuels can be an effective solution for the energy problem. Finally, 80.9% of the car owners are willing to use biofuels, 44.8% are willing to pay the supplementary amount of 0.06. €/L of the fuel market price, while the average amount reported as willing to pay was 0.079. €/L on top of the fuel market price. Furthermore, eight models correlating the eight main responses with several socioeconomic variables are developed and analyzed. Those findings heave important policy implications related to the use and promotion of biofuels. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesels have received increasing attention as alternative fuels for diesel engines and generators. This study investigates the emissions of particulate matter (PM), total carbon (TC), e.g., organic/elemental carbons, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from a diesel generator fuelled with soy-biodiesel blends. Among the tested diesel blends (B0, B10 (10vol% soy-biodiesel), B20, and B50), B20 exhibited the lowest PM emission concentration despite the loads (except the 5kW case), whereas B10 displayed lower PM emission factors when operating at 0 and 10kW than the other fuel blends. The emission concentrations or factors of EC, OC, and TC were the lowest when B10 or B20 was used regardless of the loading. Under all tested loads, the average concentrations of total-PAHs emitted from the generator using the B10 and B20 were lower (by 38% and 28%, respectively) than those using pure petroleum diesel fuel (B0), while the emission factors of total-PAHs decreased with an increasing ratio of biodiesel to premium diesel. With an increasing loading, although the brake specific fuel consumption decreased, the energy efficiency increased despite the bio/petroleum diesel ratio. Therefore, soy-biodiesel is promising for use as an alternative fuel for diesel generators to increase energy efficiency and reduce the PM, carbon, and PAH emissions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this work was to produce an immobilized form of lipase from Burkholderia cepacia (lipase PS) with advantageous catalytic properties and stability to be used in the ethanolysis of different feedstocks, mainly babassu oil and tallow beef. For this purpose lipase PS was immobilized on two different non-commercial matrices, such as inorganic matrix (niobium oxide, Nb2O5) and a hybrid matrix (polysiloxane-polyvinyl alcohol, SiO2-PVA) by covalent binding. The properties of free and immobilized enzymes were searched and compared. The best performance regarding all the analyzed parameters (biochemical properties, kinetic constants and thermal stability) were obtained when the lipase was immobilized on SiO2-PVA. The superiority of this immobilized system was also confirmed in the transesterification of both feedstocks, attained higher yields and productivities. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A transesterification reaction of waste cooking oils (WCO) with methanol in the presence of a potassium hydroxide catalyst was performed in a continuous ultrasonic reactor of low-frequency 20 kHz with input capacity of 1 kW, in a two-step process. For the first step, the transesterification was carried out with the molar ratio of methanol to WCO of 2.5:1, and the amount of catalyst 0.7 wt.%. The yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) was about 81%. A yield of FAME of around 99% was attained in the second step with the molar ratio of methanol to initial WCO of 1.5:1, and the amount of catalyst 0.3 wt.%. The FAME yield was extremely high even at the short residence time of the reactants in the ultrasonic reactor (less than 1 min for the two steps) at ambient temperature, and the total amount of time required to produce biodiesel was 15 h. The quality of the final biodiesel product meets the standards JIS K2390 and EN 14214 for biodiesel fuel. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The synthesis, characterization, and application of well-dispersed palladium nanoparticles supported on a mesocellular silica support in the catalytic decarboxylation of stearic acid are reported. Ultra-large pore volume silica mesocellular foam is synthesized as the catalyst support, with amorphous cell-and-window pore diameters of 37 nm and 17 nm, respectively. Silane surface functionalization is employed to ensure thorough metal distribution by providing binding sites for loading of palladium precursor salts. After calcination and reduction, chemisorption and microscopy results indicate ∼2 nm palladium particles are distributed throughout the silica support at 5 wt.% metal loading. The catalysts are active in the batch decarboxylation of stearic acid in nitrogen atmosphere at 300 °C, reaching conversions of 85-90% after 6 h with complete selectivity to the decarboxylation product n-heptadecane. Lower conversions (<15%) are observed after 6 h for the batch decarboxylation of ethyl stearate in nitrogen atmosphere at 300 °C, with 87% selectivity to the decarboxylation product n-heptadecane, and 13% as the intermediate stearic acid. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The catalytic cracking reactions of several kinds of woody oils have been studied. The products were analyzed by GC-MS and FTIR and show the formation of olefins, paraffins and carboxylic acids. Several kinds of catalysts were compared. It was found that the fraction distribution of product was modified by using base catalysts such as CaO. The products from woody oils showed good cold flow properties compared with diesel used in China. The results presented in this work have shown that the catalytic cracking of woody oils generates fuels that have physical and chemical properties comparable to those specified for petroleum based fuels.

AB  - Process simulation and economical evaluation of an enzymatic biodiesel production plant has been carried out. Enzymatic biodiesel production from high quality rapeseed oil and methanol has been investigated for solvent free and cosolvent production processes. Several scenarios have been investigated with different production scales (8 and 200 mio. kg biodiesel/year) and enzyme price. The cosolvent production process is found to be most expensive and is not a viable choice, while the solvent free process is viable for the larger scale production of 200 mio. kg biodiesel/year with the current enzyme price. With the suggested enzyme price of the future, both the small and large scale solvent free production proved viable. The product price was estimated to be 0.73-1.49€/kg biodiesel with the current enzyme price and 0.05-0.75€/kg with the enzyme price of the future for solvent free process. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The National Alcohol Program - PróAlcool, created by the government of Brazil in 1975 resulted less dependency on fossil fuels. The addition of 25% ethanol to gasoline reduced the import of 550 million barrels oil and also reduced the emission CO2 by 110 million tons. Today, 44% of the Brazilian energy matrix is renewable and 13.5% is derived from sugarcane. Brazil has a land area of 851 million hectares, of which 54% are preserved, including the Amazon forest (350 million hectares). From the land available for agriculture (340 million hectares), only 0.9% is occupied by sugarcane as energy crop, showing a great expansion potential. Studies have shown that in the coming years, ethanol yield per hectare of sugarcane, which presently is 6000 L/ha, could reach 10,000 L/ha, if 50% of the produced bagasse would be converted to ethanol. This article describes the efforts of different Brazilian institutions and research groups on second generation bioethanol production, especially from sugarcane bagasse. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nanometer magnetic solid base catalysts were prepared by loading CaO on Fe3O4 with Na2CO3 and NaOH as precipitator, respectively. The optimum conditions for preparation of this catalyst were investigated. The influence of the proportion of Ca2+ to Fe3O4 on the catalytic performance has been studied. The catalyst with highest catalytic activity has been obtained when the proportion of Ca2+ to Fe3O4 is 7:1; the catalytic activity of the catalyst calcined from Ca(OH)2 to Fe3O4 is better than that calcined from CaCO3 to Fe3O4; under the conditions of methanol/oil molar ratio of 15:1, catalyst dosage of 2 wt% and temperature of 70 °C, the biodiesel yield reaches to 95% in 80 min, even to 99% finally. The catalytic activity and recovery rate of the nanometer magnetic solid base catalysts are much better than those of CaO. Calcination temperature was determined by differential thermogravimetric analysis. Ca2Fe2O5, a kind of new metal multiple oxide, was found in the catalyst through X-ray diffraction. At the end, these catalysts were characterized by scanning electronic microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper deals with a methodology for calculating the greenhouse gas (GHG) balances of bioenergy systems producing electricity, heat and transportation biofuels from biomass residues or crops. Proceeding from the standard Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) as defined by ISO 14040 norms, this work provides an overview of the application of the LCA methodology to bioenergy systems in order to estimate GHG balances. In this paper, key steps in the bioenergy chain are identified and the bioenergy systems are compared with fossil reference systems producing the same amount of final products/services. The GHG emission balances of the two systems can thus be compared. Afterwards, the most important methodological assumptions (e.g. functional unit, allocation, reference system, system boundaries) and key aspects affecting the final outcomes are discussed. These key aspects are: changes in organic carbon pools, land-use change effects (both direct and indirect), N2O and CH4 emissions from agricultural soils and effects of crop residue removal for bioenergy use. This paper finally provides some guidelines concerning the compilation of GHG balances of bioenergy systems, with recommendations and indications on how to show final results, address the key methodological issues and give homogenous findings (in order to enhance the comparison across case studies). © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The article deals with the testing results of a four stroke four cylinder, DI diesel engine operating on pure rapeseed oil (RO) and its 2.5vol%, 5vol% and 7.5vol% blends with ethanol (ERO) and petrol (PRO). The purpose of this study is to examine the efect of ethanol and petrol addition to RO on blend viscosity, percentage changes in brake mean effective pressure (bmep), brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc), the brake thermal efciency (ηe) of a diesel engine and its emission composition, including NO, NO2, NO x, CO, CO2, HC and the smoke opacity of exhausts. Te addition of 2.5, 5 and 7.5vol% of ethanol and the same percentage of petrol into RO, at a temperature of 20 °C, diminish the viscosity of the blends by 9.2%, 21.3%, 28.3% and 14.1%, 24.8%, 31.7% respectively. Heating biofuels up to a temperature of 60°C, diminishes the kinematic viscosity of RO, blends ERO2.5-7.5 and PRO2.5-7.5 4.2, 3.9-3.8 and 3.9-3.7 times accordingly. At a speed of 1400-1800 min-1, bmep higher by 1.3% if compared with that of RO (0.772-0.770 MPa) ensures blend PRO2.5, whereas at a rated speed of 2200 min-1, bmep higher by 5.6-2.7% can be obtained when fuelling the loaded engine, λ = 1.6, with both PRO2.5-5 blends. Te bsfc of the engine operating on blend PRO2.5 at maximum torque and rated power is respectively 3.0% and 5.5% lower. Te highest brake thermal efciency at maximum torque (0.400) and rated power (0.415) compared to that of RO (0.394) also suggests blend PRO2.5. Te largest increase in NOx emissions making 1907 ppm (24.8%) and 1811 ppm (19.6%) compared to that of RO was measured from a more calorifc blend PRO7.5 (9.99% oxygen) at low (1400 min-1) and rated (2200 min -1) speeds. Te emission of carbon monoxide from blends ERO2.5-5 throughout the whole speed range runs lower from 6.1% to 32.9% and the smoke opacity of the fully loaded engine changes from 5.1% which is a higher to 46.4% which is a lower level if compared to the corresponding data obtained using pure RO. The CO2 emissions of carbon monoxide and the temperature of the exhausts generated by the engine running at a speed of 2200 min-1 diminish from 7.8 vol% to 6.3vol% and from 500 °C to 465 °C due to the addition of 7.5vol% of ethanol to RO.

AB  - Biodiesel has gained more and more attention in recent years resulting from the fact that it is made of renewable resources. Parallel to its environmental compatibility, biodiesel also exhibits a high thermal stability. We demonstrate here that biodiesel can replace conventional oils as apolar phase in nonaqueous microemulsions containing the room temperature ionic liquid ethylammonium nitrate as polar phase. In addition to the phase diagram and the viscosity of the microemulsions, we study the thermal stability of these systems. Along an experimental path in the phase diagram, no phase change could be observed between 30 °C and 150 °C. Conductivity measurements confirm the high thermal stability of these systems. The microemulsion exhibits a percolative behavior between 30 °C and 150 °C. Small angle X-ray scattering spectra show a single broad scattering peak similar to aqueous microemulsions. The spectra could well be described by the Teubner-Strey model. Furthermore, the adaptability of different models ranging from bicontinuous structures to ionic liquid in oil spheres as well as disordered open connected cylinders has been checked. These high temperature stable, nonaqueous, free of crude oil based organic solvent microemulsions highlight an efficient way towards the formulation of environmentally compatible microemulsions and open a wide field of potential applications. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Several reactions can contribute to the overall process of exhaust gas reforming, during which some of the engine fuel is catalytically converted mainly to H2 and CO. If the predominant reactions are endothermic, the process acts as a means of exhaust-heat recovery, and the fuel heating value is raised. When using conventional gasoline or diesel fuel, the reforming catalyst is required to promote steam- and dry-reforming, at the expense of the exothermic reactions - water gas shift, methanation, partial oxidation and combustion. In this study we show that a precious metal formulation is capable of catalysing most of the key reforming routes with the exception of the water gas shift reaction, under the set of conditions that we have used to simulate an exhaust from a bioethanol-fuelled spark ignition engine. Our results predict that the overall process of exhaust gas reforming of C2H 5OH will be oxidative, and yet waste heat will be consumed. The expected increase in fuel heating value is 6%, but can rise towards 20% if there is less O2 available in the exhaust, allowing more of the bioethanol to react by steam- and dry-reforming in the catalyst bed. By feeding the reformate back to the engine, the intention is to improve the fuel economy and emission quality. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Life-cycle assessments (LCA) of biodistillate fuels are becoming increasingly important for policy decisions regarding alternative fuels. However, due to the data intensive and assumptive nature of LCAs, rarely do two different studies produce comparable results. To add to the complexity, effects of indirect land use changes are now being incorporated into LCA models. This development is influencing policy decisions and generating much controversy. A literature survey of 55 different LCA studies of bio- distillate fuels was conducted. The comparison of energy requirements and global warming potential (GWP) impacts of these studies help to illustrate which data inputs and assumptions most strongly affect the results, and wherein the major discrepancies lie. Life-cycle energy results are typically reported as energy return (ER), meaning the heating value of the biofuel divided by the total fossil energy inputs to produce the fuels. Most studies report significantly higher ER values for biodistillates (both biodiesel and renewable diesel) compared to conventional diesel fuel. Similarly, most LCA studies show significant GWP reductions for biodistillates compared to conventional diesel. However, due to lack of consistency in LCA approaches and assumptions, considerable uncertainty still exists regarding the accuracy of most LCA results. © 2009 SAE International.

AB  - Based on a Tuning Fork flexural resonator, an innovative, miniaturized and rugged sensor that directly and simultaneously measures a fluid's dynamic viscosity, density and dielectric constant has been developed. The sensor provides a simultaneous fluid temperature measurement by incorporating a temperature sensor into the sensor assembly. The physical property measurements for viscosity, density and dielectric constant are accomplished by high performance algorithms that provide direct feedback to Engine Control Module (ECM), Urea SCR, fuel and other fluid management systems. Based on these data, real-time modification of engine or system operation can be made to optimize power, efficiency, oil drain management and emissions depending on the fluid and control system that integrates the sensor. Single parameter sensors like electrical property sensors fail to provide sufficient information to accurately monitor fluid quality or degradation. On the contrary, the tuning fork sensor provides multi parametric analysis to enable effective fluid condition monitoring as its four measured parameters offer a 4 dimensional fluid profile based on their absolute and relative change. This technology is being applied to a variety of fluids such as engine and hydraulic oils, fuels and biofuels, transmission oils and urea. Several key application examples are presented for discussion in this paper: assessment of fluid quality to make a smarter use of engine oil, fuel quality monitoring and unauthorized fuel identification, and finally monitoring of urea solutions quality. © 2009 SAE International.

AB  - Global demand for alternative fuels to combat rising energy costs has sparked a renewed interest in catalysts that can effectively remediate NOx emissions resulting from combustion of a range of HC based fuels. Because many of these new engine technologies rely on lean operating environments to produce efficient power, the resulting emissions are also present in a lean atmosphere. While HCs are easily controlled in such environments, achieving high NOx conversion to N2 has continued to elude fully satisfactory solution. Until recently, most approaches have relied on catalysts with precious metals to either store NOx and subsequently release it as N2 under rich conditions, or use NH3 SCR catalysts with urea injection to reduce NOx under lean conditions. However, new improvements in Ag based technologies also look very promising for NOx reduction in lean environments. Early in 2009 we proposed Dual SCR, a further enhancement to Ag HC-SCR, where an NH3-SCR catalyst follows the HC-SCR catalyst. The second catalyst improves overall efficiency using ammonia formed on the Ag HC-SCR catalyst to further reduce NOx. This lean NOx aftertreatment approach, with a catalyst cost at a fraction of precious metal systems, has shown NOx reduction activity exceeding 90% under a variety of temperature and feed conditions in our bench reactor studies. Here we extend our efforts to an engine test cell and use a range of fossil and biofuels as the reductants for the Ag HC-SCR catalysts and we continue to find excellent NOx reduction efficiencies. Although relatively low concentrations of H2 (near 0.1%) are useful for enhancing NOx activity at low temperatures (below 250 °C), the benefit decreases for exhaust temperatures near and above 400 °C. This technology could be a key enabler for low cost and efficient NOx reduction to help auto manufacturers meet Tier2/Bin5 and Tier2/Bin2 emissions standards. © 2009 SAE International.

AB  - Jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) is receiving attention recently as a biofuel crop. It has been introduced as drought resistant, but few quantitative data concerning its tolerance have been presented. We evaluated the tolerances of Jatropha to drought and salinity stresses in terms of parameter values in the widely used macroscopic root wateruptake model. With suchpara-meter values, root water uptake under stresses can be accurately predicted, which may contribute to efficient water management in arid and semiarid regions where irrigation is required to attain high yield. We conducted a column experiment using five columns with one plant each: three were under stresses, the others provided potential transpiration. Three TDR probes were inserted into each of the two columns to observe water content and electrical conductivity. The soil surface was covered to prevent evaporation. Weight of the columns was manually measured to obtain daily transpiration. After the stress period, root density distributions were obtained by dismantling the columns. Three parameter values were inversely determined by minimising the sum of square differences between observed and calculated daily transpiration rates. Water uptake at each depth and time was calculated by substituting linearly interpolated matric and osmotic potentials into the stress response function. Optimized daily transpiration rates agreed well with the observations. Determined stress response functions indicate that Jatropha is not more tolerant either to drought or to salinity compared to other major crop such as soybean or wheat. © 2010 Institute of Agrophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - A gas-to-liquid (GTL) fuel derived from Low Temperature Fischer-Tropsch process has been tested in an automotive diesel engine fulfilling Euro 4 emissions regulations. Both regulated and non-regulated emissions have been compared with those of a commercial diesel fuel, a commercial biodiesel fuel and a GTL-biodiesel fuel (30% and 70% v/v, respectively) in order to check blending properties, synergistic effects and compatibility between first and second generation production technologies for biofuel consumption in current diesel engines. After presenting a detailed literature review, and confirming that similar efficiencies are attained with the four tested fuels under identical road-like operating conditions (this meaning fuel consumption is inversely proportional to their heating values), significant reductions in smoke opacity, particulate matter emissions and particle number concentration were observed with both GTL and biodiesel fuels, with small changes in NOx emissions. Compared with the reductions in PM emissions derived from the use of biodiesel fuels, those derived from using GTL fuels were quite similar, despite its lower soot emissions reductions. This can be explained by the lower volatile organic fraction of the PM in the case of GTL. By adequately blending both fuels, a considerable potential to optimise the engine emissions trade-off is foreseen. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is a fatty acid alkyl ester, which is renewable, biodegradable and non-toxic fuel which can be derived from any vegetable oil by transesterification. One of the popularly used biodiesel in India is Mahua oil (Madhuca Indica). In the present investigation Mahua oil was transesterified using methanol in the presence of alkali catalyst and was used to study the performance and emission characteristics. The biodiesel was tested on a single cylinder, four stroke compression ignition engine. Engine performance tests showed that power loss was around 13% combined with 20% increase in fuel consumption with Mahua oil methyl ester at full load. Emissions such as carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon were lesser for Mahua ester compared to diesel by 26% and 20% respectively. Oxides of nitrogen were lesser by 4% for the ester compared to diesel. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Governments have been promoting biofuels for various stated aims to help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, to substitute for oil imports, to enhance energy security, and/or to gain export income. Biofuel crops have been blamed for numerous harmful effects in the global South. Beyond the impacts of planting a specific crop, indirect harm also results by displacing production across the globe. The US farmers have increased their corn production for biofuels while decreasing acres planted in soybeans, which shifted elsewhere, since 2007. Moreover, states have a weaker capacity or incentive to protect general livelihoods and environments, especially in the global South. Where land access and cost structures are unfavorable, biofuel crops could possibly be developed as a local energy substitute, especially in peripheral localities that are not well served by conventional fossil-fuel infrastructures. Current dispossession of resources, especially in the global South, has analogies with the primitive accumulation that originally turned resources into private property.

AB  - The US biodiesel business is on life support, waiting for legislative action that could save it. A tax incentive that was sustaining this new industry lapsed on 12/31/2009, eliminating the $1/gal subsidy that had offset biodiesel's higher production costs and had kept it competitively priced with conventional, petroleum-based diesel. The Congress, whose attention was riveted on health-care reform, failed to extend the subsidy, which had been in place since 2004. After 9 consecutive years of steady growth, output by the country's 170-plus biodiesel producers plummeted to < 0.5 billion gal in 2009, compared with almost 0.7 billion gal in 2008, according to the Energy Information Administration. As a result, by year-end 2009, the industry had lost about 29,000 of its 52,000 jobs and was producing at only about 15% of its capacity. Earlier this year, the US House of Representatives passed a 1-yr extension of the credit, retroactive to 1/1/2010. Then the Senate included an extension in a jobs bill that was approved in early March 2010. However, the two legislative bodies must resolve differences between their respective bills before the tax credit can be reinstated. Consequently, biodiesel production in the US has come almost completely to a standstill and many facilities have shut down. Among the plants taken offline are Renewable Biofuels' 180 million gal/yr plant in Port Neches, TX, the largest biodiesel refinery in the country; and GreenHunter Energy's year-old, 100 million gal/yr facility on the Houston Ship Channel.

AB  - The fuel matrix used in Brazil is unique around the world. The intensive use of hydrated ethanol, gasohol (gasoline with 25% v/v of ethanol), compressed natural gas (CNG), and biodiesel leads to a peculiar composition of the urban atmosphere. From 1998 to 2002 an increase in formaldehyde levels was observed and since then, a reduction. This work presents a monitoring campaign that was executed from March 2004 to February 2009 by sampling at early morning on every sunny Wednesday for a total of 183 samples. The results indicate a strong reduction in formaldehyde levels from 2004 (average of 135.8μgm-3 with SD 28.4μgm-3) to 2009 (average of 49.3μgm-3 with SD 27.4μgm-3). The levels of acetaldehyde showed a slight reduction from 2004 (average of 34.9μgm-3 with SD 8.0μgm-3) to 2009 (average of 26.8μgm-3 with SD 11.5μgm-3). Comparing the results with the concurrent evolution of the fleet and of fuel composition indicates that the observed formaldehyde levels could be associated with the increase in ethanol use and in CNG use by engines with improved technology over the first converted CNG engines. Modelling studies using the OZIPR trajectory model and the SAPRC chemical mechanism indicate that formaldehyde is the main ozone precursor in Rio de Janeiro and acetaldehyde is the forth one. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The development of renewable alternatives to diesel and jet fuels is highly desirable for the heavy transportation sector, and would offer benefits over the production and use of short-chain alcohols for personal transportation. Here, we report the development of a metabolically engineered strain of Escherichia coli that overproduces medium-chain length fatty acids via three basic modifications: elimination of β-oxidation, overexpression of the four subunits of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and expression of a plant acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterase from Umbellularia californica (BTE). The expression level of BTE was optimized by comparing fatty acid production from strains harboring BTE on plasmids with four different copy numbers. Expression of BTE from low copy number plasmids resulted in the highest fatty acid production. Up to a seven-fold increase in total fatty acid production was observed in engineered strains over a negative control strain (lacking β-oxidation), with a composition dominated by C12 and C14 saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Next, a strategy for producing undecane via a combination of biotechnology and heterogeneous catalysis is demonstrated. Fatty acids were extracted from a culture of an overproducing strain into an alkane phase and fed to a Pd/C plug flow reactor, where the extracted fatty acids were decarboxylated into saturated alkanes. The result is an enriched alkane stream that can be recycled for continuous extractions. Complete conversion of C 12 fatty acids extracted from culture to alkanes has been demonstrated yielding a concentration of 0.44 g L-1 (culture volume) undecane. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Biodiesel from Jatropha curcas L. seed is conventionally produced via a two-step method: extraction of oil and subsequent esterification/ transesterification to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), commonly known as biodiesel. Contrarily, in this study, a single step in situ extraction, esterification and transesterification (collectively known as reactive extraction) of J. curcas L. seed to biodiesel, was investigated and optimized. Design of experiments (DOE) was used to study the effect of various process parameters on the yield of FAME. The process parameters studied include reaction temperature (30-60 °C), methanol to seed ratio (5-20 mL/g), catalyst loading (5-30 wt %), and reaction time (1-24 h). The optimum reaction condition was then obtained by using response surface methodology (RSM) coupled with central composite design (CCD). Results showed that an optimum biodiesel yield of 98.1% can be obtained under the following reaction conditions: reaction temperature of 60 °C, methanol to seed ratio of 10.5 mL/g, 21.8 wt % of H2SO4, and reaction period of 10 h. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel is an interesting alternative energy source and is used as substitute for petroleum-based diesel. Microorganisms have been used for biodiesel production due to their significant environmental and economic benefits. However, few researches have investigated the regulation of fatty acid composition of these microbial diesels. Fatty acid biosynthesis in Escherichia coli has provided a paradigm for other bacteria and plants. By overexpressing two genes (fabA and fabB) associated with unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) synthesis in E. coli, we have engineered an efficient producer of UFAs. Saturated fatty acid (SFA) contents decreased from 50.2% (the control strain) to 34.6% (the recombinant strain overexpressing fabA and fabB simultaneously) and the ratio of cis-vaccenate (18:1Δ11), a major UFA in E. coli, reached 51.1% in this recombinant strain. When an Arabidopsis thaliana thioesterase (AtFatA) was coexpressed with these two genes, 0.19 mmol l-1 fatty acids was produced by this E. coli strain after 18-h culture under shake-flask conditions. Free fatty acids made up about 37.5% of total fatty acid concentration in this final engineered strain carrying fabA, fabB, and AtFatA, and the ratio of UFA/SFA reached 2.3:1. This approach offers a means to improve the fatty acid composition of microdiesel and might pave the way for production of biodiesel equivalents using engineered microorganisms in the near future. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The present paper presents results from the analysis of 29 individual C2-C9 hydrocarbons (HCs) specified in the European Commission Ozone Directive. The 29 HCs are measured in exhaust from common, contemporary vehicle/engine/fuel technologies for which very little or no data is available in the literature. The obtained HC emission fingerprints are compared with fingerprints deriving from technologies that are being phased out in Europe. Based on the total of 138 emission tests, thirteen type-specific fingerprints are extracted (Mean±SD percentage contributions from individual HCs to the total mass of the 29 HCs), essential for receptor modelling source apportionment. The different types represent exhaust from Euro3 and Euro4 light-duty (LD) diesel and petrol-vehicles, Euro3 heavy-duty (HD) diesel exhaust, and exhaust from 2-stroke preEuro, Euro1 and Euro2 mopeds. The fuels comprise liquefied petroleum gas, petrol/ethanol blends (0-85% ethanol), and mineral diesel in various blends (0-100%) with fatty acid methyl esters, rapeseed methyl esters palm oil methyl esters, soybean oil methyl or sunflower oil methyl esters. Type-specific tracer compounds (markers) are identified for the various vehicle/engine/fuel technologies.An important finding is an insignificant effect on the HC fingerprints of varying the test driving cycle, indicating that combining HC fingerprints from different emission studies for receptor modelling purposes would be a robust approach.The obtained results are discussed in the context of atmospheric ozone formation and health implications from emissions (mgkm-1 for LD and mopeds and mgkWh-1 for HD, all normalised to fuel consumption: mgdm-3fuel) of the harmful HCs, benzene and 1,3-butadiene.Another important finding is a strong linear correlation of the regulated " total" hydrocarbon emissions (tot-HC) with the ozone formation potential of the 29 HCs (ΣPO3=(1.66±0.04)×tot-RH; r2=0.93). Tot-HC is routinely monitored in emission control laboratories, whereas C2-C9 are not. The revealed strong correlations broadens the usability of data from vehicle emission control laboratories and facilitates the comparison of the ozone formation potential of HCs in exhaust from of old and new vehicle/engine/fuel technologies. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The application of waste frying oil (WFO) mixed with rapeseed oil as a feedstock for the effective production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) in a lipase-catalyzed process was investigated. The response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the interaction of four variables: the percentage of WFO in the mixed feedstock, the methanol-to-oil ratio, the dosage of Novozym 435 as a catalyst and the temperature. Furthermore, the addition of methanol to the reaction mixture in a second step after 8 h was shown to effectively diminish enzyme inhibition. Using this technique, the model predicted the optimal conditions that would reach 100% FAME, including a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 3.8:1, 100% (wt) WFO, 15% (wt) Novozym 435 and incubation at 44.5 °C for 12 h with agitation at 200 rpm, and verification experiments confirmed the validity of the model. According to the model, the addition of WFO increased FAME production yield, which is largely due to its higher contents of monoacylglycerols, diacylglycerols and free fatty acids (in comparison to rapeseed oil), which are more available substrates for the enzymatic catalysis. Therefore, the replacement of rapeseed oil with WFO in Novozym 435-catalyzed processes could diminish biodiesel production costs since it is a less expensive feedstock that increases the production yield and could be a potential alternative for FAME production on an industrial scale. © 2009 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

AB  - The search for alternative fuels and new fuel resources is a top priority for Turkey, as is the case in the majority of countries throughout the world. The fuel policies pursued by governmental or civil authorities are of key importance in the success of alternative fuel use, especially for widespread and efficient use. Following the 1973 petroleum crisis, many users in Turkey, especially in transportation sector, searched for alternative fuels and forms of transportation. Gasoline engines were replaced with diesel engines between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s. In addition, natural gas was introduced to the Turkish market for heating in the early 1990s. Liquid petroleum gas was put into use in the mid-1990s, and bio-diesel was introduced into the market for transportation in 2003. However, after long periods of indifference governmental action, guidance and fuel policies were so weak that they did not make sense. Entrepreneurs and users experienced great economical losses and lost confidence in future attempts to search for other possible alternatives. In the present study, we will look at the history of alternative fuel use in the recent past and investigate the alternative engine fuel potential of Turkey, as well as introduce possible future policies based on experience. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In Norway, the boreal forest offers a considerable resource base, and emerging technologies may soon make it commercially viable to convert these resources into low-carbon biofuels. Decision makers are required to make informed decisions about the environmental implications of wood biofuels today that will affect the medium and long-term development of a wood-based biofuels industry in Norway. We first assess the national forest-derived resource base for use in biofuel production. A set of biomass conversion technologies is then chosen and evaluated for scenarios addressing biofuel production and consumption by select industry sectors. We then apply an environmentally extended, mixed-unit, two-region input-output model to quantify the global warming mitigation and fossil fuel displacement potentials of two biofuel production and consumption scenarios in Norway up to 2050. We find that a growing resource base, when used to produce advanced biofuels, results in cumulative global warming mitigation potentials of between 58 and 83 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents avoided (Mt-CO2-eq.-avoided) in Norway, depending on the biofuel scenario. In recent years, however, the domestic pulp and paper industry-due to increasing exposure to international competition, capacity reductions, and increasing production costs-has been in decline. In the face of a declining domestic pulp and paper industry, imported pulp and paper products are required to maintain the demand for these goods and thus the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the exporting region embodied in Norway's pulp and paper imports reduce the systemwide benefit in terms of avoided greenhouse gas emissions by 27%. © 2010 by Yale University.

AB  - Active components comprised of fluorite-like Lnx(Ce0.5Zr0.5)1-xO2-y (Ln = La, Pr, Sm) and perovskite-like La0.8Pr0.2Mn0.2Cr0.8O3 mixed oxides and their composites with yttria-doped zirconia (YSZ) promoted by precious metals (Pt, Ru) and/or Ni were supported on several types of heat-conducting substrates (compressed Ni-Al foam, Fecralloy foil or gauze protected by corundum layer, Cr-Al-O microchannel cermets, titanium platelets protected by oxidic layer) as well as on honeycomb corundum monolithic substrate. These structured catalysts were tested in pilot-scale reactors in the reactions of steam reforming of methane, selective oxidation of decane and gasoline and steam/autothermal reforming of biofuels (ethanol, acetone, anisole, sunflower oil). Applied procedures of supporting nanocomposite active components on monolithic/structured substrates did not deteriorate their coking stability in real feeds with a small excess of oxidants, which was reflected in good middle-term (up to 200 h) performance stability promising for further up-scaling and long-term tests. Equilibrium yield of syngas at short contact times was achieved by partial oxidation of decane and gasoline without addition of steam usually required to prevent coking. For the first time possibility of successive transformation of biofuels (ethanol, acetone, anisole, sunflower oil) into syngas at short contact times on monolithic catalysts was demonstrated. This was provided by a proper combination of active component, thermal conducting monolithic substrates and unique evaporation/mixing unit used in this research. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Methylesters and ethylesters of fatty acids were synthesized using homogeneous CH3ONa and CH3CH2ONa, anion exchanged resin, and CaO-La2O3 catalysts. Methanol, ethanol, and methanol/ethanol mixtures were used as the alcohol feed for transesterification of soybean oil. With a homogeneous catalyst (CH3ONa) there was essentially no difference in conversion rates between methanolysis and ethanolysis in batch reactions. However, with a heterogeneous resin and CaO-La2O3 catalysts, significant differences in the conversion rates between the methanolysis and ethanolysis were observed. The formation rate of methylesters over a CaO-La2O3 catalyst was higher than that of ethylesters, which may be attributable to a steric hindrance effect. Conversely, with a heterogeneous resin catalyst, the conversion rate of ethylester was higher than that of methylesters which may be attributable to the surface hydrophobicity of the anion exchanged resin. When the transesterification of soybean oil was carried out with an equimolar methanol/ethanol mixture, the yield ratio of methylester to ethylester formed within the first 30 min was 2.6 for the homogeneous catalyst (0.3% CH3ONa), and 3.4 for the heterogeneous CaO-La2O3catalyst. These differences in selectivity are likely due to both the higher reactivity of methoxide and to a steric hindrance effect of ethoxide on the catalyst surface. In addition, the transformation of methylester to ethylester was observed when a methanol/ethanol mixture was used. Crown Copyright © 2010.

AB  - Waste frying oils (WFO) can be a good source for the production of biodiesel because this raw material is not part of the food chain, is low cost and can be used in a way that resolves environmental problems (i.e. WFO is no longer thrown into the sewage network). The goal of this article is to propose a method to evaluate the costs of biodiesel production from WFO to develop an economic assessment of this alternative. This method embraces a logistics perspective, as the cost of collection of oil from commercial producers and its delivery to biodiesel depots or plants can be relevant and is an issue that has been little explored in the academic literature. To determine the logistics cost, a mathematical programming model is proposed to solve the vehicle routing problem (VRP), which was applied in an important urban center in Brazil (Rio de Janeiro), a relevant and potential center for biodiesel production and consumption. Eighty-one biodiesel cost scenarios were compared with information on the commercialization of biodiesel in Brazil. The results obtained demonstrate the economic viability of biodiesel production from WFO in the urban center studied and the relevance of logistics in the total biodiesel production cost. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A continuous process for biodiesel production has been simulated using Aspen HYSYS V7.0 software. As fresh feed, feedstocks with a mild acid content have been used. The process flowsheet follows a traditional alkaline transesterification scheme constituted by esterification, transesterification and purification stages. Kinetic models taking into account the concentration of the different species have been employed in order to simulate the behavior of the CSTR reactors and the product distribution within the process. The comparison between experimental data found in literature and the predicted normalized properties, has been discussed. Additionally, a comparison between different thermodynamic packages has been performed. NRTL activity model has been selected as the most reliable of them. The combination of these models allows the prediction of 13 out of 25 parameters included in standard EN-14214:2003, and confers simulators a great value as predictive as well as optimization tool. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrocarbon oil was obtained by co-deoxy-liquefaction of biomass and vegetable oil in the work. Results showed the weight ratio of biomass to vegetable oil exerted a great effect on the quality of obtained hydrocarbon oil. The optimum weight ratio of biomass to vegetable oil was 4.4:1, when alkanes with the content of 50.43% were detected in obtained hydrocarbon oil, with lower oxygen content of 2.52%, which resulted in higher calorific value-up to 43.36 MJ kg-1. At the same time, removal rate of carbonyl group of vegetable oil in the mixture reached at least 75.11%. The overall efficiency of the deoxy-liquefaction of biomass and the decarboxylation of vegetable oil were both enhanced by adding vegetable oil into biomass. Compared with the oils obtained from vegetable oil and biomass, respectively, distribution of hydrocarbon oil obtained from the mixture was much more similar to that of diesel oil. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The emergence of biomass based energy warrants the evaluation of syngas from biomass gasification as a fuel for personal power systems. The objectives of this study were to determine the performance and exhaust emissions of a commercial 5.5 kW generator modified for operation with 100% syngas at different syngas flows and to compare the results with those obtained for gasoline operation at same electrical power. The maximum electrical power output for syngas operation was 1392 W and that for gasoline operation was 2451 W. However, the overall efficiency of the generator at maximum electrical power output for both the fuels were found to be the same. The concentrations of CO and NOx in the generator exhaust were lower for the syngas operation, respectively by 30-96% and 54-84% compared to the gasoline operation. However, the concentrations of CO2 in the generator exhaust were significantly higher by 33-167% for the syngas operation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The biorefinery approach, consisting in transesterification using methanol and potassium hydroxide as catalyst, has been used to assess coconut oil valorisation. Due to the fatty acid composition of coconut oil, low (LMWME) and high (HMWME) molecular weight fatty acid methyl esters were obtained. Methyl laurate (78.30 wt.%) is the major component of the low molecular weight fraction. The influence of variables such as temperature and catalyst concentration on the production of both fractions has been studied and optimized by means of factorial design and response surface methodology (RSM). Two separate optimum conditions were found to be a catalyst concentration of 0.9% and 1% and an operation temperature of 42.5 °C and 57 °C for LMWME and HMWME, respectively, obtaining conversion rates of 77.54% and 25.41%. The valuable components of LMWME may be recovered for sale as biolubricants or biosolvents, the remaining fraction could be used as biodiesel, matching the corresponding European Standard. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the results of experimental work carried out to evaluate the combustion performance and exhaust emission characteristics of turpentine oil fuel (TPOF) blended with conventional diesel fuel (DF) fueled in a diesel engine. Turpentine oil derived from pyrolysis mechanism or resin obtained from pine tree dissolved in a volatile liquid can be used as a bio-fuel due to its properties. The test engine was fully instrumented to provide all the required measurements for determination of the needed combustion, performance and exhaust emission variables. The physical and chemical properties of the test fuels were earlier determined in accordance to the ASTM standards. Results: Indicated that the engine operating on turpentine oil fuel at manufacture's injection pressure - time setting (20.5 MPa and 23° BTDC) had lower carbon monoxide (CO), unburned hydrocarbons (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), smoke level and particulate matter. Further the results showed that the addition of 30% TPOF with DF produced higher brake power and net heat release rate with a net reduction in exhaust emissions such as CO, HC, NOx, smoke and particulate matter. Above 30% TPOF blends, such as 40% and 50% TPOF blends, developed lower brake power and net heat release rate were noted due to the fuels lower calorific value; nevertheless, reduced emissions were still noted. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The off grid electrification by utilizing Integrated Renewable Energy System (IRES) is proposed to satisfy the electrical and cooking needs of the seven-uneletrified villages in the Almora district of Uttarakhand state, India. Four different scenarios are considered during modeling and optimization of IRES to ensure reliability parameters such as energy index ratio (EIR) and expected energy not supplied (EENS). The optimum system reliability, total system cost and cost of energy (COE) have also been worked out by introducing the customer interruption cost (CIC). The four different renewable energy scenarios have been compared for the considered study area using the LINGO software version 10. The fourth renewable energy scenario accounting 44.99% micro hydropower (MHP), 30.07% biomass, 5.19% biogas and 4.16% solar energy along with the additional resources of wind (1.27%) and energy plantation (12.33%) has been found to be the best among the different options considered. Furthermore, the optimal reliability for the fourth IRES system has been found to be 0.95 EIR at the optimized cost of Rs 19.44 lacs with estimated COE of Rs 3.36 per kWh. The COE obtained using LINGO software and HOMER software has also been compared and briefly discussed for all the four scenarios. In order to verify feasibility and cost of system for different biomass fuel prices, a sensitivity analysis has also been carried out and it has been found that the fourth scenario is more sustainable than the other considered options. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is widely accepted as an additive for fossil derived diesel in compression ignition engines. It offers many advantages including: higher cetane number; reduced emissions of particulates, NOx, SOx, CO, and hydrocarbons; reduced toxicity; improved safety; and lower lifecycle CO2 emissions. A characteristic of biodiesel limiting its application is its relatively poor low-temperature flow properties, which are primarily a consequence of the fatty acid make-up of the oil feedstock. Attempts to influence the fatty acid profile of either the oil feedstock or the biodiesel product include winterisation and fractionation which reduce the fraction of saturated fatty acids and result in large reductions in yield. A reduction in saturated fatty acids reduces ignition quality of the fuel, while an increase in unsaturation reduces oxidation stability. Additives designed for petroleum diesel have been used with limited success and specific additives for biodiesel remain in their infancy. The addition of branched moieties either to the alkyl head-group of the ester or as a side-chain to the tail-group can reduce the cloud point. Specifically, the removal of the double bonds on the ester group and the addition of a side-chain may provide a benefit in terms of low-temperature properties and offer improved oxidation stability. However, a negative impact on ignition quality and viscosity may result. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work provides details of an activity undertaken to determine the relevant properties of Croton megalocarpus seeds as a source of vegetable oil and its prospects as a non-food crop source of biodiesel. C. megalocarpus is a tree indigenous to East Africa which grows up to a height of 35-40. m and produces seeds which contain 40-45% oil on a mass basis. The seeds were examined and properties determined that relate to their transport and storage/handling characteristics. Oil was extracted mechanically from the seeds using a hydraulic press and chemically from the pressing residue using petroleum ether. The combustion quality of the extracted crude vegetable oil such as the gross calorific value, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen content and ash content were then determined. This study indicates that the oil from the C. megalocarpus tree has a strong potential as a source of biodiesel. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Diminishing fossil fuel reserves and the increase in their consumption indicate that strategies need to be developed to produce biofuels from renewable resources. Biodiesel offers advantages over other petroleum-derived fuel substitutes, because it is comparatively environmentally friendly and an excellent fuel for existing diesel engines. Biodiesel, which consists of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), is usually obtained from plant oils. However, its extensive production from oil crops is not sustainable because of the impact this would have on food supply and the environment. Microbial oils are postulated as an alternative to plant oils, but not all oleaginous microorganisms have ideal lipid profiles for biodiesel production. On the other hand, lipid profiles could be modified by genetic engineering in some oleaginous microorganisms, such as the fungus Mucor circinelloides, which has powerful genetic tools. We show here that the biomass from submerged cultures of the oleaginous fungus M. circinelloides can be used to produce biodiesel by acid-catalyzed direct transformation, without previous extraction of the lipids. Direct transformation, which should mean a cost savings for biodiesel production, increased lipid extraction and demonstrated that structural lipids, in addition to energy storage lipids, can be transformed into FAMEs. Moreover, the analyzed properties of the M. circinelloides-derived biodiesel using three different catalysts (BF3, H2SO4, and HCl) fulfilled the specifications established by the American standards and most of the European standard specifications. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The majority of biodiesel fuels are produced from vegetable oils or animal fats by transesterification of oil with alcohol in the presence of a catalyst. In this study, a new class of biofuel is explored by acetylation of fatty alcohols from Jojoba oil. Jojobyl methyl acetate (JMA) was produced using direct acetylation of purified jojobyl alcohol obtained during preparation of Jojobyl methyl esters (JME). Important fuel properties of JMA, such as kinematic viscosity, cloud point (CP), pour point (PP), cold filter plugging point (CFPP), acid value, oxidative stability, gross heat of combustion, and lubricity were evaluated using standard methods. A comparison was made with previously reported JME and relevant biodiesel fuel standards, such as ASTM D6751 and EN 14214. The CP, CFPP, and PP values of JMA were 2, -10, and -16 °C, respectively. These results were comparable to JME with the exception of a higher CP in the case of JMA. The kinematic viscosity (40 °C) of JMA was 7.64 mm2/s, which was higher than that observed for JME. Blends (B5 and B20) of JMA in ultralow sulfur diesel fuel (ULSD) were also evaluated for the aforementioned fuel properties and compared to an analogous set of blends of JME in ULSD and relevant petrodiesel fuel standards such as ASTM D975 and D7467. Blends of JMA in ULSD displayed similar low temperature properties to neat ULSD and blends of JME in ULSD. This research demonstrates utilization of a byproduct as feedstock for biofuel preparation and establishes a new innovative class of biofuel, which can be prepared via the acetylation of fatty alcohols.

AB  - Endosperm and embryo tissues from the seeds of Euonymus alatus (Burning Bush) accumulate high levels of 3-acetyl-1,2-diacyl-snglycerols (acTAGs) as their major storage lipids. In contrast, the aril tissue surrounding the seed produces long-chain triacylglycerols (lcTAGs) typical of most other organisms. The presence of the sn-3 acetyl group imparts acTAGs with different physical and chemical properties, such as a 30% reduction in viscosity, compared to lcTAGs. Comparative transcriptome analysis of developing endospermandaril tissues using pyrosequencing technology was performed to isolate the enzyme necessary for the synthesis of acTAGs. An uncharacterized membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family member was the most abundant acyltransferase in the endosperm but was absent from the aril. Expression of this MBOAT in yeast resulted in the accumulation of acTAGs but not lcTAG; hence, the enzyme was named EaDAcT (Euonymus alatus diacylglycerol acetyltransferase). Yeast microsomes expressing EaDAcT possessed acetyl-CoA diacylglycerol acetyltransferase activity but lacked long-chain acyl-CoA diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity. Expression of EaDAcT under the control of a strong, seed-specific promoter in Arabidopsis resulted in the accumulation of acTAGs, up to 40 mol % of total TAG in the seed oil. These results demonstrate the utility of deep transcriptional profiling with multiple tissues as a gene discovery strategy for low-abundance proteins. They also show that EaDAcT is the acetyltransferase necessary and sufficient for the production of acTAGs in Euonymus seeds, and that this activity can be introduced into the seeds of other plants, allowing the evaluation of these unusual TAGs for biofuel and other applications.

AB  - The environmental impacts of bioenergy products have received a great deal of attention. Life cycle analysis (LCA) is a widely accepted method to quantify the environmental impacts of products. Conducting comprehensive LCAs for every possible bioenergy alternative is difficult because of the sheer magnitude of potential biomass sources and energy end products. The scopes of LCAs are often simplified to compare multiple products on the basis of greenhouse gas emissions and net energy balances, and may neglect equally important considerations such as nitrogen and land use. This study determines the most desirable energy crops on the basis of nitrogen and land use. The theoretical minimum nitrogen and land use requirements of fourteen bioenergy feedstocks are evaluated. These results can help prioritize certain feedstock crops for more in-depth life cycle analyses and can be used to inform policies on dedicated energy crops. The results of the study indicate that sugar cane has the best nitrogen and land use profile of the analyzed feedstocks. Sugar cane is the largest contributor to bioenergy production worldwide and is an effective policy choice from a nutrient and land use perspective. Conversely, soybeans and rapeseed are the least effective biomass sources with respect to land use and nitrogen requirements, yet these crops are also used to meet biofuel production targets worldwide. These results indicate current energy policies either do not consider or undervalue nitrogen and land use impacts, which could lead to unsustainable recommendations. Interestingly, when both nitrogen and land intensity are taken into account, reasonably small differences are seen between the remainder of the analyzed feedstocks, indicating an inherent trade-off between energy yield and nitrogen impacts. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Atmospheric aerosol samples in PM10 and PM2.5 size fractions were collected in parallel at a rural site in Morogoro during wet season in March and April 2006. All samples were analysed for the particulate matter mass, for organic, elemental, and total carbon (OC, EC, and TC), and for water-soluble OC (WSOC). The average PM10 and PM2.5 mass concentrations and associated standard deviations were 14 ± 13 μg/m3 and 7.3 ± 4 μg/m3 respectively. On average, TC accounted for 33% of the PM10 mass and 44% of the PM2.5 mass for the campaign. The average OC/PM percentage ratios were 27% and 33% in PM10 and PM2.5 size fractions respectively and a larger fraction of the OC was water-soluble. The observed low EC/TC mean percentage ratios of 10-14% respectively for PM10 and PM2.5 fractions indicate that the carbonaceous aerosol originates mainly from biogenic aerosols and/or biomass burning. A simple source apportionment approach was used to apportion the OC to biofuel and charcoal burning. On average, 93% of the PM10 OC was attributed to biofuel and 7% to charcoal burning in the 2006 wet season campaign. However, it is suggested that a contribution to the OC at Morogoro could also come from other natural biogenic matter, and/or biomass burning aerosols. The results for the sources of OC at Morogoro should therefore be considered with great caution. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conventional integration of bioethanol and biodiesel plants employs the use of anhydrous ethanol in the biodiesel production process. The problem is that the production of anhydrous bioethanol is very energy-demanding, especially due to the azeotropic distillation required to producing high purity ethanol. The use of hydrous ethanol in the biodiesel production is preferable but unfeasible in conventional processes due to the equilibrium limitations and the economic penalties caused by the additional process steps. To solve this problem, this study proposes a novel energy-efficient integrated production of biodiesel from hydrous bioethanol. The key to success is a novel setup that combines the advantages of using solid catalysts with the integration of reaction and separation. This integrated process eliminates all typical catalyst-related operations, and efficiently uses the raw materials and the reactor volume in a separative reactor that allows significant savings in the capital and operating costs. Rigorous simulations embedding experimental results were performed using computer aided process engineering tools - such as AspenTech Aspen Plus - to design the separative reactor and evaluate the overall technical feasibility of the process. The RD column was simulated using the rigorous RADFRAC unit with RateSep (rate-based) model, and explicitly considering three phases balances. Sensitivity analysis was used to determine the optimal range of the operating parameters. The main results are given for a plant producing 10 ktpy biodiesel (>99.9%wt) from hydrous bioethanol (96%wt) and waste vegetable oil with high free fatty acids content (∼100%), using solid acids as green catalysts. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Co-processing of vegetable oils (VO) with crude oil in existing refineries is considered as an option for future biofuel production. There are three possible alternatives possible, i.e., VO can be mixed with crude oil and co-processed in the atmospheric distillation, mixed with the middle-distillate fraction from atmospheric distillation as a feedstock to the hydrofiner, or used as feedstock to the FCC together with fossil feedstocks. Processing a mixture of VO and crude oil is not reasonable because it may result in considerable compound problems due to different compositions of the feedstock. Mixing VO and crude oil fractions from atmospheric distillation with comparable characteristics as a feedstock to the hydrofiner could avoid the compound problem. However, necessary adjustments of refinery configuration, deactivation of catalysts, the oxidation instability of VO, the additional logistic requirements, corrosion problems, and additional demand of hydrogen production capacities must be considered. Co-processing VO and crude oil fractions in the FCC could result in a loss of middle distillate yield. Considering all these aspects, co-processing of VO in existing mineral oil refineries can be a promising option from economical and environmental point of view.

AB  - Liquid biofuels are mainly bioethanol, which is produced by fermentation of sugars or starches derived from agricultural selected resources and biodiesel, produced by transesterification of vegetable oils. Despite the large amount of studies performed on bioethanol production, the theme continues to be of interest through the new yeast strains with increased performance in fermentation. In this study, 45 new yeast strains were isolated from fruits and their juices in the air and on special media. Their identification at species level was performed by classical methods. During the experiments seven strains of Sccharomyces cerevisiae were selected and tested both at laboratory and pilot level for their performances. Among these strains, two of them proved to be thermotolerant and reacted positively by moderate development on tested media after a longer period of time (3 to 4 days). The tests conducted in pilot station point out that S.cerevisiae F7 strain produced the largest quantity of alcohol in the fermented meal. Based to their ability to produce ethanol from corn meal, this strain could be used at industrial level for fermentation of various raw materials in order to obtain an increased production of bioethanol. © 2010 University of Bucharest.

AB  - Although some countries use esterificated fuel, which is made out of useless vegetable oil, it makes troubles which are emission of white and black smoke, becoming worse of engine start, and so on. Since biofuels are oxygenated fuels, there are concerns abous production of large amounts of aldehydes, which are oxygenated toxic substances. This paper examines the cause of precipitation of solids in fuel at low temperatures, looks at trends in production of aldehydes from biofuels, compares exhaust characteristics when using 3 types of biofuel and gas oil in a diesel engine, and clarifies what effect constituent fatty acids have on exhaust characteristics. As the percentage of saturated fatty acids increases, the cloud point and freezing point rise, and a certain degree of correlation is evident between the cloud point and freezing point. With methyl oléate, production of aldehydes begins to increase around 400, and the produced amount is small in the low temperature range. With methyl ester fuels, there is an increase in NOx, and a decrease in THC, CO and exhaust smoke density, compared to gas oil.

AB  - Background, aim and scope: Biodiesel derived from Waste Cooking Oil (WCO) is considered highly environmentally sustainable since WCO is a waste product from domestic and commercial cooking processes and then recycled to a transportation fuel in Singapore. In addition, it avoids the conversion of land use for crop production. This is a strong advantage for Singapore which has relatively smaller land space than other countries. The import of virgin oil as feedstock into Singapore is also avoided. Therefore, the more appropriate feedstock to produce biodiesel in Singapore context is WCO. According to the National Environment Agency, diesel vehicles in Singapore contribute 50% of the total particulate matter smaller than 2.5 μm (PM0.25) emissions to air ambient. Hence, the aim of this life cycle assessment study was to compare the environmental performances of biodiesel derived from WCO and low sulphur diesel in terms of global warming potential, life cycle energy efficiency (LCEE) and fossil energy ratio (FER) using the life cycle inventory. The results of this study would serve as a reference for energy policy makers and environmental agencies. Materials and methods: ISO14040 and ISO14044 (ISO14040 2006; ISO 14044 2006) are used as the method for implementing this study. This comparative study between biodiesel derived from WCO and low sulphur diesel is done by comparing the life cycle inventory results. The tailpipe emission tests were done using a gas analyser. Results: Biodiesel production data are collected from a local facility. The production of main ingredients, types of transportation, conversion of WCO to biodiesel and the usage of biodiesel were considered within the dataset. Production of low sulphur diesel was modelled according to several references. The phases include foreign crude oil production, refining, transporting of diesel to station and finally the usage of diesel. The testing vehicle for both transportation fuels is an ISUZU pickup truck with engine capacity of 3,059 cc and in direct injection combustion chamber type. The functional unit in this study is output of 1 transportation-km. Discussion: In this section, two types of emissions are discussed. First is the net life cycle emission. The second is the exhaust tailpipe emissions. Highest amount of reduction on a life cycle basis is PM2.5 and PM10 with a significant reduction of 99.99%. On the exhaust tailpipe emission basis, the reduction for total particulate matter is 94.80%. The LCEE of biodiesel produced from WCO is calculated as 86.93%. This is higher than biodiesel reported from US studies (using soybean as feedstock) which is 80.55%. The low LCEE value of 71.09% for low sulphur diesel could be attributed by the fact that Singapore depends greatly on foreign crude oil production and imports. The FER is calculated to be 9.39. The life cycle of biodiesel produced from the recycling of WCO produces more than nine times as much energy in its final fuel product as it uses in fossil energy. This is three times higher than biodiesel derived from soya oil in the USA. Conclusions: The emission results and the life cycle energy efficiencies have indicated that the replacement of low sulphur diesel with biodiesel derived from WCO as a transportation fuel is favourable. Recommendations and perspectives: In Singapore, the potential substitution percentage of diesel by biodiesel if all of the WCO can be collected and processed to biodiesel is 1.42%. There is a need for recyclers to convince the food establishments and users of cooking oil of the benefits of recycling cooking oil, which in turn obtains a steady source of WCO as feedstock for biodiesel production. In addition, as the biodiesel life cycle defined is very much dependent on WCO as a feedstock, it is recommended to optimise the WCO collection network. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Marine diatom, strain JPCC DA0580, and marine green microalga strain NKG400014 were selected as high neutral lipid-producers from marine microalgal culture collection toward biodiesel production. These strains were tentatively identified as Navicula sp. and Chlorella sp., respectively, by 18S rDNA analysis. Growth and lipid accumulation conditions of both strains were analyzed by changing nutrient concentrations in growth media and initial illuminance intensity. The highest productivity of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) reached to 154 mg/L/week for NKG400014 and 185 mg/L/week for JPCC DA0580. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis indicates that FAME fraction from NKG400014 mainly contained 9-12-15-octadecatrienoate (C18:3) and that from JPCC DA0580 mainly contained methyl palmitate (C16:0) and methyl palmitoleate (C16:1). Furthermore, calorimetric analysis revealed that the energy content of strain was 4,233±55 kcal/kg (i.e., 15.9±0.2 MJ/kg) for NKG400014 and 6,423±139 kcal/mg (i.e., 26.9±0.6 MJ/kg) for JPCC DA0580, respectively. The value from JPCC DA0580 was equivalent to that of coal. The strains NKG400014 and JPCC DA0580 will become a promising resource that can grow as dominant species in the open ocean toward production of both liquid and solid biofuels. © Humana Press 2009.

AB  - In this study, we conducted experiments using a response surface methodology to determine the optimal reaction conditions for the enzymatic synthesis of biodiesel from rapeseed oil and short-chained alkyl acetates, such as methyl acetate or ethyl acetate, as the acyl acceptor at 40 °C. Based on our response surface methodology experiments, the optimal reaction conditions for the synthesis of biodiesel were as follows: methyl acetate as acyl acceptor, catalyst concentration of 16.50%, oil-to-methyl acetate molar ratio of 1:12.44, and reaction time of 19.70 h; ethyl acetate as acyl acceptor, catalyst concentration of 16.95%, oil-to-ethyl acetate molar ratio of 1:12.56, and reaction time of 19.73 h. The fatty acid ester content under the above conditions when methyl acetate and ethyl acetate were used as the acyl acceptor was 58.0% and 62.6%, respectively. The statistical method described in this study can be applied to effectively optimize the enzymatic conditions required for biodiesel production with short-chained alkyl acetates. © Humana Press 2009.

AB  - Grassland is a beneficial landscape for numerous reasons including potential to sequester carbon in the soil. Cross compliance dictates that grassland should not be converted to arable land; this is particularly interesting in Ireland where 91% of agricultural land is under grass. Biogas generated from grass and further upgraded to biomethane has been shown to offer a better energy balance than first-generation liquid biofuels indigenous to Europe. The essential question is whether the gaseous biofuel meets the EU sustainability criteria of 60% greenhouse gas emission savings. The base-case scenario investigated included: utilization of electricity from the grid; over-sizing heated digestion tanks to hold digestate in the winter period; vehicular efficiency 82% of that of a diesel vehicle; and no allowance for carbon sequestration. The analysis of the base case showed a reduction in emissions of 21.5%. However by varying the system, using electricity from wind, improving digester configuration, and by using a vehicle optimized for gaseous fuel, a reduction of 54% was evaluated. Furthermore allowing for 0.6 t carbon sequestration per hectare per annum the reduction increased to 75%. © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This work reports new experimental data and mathematical modeling of lipase-catalyzed biodiesel production using soybean oil and ethanol as substrates and pressurized n-propane as solvent. The experiments were carried out in a batch reactor, recording the reaction kinetics and evaluating the effects of temperature in the range of 45-70. °C, enzyme content from 1 to 20. wt% and oil to ethanol molar ratios of 1:3, 1:6, 1:9 and 1:15. The solvent to substrates mass ratio and pressure were set at 2:1 and 50. bar, respectively. Results showed that lipase-catalyzed alcoholysis in propane medium might be a potential alternative to conventional techniques for biodiesel production, since good conversions were obtained at mild temperature and pressure conditions. The semi-empirical mathematical model based on balance equations, adopted to describe the transesterification kinetics in pressurized n-propane, yielded relative deviations between experimental and calculated values lower than 10%, thus allowing a satisfactory representation of experimental results and a better understanding of the transesterification reaction. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - If mitigation of black carbon (BC) particulate matter is accompanied by a decrease in particle number emissions, and thereby by a decrease in global cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations, a decrease in global cloud radiative forcing (a reverse-gcloud albedo effect-h) results. We consider two present-day mitigation scenarios: 50% reduction of primary black carbon/organic carbon (BC/OC) mass and number emissions from fossil fuel combustion (termed HF), and 50% reduction of primary BC/OC mass and number emissions from all primary carbonaceous sources (fossil fuel, domestic biofuel, and biomass burning) (termed HC). Radiative forcing effects of these scenarios are assessed through present-day equilibrium climate simulations. Global average top-of-the- atmosphere changes in radiative forcing for the two scenarios, relative to present day conditions, are +0.13-2 0.33 W m.2 (HF) and + 0.31 ±0.33 W m.-2 (HC).

AB  - An efficient and reproducible method for the regeneration of Jatropha curcas plants has been developed. The method employed direct induction of shoot buds from petiole explants, without the formation of an intervening callus using a Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different concentrations of thidiazuron (TDZ). The best induction of shoot buds (58.35%) and the number of shoot buds per explant (10.10) were observed when in vitro petiole explants were placed horizontally on MS medium supplemented with 2.27 μM TDZ after 6 weeks. The induced shoot buds were transferred to MS medium containing 10 μM kinetin (Kn), 4.5 μM 6-benzyl aminopurine (BAP) and 5.5 μM α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) for shoot proliferation. The proliferated shoots could be elongated on MS medium supplemented with different concentrations and combinations of BAP, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), NAA and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). MS medium supplemented with 2.25 μM BAP and 8.5 μM IAA was found to be the best combination for shoot elongation and 3.01-3.91 cm elongation was achieved after 6 weeks. However, significant differences in plant regeneration and shoot elongation were observed among the genotypes studied. The orientation (horizontal or vertical) and source (in vitro or in vivo) of explants also significantly influenced plant regeneration. The elongated shoots could be rooted on half-strength MS medium supplemented with 2% sucrose, different concentrations and combinations of IBA, IAA and NAA, and 0.25 mg L-1 activated charcoal. Half-strength MS medium supplemented with 2% sucrose, 15 μM IBA, 5.7 μM IAA, 5.5 μM NAA and 0.25 mg L -1 activated charcoal was found to be the best for promoting rooting. The rooted plants could be established in soil with more than 90% survival. © 2010 Association of Applied Biologists.

AB  - In this study, Euro V diesel fuel, biodiesel, and methanol-biodiesel blends were tested in a 4-cylinder direct-injection diesel engine to investigate the combustion characteristics and particulate emissions of the diesel engine under five engine loads at the maximum torque engine speed of 1800 rpm. Compared with Euro V diesel fuel, biodiesel gives lower and earlier heat release rate. For the blended fuels, the peak heat release rate becomes higher and retarded. With regard to particulate mass concentration, biodiesel generates less than Euro V diesel fuel, while the blended fuels result in significant reduction especially at high engine loads. Compare with Euro V diesel fuel, the total particle number concentration of using biodiesel is always higher while the geometric mean diameter (GMD) of the particles is lower. With the blended fuel, the total number concentration and GMD decrease in comparison with pure biodiesel. Further analysis shows that the difference between the total number concentration of biodiesel and Euro V diesel fuel is in particles smaller than 50 nm rather than in the larger particles. The use of methanol-biodiesel blends, compared with biodiesel, could reduce the number concentration of all sizes. A comparison between the particulate mass emission and total particulate number concentration with the mass of fuel burned in the diffusion mode show that they are strongly related to each other, even for the blended fuel.

AB  - We compared the production-ecological sustainability of biofuel production from several major crops that are also commonly used for production of food or feed, based on current production practices in major production areas. The set of nine sustainability indicators focused on resource use efficiency, soil quality, net energy production and greenhouse gas emissions, disregarding socio-economic or biodiversity aspects and land use change. Based on these nine production-ecological indicators and attributing equal importance to each indicator, biofuel produced from oil palm (South East Asia), sugarcane (Brazil) and sweet sorghum (China) appeared most sustainable: these crops make the most efficient use of land, water, nitrogen and energy resources, while pesticide applications are relatively low in relation to the net energy produced. Provided there is no land use change, greenhouse gas emissions of these three biofuels are substantially reduced compared with fossil fuels. Oil palm was most sustainable with respect to the maintenance of soil quality. Maize (USA) and wheat (Northwest Europe) as feedstock for ethanol perform poorly for nearly all indicators. Sugar beet (Northwest Europe), cassava (Thailand), rapeseed (Northwest Europe) and soybean (USA) take an intermediate position. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present paper analyses the long-run relationship between vegetable oil prices and conventional diesel prices in the EU for the period 2005-2007. We applied recent developments in the threshold cointegration approach to investigate the presence of asymmetric dynamic adjusting processes between the prices of rapeseed oil, sunflower oil, and soybean oil, and the price of a mineral oil: diesel. The results presented suggest a two-regime threshold cointegration model only for the rapeseed oil-diesel price pair. Thus, the rapeseed oil price adjusts rapidly to its long-run equilibrium, determined by fossil diesel prices, but this adjustment is asymmetric: it differs if the divergence between the two prices is above or below a critical threshold. Consequently, rapeseed oil appears particularly exposed to external shocks deriving from global political scenarios, suggesting the reassessment of the high quota (80%) of EU biodiesel represented by this vegetable oil. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of biodiesel as fuel from alternative sources has increased considerably over recent years, affording numerous environmental benefits. Biodiesel an alternative fuel for diesel engines is produced from renewable sources such as vegetable oils or animal fats. However, the high costs implicated in marketing biodiesel constitute a major obstacle. To this regard therefore, the use of waste frying oils (WFO) should produce a marked reduction in the cost of biodiesel due to the ready availability of WFO at a relatively low price.In the present study waste frying oils collected from several McDonald's restaurants in Istanbul, were used to produce biodiesel. Biodiesel from WFO was prepared by means of three different transesterification processes: a one-step base-catalyzed, a two-step base-catalyzed and a two-step acid-catalyzed transesterification followed by base transesterification. No detailed previous studies providing information for a two-step acid-catalyzed transesterification followed by a base (CH3ONa) transesterification are present in literature. Each reaction was allowed to take place with and without tetrahydrofuran added as a co-solvent. Following production, three different procedures; washing with distilled water, dry wash with magnesol and using ion-exchange resin were applied to purify biodiesel and the best outcome determined. The biodiesel obtained to verify compliance with the European Standard 14214 (EN 14214), which also corresponds to Turkish Biodiesel Standards. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study explores the impact of five different types of methyl esters on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), nitrated-PAH and oxygenated PAH emissions. The measurements were conducted on a chassis dynamometer, according to the European regulation. Each of the five different biodiesels was blended with EN590 diesel at a proportion of 10-90% v/v (10% biodiesel concentration). The vehicle was a Euro 3 compliant common-rail diesel passenger car. Emission measurements were performed over the NEDC and compared with those of the real traffic-based Artemis driving cycles. The experimental results showed that the addition of biodiesel led to some important increases in low molecular-weight PAHs (phenanthrene and anthracene) and to both increases and reductions in large PAHs which are characterised by their carcinogenic and mutagenic properties. Nitro-PAHs were found to reduce with biodiesel whereas oxy-PAH emissions presented important increases with the biodiesel blends. The impact of biodiesel source material was particularly clear on the formation of PAH compounds. It was found that most PAH emissions decreased as the average load and speed of the driving cycle increased. Cold-start conditions negatively influenced the formation of most PAH compounds. A similar trend was observed with particulate alkane emissions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Five biodiesels from different feedstocks (rapeseed, soy, sunflower, palm, and used fried oils) blended with diesel at 10% vol. ratio (B10), were tested on a Euro 3 common-rail passenger car. Limited effects (-2% to +4%) were observed on CO2 emissions. CO and HC emissions increased between 10% and 25% on average, except at high speed - high power where emissions were too low to draw conclusions. NOx emissions increased by up to 20% for two out of the five blends, decreased by up to 15% for two other blends, and remained unchanged for one blend. Particulate matter (PM) was reduced for all blends by up to 25% and the reductions were positively correlated with the extent of biodiesel saturation. PM reductions are associated with consistent reductions in non-volatile particle number. A variable behaviour in particle number is observed when volatile particles are also accounted. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to make an emergy assessment of oleaginous crops cultivated in Brazil, available to produce biodiesel, in order to determine which crop is the most sustainable. This study evaluates conventional agro-chemical farms that produce rapeseed (canola), oil palm, soybean, sunflower and cotton. Rapeseed (canola) crop uses 40.41% of renewable energy and it is the most sustainable conventional oil crop; on the other hand, it is not widely produced in Brazil, probably due to climate restrictions or low market demand. The oil palm emergy indicators are contradictory: its emergy exchange ratio (EER) value is the lower, showing the possibility of fair exchange, and the low transformity value indicates high efficiency; however, it also has low renewability (28.31%), indicating a high dependency on agro-chemicals (basically fertilizers). Oil palm is a potential energy source due to its high agricultural productivity, but appropriate management is necessary to increase its sustainability and reduce the use of non-renewable resources. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, cattle manure was converted to bio-oil by subcritical hydrothermal liquefaction in the presence of NaOH. The effects of conversion temperature, process gas, initial conversion pressure, residence time and mass ratio of cattle manure to water on the bio-oil yield were studied. The bio-oil was characterized in terms of elemental composition, higher heating value, ultraviolet-visible (UV/Vis) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results showed that the bio-oil yield depended on the conversion temperature and the process gas. Higher initial conversion pressure, longer residence time and larger mass ratio of cattle manure to water, however, had negative impacts on the bio-oil yield. The higher heating value of bio-oil was 35.53 MJ/kg on average. The major non-polar components of bio-oil were toluene, ethyl benzene and xylene, which are components of crude oil, gasoline and diesel. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The dominant factors affecting the reactivity of acid-catalyzed transesterification of vegetable oil with methanol have been investigated. Effects of varying the acid catalyst species, surface active agent type and content were studied. Also, the effect of the type of oil was examined. Biodiesel fuel yields increased with the addition of sodium dodecylsulfonate as surface active agent because the mass transfer rates of protons and methanol to the oil phase through the oil-methanol interface were increased with increasing interfacial area. Evaluation of the reaction kinetics, based on changes in parent oils containing triglyceride or diglyceride showed that the activation energies were almost no change, but the frequency factors were 2210 and 9827 mol-1 min-1, respectively. Therefore, it was concluded that a lower reactivity during acid-catalyzed transesterification with methanol was caused by a lower contact probability for oil, methanol and acid catalyst in the presence of an oil-methanol interface during the reaction. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We have investigated the transesterification of rapeseed (RO) and waste sunflower (SO) oils with methanol in the presence of potassium hydroxide as a catalyst. The transesterification of tri-acylglycerols was first conducted in a batch reactor. The effect of the temperature on the reaction rates was studied at a constant molar ratio of the alcohol to tri-acylglycerols (6:1) and for a constant concentration of the catalyst (1.0 wt%). Size-exclusion chromatography and 1H NMR spectroscopy were used to quantitatively monitor the transesterification reaction. The mass-transfer coefficients of the tri-acylglycerols during the initial transesterification stage were found to be 0.2-1.2 × 10-5 m min-1, depending on the type of oil and the temperature. Calculated activation energies implied that at higher temperatures the formation of mono-acylglycerols and glycerole was favored for the SO (93 kJ/mol for the forward and 48 kJ/mol for the backward reaction) and the RO (47 kJ/mol for the forward and 36 kJ/mol for the backward reaction), respectively. For the continuous industrial reactor/separator setup, the optimum methanol recycle ratio was established as 0.0550. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Zeolite catalysts of three types (H-ZSM-5, Fe-ZSM-5 and H-Beta) were tested in the catalytic co-conversion of rapeseed cake and safflower oil into bio-fuel. This low pressure process was carried out at the temperatures of 350 and 400 °C. The yields and compositions of the product mixtures depended on the catalyst nature and the process temperatures. The produced organic phases consisted mainly of hydrocarbons, fatty acids and nitriles. This mixture possessed improved characteristics (e.g. heating value, water content, density, viscosity, pH) compared with the bio-oils, making possible its application as a bio-fuel. The most effective catalyst, providing the highest yield of organic liquid phase, was the highly acidic/wide-pore H-Beta zeolite. The products obtained on this catalyst demonstrated the highest degree of deoxygenation and the higher HHV (Higher Heating Value). The aqueous liquid phase contained water-soluble carboxylic acids, phenols and heterocyclic compounds. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Oil extracted from seeds of Maclura pomifera fruits grown in Tunisia was investigated as an alternative feedstock for the production of biodiesel fuel. Biodiesel was prepared by transesterification of the crude oil with methanol in the presence of NaOH as catalyst. Maximum oil to ester conversion was 90%. The viscosity of the biodiesel oil (4.66 cSt) is similar to that of petroleum diesel (2.5-3.5 cSt). The density (0.889 g/cm3), kinematic viscosity (4.66 cSt), flash point (180 °C), iodine number (125 °C), neutralization number (0.4), pour point (-9 °C), cloud point (-5 °C), cetane number (48) are very similar to the values set forth by the ASTM and EN biodiesel standards for petroleum diesel (No. 2). The comparison shows that the methyl esters of M. pomifera oil could be possible diesel fuel replacements. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Meadowfoam (Limnanthes alba L.) seed oil methyl esters (MFME), prepared by a standard transesterification procedure using methanol and sodium methoxide catalyst from refined meadowfoam oil (MFO), were evaluated as a potential biodiesel fuel. MFME contains the unusual 5(Z)-eicosenoate (64.2 wt%) and 5(Z),13(Z)-docosadienoate (18.9 wt%). The cetane number of MFME, 66.9, is among the highest ever reported for a biodiesel fuel. In addition, MFME exhibited exceptionally high oxidative stability of 41.5 h by the Rancimat method. Kinematic viscosity was determined as 6.18 mm2 s-1. The cloud, cold filter plugging and pour points of MFME were determined as -6, -9, and -10 °C, respectively. Blending MFME with soybean oil methyl esters (SME) provided kinematic viscosity and oxidative stability values within ranges specified in ASTM D6751 and EN 14214. Other properties such as acid value, free and total glycerol content, as well as sulfur and phosphorus contents were below limits specified in ASTM D6751 and EN 14214. Also reported are lubricity, heat of combustion, and Gardner color. For sake of comparison of some fuel properties, MFME was also prepared from crude meadowfoam oil. The most conspicuous difference in fuel properties was the even greater oxidative stability of 71.6 h by the Rancimat method of MFME from crude MFO. Addition of MFME (from refined MFO) to petrodiesel improved lubricity of ultra-low sulfur petrodiesel while not adversely affecting oxidative stability and low temperature operability. In summary, MFME has unusual fuel properties as a result of its unique fatty acid composition and appears to be a satisfactory blend component for SME and petrodiesel. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The biofuel production is often supposed to cause social problems. It contributes to the rise of food prices which disadvantages the poor. The Brazilian government tries to mitigate this problem. The Brazilian biodiesel program aimes especially at the socially weakest persons, the small farmers. Several instruments favour this inclusion. However, until now the social aim of the biodiesel program is not gained because the government itself has no interest in enforcing its instruments credibly.

AB  - One of the possible process options for the production of advanced biofuels is the co-processing of upgraded pyrolysis oil in standard refineries. The applicability of hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) was studied as a pyrolysis oil upgrading step to allow FCC co-processing. Different HDO reaction end temperatures (230-340 °C) were evaluated in a 5 L autoclave, keeping the other process conditions constant (total 290 bar, 5 wt.% Ru/C catalyst), in order to find the required oil product properties necessary for successful FCC co-processing (miscibility with FCC feed and good yield structure: little gas/coke make and good boiling range liquid yields). After HDO, the upgraded pyrolysis oil underwent phase separation resulting in an aqueous phase, some gases (mainly CO2 and CH4), and an oil phase that was further processed in a Micro-Activity Test (MAT) reactor (simulated FCC reactor). Although the oil and aqueous phase yields remained approximately constant when the HDO reaction temperature was increased, a net transfer of organic components (probably hydrodeoxygenated sugars) from the aqueous phase to the oil phase was observed, increasing the carbon recovery in the oil product (up to 70 wt.% of the carbon in pyrolysis oil). The upgraded oils were subsequently tested in a lab scale catalytic cracking unit (MAT reactor), assessing the suitability of HDO oils to be used as FCC feed. In spite of the relatively high oxygen content (from 17 to 28 wt.%, on dry basis) and the different properties of the HDO oils, they all could be successfully dissolved in and co-processed (20 wt.%) with a Long Residue, yielding near normal FCC gasoline (44-46 wt.%) and Light Cycle Oil (23-25 wt.%) products without an excessive increase of undesired coke and dry gas, as compared to the base feed only. Near oxygenate-free bio-hydrocarbons were obtained, probably via hydrogen transfer from the Long Residue. In this way, we have demonstrated on a laboratory scale that it is possible to produce hydrocarbons from ligno-cellulosic biomass via a pyrolysis oil upgrading route. The much higher coke yields obtained from the catalytic cracking of undiluted HDO oil showed the importance of co-processing using a refinery feed as a diluent and hydrogen transfer source. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With the rising emphasis on biofuels as a potential solution to climate change, this paper asks whether certification schemes, developed to promote sustainable feedstock production, are able to deliver genuine sustainability benefits. The Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS) is a certification scheme that aims to promote responsible soy production through the development of principles and criteria. However, can and does this initiative address the negative impacts associated with the intensive production of soy? Taking the example of soy biodiesel produced in Argentina, this paper asks whether the social and environmental impacts of soybean production can be mitigated by the RTRS. It concludes that at present certification schemes are unlikely to be able to address either the institutional challenges associated with their implementation or the detrimental impacts of the additional demand generated by biofuels. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.

AB  - The South Korean refining industry is facing various challenges despite showing signs of recovery in late 2009. Among the biggest difficulties South Korean refiners face is sluggish domestic demand for petroleum. After peaking at 2.328 million b/d in 1997, oil demand including non-refinery feedstock is hovering between 2.2 million b/d and 2.3 million b/d. One reason to expect slow demand growth is an already flat population that will begin to decline towards the end of the decade. Biofuel requirements are another threat to South Korean refiners, with South Korea requiring a 15% blending of bio diesel into auto diesel in January 2009 and a 2% biodiesel requirement taking effect in January 2010. South Korean refineries have started making significant investments in upgrading to produce light, clean products as part of their strategy to overcome the challenges.

AB  - Biodiesel (BD), typically consisting of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), has received much attention because it is a renewable biofuel that contributes little to global warming compared to petroleum-based diesel fuel. The most common method used for BD production is based on the alkali-catalyzed transesterification of first-use refined oils and fats with an alcohol (e.g. methanol). These technologies, however, require significant modification when applied to second use materials such as greases because of their higher free fatty acid (FFA) content. Recently, we reported a series of insoluble porous polymer grafted diphenylammonium salts that efficiently esterified the FFA in greases to FAME. In this work, the dipheny- lammonium salts were supported onto two robust meso- porous silicas. The resulting catalysts had high esterification activity with >99% of the FFA in greases converted to FAME, and the FFA content in the treated greases was reduced to < 1 wt%. The mesoporous silica- supported catalysts displayed minimal transesterification activity. © 2009 AOCS.

AB  - The maintaining of the fuel quality, for biodiesel, in its universal using as alternative fuel depends on the way of achieving its resistance enlargement in oxidation during the storage period. Through its content in substances with antioxidant properties (á- tocopherol, ã-tocopherol, ä-tocopherol, vitamin E) the additive obtained from the oil extracted from Medicago sativa and Vitis vinifera seed ensures a good protection of biodiesel during the storage period. The biodiesel and additivated biodiesel samples were placed in dark bottles and stored at medium room temperature of 23.8°C for 12 months. The value of the peroxid Index determined monthly through Hara-Totani method was included between 3.2 and 61.2 mEO2/kg biodiesel for the biodiesel samples respectively 3.1 and 43.6 mEO2/kg biodiesel for the additivated biodiesel. The induction period determined through Rancimat method was included between 8 and 1.5h for the biodiesel samples respectively 9 and 3h for the additivated biodiesel.

AB  - Oxidation stability is a physical property of liquid fuels used to describe the ageing behavior of fuels during transport and storage. In biodiesel and its blends with diesel, oxidation of fuel can result in acid formation and polymer solids which plug filters and leave problematic deposits throughout the fuel supply system. ASTM Fuel Specification Standards include both 100 % biodiesel and biofuel-blends. Of all these fuel standards only ASTM D6751, which is for 100 % biodiesel "as a blendstock," mentions the test method EN 14112. Although the following fuel specification standards permit the blending of biodiesel into the fuel, to date these standards have not yet identified a suitable oxidation stability test method for blended fuels: ASTM D975 for diesel fuel oils (<5 % biodiesel); ASTM D396 for burner fuel oils (<5 % biodiesel); and ASTM D7467 for diesel fuel oil (6-20 % biodiesel). ASTM D2274 is the most frequently used method to characterize ageing behavior of diesel by determining the polymer (sludge) content of artificially aged fuel. ASTM D02.14 approved two new test methods for evaluation of oxidation stability. ASTM D7545 is a new method for testing oxidation stability of middle-distillates. ASTM D7525 is the sister method for gasoline. These methods utilize a new rapid small scale oxidation tester (RSSOT) named PetroOXY. Within the RSSOT's test chamber, a 5 mL sample of fuel is combined with oxygen, at 700 kPa, and heated to 140°C. This initiates a fast oxidation whose results are determined by the time needed to achieve a pressure drop of 10 % in the system. Testing confirmed that the time needed to achieve the 10 % drop in pressure is directly related to the sample's oxidation stability. The RSSOT-method is quicker than other actual methods evaluating the oxidation stability biodiesel, petroleum middle-distillates, and blends. Round-robins based upon this have been conducted in Europe and Japan. Copyright © 2010 by ASTM International.

AB  - The research work on alternate fuels has been the topic of wider interest in the context of depletion of fossil fuels and increasing of pollution levels of the engines with conventional fossil fuels. Alcohols and vegetable oils are considered to replace diesel fuels as they are renewable in nature. However, use of alcohols in internal combustion engines is limited in India, as these fuels are diverted to Petro-chemical industries and hence much emphasis is given to the non-edible vegetable oils as alternate fuels in internal combustion engines. However, the drawbacks of low volatility and high viscosity associated with non-edible vegetable oils call for hot combustion chamber, provided by low heat rejection (LHR) diesel engine. Investigations are carried out on a LHR diesel engine with varied air gap thicknesses and injection pressures with jatropha oil based bio-diesel at normal temperature. Performance is improved with high degree of insulation with LHR engine with vegetable oil in comparison with conventional engine (CE) with pure diesel operation.

AB  - There is clear evidence to suggest that science may deliver a range of technologies that could be commercial within just 5 yr - but the potential of new fuels to disrupt the supply and demand for gasoline and diesel will only be realized if innovators and regulators take key steps to ensure rapid commercialization of these lower carbon alternatives. Accenture's report "Betting on science: Disruptive technologies in transport fuels", analyzed 150 companies and identified 12 technologies that may have the capacity to disrupt the hydrocarbon market. These include next generation internal combustion engine, next generation agriculture, waste to fuel, marine scrubbers, sugar to diesel, butanol, biocrude, algae, aviation biofuels, PHEV engines and batteries, charging infrastructure, and vehicle to grid technology. Accenture's research demonstrates that various alternative fuel sources have the potential to transform the supply and demand of hydrocarbons sooner than many expect. However, despite the move towards low carbon policies across the world, many hurdles stand in the way of these disruptive technologies. The innovative pioneers will now have to extend their skills from science to commerce, while governments will have to reinforce their scientific knowledge if they are to regulate effectively. Above all, they will both have to adapt to a market in which an unprecedented variety of alternative fuel sources will pose complexity and commercial threats, as well as opportunities.

AB  - Recent advances in improving the selectivity and performance for a comprehensive, three-dimensional (3D) gas chromatograph (GC3) instrument are described. With GC3, two six-port diaphragm valves are utilized as the interfaces between three, in-series capillary columns housed in a standard GC instrument fitted with a high data acquisition rate flame ionization detector (FID). Modulation periods for sampling from one column to the next are set so that sufficient slices (i.e., modulations) are acquired by the subsequent dimension resulting in comprehensive data. We present GC3 instrumentation with significantly higher 3D peak capacity than previously reported. An average peak capacity production (i.e., per time) of 180 resolved peaks per minute was experimentally achieved for three representative analytes in a 3D diesel sample separation. This peak capacity production is about 4 times higher than our previous report. We also demonstrate the significant benefit of the added chemical selectivity of the three column GC3 instrument relative to a two column GC×GC instrument, in which one of the three columns is a triflate ionic liquid stationary phase column with a high selectivity for phosphonated compounds (i.e., di-methyl-methyl phosphonate, di-ethyl-methyl phosphonate and di-isopropyl-methyl phosphonate). Using all three separation dimensions, the 2D separation fingerprint of a diesel sample is simultaneously obtained along with selective information regarding the phosphonated compounds in the diesel samples in the additional dimension. © 2010.

AB  - When grown for energy production instead for smoking, tobacco can generate a large amount of inexpensive biomass more efficiently than almost any other agricultural crop. Tobacco possesses potent oil biosynthesis machinery and can accumulate up to 40% of seed weight in oil. In this work, we explored two metabolic engineering approaches to enhance the oil content in tobacco green tissues for potential biofuel production. First, an Arabidopsis thaliana gene diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) coding for a key enzyme in triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis, was expressed in tobacco under the control of a strong ribulose-biphosphate carboxylase small subunit promoter. This modification led to up to a 20-fold increase in TAG accumulation in tobacco leaves and translated into an overall of about a twofold increase in extracted fatty acids (FA) up to 5.8% of dry biomass in Nicotiana tabacum cv Wisconsin, and up to 6% in high-sugar tobacco variety NC-55. Modified tobacco plants also contained elevated amounts of phospholipids. This increase in lipids was accompanied by a shift in the FA composition favourable for their utilization as biodiesel. Second, we expressed in tobacco Arabidopsis gene LEAFY COTYLEDON 2 (LEC2), a master regulator of seed maturation and seed oil storage under the control of an inducible Alc promoter. Stimulation of LEC2 expression in mature tobacco plants by acetaldehyde led to the accumulation of up to 6.8% per dry weight of total extracted FA. The obtained data reveal the potential of metabolically modified plant biomass for the production of biofuel. © 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Sixteen polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were measured in total suspended particulate matter (TSPM) samples collected at an urban and industrial cum residential site in Agra (India) from December 2005 to December 2006. The average total PAH concentration was found to be 115 ± 17 ng m-3. The measured concentrations were found to be lower than those reported from other cities in India like Chennai, Delhi, Kanpur, Mumbai and Kolkata. The mass distribution in air was dominated by high molecular weight compounds. PAH concentration showed a significant seasonal cycle during the year with greater concentration during the cold months due to changes in emission sources and meteorological factors. The presence of specific tracers and calculation of characteristic molecular diagnostic ratios revealed vehicular exhausts and emissions from coal and biofuel combustion as the major sources of these compounds.

AB  - Rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the road transport sector represents a difficultmitigation challenge due to a multitude of intricate factors, namely the dependency on liquid energy carriers and infrastructure lock-in. For this reason, low-carbon renewable energy carriers, particularly second generation biofuels, are often seen as a prominent candidate for realizing reduced emissions and lowered oil dependency over the medium- and long-term horizons. However, the overarching question is whether advanced biofuels can be an environmentally effective mitigation strategy in the face of increasing consumption and resource constraints. Here we develop both biofuel production and road transport consumption scenarios for northern Europe-a region with a vast surplus of forest bioenergy resources-to assess the potential role that forestbased biofuels may play over the medium- and long-term time horizons using an environmentally extended, multiregion input-outp ut model. Through scenarios, we explore how evolving vehicle technologies and consumption patterns will affect the mitigation opportunities afforded by any future supply of forest biofuels. We find that in a scenario involving ambitious biofuel targets, the size of the GHG mitigation wedge attributed to the market supply of biofuels is severely reduced under businessas-usual growth in consumption in the road transport sector. Our results indicate that climate policies targeting the road transport sector which give high emphases to reducing demand (volume), accelerating the deployment of more fuel-efficient vehicles, and promoting altered consumption patterns (structure) can be significantly more effective than those with single emphasis on expanded biofuel supply. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Within the context of expanding use of biofuels in transport worldwide, a need has emerged to accurately determine biofuel proportions of fuels. In this study, the radiocarbon method by AMS has been used to study the fuel mixtures containing 2%, 5% and 30% of the NExBTL renewable diesel, particularly. Special effort has been put to develop reproducible pretreatment and combustion methods and to verify the reliable determination of the low biofuel proportions - corresponding to the present status of the European-wide biofuel usage. The developed procedures are ready to meet the requirements set in the ASTM D 6866-06a standard and demonstrate our ability to perform reliable measurements on biofuel proportions in fuels. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glycerol (Gly)aby-product from biodiesel production was impregnated onto the surface of expanded vermiculite (EV) and reacted to produce a highly efficient absorbent to remove oils spilt on water. RESULTS: Expanded vermiculite was impregnated with glycerol at EV/Gly ratios of 1/1, 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4, and treated at 380, 480, 580 or 700°C. Electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, BET surface area, Hg porosimetry and Raman analyses indicated that residual NaOH from the biodiesel process catalyzed the polymerization of glycerol. At higher temperatures the polymer decomposed to form a carbon layer covering the EV surface. These materials were investigated for the removal of three different oils, i.e. diesel, soybean and engine oil spilt on water. CONCLUSION: This work showed that glycerol from biodiesel production can be used directly to produce a highly efficient absorbent to remediate oil spill accidents. The results obtained showed a remarkable increase on oil removal efficiency with a strong decrease on water absorption. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) seed oil methyl esters were prepared and evaluated as an alternative biodiesel fuel and contained an unusual fatty acid hitherto unreported as the principle component in biodiesel fuels: petroselinic (6Z-octadecenoic; 68.5 wt%) acid. Most of the remaining fatty acid profile consisted of common 18 carbon constituents such as linoleic (9Z,12Z-octadeca-dienoic; 13.0 wt%), oleic (9Z-octadecenoic; 7.6 wt%) and stearic (octadecanoic; 3.1 wt%) acids. A standard transesterification procedure with methanol and sodium methoxide catalyst was used to provide C. sativum oil methyl esters (CSME). Acid-catalyzed pretreatment was necessary beforehand to reduce the acid value of the oil from 2.66 to 0.47 mg g-1. The derived cetane number, kinematic viscosity, and oxidative stability (Rancimat method) of CSME was 53.3, 4.21 mm2 s-1 (40 °C), and 14.6 h (110 °C). The cold filter plugging and pour points were -15 °C and -19 °C, respectively. Other properties such as acid value, free and total glycerol content, iodine value, as well as sulfur and phosphorous contents were acceptable according to the biodiesel standards ASTM D6751 and EN 14214. Also reported are lubricity, heat of combustion, and Gardner color, along with a comparison of CSME to soybean oil methyl esters (SME). CSME exhibited higher oxidative stability, superior low temperature properties, and lower iodine value than SME. In summary, CSME has excellent fuel properties as a result of its unique fatty acid composition.

AB  - Tallow is a raw material for biodiesel production that, due to their highly centralized generation in slaughter/processing facilities and historically low prices, may have energy, environmental, and economic advantages that could be exploited. However beef tallow biodiesel have unfavorable properties due the presence of high concentration of saturated fatty esters. One way to overcome these inconveniences is using blending procedures. In this way, blends of beef tallow biodiesel with soybean biodiesel and with conventional mineral diesel fuel were prepared and the quality of the mixtures was monitored with the purpose to study ideal proportions of the fuels. By measurement of the viscosity, density, cold filter plugging point, and flash point, it was demonstrated that tallow biodiesel can be blended with both mineral diesel and soybean biodiesel to improve the characteristics of the blend fuels, over that of the tallow. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper contains details extracting esters from oil of Argemone mexicana using transesterification technique. However, weed crops as A. mexicana seed oil and its seed oil methyl ester have not been tested for their production potential, comparative fuel qualities with diesel and economic feasibility. The average oil yield has been found 35%. To the author's best knowledge, this is the first study on A. mexicana seed oil and methyl ester production as a fuel. In this study, A. mexicana crop pattern and potential of seed production in field conditions, oil extraction process from the seeds and the transesterification process for ester production were examined. Seeds were collected from the crop, which was grown over a selected land area. A. mexicana seed oil was extracted and its physical and chemical characteristics determined. The produced A. mexicana seed oil methyl ester was characterized by exposing its major properties. Methyl ester yield, fuel properties and economic assessment of the oil and its methyl ester were determined and compared to that of commercial diesel fuel. The analysis of the properties in comparison to commercial diesel fuel showed that transe-methylation improve the fuel properties of the oil. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to understand the effect of both the new homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion process and the use of biofuel, optical measurements were carried out into a transparent CR diesel engine. Rape seed methyl ester was used and tests with several injection pressures were performed. OH and HCO radical were detected and their evolutions were analyzed during the whole combustion. Moreover, soot concentration was measured by means the two colour pyrometry method. The reduction of particulate emission with biodiesel as compared to the diesel fuel was noted. Moreover, this effect resulted higher increasing the injection pressure. In the case of RME the oxidation of soot depends mainly from O2 content of fuel and OH is responsible of the NO formation in the chamber as it was observed for NOx exhaust emission. Moreover, it was investigated the evolution of HCO and CO into the cylinder. HCO was detected at the start of combustion. During the combustion, HCO oxidizes due to the increasing temperature and it produces CO. Both fuels have similar trend, the highest concentrations are detected for low injection pressure. This effect is more evident for the RME fuel. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Measurements of ultrafine particles have been performed at the exhaust of a low emission microturbine for power generation. This device has been fuelled with liquid fuels, including a commercial diesel oil, a mixture of the diesel oil with a biodiesel and kerosene, and tested under different loads. Primarily attention has been focused on the measurements of the size distribution functions of the particles emitted from the system by using particle differential mobility analysis. A bimodal size distribution function of the particle emitted has been found in all the examined conditions. Burning diesel oil, the first mode of the size distribution function of the combustion-formed particles is centered at around 2-3 nm, whereas the second mode is centered at about 20-30 nm. The increase of the turbine load and the addition of 50% of biodiesel has not caused changes in the shape of size distribution of the particles. A slightly decrease of the amount of particle formed has been found. By using kerosene the amount of emitted particles increases of more than one order of magnitude. Also the shape of the size distribution function changes with the first mode shifted towards larger particles of the order of 8-10 nm but with a lower emission of larger 20-30 nm particles. Overall, in this conditions, the mass concentration of particles is increased respect to the diesel oil operation. Particle sizes measured with the diesel oil have been compared with the results on a diesel engine operated in the same power conditions and with the same fuel. Measurements have showed that the mean sizes of the formed particles do not change in the two combustion systems. However, diesel engine emits a number concentration of particles more than two orders of magnitude higher in the same conditions of power and with the same fuel. By running the engine in more premixed-like conditions, the size distribution function of the particles approaches that measured by burning kerosene in the microturbine indicating that the distribution function of the sizes of the emitted particles can be strongly affected by combustion conditions. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Fuel properties of rapeseed oil and soybean oil methyl esters (e.g. density, cetane number and viscosity etc.) are similar to those of the diesel fuel. These methyl esters can be used as diesel engine fuel by mixing withy diesel fuel. In this study a comparison of diesel fuel, the rapeseed oil methyl ester and the soybean oil methyl ester was made from the engine performance and emissions point of view. The tests were carried out with a four-cylinder diesel engine for tree different injection pressures such as 250, 300 and 350 bar with each of these fuels. For the purpose of comparison, tests were also conducted at full load conditions with diesel fuel. As the result, the performance and emission values of rapeseed oil (R) and soybean oil (S) methyl esters were found to be nearly the same with those of diesel fuels (D) when injection pressure was increased to 300 bar. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There is a growing interest for using bioethanol-biodiesel fuel blends in diesel engines but no kinetic data and model for their combustion were available. Therefore, the kinetics of oxidation of a biodiesel-bioethanol surrogate fuel (methyl octanoate-ethanol) was studied experimentally in a jet-stirred reactor at 10 atm and constant residence time, over the temperature range 560- 1160 K, and for several equivalence ratios (0.5-2). Concentration profiles of reactants, stable intermediates, and final products were obtained by probe sampling followed by online FTIR, and off-line gas chromatography analyses. The oxidation of this fuel in these conditions was modeled using a detailed chemical kinetic reaction mechanism consisting of 4592 reversible reactions and 1087 species. The proposed kinetic reaction mechanism yielded a good representation of the kinetics of oxidation of this biodiesel-bioethanol surrogate under the JSR conditions. The modeling was used to delineate the reactions triggering the low-temperature oxidation of ethanol important for diesel engine applications. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The European Union (EU) Renewable Energy Directive stipulates that only biofuel systems that achieve greenhouse gas emission savings of 60% will be eligible to be considered for the 2020 target of 10% renewable energy in transport. Rape seed biodiesel is a very popular indigenous European biofuel; however, this 60% target is very challenging for the biofuel produced. Tropical biofuels such as palm oil biodiesel tend to be sustainable, due to use of residues and byproduct to satisfy parasitic energy demands. This paper explores, through life cycle assessment methodologies, the whole rape seed system and the potential to improve sustainability. Allocation by energy content attributes almost half the greenhouse gas emissions to rape cake (a coproduct). Indeed rape cake as animal feed displaces imported soybean from Latin America and potential destruction to rain forests. Together with use of glycerol as a source of heat, greenhouse gas savings of 75% maybe attained, indicating a sustainable system. Furthermore use of rape straw pellets in lieu of the environmentally unsound practice of using peat produced from Irish Bogs as a source of domestic heating can lead to a 135% savings on diesel. Interestingly, rape cake as a source of biomethane greatly improves the energy balance of the system but is of little benefit to emissions. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The application of biphasic acid/solvent biomass reactor to the processing of soybean, sunflower, jatropha, camelina, safflower, and canola seeds, resulting in the conversion of the carbohydrates present in these feedstocks into the biofuel precursor 5-(chloromethyl)furfural (CMF 1) was studied. Mixtures of the seed oil and CMF 1 can be submitted to ethanolysis to give ethyl levulinate 4 and biodiesel ethyl ester 5. Alternatively, heating seed oil-CMF1 mixtures in water results in the hydrolysis of 1 to levulinic acid 2 while leaving the oil intact. Levulinate esters are short-chain oxygenates, which can be blended with diesel fuel and may improve its cold-performance properties. This method has the potential to revolutionize biodiesel production by merging lipid- and cellulose-based biomass conversion technologies and thereby substantially increasing the overall yield of fuel produced from oil crops.

AB  - Simulated distillation (SimDis) is a gas chromatographic method and has evolved into an indispensable tool in petroleum industries to determine the distillation behavior of different petroleum products and to ensure fuel quality. In contrast to classic physical distillation, SimDis exhibits a range of advantages that include comparatively very small sample amounts and the possibility of automation, which are of great importance in fields of research and in the development of novel fuels. Within this work we could show that SimDis can also be used to characterize not only boiling behaviors of fossil fuels, but also alternative fuels as different kinds of biodiesel. Analysis of different kinds of biodiesel and biodiesel blends, as presented in our work, shows that shorter chain fatty acid methyl esters, as can be found in coconut oil, can significantly change the distillation characteristic to a more favorable distillation curve, which resembles a fossil diesel fuels boiling behavior. The second part of our work shows that there is a good correlation between data obtained using SimDis and conventional distillation, also in case of biodiesel. SimDis therefore can easily be used to classifiy novel biofuels, for example, also bidodiesel made of algae or novel oilseed, regarding boiling characteristics and quality. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Mineral-catalyzed decarboxylation reactions are important in both crude oil formation and, increasingly, biofuel production. In this study we examined decarboxylation reactions of a model fatty acid, propionic acid, C 2H5COOH, to an alkane, C2H6, in a model of pyrophillite with an isomorphic substitution of aluminum in the tetrahedral layer. We model a postulated reaction mechanism. (Almon, W. R.; Johns, W. D. 7th International Meeting on Organic Geochemistry 1975, Vol. 7) to ascertain the role of Al substitution and a counterion in decarboxylation reactions. We employ a periodic cell, planewave, ab initio DFT computation to examine the total energies and the frontier orbitals of different model sets, including the effects of charge on the reaction, the effect of Al substitution, and the role of Na counterions. The results show that an uncharged system with a sodium counterion is most feasible for catalyzing the decarboxylation reaction in an Al-substituted pyrophillite and, also, that analysis of the orbitals is a better indicator of a reaction than charge alone. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Many Jatropha curcas Linnaeus (JCL) plantations have been established in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. To assess the potential of JCL for biofuel production, the potential areas for JCL plantations, and the yields of JCL must be estimated as accurately as possible. Mere, we present a system approach to estimate JCL yields, classify yield levels, and estimate productivity of future JCL plantations. We used a process-based net primary productivity (NPP) model to estimate potential JCL yields. The model estimated that the potential yield of JCL dry seed will vary from 0 to 7.62 ton ha -1 y-1, in contrast to estimates of 1.50-7.80 ton ha -1 y-1 from previous assessments. We formulated a zoning scheme that takes into account land cover status and potential yield levels. This scheme was used to evaluate the potential area and production of future plantations at the global, regional, and national levels. The estimated potential area of JCL plantations is 59-1486 million hectares worldwide, and the potential production is 56-3613 million ton dry seed y-1. This study provides scientific information on global patterns of potential plantation areas and yields, which can be used to support bioenergy policy makers to plan commercial-scale JCL plantations. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study analyses the possibility of using beef tallow biodiesel transesterified with ethanol, provided by Universidade Federal Fluminense, as a viscosity reference material for biodiesels. The quantity viscosity was measured with capillary viscometers, according to Brazilian standards, in a temperature range between 20 °C and 40 °C for characterisation, and at 40 °C for homogeneity, in short-term stability (90 days) and long-term stability (450 days). Thirty-nine samples were stored, 9 at 45 °C, 6 at 4 °C and 24 at 20 °C. The behaviour of viscosity is analysed considering the estimated uncertainty of measurements for characterisation, homogeneity and stability. The reason to study a transesterified biofuel with ethanol lies in the fact that it is easy to produce this fluid from sugarcane in Brazil. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Valorization is the conversion of waste and biomass to energy, fuels and other useful materials, with particular focus on environmental indicators and sustainability goals. It is part of the larger endeavor of loopclosing. This topic is the object of cooperation between a large number of actors from various fields of engineering sciences, health and safety. In this paper, the relevance and the interest in this topic is discussed and supported with examples. The two examples proposed concern biomass and plastic films. Biomass has gained a tremendous interest during the ten last years and will be a subject for significant research progress in the future. The evolution of research in the production of biofuels from first, second and third generation biomass is discussed using thermal process. The second example concerns plastic films; valorization of plastics has been investigated for two decades already with relevant progress. However, this paper shows that there are still a number of issues to tackle and overcome for an efficient and effective valorization of plastic films. To improve and reach a significant valorization, integrated processes for proper separation, detection and classification of plastic film from industrial and commercial packaging waste are discussed. The paper also highlights the bottlenecks, barriers and challenging issues such as the emission of pollutants and greenhouse gases, energy efficiency, modeling, characterization, regulation and policy that will drive the development of this field in the future. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.

AB  - Due to diminishing petroleum reserves and the deleterious environmental consequences of exhaust gases from fossil-based fuels, research on renewable and environmentally friendly fuels has received a lot of impetus in recent years. With oil at high prices, alternate renewable energy has become very attractive. Many of these are eco-friendly. Besides ethanol, other unconventional choices are: biodiesel made from non-edible sources or waste cooking oil that can be blended with diesel; biobutanol; and gas-to-liquids from the abundance of natural gas, coal, or biomass. In this paper, we examine advances made in research on biodiesel. Current research on the synthesis of biodiesel can be classified into five areas: (i) the source of substrates, namely triglyceride and acyl-acceptors, (ii) reaction mechanism, (iii) catalysts for transesterification, including the application of inorganic base and acid catalysts as well as biocatalysts, (iv) solvent effects on biodiesel synthesis, especially in enzyme-catalyzed processes, and (v) operations and reactors involving traditional batch reactors, continuous reactors, novel membrane reactors andmicro-channel reactors. Each of these areas is reviewed in this paper. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.

AB  - A significant obstacle to the commercial acceptance of biodiesel is the potential for filter plugging due to precipitates in the fuel. The majority of these precipitates can be attributed to either steryl glucosides (SGs) or monoacylglycerols in biodiesel. A GC-FID method to quantify minor components content in biodiesel is presented. The effectiveness of room temperature and cold soak filtration, adsorbent treatment, centrifuge, and vacuum distillation processes for SG removal was studied. The vacuum distillation process is the most effective method of removing the SG from biodiesel. © 2009 AOCS.

AB  - This article evaluates the implications of uncertainty in the life cycle (LC) energy efficiency and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of rapeseed oil (RO) as an energy carrier displacing fossil diesel (FD). Uncertainties addressed include parameter uncertainty as well as scenario uncertainty concerning how RO coproduct credits are accounted for (uncertainty due to modeling choices). We have carried out an extensive data collection to build an LC inventory accounting for parameter uncertainty. Different approaches for carbon stock changes associated with converting set-aside land to rapeseed cultivation have been considered, which result in different values: from -0.25 t C/ha.yr (carbon uptake by the soil in tonnes per hectare year) to 0.60 t C/ha.yr (carbon emission). Energy renewability efficiency and GHG emissions of RO are presented, which show the influence of parameter versus scenario uncertainty. Primary energy savings and avoided GHG emissions when RO displaces FD have also been calculated: Avoided GHG emissions show considerably higher uncertainty than energy savings, mainly due to land use (nitrous oxide emissions from soil) and land use conversion (carbon stock changes). Results demonstrate the relevance of applying uncertainty approaches; emphasize the need to reduce uncertainty in the environmental life cycle modeling, particularly GHG emissions calculation; and show the importance of integrating uncertainty into the interpretation of results. © 2010 by Yale University.

AB  - Cardoon (Cynara cardunculus L.) is a perennial spontaneous thistle grown in Mediterranean countries and well adapted to marginal lands, recently considered as a non-food energy crop. Their seeds contain 24% of oil (dry basis). In this study, modeling and optimization of the production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from cardoon oil for biodiesel uses was performed at laboratory scale, via response surface methodology, following a central composite rotatable design. FAME were obtained by transesterification of crude cardoon oil with methanol in the presence of a catalyst (sodium methoxide) for 120 min. The temperature ranged from 26 to 94 7°C, the amount of sodium methoxide varied between 0.12 and 2.5 wt-% and the molar ratio methanol/oil from 0.95 : 1 to 11 : 1. The estimated yield of FAME (97%) was obtained after 30 min, at 52 7°C, for a molar ratio of 6.4 : 1 and 1.4 wt-% of catalyst. In laboratory-scale model validation experiments, 94% of FAME yield was obtained after 30 min of reaction. Transesterification was performed in a 30-L reactor, under previously optimized conditions: A yield of 88% FAME was obtained after 90 min of reaction time, due to mass transfer limitations. After purification, the biodiesel showed high quality according to DIN EN 14214 standard specifications. © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Deoxygenation of triglycerides over Co and Mo sulfides supported on a series of mesoporous molecular sieves (MCM-41) with varying Si/Al ratio has been investigated in this contribution. The catalysts were tested in a flow reactor at reaction temperatures 300 and 320 °C, hydrogen pressures 2-11 MPa and space velocities 1-4 h-1 using refined rapeseed oil as a feedstock. Incorporation of Al into the framework of MCM-41 led to an increase of both conversion of triglycerides and selectivity to hydrocarbons, namely n-heptadecane and n-octadecane. However, the conversion of triglycerides was lower than that achieved over alumina supported CoMo. Moreover, the rather high selectivity to oxygenated products, as compared with alumina supports, has made possible a detailed description of the reaction intermediates and their dependence on the reaction conditions. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - For a number of analytical tests required in the biodiesels or ethanol-fuel product specifications, the scope of these test methods does not include such alternative energy sources. Thus, it is not clear that these methods are applicable to biofuels without any modifications to take care of the different matrices. Examples are given where the modifications have been implemented in the test methods and other cases where such research and development work is still required before using the methods for biofuels.

AB  - The thermophysical properties of biofuels are required for the efficient design of their chemical processing, distribution, and utilization. We provide a review of biofuel properties research at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). We are expanding two Standard Reference Databases to include biofuels. The ThermoData Engine will collect and evaluate all published property data on biofuel components. The NIST Reference Fluid Thermodynamic and Transport Properties database is a calculational database providing properties of biofuel components and blends based on thermodynamic and transport models. The property models in the databases implement an equation of state approach based on well defined reference fluids. Complex mixtures, including blends of biofuels with conventional fuels, are modeled as "surrogate blends," i.e., a blend of perhaps a dozen components that captures the essential characteristics of a complex fuel. Surrogate blends are formulated from a "suite" of well-characterized pure compounds. Property measurements for the pure compounds in the surrogate suite include but are not limited to density, speed of sound, and viscosity. We have also carried out measurements on actual biofuel samples. A recent extension of the distillation curve that we have developed at NIST is proving very valuable in characterizing fuels. This "advanced distillation curve method" provides much more quantitative information than the traditional method, including chemical characterization of the different "cuts" as the distillation proceeds. We present examples of our measurements and models completed to date and outline future plans. Copyright © 2010 by ASTM International.

AB  - Transesterification of crude cottonseed oil with methanol in the presence of base catalyst by means of low-frequency ultrasonic irradiation at room temperature was investigated to evaluate the effects of reaction time, molar ratio of methanol to oil, catalyst type, and catalyst concentration on the biodiesel yield. All the catalysts exhibited better activity at 6/1 molar ratio of methanol to oil, among which potassium methoxide demonstrated the best activity. In addition, the effect of ultrasonic frequency on the biodiesel yield was also assessed. The high yield for the crude cottonseed oil biodiesel under the ultrasonic irradiation condition was attributed to the efficacy of cavitation, which could enhance the mass transfer between the methanol and crude cottonseed oil. The present results confirmed the high efficiency and feasibility of using ultrasonic energy to produce biodiesel.

AB  - Biodiesel is biodegradable and nontoxic, and it significantly reduces toxic and other emissions when burned as a fuel. The advantages of biodiesel as diesel fuel are its portability, ready avail- ability, renewability, higher combustion efficiency, non-toxicity, higher flash point, and lower sulfur and aromatic content, higher cetane number, and higher biodegradability. The major disadvantages of biodiesel are its higher viscosity, lower energy content, higher cloud point and pour point, higher nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, lower engine speed and power, injector cok- ing, engine compatibility, high price, and greater engine wear. The technical disadvantages of biodiesel/fossil diesel blends include problems with fuel freezing in cold weather, reduced energy density, and degradation of fuel under storage for prolonged periods. The sources of biodiesel are vegetable oils and fats. The direct use of vegetable oils and/or oil blends is generally considered to be unsatisfactory and impractical for both direct injection and indirect type diesel engines because of their high viscosities and low volatilities injector coking and trumpet formation on the injectors, higher level of carbon deposits, oil ring sticking, and thickening and gelling of the engine lubricant oil, acid composition. Biodiesel is obtained by transesterifying triglycerides with methanol. A popular variation of the batch transesterification process which needs high alcohol/acid ratio (several separation problems and high corrosivity and toxicity) is the use of continuous stirred tank reactors in series. This continuous process is heterogeneous and is based on reactive distil- lation. The key factor is the selection of the right and effective solid catalyst which leads to reduction of energy consumption and investments at all. © Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Glycerol, a byproduct of the biodiesel industry, can be used by bacteria as an inexpensive carbon source for the production of value-added biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). Burkholderia cepacia ATCC 17759 synthesized poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) from glycerol concentrations ranging from 3% to 9% (v/v). Increasing the glycerol concentration results in a gradual reduction of biomass, PHA yield, and molecular mass (Mn and Mw) of PHB. The molecular mass of PHB produced utilizing xylose as a carbon source is also decreased by the addition of glycerol as a secondary carbon source dependent on the time and concentration of the addition. 1H-NMR revealed that molecular masses decreased due to the esterification of glycerol with PHB resulting in chain termination (end-capping). How-ever, melting temperature and glass transition temperature of the end-capped polymers showed no significant difference when compared to the xylose-based PHB. The fermentation was successfully scaled up to 200 L for PHB production and the yield of dry biomass and PHB were 23.6 g/L and 7.4 g/L, respectively. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

AB  - Amyris has raised more than $170 million venture capital to get itself into the biofuels business. The company is presently planning to generate about all that fuel in Brazil. Collier's responsibilities have included shipping drums of frozen Brazilian sugarcane juice to Amyris's California laboratory. Brazil's automobile fleet now consumes more ethanol than gasoline. Around 90% of cars manufactured in Brazil can run on the biofuel. Today, Brazilian sugarcane is the only crop that can possibly back up Amyris's green marketing. While the environmental impact of growing sugarcane remains in dispute, it is clear that processing needs less energy than cultivating corn. Brazil's demand for diesel is high, which is puts Amyris in an advantageous position, allowing the company to build a respectable business without exporting a drop. Brazil also has space to increase production. Sugarcane is now planted on around 3% of Brazil's arable land.

AB  - The influences of urea, yeast extract, and nitrate as the nitrogen source on heterotrophic growth of four strains of Chlorella protothecoides were investigated in 9-day feed-batch cultures. Biomass dry weight concentration (DWC) and lipid yield (LY) of the four strains in all media were compared. The highest LY in 9 days was 654 mg/L/day by UTEX 255 in 2.4 g/L KNO3 medium with a biomass DWC of 11.7 g/L and lipid content of 50.5%. Using green autotrophic seeds instead of yellow heterotrophic seeds improved the biomass DWC (13.1 vs. 11.7 g/L), LY (850 vs. 654 mg/L/day), and lipid to glucose consumption ratio (0.607 vs. 0.162). Moreover, 17.0 g/L DWC and 489 mg/L/day LY were obtained from the sequentially mixed-nitrogen medium, and the lipid to glucose consumption ratio was improved to 0.197 from 0.162 in 2.4 g/L nitrate medium and from 0.108 in 4.2 g/L yeast extract medium in the first batch. © 2009 Humana Press.

AB  - Recent research has proposed that low-volatility organic vapors are an important class of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursors. Mixtures of low-volatility organics were photooxidized in a smog chamber under low- and high-NOx conditions. Separate experiments addressed emission surrogates (diesel fuel and motor oil) and single components (n-pentacosane). Both diesel fuel and motor oil are major components of exhaust from diesel engines. Diesel fuel is a complex mixture of intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOCs), whereas motor oil is a complex mixture of semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs). IVOCs exist exclusively in the vapor phase, while SVOCs exist in both the aerosol and vapor phase. Oxidation of SVOC vapors (motor oil and n-pentacosane) creates substantial SOA, but this SOA is largely offset by evaporation of primary organic aerosol (POA). The net effect is a cycling or pumping of SVOCs between the gas and particle phases, which creates more oxygenated organic aerosol (OA) but little new OA mass. Since gasphase reactions are much faster than heterogeneous ones, the processing of SVOC vapors likely contributes to the production of highly oxidized OA The interplay between gas-particle partitioning and chemistry also blurs traditional definitions of POA and SOA. Photo-oxidation of diesel fuel (IVOCs) rapidly creates substantial new OA mass, similarto published aging experiments with dilute diesel exhaust However, aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) data indicated thatthe SOA formed from emission surrogates is less oxidized than either the oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA) measured in the atmosphere or SOA formedfrom the photooxidation of dilute diesel exhaust Therefore, photo-oxidation of IVOCs helps explain the substantial SOA mass produced from aging diesel exhaust but some component is missing from these emission surrogate experiments that leads to the rapid production of highly oxygenated SOA. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel is synthesized via the transesterification of triglycerides contained within vegetable, animal, or waste oils. First-generation biofuels are not the solution to global transport energy needs; however, biodiesel does have a role to play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector, so long as necessary production can be achieved in a sustainable manner without negative impact on plant and animal biodiversity. The biodiesel content within diesel sold to consumers is set to increase in the future, with implications on vehicle fuel consumption, emissions, and base engine durability. This study examines the effects of increasing the biodiesel blend ratio on the performance and emissions of a production vehicle equipped with a common-rail direct-injection diesel engine, evaluated on a chassis rolls dynamometer, at various ambient temperatures. Results obtained show that reductions in engine-out carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions do not always translate to lower tailpipe emissions as reduced exhaust gas temperatures at higher blend ratios lead to reduced catalyst conversion efficiencies and higher total cycle emissions. Catalyst conversion efficiencies for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons over the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC) are reduced by 9-19 per cent (depending on the ambient temperature) for a 50:50 blend (B50) compared with the petroleum diesel (B0) baseline. Increasing the blend ratio caused a linear decrease in the vehicle's maximum tractive force. This reduction was of the order of 5 per cent for a B50 blend at low vehicle speeds and 6-10 per cent at higher speeds, which is greater than would be expected on the basis of the differences in calorific values. Over the NEDC, the fuel consumption was found to increase with increasing blend ratio.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The novelty of this work is the estimation of the fuel properties of biodiesel, a comparison study with conventional sources of biodiesel commonly used as feedstock, and an investigation for meeting the requirements of the standard specifications for this fuel produced by six strains of microalgae (three cyanobacteria, two green algae and one diatom), cultivated photosynthetically in a bubble column photobioreactor. Lipid productivity and biofuel quality were the criteria for species selection. RESULTS: Chlorella vulgaris was found to be the best strain for use as a feedstock for biodiesel production and for this specie, a carbon dioxide sequestration rate of 17.8mg L-1 min-1, a biomass productivity of 20.1mg L-1 h-1, a lipid content of 27.0% and a lipid productivity of 5.3 mg L-1 h-1 were obtained. Qualitative analysis of the fatty acid methyl esters demonstrates the predominance of saturated (43.5%) and monounsaturated (41.9%) fatty acids. The quality properties of the biodiesel were an ester content of 99.8%, a cetane number of 56.7; an iodine value of 65.0 g I2 100 g-1; a degree of unsaturation of 74.1% and a cold filter plugging point of 4.5 °C. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that amongthe fuelproperties tested, themicroalgalbiodiesel complieswith theUSStandard (ASTM 6751), European Standard (EN 14214), Brazilian National Petroleum Agency (ANP 255) and Australian Standard for biodiesel. © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - In the search of an alternative fuel to substitute diesel fuel, biodiesel appears as one of the most promising sources of energy for diesel engines because of its environmental advantages and also due to the evolution of the petroleum market. Refined oil is the conventional raw material for the production of this biofuel; however, its major disadvantage is the high cost of its production. Therefore, frying oils, waste oils, crude oils and/or acid oils are being tested as alternative raw materials; nevertheless, there will be some problems if a homogeneous basic catalyst (NaOH) is employed due to the high amount of free fatty acid present in the raw oil. In this work, the transesterification reaction of acid oil using solid resin, Dowex monosphere 550 A, was studied as an alternative process. Ethanol was employed to have a natural and sustainable final product. The reaction temperature's effects, the initial amount of free fatty acid, the molar ratio of alcohol/oil and the type of catalyst (homogeneous or heterogeneous) over the main reaction are analyzed and their effects compared. The results obtained show that the solid resin is an alternative catalyst to be used to produce fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) by a transesterification reaction with a final conversion over 90%. On the other hand, the time required to achieve this conversion is bigger than the one required using conventional technology which employs a homogeneous basic catalyst. This reaction time needs to be optimized. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The increased use of ethanol in transportation fuels warrants an investigation of its consequences. An important component of such an investigation is the temperature dependence of ethanol and gasoline exhaust chemistry. We use the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM, version 3.1, LEEDS University) with the SMVGEAR II chemical ordinary differential solver to provide the speed necessary to simulate complex chemistry to examine such effects. The MCM has over 13,500 organic reactions and 4600 species. SMVGEAR II is a sparse-matrix Gear solver that reduces the computation time significantly while maintaining any specified accuracy. Although we use a box model for this study, we determine and demonstrate in a separate study that the speed of the MCM with SMVGEAR II allows the MCM to be modeled in 3-dimensions. We also verified the accuracy of the model in comparison with smog chamber data. We then use the model with species-resolved tailpipe emissions data for E85 (15% gasoline, 85% ethanol fuel blend) and gasoline vehicles to compare the impact of each on nitrogen oxides, organic gases, and ozone as a function of ambient temperature and background concentrations, using Los Angeles in 2020 as a base case. We use two different emissions sets - one is a compilation of exhaust and evaporative data taken near 24 °C and the other from exhaust data taken at -7 °C - to determine how atmospheric chemistry and emissions are affected by temperature. We include diurnal effects by examining two day scenarios. We find that, accounting for chemistry and dilution alone, the average ozone concentrations through the range of temperatures tested are higher with E85 than with gasoline by ∼7 part per billion volume (ppbv) at higher temperatures (summer conditions) to ∼39 ppbv at low temperatures and low sunlight (winter conditions) for an area with a high nitrogen oxide (NOx) to non-methane organic gas (NMOG) ratio. The results suggest that E85's effect on health through ozone formation becomes increasingly more significant relative to gasoline at colder temperatures due to the change in exhaust emission composition at lower temperatures. Acetaldehyde and formaldehyde concentrations are also much higher with E85 at cold temperatures, which is a concern because both are considered to be carcinogens. These could have implications for wintertime use of E85. Peroxy acetyl nitrate (PAN), another air pollutant of concern, increases with E85 by 0.3-8 ppbv. The sensitivity of the results to box size, initial background concentrations, background emissions, and water vapor were also examined. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The need for biofuels, particularly liquid ones like ethanol and biodiesel, has been felt by most of the countries and their governments have been trying to promote these fuels. Following in line with global trend, India declared its biofuel policy in which biodiesel, primarily from jatropha, would meet 20% of the diesel demand beginning with 2011-2012. In spite of the efforts made by the state, production of biodiesel, however, has not picked up at all. Doubt arises as to whether the country will be able to meet the target. It is felt that the government policy, particularly regarding land utilization, organizing cultivation of jatropha and pricing of jatropha seeds, needs to be more clear. This paper attempts to make an assessment of the state of India's biofuel programme and to identify the hurdles that policy-maker need to overcome to achieve the goal. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The chemical speciation of the 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons associated to the particulate matter of conventional diesel fuel, rapeseed methyl esters, waste cooking oil methyl esters, waste cooking oil ethyl esters and their conventional fuel blends has been carried out. The speciation of these individual compounds was made by a combination of thermal extraction, solid phase micro-extraction and GC/MS analysis. This PAH speciation method was applied to a real samples obtained from a diesel engine under two different operating modes, urban and extraurban modes. The purpose of this work was to study the relationship between the amount, type and carcinogenic potency of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in engine emissions and the multi-component biodiesel fuel composition. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to understand and to model the environmental performance of biodiesel produced by various Greek raw materials under current conditions. Three energy crops (rapeseed, sunflower and soybean) have been studied, with regard to their levels of biodiesel productivity. Throughout the entire process, current Greek climatic conditions and cultivation parameters have been taken into account. At the stage of assessment, we conclude that the environmental impacts per crop area indicate that soybean has the lowest environmental impacts. However, by assessing the results per quantity of produced biodiesel, the crop with the minimum environmental impacts is sunflower. This paper shows that environmental benefits from biodiesel have better results, compared to conventional diesel, thus leading to the conclusion that it is feasible to succeed improved environmental performance. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To maximize the production of biodiesel from soybean soapstock, the effects of water on the esterification of high-FFA (free fatty acid) oils were investigated. Oleic acid and high acid acid oil (HAAO) were esterified by reaction with methanol in the presence of Amberlyst-15 as a heterogeneous catalyst or sulfuric acid as a homogeneous catalyst. The yield of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) was studied at oil to methanol molar ratios of 1:3 and 1:6 and reaction temperatures of 60 and 80 °C. The rate of esterification of oleic acid significantly decreased as the initial water content increased to 20% of the oil. The activity of Amberlyst-15 decreased more rapidly than that of sulfuric acid, due to the direct poisoning of acid sites by water. Esterification using sulfuric acid was not affected by water until there was a 5% water addition at a 1:6 molar ratio of oil to methanol. FAME content of HAAO prepared from soapstock rapidly increased for the first 30 min of esterification. Following the 30-min mark, the rate of FAME production decreased significantly due to the accumulation of water. When methanol and Amberlyst-15 were removed from the HAAO after 30 min of esterification and fresh methanol and a catalyst were added, the time required to reach 85% FAME content was reduced from 6 h to 1.8 h. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, chicken fat biodiesel with synthetic Mg additive was studied in a single-cylinder, direct injection (DI) diesel engine and its effects on engine performance and exhaust emissions were studied. A two-step catalytic process was chosen for the synthesis of the biodiesel. Methanol, sulphuric acid and sodium hydroxide catalyst were used in the reaction. To determine their effects on viscosity and flash point of the biodiesel, reaction temperature, methanol ratio, type and amount of catalyst were varied as independent parameters. Organic based synthetic magnesium additive was doped into the biodiesel blend by 12 μmol Mg. Engine tests were run with diesel fuel (EN 590) and a blend of 10% chicken fat biodiesel and diesel fuel (B10) at full load operating conditions and different engine speeds from 1800 to 3000 rpm. The results showed that, the engine torque was not changed significantly with the addition of 10% chicken fat biodiesel, while the specific fuel consumption increased by 5.2% due to the lower heating value of biodiesel. In-cylinder peak pressure slightly rose and the start of combustion was earlier. CO and smoke emissions decreased by 13% and 9% respectively, but NOx emission increased by 5%. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the details of development of a biodiesel production test rig based on hydrodynamic cavitation followed by results of experimental investigation carried out on a four cylinder, direct injection water cooled diesel engine operating on diesel and biodiesel blend of Citrullus colocyntis (Thumba) oil. The experiment covers a wide range of engine rpm. Results show that biodiesel of Thumba oil produced through hydrodynamic cavitation technique can be used as an alternative fuel with better performance and lower emissions compared to diesel. The most significant conclusions are that (i) Biodiesel production through hydrodynamic cavitation technique seems to be a simple, efficient, time saving, eco-friendly and industrially viable process. (ii) 30% biodiesel blend of Thumba oil shows relatively higher brake power, brake thermal efficiency, reduced bsfc and smoke opacity with favourable p-θ diagram as compared to diesel. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This publication continues previously published work from the authors which evaluates the storage potential of poultry fat for its use as an unmodified biofuel in heat and steam generating systems [1]. The previous work examined the physical properties of these fats while this study is concerned with chemical properties. In this study poultry fat (biofuel) and its 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% mixtures with #2 pump diesel fuel were stored for 1 year at bench scale (1L) under controlled laboratory conditions at 4, 38, 54.4 °C and at 22 °C. One hundred percent of poultry fat was studied under these same conditions with and without an antioxidant additive. Twenty and eighty percent of poultry fat mixtures were also stored at pilot scale (250 gallons) under outdoor, ambient conditions. Chemical properties relevant to the use of these mixtures as a biofuel for industrial boilers were studied and tracked. These properties include Energy Values (BTU), Ultimate Analysis (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, ash, nitrogen, and sulfur), moisture, impurities, unsaponafiables (MIU), and Free Fatty Acid Content. Energy content of the biofuel samples dropped over the course of the study with untreated biofuel losing 18.9% of its BTU value over the course of a year. Ultimate analyses showed an overall increase in carbon composition and a decrease in oxygen content. Hydrogen levels increased in most treatments as did overall ash and sulfur percent composition. MIU values increased, this overall increase was attributable to variable increases in insolubles and unsaponifiables. Free fatty acid levels increased in all treatments. Most of the chemical changes observed in this study were reduced by the addition of antioxidant to 100% biofuel. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In a previous study, waste fish oil was converted into bio-oil by a fast pyrolysis process at 525 °C in a continuous pilot plant reactor with 72-73% yield. The bio-oil was distilled to obtain light bio-oil and heavy bio-oil and these biofuels were characterized in terms of their physico-chemical properties. In this study, the chemical composition of light bio-oil and heavy bio-oil was determined using GC-FID, GC-MS, 1H and 13C NMR techniques. The GC-MS analysis of waste fish oil showed the main composition of fatty acids to be the following: C16:0 (15.87%), C18:2 (20.96%), C18:1 (17.29%), C20:5 (5.11%), C20:1 (7.59%), C22:6 (4.53%), C22:1 (10.42%) and others. The GC-FID analysis of the light bio-oil showed 482 compounds that were PIONA classified as paraffins (4.48%), iso-paraffins (8.31%), olefins (26.56%), naphthenes (6.07%) and aromatics (16.86%). The heavy bio-oil had a similar chromatographic profile as diesel oil, with a high content of carboxylic acids and olefins. These results are in good agreement with those for the gasoline and diesel oil fractions of petroleum. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The liquid-phase deoxygenation of stearic, oleic, and linoleic acids employing a 5 wt% Pd/C catalyst was investigated using on-line quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS). Catalytic deoxygenation of stearic acid (SA) under He occurs primarily via decarboxylation; the liquid products are n-heptadecane and heptadecenes. On-line QMS revealed concomitant CO2 and H2 evolution which can explain the greater than expected heptadecene yields at low to intermediate conversions. After essentially complete SA conversion, hydrogenation of heptadecenes via hydrogen transfer from the dodecane solvent results in 98% n-heptadecane yield. The initial rate of SA decarboxylation under 10% H2 is lower than under He; however, by avoiding the formation of unsaturated products the reaction requires much less time to reach completion. The SA decarboxylation rate under 10% H2 is 6-fold slower in heptadecane than in dodecane. This apparent solvent effect is explained by the lower vapor pressure of heptadecane resulting in greater H2 inhibition of the decarboxylation reaction. Our results demonstrate that the unsaturated C18 free fatty acids, oleic and linoleic, must be hydrogenated to SA before decarboxylation can proceed at a significant rate. Oleic acid (OA) deoxygenation under He occurs very slowly and primarily via decarbonylation. In contrast, OA deoxygenation under 10% H2 occurs facilely via hydrogenation to SA followed by decarboxylation. Since hydrogenation is complete during heating to reaction temperature, the decarboxylation kinetics and product yields are not affected by the initial unsaturation of the reactant. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The results of studies into tricomponent fuel mixtures containing fossil diesel fuel (D), fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), and ethanol (E) are presented. We propose the possibility of the use of D-FAME-Ein Lithuania. We determined the limits of component concentrations that make it possible to produce stable tricomponent fuel mixtures of D-FAME-E at different concentrations of ethanol (i.e., 99.8% and 96%) and at different temperatures (20, 0, and -10°C). Engine tests were performed with fuels prepared according to these conditions. During the performance testing of 2FL5U and 1A41 diesel engines, we determined the possible influence of ethanol admixture on fuel effectiveness and emission of toxic components of exhaust gases. Admixture of ethanol increased the indicated efficiency of diesel engines by about 2% and decreased NOx emission by 5-7%. It also decreased the smoke density and increased hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. Particular alterations of fuel characteristics were experimentally fixed for fuels containing ethanol. Technological measures are suggested for the development of an efficient and stable diesel engine fleet for operation in Lithuania on tricomponent biofuel mixtures, i.e., D-FAME-E.

AB  - This paper describes a catalytic hydrothermolysis (CH) process aimed at converting triglycerides to nonester biofuels. The CH conversion was carried out at temperatures ranging from 450 to 475 °C and a pressure of 210 bar in the presence of water with and without a catalyst. The organic phase (biocrude) from the CH process underwent post-treatment involving decarboxylation and hydrotreating. Results derived from soybean oil, jatropha oil, and tung oil show that certain biofuel fractions met JP-8 specifications and Navy distillate specifications. One of the CH biofuel characteristics is their high levels of cyclics and aromatics. Tung-oil-based biofuels derived from the CH process contain up to 60% aromatics, which can be a desirable ingredient for fuel blends involving biofuels derived from other processes or feedstocks. Results from these crop oils also suggest that the CH process can be adapted to a variety of other triglyceride feedstocks. Copyrigh © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In an urban-transit bus, fueled by biodiesel in Toledo, Ohio, single inhalable particle samples in October 2008 were collected and detected by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/EDS). Particle size analysis found bimodal distribution at 0.2 and 0.5 μm. The particle morphology was characterized by 14 different shape clusters: square, pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, octagon, nonagon, decagon, agglomerate, sphere, triangle, oblong, strip, line or stick, and unknown, by quantitative order. The square particles were common in the samples. Round and triangle particles are more, and pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, octagon, nonagon, decagon, strip, line or sticks are less. Agglomerate particles were found in abundance. The surface of most particles was coarse with a fractal edge that can provide a suitable chemical reaction bed in the polluted atmospheric environment. The three sorts of surface patterns of squares were smooth, semi-smooth, and coarse. The three sorts of square surface patterns represented the morphological characteristics of single inhalable particles in the air inside the bus in Toledo. The size and shape distribution results were compared to those obtained for a bus using ultra low sulfur diesel. © 2010 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the US has issued guidelines for the second phase of time renewable fuels standard (RFS2) that requires refiners to ensure that the gasoline supply contains 8.25% ethanol. The agency has also announced volume standards for specific categories of renewable fuels with 2010 cellulosic ethanol standard is down to 6.5 million gallon down from the 100 million gallon. The biomass-based diesel standard includes the proposed 2009 and 2010 standards, which is termed as retroactive by oil industry groups as these are finalized on February 3, 2010 and will be effective from July 1, 2010. The industry experts believe that the US government's move to boost biofuels is incrementally favorable to corn-based ethanol, with the EPA setting a specific annual volume for biodiesel for the first time, and could set an important precedent for corn ethanol in the event of a future advanced biofuel shortfall.

AB  - Bioenergy is the only alternative and cheap source of energy which can be made easily available to the world. The present experiment included three steps for the conversion of spent tea (Camellia sinensis) into biofuels. In the first step, spent tea was gasified using Co nano catalyst at 300°C and atmospheric pressure. Catalytic gasification of spent tea yielded 60% liquid extract, 28% fuel gases and 12% charcoal. Gaseous products contain 53.03% ethene, 37.18% methanol and 4.59% methane. In the second step of the experiment, liquid extract of spent tea obtained from gasification, on transesterification gave 40.79% ethyl ester (biodiesel). In the third step, Aspergillus niger's growth on spent tea produced 57.49% bioethanol. This study reports an interesting finding that spent tea (solid waste) could be used not only for the production of biodiesel and bioethanol but also hydrocarbon fuel gases. The world today is consuming several million tons of tea yearly. The present technology could be utilized to produce alternate energy. © 2010 Academic Journals.

AB  - Diesel engines have proven their utility in the transportation, agriculture, and power sectors in India. They are also potential sources of decentralized energy generation for rural electrification. Concerns on the long-term availability of petroleum diesel and the stringent environmental norms have mandated the search for a renewable alternative to diesel fuel to address these problems. Vegetable oils have been considered good alternatives to diesel in the past couple of years. However, there are many issues related to the use of vegetable oils in diesel engine. Jatropha curcas has been promoted in India as a sustainable substitute to diesel fuel. This study aims to develop a dual fuel engine test rig for evaluating the potential suitability of Jatropha oil as diesel fuel and for determining the performance and emission characteristics of an engine with Jatropha oil. The experimental results suggest that engine performance using Jatropha oil is slightly inferior to that of diesel fuel. The thermal efficiency of the engine was lower, while the brake-specific fuel consumption was higher with Jatropha oil compared with diesel fuel. The levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from Jatropha oil during the entire duration of the experiment were lower than those of diesel fuel. The reduction of NOx was found to be an important characteristic of Jatropha oil as NOx emission is the most harmful gaseous emission from engines; as such, its reduction is always the goal of engine researchers and makers. During the entire experiment, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the case of using Jatropha oil were higher than when diesel fuel was used. The higher density and viscosity of Jatropha oil causes lower thermal efficiency and higher brakespecific fuel consumption. The performance and emission characteristics found in this study are significant for the study of replacing diesel fuel from fossils with Jatropha oil in rural India, where the availability of diesel has always been a problem. © KSME &amp; Springer 2010.

AB  - Ethanol is increasingly popular as fuel. It is renewable, cleaner than gasoline, and during the 2008 oil price peak, its costs of production without subsidies actually rivalled those of gasoline. The fuel grade ethanol producers are large consumers of stainless steel, in particular for cookers, fermentation tanks, and distillation columns as well as storage tanks for the finished product. The main reason is that cleanliness is important for the enzymes. However, contaminants play an important role in production as well as storage and distribution. Contaminants are causing a phenomenon called stress corrosion cracking. Biodiesel fuel is a mixture of fatty acid alcohol esters. Modern diesel engines are very sensitive to fuel quality and purity. Biodiesel is unstable, just like butter, which is going rancid in a matter of weeks. Biodiesel degradation is an oxidation process, which among others is speeded up by tiny amounts of metal ions leaching from production and storage vessels. Biodiesel vessels need to be designed in non-degradable materials of construction, as stainless steel. In addition, pretreatment of low cost feedstock and methyl recycling operations use strong acids, which also necessitate stainless steels. Biomass is gaining importance as a source for renewable fuels and hydrogen in addition to heat and electricity. Corrosion issues are numerous and include high temperature corrosion under ash and alkali salt deposits and metal dusting at gasification. Fuel grade ethanol, biodiesel and biomass represent three different corrosion issues, which can be solved using the correct stainless steel. © 2010 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

AB  - Chemistry with its key targets of providing materials and processes for conversion of matter is at the center stage of the energy challenge. Most energy conversion systems work on (bio)chemical energy carriers and require for their use suitable process and material solutions. The enormous scale of their application demands optimization beyond the incremental improvement of empirical discoveries. Knowledge-based systematic approaches are mandatory to arrive at scalable and sustainable solutions. Chemistry for energy, "ENERCHEM" contributes in many ways already today to the use of fossil energy carriers. Optimization of these processes exemplified by catalysis for fuels and chemicals production or by solid-state lightning can contribute in the near future substantially to the dual challenge of energy use and climate protection being in fact two sides of the same challenge. The paper focuses on the even greater role that ENERCHEM will have to play in the era of renewable energy systems where the storage of solar energy in chemical carries and batteries is a key requirement. A multidisciplinary and diversified approach is suggested to arrive at a stable and sustainable system of energy conversion processes. The timescales for transformation of the present energy scenario will be decades and the resources will be of global economic dimensions. ENERCHEM will have to provide the reliable basis for such technologies based on deep functional understanding. © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Aliphatic hydrocarbons are highly appealing targets for advanced cellulosic biofuels, as they are already predominant components of petroleum-based gasoline and diesel fuels. We have studied alkene biosynthesis in Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698, a close relative of Sarcina lutea (now Kocuria rhizophila), which 4 decades ago was reported to biosynthesize iso- and anteiso-branched, long-chain alkenes. The underlying biochemistry and genetics of alkene biosynthesis were not elucidated in those studies. We show here that heterologous expression of a three-gene cluster from M. luteus (Mlut-13230-13250) in a fatty acid-overproducing Escherichia coli strain resulted in production of long-chain alkenes, predominantly 27:3 and 29:3 (no. carbon atoms: no. C=C bonds). Heterologous expression of Mlut-13230 (oleA) alone produced no long-chain alkenes but unsaturated aliphatic monoketones, predominantly 27:2, and in vitro studies with the purified Mlut-13230 protein and tetradecanoylcoenzyme A (CoA) produced the same C27 monoketone. Gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry confirmed the elemental composition of all detected long-chain alkenes and monoketones (putative intermediates of alkene biosynthesis). Negative controls demonstrated that the M. luteus genes were responsible for production of these metabolites. Studies with wild-type M. luteus showed that the transcript copy number of Mlut-13230-13250 and the concentrations of 29:1 alkene isomers (the dominant alkenes produced by this strain) generally corresponded with bacterial population over time. We propose a metabolic pathway for alkene biosynthesis starting with acyl-CoA (or-ACP [acyl carrier protein]) thioesters and involving decarboxylative Claisen condensation as a key step, which we believe is catalyzed by OleA. Such activity is consistent with our data and with the homology (including the conserved Cys-His-Asn catalytic triad) of Mlut-13230 (OleA) to FabH (β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III), which catalyzes decarboxylative Claisen condensation during fatty acid biosynthesis. © 2010, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Oxygenated fuels are known to reduce particulate matter (PM) emissions from diesel engines. In this study, 100% soy methyl ester (SME) biodiesel fuel (B100) and a blend of 10% acetal denoted by A-diesel with diesel fuel were tested as oxygenated fuels. Particle size and number distributions from a diesel engine fueled with oxygenated fuels and base diesel fuel were measured using an Electrical Low Pressure Impactor (ELPI). Measurements were made at ten steady-state operational modes of various loads at two engine speeds. It was found that the geometric mean diameters of particles from SME and Adiesel were lower than that from base diesel fuel. Compared to diesel fuel, SME emitted more ultra-fine particles at rated speed while emitting less ultra-fine particles at maximum speed. Ultra-fine particle number concentrations of A-diesel were much higher than those of base diesel fuel at most test modes. © Higher Education Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

AB  - Hierarchical macroporous–mesoporous SBA-15 silicas have been synthesised via dual-templating routes employing liquid crystalline surfactants and polystyrene beads. These offer high surface areas and well-defined, interconnecting macro- and mesopore networks with respective narrow size distributions around 300 nm and 3–5 nm for polystyrene:tetraethoxysilane ratios ≥2:1. Subsequent functionalisation with propylsulfonic acid yields the first organized, macro-mesoporous solid acid catalyst. The enhanced mass transport properties of these new bi-modal solid acid architectures confer significant rate enhancements in the transesterification of bulky glyceryl trioctanoate, and esterification of long chain palmitic acid, over pure mesoporous analogues. This paves the way to the wider application of hierarchical catalysts in biofuel synthesis and biomass conversion. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - A key aspect in modeling the (future) competition between biofuels is the way in which production cost developments are computed. The objective of this study was threefold: (i) to construct a (endogenous) relation between cost development and cumulative production (ii) to implement technological learning based on both engineering study insights and an experience curve approach, and (iii) to investigate the impact of different technological learning assumptions on the market diffusion patterns of different biofuels. The analysis was executed with the European biofuel model BioTrans, which computes the least cost biofuel route. The model meets an increasing demand, reaching a 25% share of biofuels of the overall European transport fuel demand by 2030. Results show that 1st generation biodiesel is the most cost competitive fuel, dominating the early market. With increasing demand, modestly productive oilseed crops become more expensive rapidly, providing opportunities for advanced biofuels to enter the market. While biodiesel supply typically remains steady until 2030, almost all additional yearly demands are delivered by advanced biofuels, supplying up to 60% of the market by 2030. Sensitivity analysis shows that (i) overall increasing investment costs favour biodiesel production, (ii) separate gasoline and diesel subtargets may diversify feedstock production and technology implementation, thus limiting the risk of failure and preventing lock-in and (iii) the moment of an advanced technology's commercial market introduction determines, to a large degree, its future chances for increasing market share. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There is strong interest in the production of fuels from triglycerides of biological origin. In this work tricaprylin (TC) and caprylic acid (CA) were used as model compounds to study the catalytic hydroconversion process of triglycerides to acyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons. Supported metal and metal oxide catalysts, such as palladium on activated carbon (Pd/C), and promoted molybdena-alumina (Ni,Mo/γ-Al2O3) were used. The reaction was found to proceed in consecutive steps: hydrogenolysis (HYS) of TC to CA and propane, followed by hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of the CA intermediate. The overall reaction rate was governed by the rate of the HDO reaction. Two distinct HDO routes were distinguished: (i) hydrodecabonylation and (ii) reduction of oxygen. Over Pd/C the prevailing reaction route of CA hydroconversion was the decarbonylation giving mainly C7 alkane and CO, whereas the HDO over the Ni,Mo/γ-Al2O3 catalysts proceeded in consecutive H2 addition and dehydration steps giving predominantly C8= alkenes, C8 alkanes and water. In reaction route (ii) alcohol and traces of aldehyde were detected as acid-to-alkane intermediates. Results suggest that reaction route (i) passes through formic acid intermediate that, in the presence of H2, rapidly decomposes to CO and H2O. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Laminar flame speeds and extinction strain rates of premixed C5-C12 n-alkane flames were determined at atmospheric pressure and elevated unburned mixture temperatures, over a wide range of equivalence ratios. Experiments were performed in the counterflow configuration and flow velocities were measured using Laser Doppler Velocimetry. The laminar flame speeds were obtained using a non-linear extrapolation technique utilizing numerical simulations of the counterflow experiments with detailed descriptions of chemical kinetics and molecular transport. Compared to linearly extrapolated values, the laminar flame speeds obtained using non-linear extrapolations were found to be 1-4 cm/s lower depending on the equivalence ratio. It was determined that the laminar flame speeds of all n-alkane/air mixtures considered in this investigation are similar to each other and sensitive largely to the H2/CO and C1-C4 hydrocarbon kinetics. Additionally, the resistance to extinction decreases as the fuel molecular weight increases. Simulations of the experiments were performed using the recently developed JetSurF 0.2 reaction model consisting of 194 species and 1459 reactions. The laminar flame speeds were predicted with good accuracy for all the n-alkane-air mixtures considered. The experimental extinction strain rates are well predicted by the model for fuel-lean mixtures. For stoichiometric and fuel-rich mixtures, the predicted extinction strain rates are approximately 10% lower than the experimental values. Insights into the physical and chemical processes that control the response of n-alkane flames are provided through detailed sensitivity analyses on both reaction rates and binary diffusion coefficients. © 2009 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - There is currently a sustained interest in biofuels as they represent a potential alternative to petroleum derived fuels. Biofuels are likely to help decrease greenhouse gas emissions and the dependence on oil resources. Biodiesels are Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAMEs) that are mainly derived from vegetable oils; their compositions depend on the parent vegetables: rapeseed ("RME"), soybean ("SME"), sunflower, palm etc. A fraction of biodiesel has also an animal origin ("tallow"). A key factor for the use of biofuels in gas turbines is their emission indices (NOx, CO, VOC, and PM) in comparison with those of conventional "petroleum gasoils". While biodiesels reduce carbon-containing pollutants, experimental data from diesel engines show a slight increase in NOx. The literature relating to gas turbines is very scarce. Two recent, independent field tests carried out in Europe (RME) and in the USA (SME) showed slightly lower NOx while a lab test on a microturbine showed the opposite effect. To clarify the NOx index of biodiesels in gas turbines, a study has been undertaken, taking gasoil and natural gas (NG) as reference fuels. In this study, a calculation of the flame temperature developed by the 3 classes of fuels has been performed and the effect of their respective compositions has been investigated. The five FAMEs studied were RME, SME and methyl esters of sunflower, palm and tallow; these are representative of most widespread vegetable and animal oil bases worldwide. The software THERGAS has been used to calculate the enthalpy and free energy properties of the fuels and GASEQ for the flame temperature (Tf), acknowledging the fact that "thermal NOx" represents the predominant form of NOx in gas turbines. To complete the approach to structural effects, we have modeled two NG compositions (rich and weak gases) and three types of gasoil using variable blends of eleven linear/branched/cyclic molecules. The results are consistent with the two recent field tests and show that the FAMEs lie close to petroleum gasoils and higher than NG in terms of NOx emission. The composition of the biodiesel and regular diesel fuel influences their combustion heat: methyl esters with double bonds see a slight increase of their Tf and their NOx index while that of gasoil is sensitive to the aromatic content. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The hypothesis of this study is that there is a statistical relationship between the cardiovascular disease mortality rate and the intensity of fuel consumption (measured in gallons/square mile) at a particular location. We estimate cross-sectional regressions of the mortality rate due to cardiovascular disease against the intensity of fuel consumption using local data for the entire US, before the US Clean Air Act (CAA) in 1974 and after the most recent policy revisions in 2004. The cardiovascular disease rate improvement estimate suggests that up to 60 cardiovascular disease deaths per 100,000 residents are avoided in the largest urban areas with highest fuel consumption per square mile. In New York City, for instance, the mortality reduction may be worth about $30.3 billion annually. Across the US, the estimated Value of Statistical Life (VSL) benefit is $202.7 billion annually. There are likely three inseparable reasons that contributed importantly to this welfare improvement. First, the CAA regulations banned leaded gasoline, and mandated reduction in specific chemicals and smog components. Second, technologies such as the Catalytic Converter (CC) for the automobile and the low particulate diesel engine were adopted. Third, biofuels have had important roles, making the adoption of clean air technology possible and substituting for high emission fuels. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The high viscosity of fish oil leads to problem in pumping and spray characteristics. The inefficient mixing of fish oil with air leads to incomplete combustion. The best way to use fish oil as fuel in compression ignition (CI) engines is to convert it into biodiesel. It can be used in CI engines with very little or no engine modifications. This is because it has properties similar to mineral diesel. Combustion tests for methyl ester of fish oil and its blends with diesel fuel were performed in a kirloskar H394 DI diesel engine, to evaluate fish biodiesel as an alternative fuel for diesel engine, at constant speed of 1500 rpm under variable load conditions. The tests showed no major deviations in diesel engine's combustion as well as no significant changes in the engine performance and reduction of main noxious emissions with the exception on NOx. Overall fish biodiesel showed good combustion properties and environmental benefits. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this research, an experimental investigation has been performed to give insight into the potential of biodiesel as an alternative fuel for High Speed Direct Injection (HSDI) diesel engines. The scope of this work has been broadened by comparing the combustion characteristics of diesel and biodiesel fuels in a wide range of engine loads and EGR conditions, including the high EGR rates expected for future diesel engines operating in the low temperature combustion (LTC) regime. The experimental work has been carried out in a single-cylinder engine running alternatively with diesel and biodiesel fuels. Conventional diesel fuel and neat biodiesel have been compared in terms of their combustion performance through a new methodology designed for isolating the actual effects of each fuel on diesel combustion, aside from their intrinsic differences in chemical composition. The analysis of the results has been sequentially divided into two progressive and complementary steps. Initially, the overall combustion performance of each fuel has been critically evaluated based on a set of parameters used as tracers of the combustion quality, such as the combustion duration or the indicated efficiency. With the knowledge obtained from this previous overview, the analysis focuses on the detailed influence of biodiesel on the different diesel combustion stages known ignition delay, premixed combustion and mixing controlled combustion, considering also the impact on CO and UHC pollutant emissions. The results of this research explain why the biodiesel fuel accelerates the diesel combustion process in all engine loads and EGR rates, even in those corresponding with LTC conditions, increasing its possibilities as alternative fuel for future DI diesel engines. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Terminalia belerica seeds, collected from Indian forests, were explored as an alternate bioresource for biodiesel synthesis. The oil yield of T. belerica seed is about 31% (dry weight basis). The fatty acid profile of T. belerica seed oil shows predominance of oleic acid (C18:1) glycerides (61.5%) along with linoleic (18.5%) and palmitic (11.6%) glycerides. Oil was extracted and evaluated for physico-chemical properties vis-a-vis jatropha, sunflower, soybean and rapeseed oil. T. belerica oil was transesterified with methanol in the presence of sodium methoxide catalyst. The physico-chemical properties of synthesized methyl ester were compared to jatropha, sunflower, soybean and rapeseed methyl esters as per ASTM D-6751 specification of biodiesel. Synthesized T. belerica methyl ester was also blended in diesel at 5-20% ratios and evaluated for key physico-chemical properties as per IS 1460 specification and found to meet in properties evaluated as per specific standards. The study revealed the possibility of T. belerica seed oil as potential resource of biodiesel. © 2009.

AB  - In the present study, gasification of biodiesel by-product, crude glycerin, was performed in an entrained flow gasifier. Gasification was conducted in a temperature range of 950-1500 °C and excess air ratio of 0.17-0.7 for air or oxygen as a gasification agent. From the results, syngas heating value, carbon conversion and cold gas efficiency of more than 2500 kcal/N m3, 92% and 65% were achieved, respectively. The H2/CO ratio of the product gas was varied from 1.25 to 0.7 with the excess air ratio and this gas composition was favorable for DME synthesis. The optimum excess air ratio for gasification of biodiesel by-product was evaluated to be an approximately 0.35-0.4. The present results indicate that crude glycerin can be utilized as a feedstock for gasification to make syngas. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this research was to improve the cold-flow property of biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester, FAME) made from corn oil by urea complexation. Effects of processing conditions on the yield of low-melting-point biodiesel and its fatty acid composition were investigated. The optimal conditions were as follows: 50 °C stirring temperature, 40 min stirring time, 1:1 (w/w) ratio of urea to FAME, 5:1 (v/w) ratio of methanol to FAME, 20 °C crystallization temperature, and 2 h crystallization time. Under these conditions, the maximum yield of non-urea complexes with a melting temperature range from -52 to -45 °C was 53%, and the fatty acid profiles of non-urea complexes were 0.3% palmitic acid, 23.7% oleic acid, 75.1% linoleic acid, and 0.9% linolenic acid. Results also showed that oxystearin was helpful in further improving the cold-flow property of low-melting-point biodiesel. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - ZrO2 supported La2O3 catalyst prepared by impregnation method was examined in the transesterification reaction of sunflower oil with methanol to produce biodiesel. It was found that the catalyst with 21 wt% loaded La2O3 and calcined at 600 °C showed the optimum activity. The basic property of the catalyst was studied by CO2-TPD, and the results showed that the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield was related to their basicity. The catalyst was also characterized by TG-DTA, XRD, FTIR, SEM and TEM, and the mechanism for the formation of basic sites was discussed. It was also found that the crystallite size of support ZrO2 decreased by loading of La2O3, and the model of the solid-state reaction on the surface of La2O3/ZrO2 catalyst was proposed. Besides, the influence of various reaction variables on the conversion was investigated. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An efficient microwave-assisted transesterification (MAT) technique was developed to prepare biodiesel from yellow horn (Xanthoceras sorbifolia Bunge.) oil with a heteropolyacid (HPA) catalyst namely Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40. A study for optimizing the reaction conditions such as reaction temperature, time, molar ratio of methanol/oil, catalyst amount, and recycle number of catalyst has been performed. The maximum yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) reached 96.22% under optimal conditions of temperature 60 °C, 10 min, molar ratio of methanol/oil 12:1, 1% (w/w of oil) catalyst and minimum recycle number nine times. The final product of biodiesel, obtained after the new catalyzed process, was analyzed by gas chromatography. The results showed that the Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 heterogeneous acid catalyst had higher efficiency for transesterification under microwave irradiation compared with the conventional method. The product properties of yellow horn biodiesel are found to be in agreement with EN 14214 standard. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) by a two-step in-situ transesterification from two kinds of rice bran was investigated in this study. The method included an in-situ acid-catalyzed esterification followed by an in-situ base-catalyzed transesterification. Free fatty acids (FFAs) level was reduced to less than 1% for both rice bran A (initial FFAs content = 3%) and rice bran B (initial FFAs content = 30%) in the first step under the following conditions: 10 g rice bran, methanol to rice bran ratio 15 mL/g, H2SO4 to rice bran mass ratio 0.18, 60 °C reaction temperature, 600 rpm stirring rate, 15 min reaction time. The organic phase of the first step product was collected and subjected to a second step reaction by adding 8 mL of 5 N NaOH solution and allowing to react for 60 and 30 min for rice bran A and rice bran B, respectively. FAMEs yields of 96.8% and 97.4% were obtained for rice bran A and rice bran B, respectively, after this two-step in-situ reaction. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is a clean burning biofuel produced from renewable resources (straight vegetable oil, animal oil/fats, tallow and waste cooking oil), which can be blended at any level with petroleum diesel to create a blend of biodiesel. The EU has adopted a series of directives to promote and to represent some of the most important renewable energy sources out of biofuels also covering biodiesel as well. The main processing stages currently applied for biodiesel technology are represented by transesterification, neutralization of mixture, phase separation, biodiesel and glycerine purifications. The reaction, generally occurring in a two-stage mixer-settler unit, arises some difficulties for clear cut separations. A new alternative technology, using hydrophobic porous membranes, can be used to prevent bulk mixing of the two phases and facilitate contact and mass transfer of species between the two phases. The glycerine side stream (roughly representing 10% of biodiesel) typically contains a mixture of many components, which are generally difficult to separate. Current methods for glycerine purification are complicated and conducted with higher costs. In this case, the new technology provides an economical solution for the purification of crude glycerine stream combining the high efficiency of electro-dialysis and nano-filtration processes. A comparative cost approach based on available information is sketched. Also, some examples sustain the aim of the study. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Volatility of oil prices along with major concerns about climate change, oil supply security and depleting reserves have sparked renewed interest in the production of fuels from renewable resources. Recent advances in synthetic biology provide new tools for metabolic engineers to direct their strategies and construct optimal biocatalysts for the sustainable production of biofuels. Metabolic engineering and synthetic biology efforts entailing the engineering of native and de novo pathways for conversion of biomass constituents to short-chain alcohols and advanced biofuels are herewith reviewed. In the foreseeable future, formal integration of functional genomics and systems biology with synthetic biology and metabolic engineering will undoubtedly support the discovery, characterization, and engineering of new metabolic routes and more efficient microbial systems for the production of biofuels. © Dellomonaco et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - While ethods for aggregating emissions are widely used and standardized in life cycle assessment (LCA), there is little agreement about methods for aggregating natural resources for obtaining interpretable metrics.Thermodynamic methods have been suggested including energy, exergy, and emergy analyses. This work provides insight into the nature of thermodynamic aggregation, including assumptions about substitutability between resources and loss of detailed information about the data being combined. Methods considered include calorific value or energy, industrial cumulative exergy consumption (ICEC) and its variations, and ecological cumulative exergy consumption (ECEC) or emergy. A hierarchy of metrics is proposed that spans the range from detailed data to aggregate metrics. At the fine scale, detailed data can help identify resources to whose depletion the selected product is most vulnerable. At the coarse scale, new insight is provided about thermodynamic aggregation methods. Among these, energy analysis is appropriate only for products that rely primarily on fossil fuels, and it cannot provide a useful indication of renewability. Exergy-based methods can provide results similar to energy analysis by including only nonrenewable fuels but can also account for materials use and provide a renewability index. However, ICEC and its variations do not address substitutability between resources, causing its results to be dominated by dilute and low-quality resources such as sunlight. The use of monetary values to account for substitutability does not consider many ecological resources and may not be appropriate for the analysis of emerging products. ECEC or emergy explicitly considers substitutability and resource quality and provides more intuitive results but is plagued by data gaps and uncertainties. This insight is illustrated via application to the life cycles of gasoline, diesel, corn ethanol, and soybean biodiesel. Here, aggregate metrics reveal the dilemma facing the choice of fuels: high return on investment versus high renewability. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Deoxygenation of vegetable oils has a potential to become an important process for production of biofuels. The present work focuses on investigation of Ni, Mo, and NiMo sulfided catalysts prepared by impregnation in deoxygenation of rapeseed oil at 260-280 °C, 3.5 MPa and 0.25-4 h-1 in a fixed-bed reactor. The activity of the catalysts decreased in the order NiMo/Al2O3 &gt; Mo/Al2O3 &gt; Ni/Al2O3. The catalysts exhibited significantly different product distributions. The bimetallic NiMo catalysts showed higher yields of hydrocarbons than the monometallic catalysts at a given conversion. Apart from the various oxygenated product intermediates, NiMo/Al2O3 yielded a mixture of decarboxylation and hydrodeoxygenation hydrocarbon products while Ni/Al2O3 yielded only decarboxylation hydrocarbon products and Mo/Al2O3 yielded almost exclusively hydrodeoxygenation hydrocarbon products. The effect of Ni/(Ni + Mo) atomic ratio in the range 0.2-0.4 on the activity and selectivity was not significant. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Euro V diesel fuel, pure biodiesel and biodiesel blended with 5%, 10% and 15% of ethanol or methanol were tested on a 4-cylinder naturally-aspirated direct-injection diesel engine. Experiments were conducted under five engine loads at a steady speed of 1800 r/min. The study aims to investigate the effects of the blended fuels on reducing NOx and particulate. On the whole, compared with Euro V diesel fuel, the blended fuels could lead to reduction of both NOx and PM of a diesel engine, with the biodiesel-methanol blends being more effective than the biodiesel-ethanol blends. The effectiveness of NOx and particulate reductions is more effective with increase of alcohol in the blends. With high percentage of alcohol in the blends, the HC, CO emissions could increase and the brake thermal efficiency might be slightly reduced but the use of 5% blends could reduce the HC and CO emissions as well. With the diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), the HC, CO and particulate emissions can be further reduced. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - An efficient approach has been adopted for the synthesis of biodiesel developed from karanja, a nonedible oil feedstock. A two-step reaction was followed for synthesis of biodiesel. Karanja oil possessing a high free fatty acid content was esterified with sulfuric acid, and the product obtained was further converted to fatty acid alkyl esters (biodiesel) by transesterification reactions. A moderate molar ratio of 6:1 (methanol/oil) was efficient for acid esterification with 1.5% v/v H2SO4 and 1 h of reaction time at 60 ± 0.5 °C, which resulted in reduction of FFA from 19.88 to 1.86 mg of KOH/g. During alkaline transesterification, 8:1 molar ratio (methanol/oll), 0.8 wt % sodium hydroxide (NaOH), 1.0 wt % sodium methoxide (CH3ONa), or 1.0 wt % potassium hydroxide (KOH) as catalyst at 60 ± 0.5 °C gave optimized yield (90-95%) and high conversion (96-100%). Optimum times for alkaline transesterification were 45 min for CH 3ONa and 1 h for NaOH and KOH. Conversion of karanja oil feedstock to its respective fatty acid methyl esters was identified on a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer and determined by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance and gas chromatography. The fuel properties, such as cetane number of the methyl ester synthesized, were studied and found to be within the limits and specification of ASTM D 6751 and EN 14112 except for oxidation stability. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The methanolysis of soybean oil to produce a fatty acid methyl ester (ME, i.e., biodiesel fuel) was catalyzed by lipase-producing filamentous fungi immobilized on biomass support particles (BSPs) as a whole-cell biocatalyst in the presence of ionic liquids. We used four types of whole-cell biocatalysts: wild-type Rhizopus oryzae producing triacylglycerol lipase (w-ROL), recombinant Aspergillus oryzae expressing Fusarium heterosporum lipase (r-FHL), Candida antarctica lipase B (r-CALB), and mono- and diacylglycerol lipase from A. oryzae (r-mdlB). w-ROL gave the high yield of fatty acid methyl ester (ME) in ionic liquid [Emim][BF4] or [Bmim][BF4] biphasic systems following a 24 h reaction. While lipases are known to be severely deactivated by an excess amount of methanol (e.g. 1.5 Mequiv. of methanol against oil) in a conventional system, methanolysis successfully proceeded even with a methanol/oil ratio of 4 in the ionic liquid biphasic system, where the ionic liquids would work as a reservoir of methanol to suppress the enzyme deactivation. When only w-ROL was used as a biocatalyst for methanolysis, unreacted mono-glyceride remained due to the 1,3-positional specificity of R. oryzae lipase. High ME conversion was attained by the combined use of two types of whole-cell biocatalysts, w-ROL and r-mdlB. In a stability test, the activity of w-ROL was reduced to one-third of its original value after incubation in [Bmim][BF4] for 72 h. The stability of w-ROL in [Bmim][BF4] was greatly enhanced by cross-linking the biocatalyst with glutaraldehyde. The present study demonstrated that ionic liquids are promising candidates for use as the second solvent in biodiesel fuel production by whole-cell biocatalysts. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Vegetable oil was being used as fuel in earlier days when the petroleum fuel supply was quite expensive and/or difficult to obtain. Later, with the ease of availability and supply of petroleum products, vegetable oil was replaced with the diesel which reduced the dependence on vegetable oil and the entire research efforts were directed towards improving the performance of CI engine using diesel fuel and the research efforts directed towards improving the performance of CI engines using vegetable oil as fuel for CI engines were reduced to very large extent. The present work describes the simulated result of the performance of a four stroke, single cylinder, air-cooled, direct-injection compression ignition engine powered by neat jatropha oil. The preheating of the neat jatropha oil is done from 30°C to 100°C. The performance of the engine was studied for a speed range between 1500 to 4000 rpm, with the engine set at full throttle opening and hence the engine was operated under full load conditions. The parameters considered for comparing the performance of neat jatropha oil with that of diesel fuel operation, were brake specific fuel consumption, thermal efficiency, brake power, NOX emission of the engine. The software established that i) the engine offers lower thermal efficiency when it is powered by preheated neat jatropha oil at higher speed ii) the power developed and Nox emission increase with the increase in the fuel inlet temperature iii) and the specific fuel consumption is higher than diesel fuel operation at all elevated fuel inlet temperature. © Indian Society for Education and Environment (iSee).

AB  - One of the primary reasons for expanding the production and use of biofuels is the potential environmental benefit that can be obtained from replacing fossil fuels with fuels derived from renewable biomass resources. This investigation examines the impact of biofuels on the environment directly from the practical view point analysing how the internal combustion engine emission concentration changes using the most common first-generation biofuels in Latvia - biodiesel, rapeseed oil and bioethanol. Laboratory experiments were performed on a chassis dynamometer Mustang MD1750, but the content of exhaust gases components was determined by the AV L SESAM FTIR measurement system. Investigation shows that the trends of different exhaust gas component changes, which would be the same for all investigated fuels, don't exist, i.e., each vehicle and biofuel type or blend is particular and has to be analysed separately. In comparison with fossil diesel, running the car VW Golf on rapeseed oil the average reduction of NOx was 10%, but SO2 - 59%. The CO, CO2, unburned hydrocarbon and mechanical particle emissions were higher. Running the car Opel Vectra on biodiesel the amount of NOx in comparison with fossil diesel increased in average by about 12%, the amount of mechanical particles and unburned hydrocarbons decreased quite significantly, but just a small increase of CO and SO2 was observed. Testing the car VW Passat on gasoline-bioethanol blends increase of the bioethanol content in the fuel blend increased also the NOx content in exhaust gases, but the content of CO, CO2 and NH3 decreased.

AB  - Oil palm requires 7–11 times less land area than soyabean, rapeseed and sunflower to produce the same amount of oil. Therefore, the use of palm oil for food and biofuel, has saved 97–159 million ha of land from being deforested for cultivation with lower yielding oil crops. This has avoided 27–45 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2-e) emissions. Oil palm also sequesters eight times more CO2 than soyabean. As a biofuel, the use of palm biodiesel results in 62–82% Life Cycle Analysis Greenhouse Gas (LCA GHG) reduction when compared with fossil fuel. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Biomass is the most important renewable energy source in the world, and its importance will increase as national energy policy and strategy focuses more heavily on renewable sources and conservation. In the future, biomass has the potential to provide a cost-effective and sustainable supply of energy. Renewable energy is a promising alternative solution because it is clean and environmentally safe. The promise of renewable energy is that it offers a solution to many of the environmental and social problems associated with fossil and nuclear fuels. Biomass feedstocks include forest products wastes, agricultural residues, organic fractions of municipal solid wastes, paper, cardboard, plastic, food waste, green waste, and other waste. Biomass is a sustainable feedstock for chemicals and energy products. Biomass feedstocks are more evenly distributed in the world. As an energy source that is highly productive, renewable, carbon neutral, and easy to store and transport, biomass has drawn worldwide attention recently. There are some barriers to the development of biofuel production. They are technological, economical, supply, storage, safety, and policy barriers. Reducing these barriers is one of the driving factors in the government's involvement in biofuel research and development. Production costs are uncertain and vary with the feedstock available. The production of biofuels from lignocellulosic feedstocks can be achieved through two very different processing routes: biochemical and thermochemical. As of now, there seems to be no clear candidate for "best technology pathway" between the competing biochemical and thermochemical routes. Technical barriers for enzymatic hydrolysis include: low specific activity of current commercial enzymes, high cost of enzyme production, and lack of understanding of enzyme biochemistry and mechanistic fundamentals. © Springer 2010.

AB  - The biorefinery economy is a vision for a future in which biorenewables replaces fossil fuels. The transition to a biorefinery economy would require huge investment in new infrastructure to produce, store, and deliver biorefinery products to end users. The benefits of biofuels over traditional fuels include greater energy security, reduced environmental impact, foreign exchange savings, and socioeconomic issues related to the rural sector. Furthermore, biofuel technology is relevant to both developing and industrialized countries. For these reasons, the share of biofuels in the automotive fuel market is expected to grow rapidly over the next decade. Biofuels could be peaceful energy carriers for all countries. The main economic factors are capital cost, plant capacity, process technology, raw material cost, and chemical costs. The cost of large-scale production of bio-based products is currently high in developed countries. Economic advantages of a biofuel industry would include value added to the feedstock, an increased number of rural manufacturing jobs, an increase in income taxes, investments in plants and equipment, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, reduced reliance on a country's crude oil imports, and supported agriculture by providing a new labor and market opportunities for domestic crops. © Springer 2010.

AB  - Biochemical conversion proceeds at lower temperatures and lower reaction rates and can offer high selectivity for products. Higher moisture feedstocks are generally good candidates for biochemical processes. Ethanol is the most widely used liquid biofuel. It is an alcohol and is fermented from sugars, starches or from cellulosic biomass. Cellulosic materials can be used to produce bioethanol. Bioethanol represents an important, renewable liquid fuel for motor vehicles. The lignocellulosic biomass is hydrolyzed by acids or enzymes into glucose sugar, which becomes bioethanol by fermentation. Fermentation feedstocks require pretreatment by chemical, physical, or biological means to open up the structure of biomass and reduce the complex carbohydrates to simple sugars. Biorefineries for production of several products and byproducts such as biofuels, heat and/or electricity have been in focus in the recent years. It is possible to produce light alkanes by aqueous-phase reforming of biomass-derived oxygenates such as sorbitol and glycerol, which can be obtained from glucose by hydrogenation. © Springer 2010.

AB  - The environmental pollution associated with the use of fossil fuels has led to worldwide interest in the production of biofuels. The main commodity source for biodiesel can be nonedible oils obtained from plant species such as Jatropha curcas (Ratanjyot), Pongamia pinnata (Karanj) etc. Among all the oil bearing crops, recently, Jatropha a drought resistant, multipurpose, perennial plant living up to 50 years, has emerged as the focal point for the biofuel industry with rapid R&D investments. Primary issues favoring Jatropha over other crops are its nonfood nature, reported ability to grow on waste lands and tolerance to high temperatures. Jatropha has also been reported to play an important role in carbon sequestration along with wasteland reclamation. The interest in J. curcas as a feedstock for the production of biodiesel is rapidly growing. It has long been used around the world as a source of lamp oil and soap and also as a hedging plant. Jatropha oil cake is rich in nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus can be used as organic manure. The presence of toxic components in Jatropha seed also provides a use in biopesticide formulations. Nonetheless, all parts of the plant have traditional medicinal uses (both human and veterinary purposes) that are being investigated. Here, the current status of studies on Jatropha worldwide on various aspects such as its taxonomy, botanical description, distribution, ecological requirement, propagation methods, crop improvement applying genetic/molecular approaches, and its potential in the energy sector, wasteland reclamation and for other applications is reviewed and compiled. Detailed information about the presence of various chemicals including toxins in different parts of the plant is summarized. Aspects related to its energy balance and energy flow, environmental effect (CDM) and its economics have also been dealt with. © 2011 Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Fuel and not energy may be the most critical bottleneck for sustainable maintenance of the global economy. The biggest challenge facing the future of the emerging liquid biofuels industry is selection of appropriate crops that will provide reliable and sustainable feedstocks for the increasing energy demands of a growing world population. With few exceptions, current first generation biofuel feedstocks are food crops that have been bred for attributes that are desirable for food production and quality, not biofuel content. In selecting the most appropriate bioenergy candidate species, a number of important issues should be addressed. Upper most in the thoughts of both scientific and lay communities is the socalled 'food versus fuel' debate. Further, it is argued that lands currently, or projected to be cultivated with biofuel crops should not be destined for food production. Similarly, lands currently not under agricultural production are being cleared for the cultivation of energy crops. In this chapter we describe the emerging biofuel feedstock Pongamia pinnata and in doing so address the issues concerning opponents of the biofuels industry and current biofuel feedstocks. © 2011 Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Algae have been and are used as a source of: food, industrial and fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, cosmaceuticals, animal fodder, energy, effluent bioremediation, and fertilizer for the past five thousand years. Algal utilization as a feedstock for biofuel development is not a new concept having been initiated over the past forty years utilizing both macro and microalgae. Utilization of algae as a potential biofuel feedstock, reducing global reliance on petroleumbased transportation fuels, has attracted significant attention. Algalbased biofuels represents many different forms of liquid transportation fuel or energy source including: alkanes, biobutanol, biodiesel, bioethanol, biohydrogen, biomethane, gasoline, green diesel, and jet fuel. Microalgae or phytoplankton have rapidly gained acceptance as a significant feedstock secondgeneration biofuel feedstock. Several advantages of microalgae over terrestrial crops include: Large areal productivities and yields (estimates 50007000 gallons/acre/year); Short lifecycle; Use of marginal, nonarable land; and Avoidance of feedstock vs. food conflict. Macroalgae or seaweeds represent an alternative to microalgal cultivation as a source of algalbased biofuels exhibiting several advantages including harvesting ease and longestablished farming efforts and yielding ∼16 million wet tons per year. Algalbased biofuels stands ready to take its place amongst the evolving secondgeneration biofuel feedstocks. Incremental biological and technological enhancements along with the development of new methodologies will drive the commercialization of this nascent industry to realize its fullest potential; a significant source of biologicallybased transportation fuels. © 2011 Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In central Mexico during the spring of 2007 we measured the initial emissions of 12 gases and the aerosol speciation for elemental and organic carbon (EC, OC), anhydrosugars, Cl?, NO?3 , and 20 metals from 10 cooking fires, four garbage fires, three brick making kilns, three charcoal making kilns, and two crop residue fires. Global biofuel use has been estimated at over 2600 Tg/y. With several simple case studies we show that cooking fires can be a major, or the major, source of several gases and fine particles in developing countries. Insulated cook stoves with chimneys were earlier shown to reduce indoor air pollution and the fuel use per cooking task. We confirm that they also reduce the missions of VOC pollutants per mass of fuel burned by about half. We did not detect HCN emissions from cooking fires in Mexico or Africa. Thus, if regional source attribution is based on HCN emissions typical for other types of biomass burning (BB), then biofuel use and total BB will be underestimated in much of the developing world. This is also significant because cooking fires are not detected from space. We estimate that ≃2000 Tg/y of garbage are generated globally and about half may be burned, making this a commonly overlooked major global source of emissions. We estimate a fine particle emission factor (EFPM2.5) for garbage burning of ≃10.5±8.8 g/kg, which is in reasonable agreement with very limited previous work. We observe large HCl emission factors in the range 2-10 g/kg. Consideration of the Cl content of the global waste stream suggests that garbage burning may generate as much as 6-9 Tg/yr of HCl, which would make it a major source of this compound. HCl generated by garbage burning in dry environments may have a relatively greater atmospheric impact than HCl generated in humid areas. Garbage burning PM2.5 was found to contain levoglucosan and K in concentrations similar to those for biomass burning, so it could be a source of interference in some areas when using these tracers to estimate BB. Galactosan was the anhydrosugar most closely correlated with BB in this study. Fine particle antimony (Sb) shows initial promise as a garbage burning tracer and suggests that this source could contribute a significant amount of the PM2.5 in the Mexico City metropolitan area. The fuel consumption and emissions due to industrial biofuel use are difficult to characterize regionally. This is partly because of the diverse range of fuels used and the very small profit margins of typical microenterprises. Brick making kilns produced low total EFPM2.5 (≃1.6 g/kg), but very high EC/OC ratios (6.72). Previous literature on brick kilns is scarce but does document some severe local impacts. Coupling data from Mexico, Brazil, and Zambia, we find that charcoal making kilns can exhibit an 8-fold increase in VOC/CO over their approximately oneweek lifetime. Acetic acid emission factors for charcoal kilns were much higher in Mexico than elsewhere. Our dirt charcoal kiln EFPM2.5 emission factor was ≃1.1 g/kg, which is lower than previous recommendations intended for all types of kilns. We speculate that some PM2.5is scavenged in the walls of dirt kilns. © 2010 Author(s).

AB  - This article examines the intensification of development cooperation in the field of biogenetic fuels, in particular bioethanol, in light of increasing knowledge on the positive and negative impacts of biofuel production and use. Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, biofuels made from biomass have become an important alternative nonfossil energy source in the EU, improving the CO2 balance, ensuring competitiveness and increasing the security of energy supply by reducing dependence on fossil fuels. Recent studies have shown that the EU's cultivation capacities are limited and have revealed the negative impact of biofuels on food security, land use and land tenure. This article investigates the case of biofuel production in Senegal, as the champion of the OPEC verte, against the background of the 20/20/20 targets of the European Union and the implementation strategies of France and Sweden. The empirical results of the study lead to the conclusion that the intervention of specific actors and the forecast of new technologies play a crucial role for stabilizing the network in favor of biofuel production and use against the background of increased criticism of the negative impacts of the enhanced production of biofuels. This article aims to heoretically ground this argument by applying the actor-network theory of Bruno Latour to show how the issue of biofuels has become relevant and what this implies for democracy theory and the efficiency of the system of European "governance" in the framework of globalization. The article concludes with a fresh look at international relations and, more specifically, the relations between developed and developing countries. © 2010 Interdisciplinary Centre for Comparative Research in the Social Sciences and ICCR Foundation.

AB  - Across the energy sector, alternatives to fossil fuels are being developed, in response to the dual drivers of climate change and energy security. For transport, biofuels have the greatest potential to replace fossil fuels in the short-to medium term. However, the ecological benefits of biofuels and the role that their deployment can play in mitigating climate change are being called into question. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a widely used approach that enables the energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of biofuel production to be calculated. Concerns have nevertheless been raised that published data show widely varying and sometimes contradictory results. This review describes a systematic review of GHG emissions and energy balance data from 44 LCA studies of first- and second-generation biofuels. The information collated was used to identify the dominant sources of GHG emissions and energy requirements in biofuel production and the key sources of variability in published LCA data. Our analysis revealed three distinct sources of variation: (1) 'real' variability in parameters e.g. cultivation; (2) 'methodological' variability due to the implementation of the LCA method; and (3) 'uncertainty' due to parameters rarely included and poorly quantified. There is global interest in developing a sustainability assessment protocol for biofuels. Confidence in the results of such an assessment can only be assured if these areas of uncertainty and variability are addressed. A more defined methodology is necessary in order to allow effective and accurate comparison of results. It is also essential that areas of uncertainty such as impacts on soil carbon stocks and fluxes are included in LCA assessments, and that further research is conducted to enable a robust calculation of impacts under different land-use change scenarios. Without the inclusion of these parameters, we cannot be certain that biofuels are really delivering GHG savings compared with fossil fuels. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The use of biomass fuels for vehicles has been a focus of attention all over the world in terms of prevention of global warming, effective utilization of resources and local revitalization. For the purpose of beneficial use of unused biomass resources, the movement of the use of bioethanol and biodiesel made from them has spread in Japan. In Japan, biodiesel is mainly made from waste cooking oil collected by local communities or governments, and in termsof local production for local consumption, it is used as neat fuel (100% biofuel) or mixed with diesel fuel in high concentration for the vehicles. On the other hand, extremely low emission level must be kept for not only gasoline vehicles but also diesel vehicles in the post new long-term regulation implemented from 2009 in Japan. It is necessary for diesel vehicles to equip an advanced type of aftertreatment such as Urea-Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system or lean NOx trap (LNT) catalyst system in order to comply with this regulation. In this study, engine bench tests were conducted to understand the emission characteristics in the use of high concentration of biodiesel for an engine system with the urea-SCR system which is expected to be equipped for a lot of heavy-duty vehicles in the near future. The results indicated that NOx emission in biodiesel operation increased compared with that in conventional diesel operation under Japanese JE05 mode test. This is because of the NOx emission increasing in the engine out and the NOx reduction efficiency decreasing in the urea-SCR system. Especially, B100 (Neat biodiesel) increased NOx emission over the New Long-Term regulation limit, even though this engine system complied with the new long-term regulation level enough. This was mainly affected by the decrease of NOx reduction efficiency in urea-SCR system due to the decrease of NO2 /NOx ratio at the inlet of urea-SCR. The factor of the decrease in NO2 /NOx ratio was considered to be the decrease in NO2 concentration derived from thereduction of engine-out NO 2 emission and the deterioration of oxidizability of diesel oxide catalyst (DOC). As for the deterioration of oxidizability of DOC, it was thought to be due to the decrease in exhaust gas temperature, catalyst poisoning and reduction action by SOF adhered in DOC. Therefore, it was necessary to improve oxidizability of DOC in order to decrease NOx emissions. © 2010 SAE International.

AB  - The South African government ratified a new biofuels industrial strategy at the end of 2007. The feasibility study that forms the basis of the strategy highlights the potential environmental implications of such a strategy. However, at present there is no structured approach to evaluate the environmental profile of the scenarios within the strategy. This paper introduces life cycle inventories whereby the environmental profiles of biofuel value chains may be evaluated meaningfully. The scope of the paper focuses on the seed extraction biodiesel production scenarios of the strategy. The inventory analysis shows that the inputs and outputs of the farming unit process are sensitive to the type of crop and region of produce. Water usage is a highly variable parameter, which emphasises the importance of rainfall and irrigation to the overall burden of the biodiesel system on water resources. Crop yields may differ by a factor of two, which is a significant difference in terms of land and non-renewable energy resources requirements. The oil and meal/cake content of the seed proves to be the most important parameter that influences the initial unit processes of the value chains; almost all the inputs and outputs of the farming unit processes, for all the crops, range in the order of a factor of two due to this parameter. The uncertainties associated with the logistic system in the value chain also have major implications. Further, should there be no market offset for the meal/cake co-products, the waste treatment requirements would be highly uncertain. Very little uncertainties were detected in the biodiesel production unit process, although the energy efficiency, and sustainability, of the overall production system remains questionable. The paper identifies a number of limitations with inventory sets that need to be addressed through further research efforts to improve the environmental evaluations of a biofuel value chain in South Africa for policy-making purposes.

AB  - We propose to compare avoided emissions from ethanol use in Brazil with emissions caused by the use of fossil fuel, and by land use changes, specifically Amazon deforestation. The avoided emissions of CO2 in Brazil due to ethanol use in 2008 ranged from approximately 9 to 12 TgCyr-1. These values are an order of magnitude higher than the amount of carbon that could be potentially sequestered in soils if sugarcane cultivation in Brazil switches completely to mechanized harvesting, and two orders of magnitude higher than the carbon emissions in soils cultivated with sugarcane and that undergo harvest with burning. In relation to fossil fuel emissions, ethanol avoided emissions are equivalent to 20-30% of the carbon emissions associated with the use of gasoline and diesel in the transportation sector, and to approximately 10% of the total use of fossil fuel in the country. When compared with the carbon emissions from Amazon deforestation ethanol avoided emissions are again one order of magnitude lower. We conclude that ethanol avoided emissions are relatively important within the transport sector, but are still incipient if compared with the emissions from total fossil fuel combustion and emissions from deforestation indicating that climate mitigation efforts in Brazil needs to focus outside of biofuel production. Consequently, we suggest that Brazil develop equally strong actions towards increased energy efficiency use in the country and, more importantly to drastically reduce carbon emissions associated with Amazon deforestation. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) seeds have been grown in tropical regions throughout the world since prehistoric times. Sesame seed, a rich source of protein, is one of the fi rst crops processed for oil production. Its non-culinary application includes its use as an ingredient in soap, cosmetics, lubricants and medicines. Sesame seeds also contain two unique substances: Sesamin and sesamolin known to have a cholesterollowering eff ect in humans and to prevent high blood pressure. Both of these were also reported to increase the hepatic mitochondrial and the peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation rate in experimental animals. Cephalin, a phospholipid from sesame seed has been reported to possess hemostatic activity. The oil has wide medical and pharmaceutical applications. It is mildly laxative, emollient and demulcent. The seeds and fresh leaves may be used as a poultice. The antibacterial activity of seeds against Staphylococcus and Streptococcus as well as common skin fungi, such as athlete's foot fungus has also been well recognized. The oil is also known to maintain high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL). Refi ned sesame oil is rich with antioxidant components like lignans allowing for greater shelf-life of foods plus improving their fl avor and taste. In addition to its use as an antioxidant, sesame oil contains a large amount of linoleate in triglyceride form that selectively inhibit malignant melanoma growth. Off -late, the work has also been oriented towards the production of biodiesel from sesame seed oil as a viable alternative to the diesel fuel. The ethno-botanical and medicinal uses of this commercially important, nutritionally rich oilseed need to be explored for better utilization.

AB  - Tougher environmental regulations, a move toward energy security and sustainability and emerging green initiatives are significantly impacting the fuel industry. Removal of sulphur from traditional diesel fuels to produce a cleaner burning fuel and the introduction of biofuels derived from non-fossil fuel sources are leading to new challenges in particle, water and soft organic contaminants filtration. In addition, new engine designs developed to meet environmental concerns require higher levels of fuel cleanliness. Thus, providing higher performance fuel filtration to achieve these new cleanliness standards is further exacerbated by the complex nature of the evolving diesel fuels. An emerging challenge for filter manufacturers is designing systems which retain filtration performance under actual operating conditions. Historically, filters were evaluated using standard laboratory tests that do not necessarily reflect real world driving conditions where cyclic flow and vibration are common phenomena. There is also a trend toward fuel system flexibility which helps manufacturers integrate multiple functions into a fuel filter module. A modular design is a cost effective means for providing a variety of performance features which allows individualization of the fuel filtration system.

AB  - Although acclaimed as a biofuel crop with high potential to sustainably replace fossil fuels, Jatropha curcas L. remains a poorly studied plant. Reliable yield assessments with conventional methods require agroclimatic and physiological knowledge, which is not yet available for Jatropha. To fill this gap, we tested a novel two-step approach integrating knowledge from biogeography and population biology with available Jatropha field data. In the first step, using MaxEnt, a widely implemented model in biogeography, we predicted Jatropha fitness in response to climate by relating natural occurrence recorded in herbaria with bioclimatic geodatasets. In the second step, we relied on population biology principles supported by seed mass addition experiments to relate fitness to reproductive potential, hence seed yield. Jatropha seed yield in response to climate was mapped worldwide for actual (1950-2000 average) and future (2020) climate conditions. The modelled Jatropha seed yield was validated against a set of on-field yield assessments (R2=0.67, P&lt;0.001). The discrepancies between estimated and measured yields were partially explained by model uncertainties, as quantified by the sensitivity analysis of our modelling (R2=0.57, P=0.001). Jatropha has a pan-tropical distribution, plus specific adaptability to hot temperate areas. Climate variables most significantly affecting modelled yield response were annual average temperature, minimum temperature, annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In recent years, the areas cultivated with physic nut (Jatropha curcas) have expanded in Brazil, aiming at its use in biofuel production. However, one of the problems faced by the producers is the lack of studies on its tolerance to the herbicides registered in Brazil. The objective of this work was to evaluate the tolerance of physic nut genotypes to herbicides applied at pre-emergence. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design, with four replications, in a factorial design, 3 × 6. Factor A was composed by the genotypes (Filomena, Gonçalo and Paraguaçu), and factor B by the herbicides (isoxaflutole, oxyfluorfen, sulfentrazone, pendimethalin and tebuthiuron), plus one non-treated control. Intoxication by the herbicides was evaluated at 19, 32, 40, 48, 56 and 64 days after treatments (DAT). Height, leaf area, and plant dry matter were evaluated at 64 DAT. It was verified that the jatropha genotypes have different tolerance to the herbicides studied. Isoxaflutole and tebuthiuron caused severe injuries to all genotypes and negatively affected all the variables evaluated. On the other hand, oxyfluorfen and pendimethalin proved to be selective to the crop and should be evaluated in further studies to be recommended to the crop.

AB  - Biodiesel is the name of a clean burning alternative fuel produced from domestic, renewable resources and it can be blended at any level with petroleum diesel to create a biodiesel blend and can be used in compression ignition (diesel) engines with no major modifications. The oil obtained from the seeds of Pongamia pinnata holds promise as fuel used as alternative for diesel. The plant has a variety of uses, but its economic exploitation has remained neglected for long time. Survey of Pongamia pinnata plant at the study area was conducted during JanuarySeptember 2007 to know the density of the species and impact of morphological characteristics on the yield efficiency of the species. Since, lot of wasteland (4631 hectares) was found in the study area (Bhadravathi taluk), recognition of the potential use of these species as a source of biofuels and in wasteland reclamation has got promising scope. This paper reflects on the ecological and economical benefits of Pongamia pinnata as an energy source in the study area.

AB  - The increased demand for biodiesel feedstock encourages producers to expand areas seeded to oilseed crops. Vegetable oil from canola-grade feedstock ranks among the best in the production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME or bio- diesel). FAME produced from canola-quality oilseed grown on salt-affected lands offer new opportunities for increased production and can counter fuel-versus-food concerns, provided that the biodiesel product meets quality standards. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has set the North American fuel quality standards (D6751) for 100% biodiesel (B100) to be blended with petrodiesel fuel. Canola-quality feedstock yields oil low in free fatty acids, i.e., acids that are not bonded to parent oil molecules. These free acids may negatively affect diesel engine components, especially at biodiesel oil blends greater than 20%. In addition, solid and dissolved impurities, alkali/alkaline earth metals, and oxidation stability are of concern to fuel injection equipment manufacturers. Ultimately, purity, composition, and biodiesel utility depend on the quality of the feedstock supplied. Transesterification and washing to produce biodiesel can improve purity, but these processes normally do not alter fatty acid composition. Contaminants in biodiesel fuel may include water, sediment, S, P, K, Na, Ca, Mg, carbon residue, and various other constituents in the fuel's sulfated ash. Canterra 1818 canola feedstock grown on negligibly, slightly, moderately, and severely salinized soil was crushed and tested for biodiesel fuel quality. All samples yielded biofuel within the ASTM specifications except for free glycerol in the negligibly saline sample. © 2010 ASABE ISSN.

AB  - Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz is one of the most promising crops for biofuel `production, which can be grown on less fertile soils than oilseed rape. To validate this proposition, research was carried out in the crop rotation of the Vėžaičiai Branch of the Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture and Forestry during 2008-2009 on a Bathihypogleyi-Dystric Albeluvisol (ABd-gld-w). We explored the effects of nitrogen fertilisers (N0, N30, N60, N90 and N120), sowing time (as soon as soil conditions allow, 5 days later and 10 days later) and seed rates (6, 8 and 10 kg ha-1) on Camelina seed yield and yield components. Camelina seed yield was found to depend on nitrogen fertilisation, sowing time and weather conditions. During 2008-2009, the seed yield of the Camelina variety 'Borowska' ranged from 0.38 t ha-1 in unfertilised plots to 0.83 t ha-1 in the plots applied with N60. Nitrogen fertilisation increased the yield by 1.1-1.6 times (in 2008) and by 1.4-2.2 times (in 2009), compared to that in unfertilised plots. The highest seed yield (0.67 and 0.74 t ha-1) was achieved for the first (28 04 and 08 04) sowing date with a seed rate of 8 kg ha-1, due to the highest number of plants m-2 (in 2008) and the highest number of branches per plant and 1000 seed weight (in 2009). Increased seed rate did not cover the decrease in seed yield when sowing had been delayed. The relatively low Camelina seed yield in Western Lithuania region resulted from the unfavourable weather conditions, i.e. droughts which persisted throughout the spring season.

AB  - Opportunities for further developments in biofuels for diesel engines are discussed with the aim to use them also in modern and even future diesel engine generations. For this purpose, the actual problems with biofuels are discussed. For the neat fuel, the high boiling curve is the main obstacle to use this fuel in modern passenger cars with particle filter. With blends, problems are encountered when the biogenic share is in the range of 10 to 20 % and the fuel is aged, which means oxidized. Then oligomers are formed that precipitate as sediments and can lead to filter blocking or undesirable combustion products in the exhaust gas. In this case one can try, by means of polar solvents, like alcohols, to resolve the sediments or to prevent the oligomers from sedimentation. In case of the neat fuel, we are actually carrying out a research project in which a catalytic shortening of the fatty acids by a so-called metathesis reaction is applied. This should lead to fuels with improved boiling behavior.

AB  - Biodiesel, bioethanol and biogas are the most important alternative fuels produced by using biologic origin sources. Effect of biofuel on engine performance is one of the research subjects of today. The engine experiments to test the engines are many times are hard, time consuming and high cost. Additionally, it is impossible to perform the test outside of limiting values. In this study, an artificial neural network, an artificial intelligence technique, is developed to successfully apply on automotive sector as well as many different areas of technology aiming to overcome difficulties of the experiments, minimize the cost, time and workforce waste. Diesel fuel, biodiesel, B20 and bioethanol-diesel fuel having different percentages (5%, 10%, and 15%) and biodiesel were mixed together, to use in developed artificial neural network. Mixtures were also controlled for their fuel properties and motor experiments were performed to collect the reference values. Power, moment, hourly fuel consumption and specific fuel consumption were estimated by using the artificial neural network developed by using the reference values. Estimated values and experiment results are compared. As a result, from the performed statistical analyses, it is seen that realized artificial intelligence model is an appropriate model to estimate the performance of the engine used in the experiments. Reliability value is calculated as 99.94% (p = 0.9994 and p > 0.05) by using statistical analyses. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Copaiba (Copaifera officinalis) is a tropical plant that is also known as the 'diesel tree', previously noted for production of diesel-like oleoresin. The advancements in molecular tools such as expressed sequence tag (EST) library construction provide a novel opportunity for insight into the physiology of this tree. We generated a small set of ESTs for a young copaiba, sequencing and annotating a total of 613 unigenes. Of these, 84% showed similarity to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. Annotation showed 70% of unigenes had at least one associated Gene Ontology (GO) term. We found a majority of ESTs to be associated with heat response genes. Based on these data, this EST library of C. officinalis represents a small but important step in helping to understand the general physiology and heatresponse expression patterns. Additionally, this small collection of EST offers a modest starting point in helping to understand this enigmatic tropical plant. © 2010 The Japanese Society for Plant Cell and Molecular Biology.

AB  - One of the priorities of the European Union is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to contribute significantly to climate change mitigation. The aim of this paper is to analyze consumers' valuation of one type of renewable energy which is important to reach the European emission reduction targets, biodiesel, and to assess the extra price consumers are willing to pay to use biodiesel instead of conventional diesel. In order to achieve these goals, a market survey has been carried out in Aragón (Spain) to collect primary data from diesel consumers. A choice experiment has been used to assess willingness to pay for biodiesel. Results suggest that the consumers' level of knowledge of biodiesel is not very high although consumers' perception of the product is quite favourable because they believe biodiesel is less pollutant and reduces greenhouse gas emissions, compared to conventional diesel. Actual consumption of biodiesel is still very low. However, consumers are willing to pay 5% extra to fill up with biodiesel instead of its conventional counterpart.

AB  - Control of transient emissions from turbocharged diesel engines is an important objective for automotive manufacturers, since stringent criteria for exhaust emission levels must be met as dictated by the legislated transient cycles. On the other hand, bio-fuels are getting impetus today as renewable substitutes for conventional fuels (diesel fuel or gasoline), especially in the transport domain. In the present work, experimental tests are conducted on a turbocharged truck diesel engine in order to investigate the formation mechanism of NO (nitric oxide) and smoke under various accelerating schedules experienced during daily driving conditions. To this aim, a fully instrumented test bed was set up in order to capture the development of key engine and turbocharger variables during the transient events using ultra-fast response instrumentation for the instantaneous measurement of the exhaust NO and smoke opacity. Apart from the baseline diesel fuel, the engine was operated with a blend of diesel fuel with 30% bio-diesel, and a blend of diesel fuel with 25% n-butanol. Analytical diagrams are provided to explain the behavior of emissions development in conjunction with turbocharger and fueling response. Unsurprisingly, turbocharger lag was found to be the main culprit for the emissions spikes during all test cases examined. The differences in the measured exhaust emissions of the two bio-fuel/diesel fuel blends, both leading to serious smoke reductions but also NO increases compared with the baseline operation of the engine were determined and compared. The differing physical and chemical properties of bio-diesel and n-butanol against those of the diesel fuel, together with the formation mechanisms of NO and soot were used for the analysis and interpretation of the experimental findings concerning transient emissions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - According to the proposed National Mission on Biodiesel in India, we have undertaken studies on the oxidative stability of biodiesel synthesized from tree borne non-edible oil seeds jatropha. Neat jatropha biodiesel exhibited oxidation stability of 3.95 h and research was conducted to investigate the influence of natural and synthetic antioxidants on the oxidation stability of jatropha methyl ester. Antioxidants namely α-tocopherol, tert-butylated hydroxytoluene, tert-butylated phenol derivative, octylated butylated diphenyl amine, and tert-butylhydroxquinone were doped to improve the oxidation stability. It was found that both types of antioxidants showed beneficial effects in increasing the oxidation stability of jatropha methyl ester, but comparatively, the synthetic antioxidants were found to be more effective. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biogas from anaerobic digestion of biological wastes is a renewable energy resource. It has been used to provide heat, shaft power and electricity. Typical biogas contains 50-65% methane (CH4), 30-45% carbon dioxide (CO2), moisture and traces of hydrogen sulphide (H2S). Presence of CO2 and H2S in biogas affects engine performance adversely. Reducing CO2 and H2S content will significantly improve quality of biogas. In this work, a method for biogas scrubbing and CH4 enrichment is presented. Chemical absorption of CO2 and H2S by aqueous solutions in a packed column was experimentally investigated. The aqueous solutions employed were sodium hydroxide (NaOH), calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) and mono-ethanolamine (MEA). Liquid solvents were circulated through the column, contacting the biogas in countercurrent flow. Absorption characteristics were examined. Test results revealed that the aqueous solutions used were effective in reacting with CO2 in biogas (over 90% removal efficiency), creating CH4 enriched fuel. H2S was removed to below the detection limit. Absorption capability was transient in nature. Saturation was reached in about 50min for Ca(OH)2, and 100min for NaOH and MEA, respectively. With regular replacement or regeneration of used solutions, upgraded biogas can be maintained. This technique proved to be promising in upgrading biogas quality. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In order to realize a premixed compression ignition (PCI) engine, the effects of bioethanol-gas oil blends and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on PM-NO. x trade-off have been investigated focusing on ignition delay, premixed combustion, diffusion combustion, smoke, NO. x and thermal efficiency. The present experiment was done by increasing the ethanol blend ratio and ethanol and by increasing the EGR ratio in a single cylinder direct injection diesel engine. It is found that a remarkable improvement in PM-NO. x trade-off can be achieved by promoting the premixing based on the ethanol blend fuel having low evaporation temperature, large latent heat and low cetane number as well, in addition, based on a marked elongation of ignition delay due to the low cetane number fuel and the low oxygen intake charge. As a result, very low levels of NO. x and PM, which satisfies the 2009 emission standards imposed on heavy duty diesel engines in Japan, were achieved without deterioration of brake thermal efficiency in the PCI engine fuelled with the 50% ethanol blend diesel fuel and the high EGR ratio. It is noticed that smoke can be reduced even by increasing the EGR ratio under the highly premixed condition. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - High heating value (HHV) is an important property which characterises the energy content of a fuel such as solid, liquid and gaseous fuels. The previous assertion is particularly important for vegetable oils and biodiesels fuels which are expected to replace fossil oils. Estimation of the HHV of vegetable oils and biodiesels by using their fatty acid composition is the aim of this paper. The comparison between the HHVs predicted by the method and those obtained experimentally gives an average bias error of -0.84% and an average absolute error of 1.71%. These values show the utility, the validity and the applicability of the method to vegetable oils and their derivatives. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The relative influence of source categories of aerosols that affect atmospheric extinction is analyzed by evaluating the potential source contribution function (PSCF) based source regions of the positive matrix factorization (PMF) estimated factors against satellite retrievals of aerosol index and active fires and combining with emission inventory information. This approach has been applied to aerosol chemical data obtained from the integrated campaign undertaken during March-May 2006: Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, Gases and Radiation Budget (ICARB). Four source categories were identified: dust, nitrate-and-dust, biomass-and-fossil combustion, and secondary species. The relative influence of dust and nitrate-and-dust was higher during north-south transport from west Asia over the Arabian Sea during the period of campaign, coincident with highs in the spatial distribution of Ultraviolet Aerosol Index (UVAI) from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), implying dust-nitrate association in the outflow from west Asia. The relative influence of anthropogenic sources (biomass-and-fossil combustion and secondary species) was higher over Bay of Bengal during March-April 2006. High fire frequency from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), coincident with the probable source regions identified in the central Indo-Gangetic plain and central India (south of 27N), indicates influence of biomass burning source. The biomass-and-fossil combustion factor arising from biofuel, crop residue, and forest fires is evident by their large emission flux rather than from industrial sources in the probable source regions associated with this factor. In contrast, thermal power plant and industries largely influenced the secondary species factor. This approach provides verification of source categories identified through PMF against active sources from satellite remote sensing and provides an estimate of their relative strength based on emission inventory information. © Copyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.

AB  - Several solid acid catalysts are prepared and compared in upgrading bio-oil using ethanol and acetic acid as raw materials through the catalytic esterification reaction model. The SO4 2-/SiO 2-TiO2 catalyst in the optimum experimental conditions achieved higher catalytic activity. The bio-oil was stabilized by ester reaction over SO4 2-/SiO2-TiO2 catalyst in the conditioned experiment with lowered dynamic viscosity and enhanced fluidity, which was sustained after aging for 6 months in a refrigerator under about 5 °C. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the composition before and after the catalytic esterification proved that the proportion of esters in the upgraded bio-oils increased remarkably, suggesting that the catalytic esterification can vary the composition and properties obviously thus enhances the stability of bio-oil. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper the problem is discussed of supplying high power diesel engines with biofuels in the aspect of consequences which occurr during their operation. Attention was paid to advantages and difficulties associated with application of biofuels to self-ignition engines. A relevant research problem was characterized and research targets were proposed to make it possible to most favourably shape energy merits of the engines. Special attention was given to wear process of such engines and their failures resulting from application of biofuels. The following problems were also considered: calcium carbonate sedimentation, closing graphite platelets in structure of cylider bearing surface and surface defects of piston rings made of aluminium bronze. It was demonstrated that to assess operation of the engines is possible under the assumption that in a valuating approach their operation can be compared to a physical quantity represented numerically and measured with the use of the joule*sec unit. Conclusions resulting from the domestic and foreign investigations on power and reliability of such engines were also presented.

AB  - Transesterified vegetable oil (biodiesel) has recently attracted enormous attention all over the world as an alternative fuel for diesel engines because of its renewability. Biodiesel can be produced from renewable sources such as vegetable oil, animal fat and used cooking oil. Currently, the cost of biodiesel is high as compared to conventional diesel oil because most of the biodiesel is produced from pure vegetable oil. However, the cost of biodiesel can be reduced by using low cost feedstock such as animal fat and used cooking oil. This paper reviews the work that has already been done in technologies for biodiesel production from used cooking oil. The fuel properties of biodiesel from used cooking oil were also reviewed and compared with conventional diesel oil. In addition, biodiesel specifications provided by different countries were also presented. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The relatively high cost of refined oils render the resulting fuels unable to compete with petroleum derived fuel. In this study, biodiesel is prepared from palm fatty acid (PFA) which is a by-product of palm oil refinery. The process conditions were optimized for production of palm fatty acid methyl esters. A maximum conversion of 94.4% was obtained using two step trans-esterification with 1:10 molar ratio of oil to methanol at 65°C. Sulfuric acid and Sodium hydroxide were used as acid and base catalyst respectively. The composition of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) obtained was similar to that of palm oil. The biodiesel produced met the established specifications of biodiesel of American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). The kinetics of the trans-esterification reaction was also studied and the data reveals that the reaction is of first order in fatty acid and methanol (MeOH) and over all the reaction is of second order. © 2010 by Japan Oil Chemists' Society.

AB  - The objective of this work was to study the potentialities of Dipteryx lacunifera Ducke seeds oil for biodiesel production. The yield in oil was of 46.11 ± 0.37%. Methyl biodiesel was prepared by base catalyzed transesterification yielding 88.13% and percentage conversion of triglycerides to corresponding methyl ester of 89.1%. The addition of the tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ, 50 ppm), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT, 50 ppm) and cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL, 2000 ppm) antioxidants in the biodiesel contributed to the increase of the induction period of 2.97 h for 8.08; 6.06 and 6.02 h, respectively.

AB  - With the increasing attention to the environmental impact of discharging greenhouses gases, there has been a growing public pressure to reduce the carbon footprint associated with the use of fossil fuels. In this context, one of the key strategies is the substitution of fossil fuels with biofuels such as biodiesel. The design of biodiesel production facilities has traditionally been carried out based on technical and economic criteria. Greenhouse gas (GHG) policies (e.g., carbon tax, subsidy) have the potential to significantly alter the design of these facilities, the selection of the feedstocks, and the scheduling of multiple feedstocks. The objective of this article is to develop a systematic approach to the design and scheduling of biodiesel production processes while accounting for the effect of GHG policies in addition to the technical, economic, and environmental aspects. An optimization formulation is developed to maximize the profit of the process subject to flowsheet synthesis and performance modeling equations. Furthermore, the carbon footprint is accounted for with the help of a life cycle analysis (LCA). The objective function includes a term which reflects the impact of the LCA of a feedstock and its processing to biodiesel. A multiperiod approach is used to discretize the decision- making horizon into time periods. During each period, decisions are made on the type and flowrate of the feedstocks, as well as the associated design and operating variables. A case study is solved with several scenarios of feedstocks and GHG policies. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

AB  - Antioxidants are an alternative to prevent or slow the degradation of the biofuel. In this study, it was evaluated the oxidative stability of B100 biodiesel from soybean oil in the presence of three commercial synthetic antioxidants, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), pure or blended, from the experimental design of simplex-centroid mixture. The reaction order and rate constant were also calculated for all tests. The treatment containing pure TBHQ proved to be the most effective, proven by design, the optimum mix obtained and the rate constant. Binary and ternary mixtures containing TBHQ also showed appreciable antioxidant effect.

AB  - MixAlco is a robust process that converts biomass to fuels and chemicals. A key feature of the MixAlco process is the fermentation, which employs a mixed culture of acid-forming microorganisms to convert biomass components (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) to carboxylate salts. Subsequently, these intermediate salts are chemically converted to hydrocarbon fuels (gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel). This work focuses on process synthesis, simulation, integration, and cost estimation of the MixAlco process. For the base-case capacity of 40 dry tonne feedstock per hour, the total capital investment is US $5.54/annual gallon of hydrocarbon fuels (US $3.79/annual gallon of ethanol equivalent), and the minimum selling price [with 10% return on investment (ROI), internal hydrogen production, and US $60/tonne biomass] is US $ 2.56/gal hydrocarbon, which is equivalent to US $ 1.75/gal ethanol. If plant capacity is increased to 400 tph, the minimum selling price of biomass-derived hydrocarbon fuels is US $1.76/gal hydrocarbon (US $1.20/gal ethanol equivalent), which can compete without subsidies with petroleum-derived hydrocarbons when crude oil sells for about US $65/bbl. At 40 tph, using the average tipping fee for municipal solid waste (US $45/dry tonne) and current price of external hydrogen (US $1/kg), the minimum selling price is only US $1.24/gal hydrocarbon (US $0.85/gal ethanol equivalent). © 2010 Society for Industrial Microbiology.

AB  - Biodiesel is one of the new possible substitutes of regular fuel for engines and is produced from different vegetable oils or animal fats. The main reaction involved is the transesterification of triglycerides into esters. The employment of low quality or waste raw materials has been considered to strongly improve the economic competitiveness of this biofuel with respect to the petroleum-derived diesel. In the case of waste raw materials characterized by a high content of Free Fatty Acids (FFAs), direct esterification of the FFAs is the primary route for producing biodiesel. The novel sustainable esterification process based on catalytic Reactive Distillation Column (RDC) has been proposed to overcome the shortcomings in the conventional process. A reliable kinetic model which would be applicable in a wide range of operating conditions is an important data for the RDC design. In the present study, kinetics of heterogeneous catalyzed direct fatty acid esterification was studied with a tungstated zirconia catalyst in a stirred batch reactor to synthesis biodiesel. The waste cooking oil with high content of FFAs was simulated by mixing pure oleic acid with refined palm oil. Ethanol was used in the experiments instead of methanol because it is less toxic and safer to handle. The effects of the main variables involved in the process such as reaction temperature, amount of catalyst, amount of triglyceride and the molar ratio of alcohol/free fatty acid were analyzed. The experimental data were interpreted with a second order, pseudo homogeneous kinetic model and a good agreement between experimental data and the model is obtained. © 2010 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

AB  - The hydrotreatment of bio-oil, which obtained from fast pyrolysis of pine sawdust, was investigated over MoNi/c-Al2O3 catalyst under mild conditions (373 K, 3 MPa hydrogen pressure). Acetic acid was taken as a model compound to investigate the effects of Mo promoter contents and reducing temperatures of catalysts on the catalysts activity under the condition of 473 K and 3 MPa hydrogen pressure. X-ray diffraction and temperature programmed reduction showed that the addition of Mo promoter benefited the uniformity of nickel species and inhibited the formation of NiAl2O4 spinel in the catalysts. The GC spectrum of liquid products showed the mechanism of the model reaction. The maximum conversion of acetic acid (33.20%) was attained over 0.06MoNi/γ-Al2O3 catalysts being reduced at 873 K. This catalyst was chosen for the upgrading of raw bio-oil. After the upgrading process, the pH value of the bio-oil increased from 2.33 to 2.77. The water content increased from 35.52 wt.% to 41.55 wt.% and the gross calorific value increased from 13.96 MJ/kg to 14.17 MJ/kg. The hydrogen content in the bio-oil increased from 6.25 wt.% to 6.95 wt.%. The product properties of the upgraded bio-oil, particularly the hydrogen content and the acidity were considerably improved. The results of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that both hydrotreatment and esterification had happened over 0.06MoNi/γ-Al2O3 (873) catalyst during the upgrading process. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many organizations interested in renewable, domestic energy have switched from petroleum diesel to biodiesel blends for use in transportation and heavy-duty equipment. Although considerable evidence exists on the negative health effects of petroleum diesel exhaust exposures in occupational settings, there has been little research examining biodiesel exposures. Working collaboratively with a local municipality, concentrations of particulate matter (PM) and other air toxics were measured at a recycling facility in southwestern New Hampshire while heavy equipment operated first on petroleum diesel and then on a B20 blend (20% soy-based biodiesel/80% petroleum diesel). This pilot study used a combination of established industrial hygiene and environmental air monitoring methods to estimate occupational exposure profiles to PM and air toxics from combustion of petroleum diesel and biodiesel. Results indicate that B20 use dramatically reduces work area respirable particle, PM2.5 (PM ≤2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter), and formaldehyde levels compared with petroleum diesel. Some volatile organic compound concentrations were higher for petroleum diesel and others were higher for the B20 blend. Overall, this study suggests that biodiesel blends reduce worker exposure to and health risk from petroleum diesel exhaust, but additional exposure research is recommended.

AB  - Galvanic corrosion of zamak was evaluated in alcohol fuel and in some alcoholic solutions that contained ionic impurities. Also, the effect of corrosive process on the quality parameters of ethanol was investigated. The results showed that corrosion of zamak mainly occurred in solutions with high levels of water and impurities. After the assays, the increasing of both pH and conductivity of the alcohols was observed. Therefore, the results showed that the contact between zamak and some materials must be avoided and the quality control of alcohol fuel must be assured as a way of avoiding damages on engines and storagetransportation fuels systems. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ozonation of vegetable oils and fatty acids is a convenient oxidation process that has been used to prepare various value-added intermediates and products for industrial applications. Unlike other oxidation routes, ozone is produced on-site eliminating issues related to transportation and storage of the oxidation agent. Furthermore, any residual ozone quickly decomposes back to oxygen such that no special work-up procedures are needed to remove waste byproducts from the reaction mixture. The general process is initiated with the attack of ozone on the double bonds and the formation of ozonide intermediates. Various methods are then described in the patent literature where these intermediates are decomposed and reacted via different routes to produce carboxylic acids and esters, polyols, aldehydes, biodiesel and biofuel additives, as well as methods to stabilize and use these intermediates as disinfectants and other pharmaceutical agents. Although this oxidation process has been known for many years, a renewed interest is apparent from the increase in the number of patents in recent years. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

AB  - For several years, UE has been trying to increase the use of biofuels to replace petrol or diesel in the transports with the aim of fulfilling a commitment about climate change, supplying enviromentally friendly conditions, promoting renewable energy sources. To achieve this, the 2003/30/EC Directive states that in all the European countries, before 31st December 2010, at least 5.75% of all petrol and diesel fuels used for transport are biofuels. In previous papers, the authors evaluated this possibility. Analyzing hydrogen as replacement of fossil fuels and biofuels nowadays in Spain on a technical, economic and point of view is the aim of this paper.

AB  - Production of recombinant Oryza sativa non-symbiotic hemoglobin 1 (OsHb1) by Escherichia coli was maximized in shake-flask cultures in media containing tryptone, yeast extract, sodium chloride and byproduct glycerol from biodiesel production. Response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), followed by multiple response optimization through a desirability function were applied to evaluate the amount of OsHb1 produced. The results obtained by the application of ANNs were more reliable since better statistical parameters were obtained. The optimal conditions were (g L-1), tryptone, 42.69; yeast extract, 20.11; sodium chloride, 17.77; and byproduct glycerol, 0.33. A maximum recombinant protein concentration of 3.50 g L-1 and a minimum biomass concentration of 18.48 g L -1 were obtained under these conditions. Although the concentrations of tryptone, yeast extract and sodium chloride are relatively high, the increase in the yield with respect to biomass formed (YP/X) overcomes this disadvantage. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The investigation of alternative sources of triglycerides suitable for the synthesis of biodiesel, obtained from species adapted to semi-arid lands is currently a very important challenge for Brazilian researchers. In this work we carried out studies with the fruits of the Syagrus coronate (Mart.) Becc., popularly known in Brazil as " licuri" or " ouricuri" The aim of this study was the evaluation of some properties and chemical composition of the oil, as well to explore their potential application in biodiesel production. The oil was obtained from the fruit, with yields of 39% (mass%). The crude oil of the S. coronata was transesterified, using a conventional catalysts and methanol, to obtain biodiesel. The properties of the biodiesel produced are comparable with those commonly accepted for use as biodiesel. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The world is looking for changes in its energetic matrix through the use of biofuels to reduce the dependence on oil derivatives. Currently, the number of studies concerning mixtures of triglycerides from animals or plants with diesel fuel has risen due to efforts to reduce the consumption of diesel oil. This paper studies the behavior of the density of plant oils mixed with diesel fuel in relation to temperature, which is essential to guarantee engine efficiency. The density is related to the mass and to the volume being a critical property to the assessment of the subministered energy to the engine by the injection system, which behaves like a pump of positive displacement. Samples of the diesel fuel mixture were made with plant triglycerides in proportion and range of ̃5-20%. The densities of the samples were measured in a density meter with temperature varying between 18 and 25°C, as well as at 15°C, according to ASTM standard. Afterwards, the uncertainties of measurement were calculated, and the density change with respect to temperature is presented and shown in density variation curves. An analysis of the density variation curves shows that. Copyright © 2010 by ASTM International.

AB  - Swedish Environmental Class One (MK1) diesel fuel and three diesel substitutes were compared during steady state conditions, during transients and during work operations commonly performed by tractors and construction equipment. This was carried out in order to determine how fuel, typical engine load/speed and transient effects influence emissions and engine efficiency during common work operations.The results showed that the differences between the fuels were small, except for particulates. Differences in typical engine load/speed and transients effects could; however, cause emissions to vary between 0.5 and 3 times those expected from the current (steady state) ISO 8178C1 cycle, whilst the fuel consumption was only moderately affected. Transient effects appeared to be able to double the emissions. © 2010.

AB  - The discussion on the promotion of biofuels is ambiguous: on the one hand benefits like reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and increase of energy supply security are expected, on the other hand low effectiveness with respect to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and high costs are being criticized. The core objective of this paper is to investigate the market prospects of biofuels for transport in the EU in a dynamic framework till 2030. The major results of this analysis are: (i) Under current policy conditions - mainly exemption of excise taxes - the economic prospects of 1st generation biofuels in Europe are rather promising; the major problems of 1st generation biofuels are lack of available land for feedstocks and the modest ecological performance; (ii) Large expectations are currently put into advanced 2nd generation biofuels production from lignocellulosic materials. With respect to the future costs development of 2nd generation biofuels, currently it can only be stated that in a favourable case by 2030 they will be close to the costs of 1st generation biofuels. However, because of the increasing prices for fossil gasoline and diesel in all international scenarios - given remaining tax exemptions - biofuels will become competitive already in the next few years. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - When evaluating the production of renewable energies such as biofuels, it is necessary to include in the assessment the resource inputs, capital, labor investment and environmental remediation costs. Extended Exergy Accounting (EEA) is a system analysis method that calculates, on the basis of detailed mass and exergy balances, the total amount of primary exergy resources necessary to obtain a product or service. The conceptual novelty of EEA is represented by the fact that it also includes externalities (capital, labor and environmental impact) measured in homogeneous units (Joules). As an illustration of EEA, we assess and compare the production of 1 ton of biodiesel from used cooking oil (UCOME) and rapeseed crops (RME). The extended exergy "content" of UCOME and RME are 51.90. GJ and 77.05. GJ respectively. The production of UCOME uses 25.15. GJ less resources (materials and energy) and requires lower total investments and environmental remediation costs than that of RME. On the other hand, UCOME requires 35% more workhours. In summary, the extended exergy of UCOME is about 1.5 the extended exergy content of RME. Thus, we can conclude that biodiesel production from UCO is less resource use intensive than the production from RME. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Various biofuels, including bioethanol and biodiesel are technologically being considered replacements for fossil fuels, such as the conventional gasoline and diesel. This paper aims to measure whether economic substitutability can be generated during periods of higher and/or lower prices of crude oil. The empirical results of the bivariate EGARCH model prove that this substitutive effect was occurred during the higher crude oil price period due to the significant price spillover effects from crude oil futures to corn and soybean futures, indicating that the increase in food prices can be attributed to more consumption of biofuels. We suggest more extensive research in the search for fuel alternatives from inedible feedstock such as pongamia, jojoba, jatropha, especially the 2nd generation biofuel technologies such as algae-based biofuels. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Today's society relies heavily on fossil fuels as a main energy source. Global energy demand increase, energy security and climate change are the main drivers of the transition towards alternative energy sources. This paper analyses algal biodiesel production for the EU road transportation and compares it to the fossil fuels and 1st generation biofuels. A cost-effectiveness analysis was used to aggregate private and external costs and derive the social cost of each fuel. The following externalities were internalized: emissions (GHG and non-GHG), food prices impact, pesticides/fertilizers use and security of supply. Currently the social cost of producing algal biodiesel at 52.3 € GJ-1 is higher than rapeseed biodiesel (36.0 € GJ-1) and fossil fuels (15.8 € GJ-1). Biotechnology development, high crude oil prices and high carbon value are the key features of the scenario where algal biodiesel outcompetes all other fuels. A substantial investment into the biotechnology sector and comprehensive environmental research and policy are required to make that scenario a reality. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Today in most European member states diesel contains up to 5% vol biodiesel. Since blending is expected to increase to 10% vol, the question arises, how this higher mixing ratio will affect tailpipe emissions particularly those linked to adverse health effects. This paper focuses on the impact of biodiesel on carbonyl compound emissions, attempting also to identify possible relationship between biodiesel feedstock and emissions. The blends were produced from five different feedstocks, commonly used in Europe. Measurements were conducted on a Euro 3 common-rail passenger car over various driving cycles. Results indicate that generally the use of biodiesel at low concentrations has a minor effect on carbonyl compound emissions. However, certain biodiesels resulted in significant increases while others led to decreases. Biodiesels associated with increases were those derived from rapeseed oil (approx. 200%) and palm oil (approx. 180%), with the highest average increases observed at formaldehyde and acroleine/acetone. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, parameters affecting castor oil transesterification reaction were investigated. Applying four basic catalysts including NaOCH3, NaOH, KOCH3 and KOH the best one with maximum biodiesel yield was identified. Using Taguchi method consisting four parameters and three levels, the best experimental conditions were determined. Reaction temperature (25, 65 and 80°C), mixing intensity (250, 400 and 600rpm), alcohol/oil ratio (4:1, 6:1 and 8:1) and catalyst concentration (0.25, 0.35 and 0.5%) were selected as experimental parameters. It was concluded that reaction temperature and mixing intensity can be optimized. Using the optimum results, we proposed a kinetic model which resulted in establishing an equation for the beginning rate of transesterification reaction. Furthermore, applying ASTM D 976 correlation, minimum cetane number of produced biodiesel was determined as 37.1. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Anhydrous ethanol is one of the biofuels produced today and it is a subset of renewable energy. It is considered to be an excellent alternative clean-burning fuel to gasoline. Anhydrous ethanol is commercially produced by either catalytic hydration of ethylene or fermentation of biomass. Any biological material that has sugar, starch or cellulose can be used as biomass for producing anhydrous ethanol. Since ethanol-water solution forms a minimum-boiling azeotrope of composition of 89.4 mol% ethanol and 10.6 mol% water at 78.2°C and standard atmospheric pressure, the dilute ethanol-water solutions produced by fermentation process can be continuously rectified to give at best solutions containing 89.4 mol% ethanol at standard atmospheric pressure. Therefore, special process for removal of the remaining water is required for manufacture of anhydrous ethanol. Various processes for producing anhydrous ethanol have been used/suggested. These include: (i) chemical dehydration process, (ii) dehydration by vacuum distillation process, (iii) azeotropic distillation process, (iv) extractive distillation processes, (v) membrane processes, (vi) adsorption processes and (vii) diffusion distillation process. These processes of manufacturing anhydrous ethanol have been improved continuously due to the increasingly strict requirements for quantity and quality of this product. The literature available on these processes is reviewed. These processes are also compared on the basis of energy requirements. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study is to show the impact of different assumptions and methodological choices on the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) performance of biofuels by providing the results for different key parameters on a consistent basis. These include co-products allocation or system expansion, N2O emissions from crop cultivation, conversion systems and co-product applications and direct land-use change emissions. The results show that the GHG performance of biofuels varies depending on the method applied and the system boundaries selected. Key factors include selected allocation procedures and the location of production and related yields, reference land and soil N2O emissions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. will be cultivated in large parts of the central highlands of Chiapas (México) so that its seeds can be extracted for biofuel. Little is known how the cultivation of J. curcas, which contains phorbolesters, might affect soil processes. Soil was sampled at five locations and amended with leaves of J. curcas while dynamics of ammonium (NH4 +), nitrite (NO2 -) and nitrate (NO3 -) and emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), well known greenhouse gasses, were monitored. If we considered no priming effect, then between 12 and 31% of the C added with Jatropha leaves mineralized within 56 days. However, the concentration of mineral N (sum of NH4 +, NO2 - and NO3 -) did not increase in the Jatropha-amended soils compared to the unamended soils. The mean CO2 emission rate increased significantly 3.7 times when Jatropha leaves were added to the different soils. The N2O emission was low in the unamended soil and remained &lt;5μgN2O-Nkg-1. Application of J. curcas leaves increased the N2O emission rate significantly in two soils, but not in the other three. Oxidation of CH4 occurred in each of the unamended soils with the fastest decrease generally found within the first day. Application of Jatropha leaves had no significant effect on oxidation of CH4, except in one soil. It was found that application of Jatropha leaves did increase emission of CO2, did not affect the soil mineral N content and had only an increasing effect on emission of N2O and oxidation of CH4 in some soils. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) may offer a potential near term, low-carbon alternative to today's gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles. A representative vehicle technology that runs on electricity in addition to conventional fuels was introduced into the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model as a perfect substitute for internal combustion engine (ICE-only) vehicles in two likely early-adopting markets, the United States and Japan. We investigate the effect of relative vehicle cost and all-electric range on the timing of PHEV market entry in the presence and absence of an advanced cellulosic biofuels technology and a strong (450ppm) economy-wide carbon constraint. Vehicle cost could be a significant barrier to PHEV entry unless fairly aggressive goals for reducing battery costs are met. If a low-cost PHEV is available we find that its adoption has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions, refined oil demand, and under a carbon policy the required CO2 price in both the United States and Japan. The emissions reduction potential of PHEV adoption depends on the carbon intensity of electric power generation. Thus, the technology is much more effective in reducing CO2 emissions if adoption occurs under an economy-wide cap and trade system that also encourages low-carbon electricity generation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bio fuels and conventional fuels differ in terms of their evaporation rates, permeation rates, and exhaust emissions, which can alter exposures of workers, especially those in the fuel refining and distribution industries. This study investigated the permeation of biofuels (bioethanol 85%, biodiesel 20%) and conventional petroleum fuels (gasoline and diesel) through gloves used in occupational settings (neoprene, nitrile, and Viton) and laboratories (latex, nitrile, and vinyl), as well as a standard reference material (neoprene sheet). Permeation rates and breakthrough times were measured using the American Society for Testing and Materials F739-99 protocol, and fuel and permeant compositions were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In addition, we estimated exposures for three occupational scenarios and recommend chemical protective clothing suitable for use with motor fuels. Permeation rates and breakthrough times depended on the fuel-glove combination. Gasoline had the highest permeation rate among the four fuels. Bioethanol (85%) had breakthrough times that were two to three times longer than gasoline through neoprene, nitrile Sol-Vex, and the standard reference materials. Breakthrough times for biodiesel (20%) were slightly shorter than for diesel for the latex, vinyl, nitrile examination, and the standard neoprene materials. The composition of permeants differed from neat fuels, e.g., permeants were significantly enriched in the lighter aromatics including benzene. Viton was the best choice among the tested materials for the four fuels tested. Among the scenarios, fuel truck drivers had the highest uptake via inhalation based on the personal measurements available in the literature, and gasoline station attendants had highest uptake via dermal exposure if gloves were not worn. Appropriate selection and use of gloves can protect workers from dermal exposures; however, current recommendations from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health should be revised to account for contemporary fuel formulations that routinely contain ethanol.

AB  - Since 2003 India has been actively promoting the cultivation of Jatropha on unproductive and degraded lands (wastelands) for the production of biodiesel suitable as transportation fuel. In this paper the life cycle energy balance, global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential and land use impact on ecosystem quality is evaluated for a small scale, low-input Jatropha biodiesel system established on wasteland in rural India. In addition to the life cycle assessment of the case at hand, the environmental performance of the same system expanded with a biogas installation digesting seed cake was quantified. The environmental impacts were compared to the life cycle impacts of a fossil fuel reference system delivering the same amount of products and functions as the Jatropha biodiesel system under research. The results show that the production and use of Jatropha biodiesel triggers an 82% decrease in non-renewable energy requirement (Net Energy Ratio, NER=1.85) and a 55% reduction in global warming potential (GWP) compared to the reference fossil-fuel based system. However, there is an increase in acidification (49%) and eutrophication (430%) from the Jatropha system relative to the reference case. Although adding biogas production to the system boosts the energy efficiency of the system (NER=3.40), the GWP reduction would not increase (51%) due to additional CH4 emissions. For the land use impact, Jatropha improved the structural ecosystem quality when planted on wasteland, but reduced the functional ecosystem quality. Fertilizer application (mainly N) is an important contributor to most negative impact categories. Optimizing fertilization, agronomic practices and genetics are the major system improvement options. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Emission of fine particles by mobile sources has been a matter of great concern due to its potential risk both to human health and the environment. Although there is no evidence that one sole component may be responsible for the adverse health outcomes, it is postulated that the metal particle content is one of the most important factors, mainly in relation to oxidative stress. Data concerning the amount and type of metal particles emitted by automotive vehicles using Brazilian fuels are limited. The aim of this study was to identify inhalable particles (PM10) and their trace metal content in two light-duty vehicles where one was fueled with ethanol while the other was fueled with gasoline mixed with 22% of anhydrous ethanol (gasohol); these engines were tested on a chassis dynamometer. The elementary composition of the samples was evaluated by the particle-induced x-ray emission technique. The experiment showed that total emission factors ranged from 2.5 to 11.8 mg/km in the gasohol vehicle, and from 1.2 to 3 mg/km in the ethanol vehicle. The majority of particles emitted were in the fine fraction (PM 2.5), in which Al, Si, Ca, and Fe corresponded to 80% of the total weight. PM 10 emissions from the ethanol vehicle were about threefold lower than those of gasohol. The elevated amount of fine particulate matter is an aggravating factor, considering that these particles, and consequently associated metals, readily penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract, producing damage to lungs and other tissues. © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - 'Enhanced Biomass-to-Liquid' (EBtL) refers to BtL processes (biomass gasification and liquid fuel synthesis) with a significant increase in fuel production by means of external energy inputs. The conversion yield of biomass carbon into fuel carbon is multiplied by a factor of 3 in comparison with existing (autothermal) gasification processes. The technical options of such processes are outlined and evaluated in the paper: the production cost is estimated between 0.7 and 1.2 €/litre diesel.EBtL routes enable a strong increase in biofuel production compared with today biofuel processes (i.e. ethanol plus vegetal oil). They may also be seen as an efficient way to store electricity and hydrogen (produced from processes generating no greenhouse gas emissions) into a liquid fuel made from renewable carbon and compatible with present motor technologies and fuel storage and distribution. In combination with hybrid motors (liquid fuel and electricity), these technologies may offer a realistic alternative to petroleum and help reducing greenhouse gas emissions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this article, diverse liquid biofuels of the first generation were compared as partial or infant substitutes for fossil diesel fuel applied in cogeneration plant of the average capacity of 340 kW. The study concentrates on agricultural and economic conditions as well as legislative basis distinctive to Lithuania. At the laboratory of the Lithuanian University of Agriculture Institute of Agro-Engineering an experimental diesel engine powered generator was fuelled with rapeseed oil methyl ester (pure and in the blend with fossil diesel and dyed diesel fuels) and rapeseed oil with excellent energy balances and emissions characteristics more favorable than fossil diesel. Detailed estimations were proposed in order to assess the economic feasibility of complementing renewable electricity and heat generated in the final output cycle. The carried out analysis showed, that good perspectives are forecasted for using diesel engines in cogeneration plants, if they run on rapeseed oil produced by farmers themselves. The operation of such a plant would realize 184960 € of annual income for sold electricity, allowing to pay annual depreciation expenses and exceed the production cost for thermal energy to be 0.033 €/kW h. This price lies under the established one by the centralized energy suppliers, accordingly 0.058 €/kW h. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The lipid contents and fatty acid profiles of Chlorella zofingiensis cultured in the dark with various carbon sources were investigated. Glucose was found to be the best carbon source for the growth and lipid production. When cultivated with 50gL-1 glucose, C. zofingiensis accumulated lipids up to 52% of the dry biomass, with triacylglycerols (TAGs) accounting for 72.1% of the total lipids. Fatty acid profiles revealed that glucose contributed to the highest yield of total fatty acids (TFAs) and proportion of oleic acid (35.7% of TFAs), which corresponded to the strongest up-regulation of biotin carboxylase (BC) and stearoyl ACP desaturase (SAD) genes. In fed-batch cultivation based on glucose, the lipid yield and productivity of C. zofingiensis were further increased to 20.7gL-1 and 1.38gd-1L-1 respectively, representing 3.9-fold of those achieved in batch culture. We conclude that C. zofingiensis has great potential for biodiesel production. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the production of the 21 major field crops in Canada were 16.8 Tg CO2e of N2O and 17.2 Tg of fossil fuel CO2 in 2006. The mean GHG emission intensity on an area basis for these crops was 1.0Mg of CO2e per ha. On a dry matter (DM) basis, the mean GHG emission intensity was 0.33Mg of CO2e Mg-1 DM. For western Canada, the GHG emission intensity was 0.35 MgCO2e Mg-1 DM and 0.30 MgCO2e Mg-1 DM for eastern Canada. The sensitivity of the GHG emissions to crop-specific GHG emission intensities was demonstrated by examining two biodiesel scenarios. The biodiesel share of the diesel fuel blend was 2% in the first scenario (B2) and 5% in the second scenario (B5). The increased feedstock was assumed to come from canola and soybeans. The B2 scenario increased the emission intensity for western Canada to 0.38 MgCO2e Mg-1 DM and the B5 scenario to 0.43 MgCO2e Mg-1 DM. Neither scenario had any appreciable effect on the magnitude of the emission intensity for eastern Canada. The GHG emissions from the canola-dominated western Canadian field crops were increased by the B2 and B5 fuel blend scenarios. In the soybean-dominated east, the two scenarios resulted in decreased GHG emissions from field crops. Canola-based biodiesel potentially eliminates more petrodiesel CO2 emissions than soybean biodiesel. However, for both scenarios, the net potential GHG reductions (petrodiesel offset plus change in GHG emissions from field crops) were 2.60 MgCO2e ha-1 of additional oilseeds in the east and 0.94 MgCO2e ha-1 in the west. The higher meal by-product from soybean oil meant a smaller loss of livestock feed for eastern Canada. © 2010.

AB  - The scope of present work was the modelling and mapping of maize biomass yield in correlation with water quality and irrigation water management effects in an experimental field with combinational use of in situ measurements and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning System (GPS), Geostatistical modeling. The investigation of drip irrigation frequency effects in yield and in the proportion of biomass in the various plant parts and in the distribution of soil moisture were studied, in an experimental parcel of three interventions (i.e. irrigation per 9, 12 and 15 days) in a four replications, randomized complete block design (RCBD) with systematic plot arrangement, in a farm located in central Greece (Larissa), at the farming period of year 2003. The cut plants fractions results for the distribution of above ground biomass (dry matter), were: 47.74% grain, 26.72% stalk, 11.43% leaf, 7.25% cob, 6.86% husk, and for the distribution of biomass in stover (dry matter) were: 49.75% stalk, 22.27% leaf, 16.22% cob and 11.76% husk. The mean biomass in stover yield was found 11,562.99 kg ha -1. It was observed that the 9 days irrigation treatment resulted in the greatest biomass in stover yield (13,198.02 kg ha -1) and the highest potential for Bioethanol production (5,411.18 L ha -1), and from the statistical analysis of the plots harvested mean biomass yields, it was found that their values were significantly different at level of significance p &lt; 0.05. ICT provided significant insight into the nature of biomass yield and the field's spatial variability as effected of the integrated irrigation water management and its biofuel potential, aiming at water savings and environmental protection. © 2010 Desalination Publications.

AB  - Fats, oil and grease (FOG) can be recovered efficiently from grease interceptors for biodiesel production. FOG is susceptible to hydrolysis because of its inherent high moisture content and the presence of lipases associated with food residuals in the grease interceptors. This study reveals that the FFA content of FOG derived from grease interceptors did not exceed 8% (w/w) due to constant influx of fresh FOG from wastewater. However, if the FOG is allowed to hydrolyze without dilution, the FFA content can reach 15% (w/w) in more than 20 days. Experiments were conducted to optimize reaction parameters for the esterification of FOG prior to the conventional alkali-catalyzed biodiesel production process. Sulphuric acid (H2SO4) was a more efficient catalyst than Fe2(SO4)3 in reducing the acid value to ≤1 mg KOH/g under identical reaction conditions. At reaction temperatures of ≤50 °C, only H2SO4 was capable of reaching the recommended acid value within 24 h. The optimum methanol to FFA ratio for an H2SO4-catalyzed reaction was 20:1, whereas for Fe2(SO4)3 it was above 26:1. Esterification occurred under static, non-mixed conditions, although conversion rates were low. The rate of conversion increased with mixing speed, with a 200 rpm orbital shaking speed as optimum. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work, the esterification of free fatty acids (FFA) in waste cooking oil catalysed by ferric sulphat was studied as a pre-treatment step for biodiesel production. The effects of reaction time, methanol to oil ratio catalyst concentration and temperature on the conversion of FFA were investigated on a laboratory scale. The results showed that the conversion of FFA reached equilibrium after an hour, and was positively dependent on the methanol to oil molar ratio and temperature. An optimum catalyst concentration of 2 wt.% gave maximum FFA conversion of 59.2%. For catalyst loadings of 2 wt.% and below, this catalysed esterification was proposed to follow a pseudo-homogeneous pathway akin to mineral acid-catalysed esterification, driven by the H+ ions produced through the hydrolysis of metal complex Waste cooking oil [Fe(H20)6]3+ (aq). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrothermal oxidation pathways of high molecular weight unsaturated carboxylic acids were investigated for the potential use of chemoselectivity to improve the efficiency of the desired products from bio-masses directly containing or easily producing unsaturated carboxylic acids. Hock cleavage, which frequently occur at general chemical, was observed in the absence of any acid catalyst and may be a potential major oxidation cleavage mechanism, which leads to the cleavage at both the carbon-carbon double bond and the single bond near a double bond. The addition of a peroxyl radical to the double bond may be also a potential major oxidation mechanism, which leads to the oxidation cleavage mainly at the carbon-carbon double bond. Cleavage at the carbon-carbon bond near the double bond by the addition of a peroxyl radical to the double bond may also occur. However, oxidation at either α,β,or γ, carbon to the -COOH group hardly occurred. These results may help to selectively produce desired products from biomasses, such as lignin and oils. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The following study analyzes the performance of a continuous flow biodiesel reactor/separator. The reactor achieves high conversion of vegetable oil triglycerides to biodiesel while simultaneously separating co-product glycerol. The influence of the flow direction, relative to the gravity vector, on the reactor performance was measured. Reactor performance was assessed by both the conversion of vegetable oil triglycerides to biodiesel and the separation efficiency of removing the co-product glycerol. At slightly elevated temperatures of 40-50 °C, an overall feed of 1.2 L/min, a 6:1 M ratio of methanol to vegetable oil triglycerides, and a 1-1.3 wt.% potassium hydroxide catalyst loading, the reactor converted more than 96% of the pretreated waste vegetable oil to biodiesel. The reactor also separated 36-95% of the glycerol that was produced. Tilting the reactor away from the vertical direction produced a large increase in glycerol separation efficiency and only a small decrease in conversion. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many samples of rapeseed oil ethyl ester were prepared by alkaline-catalyzed transesterification at various conditions (reaction time, temperature, amount of catalyst, the molar ratio of ethanol to oil, the rotations of a disperser and the purification by water). The concentrations of the key impurities for biodiesel quality (the concentrations of monoglycerides, diglycerides, triglycerides, free glycerol, ethanol, free fatty acids, water) and some qualitative parameters (flash point, carbon residue, kinematics viscosity at 40°C) were determined and then the relationships among them were found out. The relationships were characterized by the linear or non-linear statistical models. The found models enable the better understanding of the significance of the qualitative parameters and estimate them from the concentrations of impurities. The temperature dependence was also measured in the case of the viscosity of ethyl ester and used rapeseed oil. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cryptococcus curvatus, an oleaginous yeast was observed to grow on crude glycerol derived from yellow grease. When cultured in a one-stage fed-batch process wherein crude glycerol and nitrogen source were fed intermittently for 12 days, the final biomass density and lipid content were 31.2 g/l and 44.2%, respectively. When cultured in a two-stage fed-batch operation wherein crude glycerol was supplemented at different time points while nitrogen source addition was discontinued at the middle of the experiment, the biomass density was 32.9 g/l and the lipid content was 52% at the end of 12 days. Compared with other oil feedstocks for biodiesel production, lipid accumulated by C. curvatus grown on glycerol has high concentration of monounsaturated fatty acid, which makes it an excellent source for biodiesel use. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Large amount of hydrogen is consumed during the upgrading of bitumen into synthetic crude oil (SCO), and this hydrogen is exclusively produced from natural gas in Western Canada. Because of large amount of emission from natural gas, alternative sources for hydrogen fuel especially renewable feedstocks could significantly reduce CO2 emissions. In this study, biomass is converted to bio-oil by fast pyrolysis. This bio-oil is steam reformed near bitumen upgrading plant for producing hydrogen fuel. A techno-economic model is developed to estimate the cost of hydrogen from biomass through the pathway of fast pyrolysis. Three different feedstocks including whole-tree biomass, forest residues (i.e. limbs, branches, and tops of tree produced during logging operations), and straw (mostly from wheat and barley crops) are considered for biohydrogen production. Delivered cost of biohydrogen from whole-tree-based biomass ($2.40/kg of H2) is lower than that of forest residues ($3.00/kg of H2) and agricultural residues ($4.55/kg of H2) at a plant capacity of 2000 dry tonnes/day. In this study, bio-oil is produced in the field/forest and transported to a distance of 500 km from the centralized remote bio-oil production plant to bitumen upgrading plant. Feedstock delivery cost and capital cost are the largest cost contributors to the bio-oil production cost, while more than 50% of the cost of biohydrogen production is contributed by bio-oil production and transportation. Carbon credits of $133, $214, and $356/tonne of CO2 equivalent could make whole-tree, forest residues, and straw-based biohydrogen production competitive with natural gas-based H2 for a natural gas price of $5/GJ, respectively. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study focuses on the use of waste cooking oil (WCO) as the main feedstock for hydrotreatment to evaluate the effect of temperature on the product hydrocarbon composition. A qualitative analysis was initially performed using a GC × GC-TOFMS indicating the presence of mainly paraffins of the C15-C18 range. A quantitative analysis was also performed via a GC-FID, which gave both n-paraffins and iso-paraffins in the range of C8-C29. The results indicate that hydrotreating temperature favors isomerization reactions as the amount of n-paraffins decreases while the amount of iso-paraffins increases. For all experiments the same commercial hydrotreating catalyst was utilized, while the remaining operating parameters were constant (pressure = 1200 psig, LHSV=1.0h-1, H2/oil ratio = 4000 scfb, liquid feed = 0.33 ml/min, and gas feed = 0.4 scfh). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is susceptible to start-up and performance problems, consistent with its chemical composition, when vehicles and fuel systems are subjected to cold temperatures. In this work, a comprehensive evaluation of the crystallization behavior of different biodiesels was performed by measuring the cold filter plugging point (CFPP), cloud point (CP) and pour point (PP). Results were related to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms. Peanut methyl esters in particular led to the most unfavorable properties due to the presence of long-chain saturated compounds (arachidic or C20:0, behenic or C22:0, and lignoceric or C24:0 acid methyl esters) approaching 6 wt.%. The cold flow properties may be improved with different winterization techniques to eliminate some of these compounds. In this work, various techniques are tested, and the best technique is found to be crystallization filtration using methanol, which reduces the CFPP from 17 °C to -8 °C with a biodiesel loss of 8.93 wt.%. Moreover, the cake from filtration, enriched with long-chain saturated methyl esters, can be used as phase change material (PCM) for thermo-regulated materials. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - India, which is one of the major biofuel producing countries in Asia, has been quick enough to jump to biofuel production. Biofuel production has multiple implications and rural development is one of them. Local governments took precedence to national government in promoting biofuels and in integrating biofuel promotion with the developmental programs such as drought mitigation and forestry programs. The current paper studies one such program taken up by the state governments in India and identifies different issues that could hamper the transfer of real benefits to rural communities.

AB  - A life cycle assessment study of the biomass-to-oil (BTO *) process based on the fast ablative pyrolysis of wood chips from forest residues has been performed. The planned system consists of eight pyrolyzers with a throughput of 6 tpd each. The bio-oil will be burnt in eight modified diesel engines with a capacity of 315 kWhel each. The results were compared with a reference system (fossil diesel-fueled CHP). The comparison is made for the production of 1 kWh of electrical energy (kWhel) and shows significant differences for global warming potential (GWP 100: 287.7%), eutrophication potential (EP: +23.2%), acidification potential (AP:-44.6%), photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP:-63.6%), and ozone depletion potential (ODP:-92.4%). The results of the BTO-CHP-system show lower environmental impact values in all environmental impact categories except for the EP-value, which exceeds the reference due to the application of bio-oil additives derived from agricultural production. © 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog.

AB  - Fuel distribution uses 304 stainless steel containers for the storage of biofuels, however, there are few reports in the literature about the corrosive aspects this steel in biodiesel. The objective of this research is to study the corrosive behavior of 304 austenitic stainless steel in the presence of biodiesel, unwashed and washed, with aqueous solutions of citric, oxalic, acetic and ascorbic acids 0,01 mol L-1, and compare with results obtained for the copper (ASTM D130). The employedtechniques were: atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) and optical microscopy (OM). The results of EAA showed a low rate of corrosion for the stainless steel, the alloys elements studied were Cr, Ni and Fe, the highest rate was observed for the chrome, 1.78 ppm/day in biodiesel with or without washing. The OM of the 304 steel, when compared with that of copper, has a low corrosion rate in the 304 steel/biodiesel system. Not with standing, this demonstrates that not only the 304 steel, but also the copper, corrodes in biodiesel.

AB  - Microalgae have the potential to provide large amounts of lipid-containing biomass that could be used as a renewable oil feedstock for biofuel use. Many fast-growing algae, such as Chlorella vulgaris, when grown under nutrient-sufficient conditions, have a lipid profile that is unsuitable for biodiesel use, since the triacylglyceride content is too low. However, growth under nitrogen limitation has been shown to increase triacylglycerides. Here we investigate the most effective nitrogen-limitation regime and find that rather than transferring cells to a medium without nitrogen, the maximal triacylglyceride productivity (46 mg/l/day) is achieved by allowing the cells to deplete the nitrogen naturally. Detailed analysis of the fatty acid composition of the lipids indicated that there was a high proportion of α-linolenic acid (C18:3) under all conditions, so that it would have to be blended with other feedstocks in order to adhere to international standards for biodiesel. © 2010 Future Science Ltd.

AB  - We have formalized and parameterized a model for the production of six transport fuels and six fuels blends from six feedstocks through 13 different production chains, and their adoption of by 11 distinct subpopulations of motorists. The motorists are represented by agents that use heuristics to choose a fuel on the basis of three attributes and a social feedback loop. Adoption of specific fuels is mostly driven by price differences, but other factors play a role if prices are similar. The results are not always intuitive and do not always show up immediately. We find that sustained combinations of interventions are required to bring about a transition away from petrol or diesel. Adoption of alternative fuels was most often confined to niche markets with a share of 5% or lower. Only in a single case was a complete fuel transition observed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Acidic oil made by acidification and extraction of soapstock was used to produce biofuel in delayed coking apparatus. Through two pre-heatings of acidic oil in delayed coking apparatus, when the temperature of the coking drum reached 460C, the maximum yield of liquid oil (around 84%) was obtained, whereas the ratio of diesel and gasoline (about 5.3:1) was obtained. The liquid oil was separated by distillation to obtain the biofuel (205-360C). By comparing the basic properties of the obtained biofuel with 0# diesel and analyzing the basic properties of the resulted biodiesel-diesel blends, the results showed that the performance of the product was almost close to 0# diesel standards; when biodiesel content reached up to 20% in the blend, its properties (such as viscosity, density, and CFPP) changed slightly by comparing with 0# diesel.

AB  - The novel biodiesel production technology using supercritical reactive extraction from Jatropha curcas L. oil seeds in this study has a promising role to fill as a more cost-effective processing technology. Compared to traditional biodiesel production method, supercritical reactive extraction can successfully carry out the extraction of oil and subsequent esterification/transesterification process to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) simultaneously in a relatively short total operating time (45-80 min). Particle size of the seeds (0.5-2.0 mm) and reaction temperature/pressure (200-300 °C) are two primary factors being investigated. With 300 C reaction temperature, 240 MPa operating pressure, 10.0 ml/g methanol to solid ratio and 2.5 ml/g of n-hexane to seed ratio, optimum oil extraction efficiency and FAME yield can reach up to 105.3% v/v and 103.5% w/w, respectively which exceeded theoretical yield calculated based on n-hexane Soxhlet extraction of Jatropha oil seeds. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrogenolysis of biodiesel derived glycerol to 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) has attracted much attention in recent years. In this work, glycerol hydrogenolysis to 1,2-PDO was performed over CuO/MgO catalysts prepared by impregnation and coprecipitation at 180 °C and 3.0 MPa H2. It was found that the Cu(15)/MgO catalyst prepared by coprecipitation had the best activity. The conversion of glycerol and the selectivity of 1,2-PDO over Cu(15)/MgO reached 72.0% and 97.6%, respectively. And the conversion of glycerol was further increased to 82.0% when small amount of NaOH was added in the reaction mixture. Those highly active catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, N2-adsorption and temperature-programmed reduction with H2. Characterization results revealed that the activity of the prepared catalysts depended strongly on the particle sizes of both Cu and MgO. Catalysts that have smaller sized Cu and MgO particles are more active for glycerol hydrogenolysis. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present work the preparation of biodiesel from Jatropha curcas L. oil produced by two-phase solvent extraction (TSE) was studied. The experimental results of TSE process showed that the optimal extraction conditions were 30 g samples, 240 mL of extraction solvent mixture and methanol/n-hexane volume ratio 60:40, extraction temperature 35 °C, extraction time 30 min. Further, the effect of methanol recycling on the TSE process was also investigated. After TSE process, the investigations were carried out on transesterification of methanol with oil-n-hexane solution coming from TSE process in the presence of sodium hydroxide as the catalyst. The conversion could achieve 98% with 3:1 n-hexane/oil weight ratio, 60 °C reaction temperature, 7:1 methanol/oil mole ratio, 1.1% alkali catalyst concentration and 120 min reaction time. The properties of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) product prepared from Jatropha curcas L. oil produced by two-phase solvent extraction met the ASTM specifications for biodiesel.

AB  - The utilization of non-edible feedstock such as moringa oleifera for biodiesel production attracts much attention owing to the issue with regards to avoiding a threat to food supplies. In this study, the optimization of biodiesel production parameters for moringa oleifera oil was carried out. The free fatty acid value of moringa oil was found to be 0.6%, rendering the one step alkaline transesterification method for converting moringa fatty acids to their methyl esters possible. The optimum production parameters: catalyst amount, alcohol amount, temperature, agitation speed and reaction time were determined experimentally and found to be: 1.0 wt% catalyst amount, 30 wt% methanol amount, 60 °C reaction temperature, 400 rpm agitation rate and 60 min reaction time. With these optimal conditions the conversion efficiency was 82%. The properties of the moringa biodiesel that was produced were observed to fall within the recommended international biodiesel standards. However, moringa biodiesel showed high values of cloud and pour points of 10 °C and 3 °C respectively, which present a problem as regards use in cold temperatures. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In regions with a large wine production the usage of their natural waste to make biodiesel can result an interesting alternative. In this work, different methods of extraction, refining and transesterification of grape seed oil were assayed. Two techniques of oil extraction were compared: solvent extraction and pressing. Two conventional transesterifications of the refined oil were carried out using methanol and bioethanol, being the methyl and ethyl ester contents higher than 97 wt.%. Finally, several in situ transesterifications were done. In situ transesterification did not reach either the oil yield extraction or the alkyl ester contents but the obtained biodiesel had better oxidation stability in comparison with the conventional process. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The growth of corn-based ethanol production and soybean-based bio-diesel production following the increase in the oil prices have significantly affect the world agricultural grain productions and its prices. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationships between the crude oil price and the global grain prices for corn, soybean, and wheat. The empirical results show that the change in each grain price is significantly influenced by the changes in the crude oil price and other grain prices during the period extending from the 3rd week in 2005 to the 20th week in 2008 which implies that grain commodities are competing with the derived demand for bio-fuels by using soybean or corn to produce ethanol or bio-diesel during the period of higher crude oil prices in these recent years. The subsidy policies in relation to the bio-fuel industries in some nations engaging in bio-fuel production should be considered to avoid the consequences resulting from high oil prices. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study presents the feasibility of converting a non-edible oil source native to the Africa region - croton megalocarpus oil to methyl esters (biodiesel) using sulfated tin oxide enhanced with SiO2 (SO2-4/SnO2-SiO2) as super acid solid catalyst. This study was conducted using design of experiment (DoE), specifically, response surface methodology based on three-variable central composite design (CCD) with alpha (α) = 2. The reaction parameters studied are: reaction temperature (60-180 oC), reaction period (1-3 h) and methanol to oil ratio (1:6-1:24). Although the oil was found to contain high free fatty acid, however, yield up to 95% was obtained without any pre-treatment step with the following reaction conditions: 180 oC, 2 h and 15:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, while keeping constant catalyst concentration and stirring speed at 3 wt.% and 350-360 rpm, respectively. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In biodiesel production through transesterification, glycerin is produced as a valuable co-product. Some biodiesel plants have incorporated a glycerin purification process since the beginning of operations. The objective of this study is to evaluate the benefits of the incorporation of a glycerin purification process to a biodiesel plant where has already been constructed without the initial consideration of including an extra process for glycerin. A cost-benefit analysis is applied to evaluate the potential benefit from the incorporation of this process, in cases of a high plant cost and a low plant cost, with and without a glycerin facility installation. Our results show that the installation of a glycerin purification process could benefit a biodiesel plant through glycerin recovery and a decrease in wastewater treatment cost. The current downward trend in the market price of glycerin could be offset by encouraging the development of new applications for glycerin in order to expand the existing market and to stabilize the market price. However, biodiesel plants using waste cooking oil in Japan still need government subsidy to sustain their business activity. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A carbon-based solid acid catalyst was prepared by the sulfonation of carbonized vegetable oil asphalt. This catalyst was employed to simultaneously catalyze esterification and transesterification to synthesis biodiesel when a waste vegetable oil with large amounts of free fatty acids (FFAs) was used as feedstock. The physical and chemical properties of this catalyst were characterized by a variety of techniques. The maximum conversion of triglyceride and FFA reached 80.5 wt.% and 94.8 wt.% after 4.5 h at 220 °C, when using a 16.8 M ratio of methanol to oil and 0.2 wt.% of catalyst to oil. The high catalytic activity and stability of this catalyst was related to its high acid site density (-OH, Brönsted acid sites), hydrophobicity that prevented the hydration of -OH species, hydrophilic functional groups (-SO3H) that gave improved accessibility of methanol to the triglyceride and FFAs, and large pores that provided more acid sites for the reactants. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrotreating of waste cooking oil (WCO) was studied as a process for biofuels production. The hydrotreatment temperature is the most dominant operating parameter which defines catalyst performance as well as catalyst life. In this analysis, a hydrotreating temperature range of 330-398 °C was explored via a series of five experiments (330, 350, 370, 385 and 398 °C). Several parameters were considered for evaluating the effect of temperature including product yields, conversion, selectivity (diesel and gasoline), heteroatom removal (sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen) and saturation of double bonds. For all experiments the same commercial hydrotreating catalyst was utilized, while the remaining operating parameters were constant (pressure = 1200 psig, LHSV = 1.0 h-1,H2/oil ratio = 4000 scfb, liquid feed = 0.33 ml/min and gas feed = 0.4 scfh). It was observed that higher reactor temperatures are more attractive when gasoline production is of interest, while lower reaction temperatures are more suitable when diesel production is more important. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A comprehensive study of critical parameters in the pig pancreatic lipase (PPL) catalysed transesterification of sunflower oil to novel biofuels integrating glycerol into their composition is reported. The influence of oil/alcohol ratio, temperature, quantity of enzyme and water added and pH have been investigated. The enzymatic activity of PPL was found to be greatly influenced by the pH, reaching notable activities at high pH values (10-12), in contrast to other lipases. The addition of small quantities of NaOH (up to 0.1 mL) as coadjuvant in the transesterification reaction enhances the activity of the enzymes. This remarkable behaviour, reported for the first time, may pave the way for the utilisation of these relatively cheap enzymes in large scale commercial biodiesel production. Besides, a novel biofuels containing glycerol into their composition as mono- and diglycerides using PPL as biocatalyst has been developed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable fuel which can be produced through an esterification reaction. The cost of feedstock which resulted in that of biodiesel is a large problem to be resolved. Dark oil from industrial process can be a better alternative for biodiesel production because of its low price. In spite of this, the study of biodiesel production using the dark oil has not been reported. This study provides technical information and catalytic properties on this system. Among the several catalysts, WO3/ZrO2 catalyst was the most effective catalyst in the esterification of the dark oil to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). The catalytic reaction parameters were optimized that 20 wt.% WO3/ZrO2 has a high FFA conversion of 96% at 150 °C, 0.4 g/ml (oil), 1:9 (oil to alcohol, molar ratio) and 2 h reaction time. The physical and chemical properties of the catalyst were characterized by XRD, Raman spectrometer, BET and NH3-TPD.

AB  - A marine microalga, Schizochytrium limacinum SR21 has been found to grow fast on crude glycerol - a major by-product from the current biodiesel industry. Using crude glycerol derived from restaurant used oils (yellow grease), we have determined that glycerol concentrations of 25 and 35 g/l were the optimal ones for untreated and treated crude glycerol in batch cultures, respectively. Biomass dry weight as 8.3 and 13.3 g/l were attained for these two doses, respectively. Higher concentrations of glycerol resulted in decreased cell growth due to substrate inhibition and methanol presence. With 35 g/l, the cellular lipid content was the highest - 73.3% among all the doses tested. Animal fats derived crude glycerol also supported algal growth and lipid production. Results from this study set a solid foundation for our ongoing fed-batch process to achieve maximal crude glycerol utilization and lipid production.

AB  - To increase the lipid productivity and thus to reduce the production cost of microalgal biodiesel, effects of cultivation conditions including KNO3-level, CO2 concentration and irradiance on the cell growth, chlorophyll a content and lipid accumulation of Chlorella vulgaris were systematically investigated in a membrane sparged photobioreactor. The biochemical compositions including carbohydrates, proteins and lipids were analyzed simultaneously by the FT-IR spectroscopy. The results showed that the largest biomass productivity and the highest lipid content were obtained at different cultivation conditions. The algae should be harvested at a point that optimized the biomass productivity and lipid content. When the cultivation conditions were controlled at 1.0 mM KNO3, 1.0% CO2 and 60 lmol photons m2 s1 at 25 °C, the highest lipid productivity obtained was 40 mg L1 d1, which was about 2.5-fold that had been reported by Illman et al. (2000). The influences of cultivation conditions on the cell growth, lipid accumulation, and other biochemical compositions of cells were further discussed and illustrated by a schematic which was also useful for other microalgal species. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The crude fish oil from the waste parts of marine fish is considered to be alternative source of abundant and low-cost feedstock for biodiesel production. Fish oil extracted from the waste parts of marine fish is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Thus, the biodiesel produced from marine fish oil may have lower oxidative stability. To better understand how to improve the oxidative stability of marine fish-oil biodiesel, the influence of oxidative variables including antioxidant addition, operating temperature and storage time on the fuel characteristics of this biodiesel was investigated in this study. The experimental results show that the addition of antioxidant significantly retards the deterioration over time of the fuel characteristics of the marine fish-oil biodiesel. Operating temperature was found to be a dominant factor in the deterioration of the fuel characteristics of this biodiesel. The marine fish-oil biodiesel sample to which no antioxidant has been added and which has been stored at a higher temperature appears to have the highest deterioration rate of methyl ester content and greatest rate of increase in acid value, kinematic viscosity, and carbon residue among the four tested biodiesel samples. Moreover, the addition of a combination of two antioxidants was found to have a slightly greater effect in reducing the deterioration rate of the fuel characteristics of this biodiesel than the addition of a single antioxidant alone. However, the addition of antioxidant to the fish-oil biodiesel results in an increase in kinematic viscosity and carbon residue at the beginning of the storage period.

AB  - Gasification is a thermochemical path that makes it possible to convert biomass into gases. The main requirements for the transformation process are both a high mass rate transformation and a low content of organic impurities (tars) in the produced gas (syngas). An allothermal process of gasification, based on the use of thermal plasma to supply the energy for bio-oil conversion is being studied at the CEA (Commissariat l'Energie Atomique) Cadarache, bio-oil being produced by a pre-processing of biomass by flash pyrolysis. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the gasification of bio-oil by a thermal plasma process. Indeed, it is expected that the high level of temperature and presence of oxygenated active species in the plasma flow may help to reduce the tar content below 0.1 mg/Nm3, a required value for the Fischer Tropsch post-process and increase the mass yield. The first step of the work consists in developing a model that takes into account the plasma flow inside the reactor and the liquid material treatment in order to increase the understanding of the process and determine the optimal operating parameters of the plasma reactor. The bio-oil injected under the form of a liquid jet is subjected to fragmentation, evaporation and chemical reactions in the plasma jet. The modeling work presented in this paper is focused on the break up of the droplets formed by the disintegration of the liquid jet. It uses the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code Fluent 6.3. Numerical predictions are compared with experimental data obtained with a shadowgraphy system.

AB  - In order to characterize enzyme activity and stability corresponding to temperature effects, thermodynamic studies on commercial immobilized lipase have been carried out via enzymatic transesterification. An optimum temperature of 40 °C was obtained in the reaction. The decreasing reaction rates beyond the optimum temperature indicated the occurrence of reversible enzyme deactivation. Thermodynamic studies on lipase denaturation exhibited a first-order kinetics pattern, with considerable stability through time shown by the lipase as well. The activation and deactivation energies were 22.15 kJ mol-1 and 45.18 kJ mol-1, respectively, implying more energy was required for the irreversible denaturation of the enzyme to occur. At water content of 0.42%, the initial reaction rate and FAME yield displayed optimum values of 3.317 g/L min and 98%, respectively. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The anaerobic co-digestion of glycerol and wastewater derived from biodiesel manufacturing, in which COD was found to be 1054 and 428 g/L, respectively, was studied in batch laboratory-scale reactors at mesophilic temperature (35 °C). Glycerol was acidified with H3PO4 in order to recover the alkaline catalyst employed in the transesterification reaction (KOH) as agricultural fertiliser (potassium phosphates). Wastewater was subjected to an electrocoagulation process in order to reduce its oil content. After mixing, the anaerobic revalorisation of the wastewater was studied employing inoculum-substrate ratios ranging from 5.02 to 1.48 g VSS/g COD and organic loading rates of 0.27-0.36 g COD/g VSS d. Biodegradability was found to be around 100%, while the methane yield coefficient was 310 mL CH4/g COD removed (1 atm, 25°C). At the equilibrium time, the proportionality between r' and the load was constant, showing 1.55 mL CH4/(g VSS g COD h). The results showed that anaerobic co-digestion reduces the clean water and nutrient requirement, with the consequent economical and environmental benefit. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Modern bioenergy is commercial energy production from biomass for industry, power generation, or transport fuels. Bioenergy is an inclusive term for all forms of biomass and biofuels. Green energy is an alternate term for renewable energy that is the energy generated from sources that are considered environmentally friendly. The term biofuel is referred to as liquid or gaseous fuels for the transport sector that are predominantly produced from biomass. Bioethanol is a petrol additive/substitute.It is possible that wood, straw, and even household wastes may be economically converted to bioethanol. Bioethanol is derived from alcoholic fermentation of sucrose or simple sugars, which are produced from biomass by hydrolysis process. Biodiesel is an environmentally friendly alternative liquid fuel that can be used in any diesel engine without modification.

AB  - Biodiesel use is being promoted worldwide as a green alternative to conventional diesel. A global three-dimensional chemistry transport model is employed to investigate the impact on air quality and global tropospheric composition of adopting biodiesel as a fractional component of diesel use. Five global simulations are conducted where emission changes of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides were applied within the model to investigate changes in tropospheric pollutants. Hydrocarbon emissionreductions lead to an overall improvement in air quality with reductions in ozone, organic aerosol, aromatic species and PAN. However when the increase in NOx, caused by increased exhaust temperature, is included there is negligible difference in ozone production between mineral diesel and biodiesel blends. The cause of these effects is discussed. Copyright © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The article explores the possibilities of using fatty acid methyl esters derived from the oil of a new species of oily plant Camelina sativa not demanding on soil. The performed research on the physical and chemical properties of pure methyl esters from Camelina sativa show that biofuels do not meet requirements for the biodiesel fuel standard (LST EN 14214:2009) of a high iodine value and high content of linoleic acid methyl ester, so they must be mixed with methyl esters produced from pork lard the content of which in the mixture must be not less than 32%. This article presents the results of tests on combustion emission obtained when three-cylinder diesel engine VALMET 320 DMG was fuelled with a mixture containing 30% of this new kind of fuel with fossil diesel fuel comparing with emissions obtained when the engine was fuelled with a fuel mixture containing 30% of conventional biodiesel fuel (rapeseed oil methyl esters) with fossil diesel fuel. The obtained results show that using both types of fuel, no significant differences in CO and NOMx concentrations were observed throughout the tested load range. When operating on fuels containing methyl esters from Camelina sativa, HC emissions decreased by 10 to 12% and the smokeness of exhaust gas by 12 to 25%.

AB  - Two fuel kinds of organic origin including rapeseed methyl ester (RME) and ethanol (E) were selected for their different physical-chemical parameters to study the maximum apt volume of oxygenates to mix fossil diesel (D) and establish expectancy to apply D-RME-E blend as a fuel for the unmodified high-speed diesel engine (a combustion chamber consists of a dished piston). The objective of the article is to provide an explicit relationship between the nature of fuel composition and diesel engine operating parameters. The results of the carried out tests on the engine oriented on dynamic and emission characteristics using various portions of the before mentioned bio-components in diesel fuel are presented. Engine behaviour seemed to be improved in the presence of ethanol additives in D-RME blend with a reduction in pollutant emissions in exhaust gases, fuel consumption, ameliorated cetane number, ignition delay time and physical-chemical characteristics of the investigated compounds. The positive and negative aspects of applying bio-based additives in fossil diesel are reported and discussed.

AB  - A two-step thermochemical process, pyrolysis followed by catalytic cracking, was used to produce liquid fuels from poultry dissolved air flotation (DAF) skimmings, a waste material generated during poultry processing. Raw DAF-derived solids were dried and subjected to pyrolysis at 400, 500, 600 or 700 °C to thermally crack the material into three physical phases; a gas, solid, and liquid. The liquid phase, DAF bio-oil, was further processed in an attempt to produce a liquid fuel capable of powering a diesel engine. After catalytic processing and collection, the DAF bio-oil exhibited a higher heating value (HHV) of 36 MJ kg-1, which is less than the reported HHV of diesel (45.7 MJ kg-1), similar to biodiesel (36-40 MJ kg-1), but much higher than the HHV of bio-oil produced from the bioconversion of woody biomass (20 MJ kg-1). DAF bio-oil analysis generated measurements of HHV (MJ kg-1), cloud point (°C), viscosity (mm2 s-1 at 40 °C), and water content (%) revealed values of 36, 61.7, 37.8, and 4.72, respectively. After catalytic cracking, HHV increased to 40.2 MJ kg-1, cloud point decreased to -2.7 °C, viscosity decreased to 1.6 mm2 s-1, and water content decreased to 1.9% making it comparable to conventional fuels. The upgraded DAF bio-oil could be utilized as a fuel for direct combustion in industrial boilers for steam generating, blended with petroleum fuels as an additive, or used directly as diesel transportation fuel. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Advances in biodiesel, emulsified diesel and artificial chemical additives are driven by consumer demand to save energy and reduce emissions from diesel engines. However, the effect of emulsified bio-solution/palm-biodiesel/diesel blends in diesel engines has not been assessed. Experimental results in this work demonstrate that the emulsified bio-solution/palm-biodiesel/diesel blends have the advantage in saving energy and reducing emissions of both polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and particulate matter (PM) from diesel engines. When comparing with P0 (premium diesel fuel as base fuel), E16P20 fuel (16 vol% bio-solution + 20 vol% palm-biodiesel + 64 vol% P0, an additional 1 vol% surfactant) saved 12.4% fuel consumption and reduced emissions of PM by 90.1%, total PAHs by 69.3%, and total BaPeq (benzo[a]pyrene equivalent concentration) by 69.6%. Emulsified palm-biodiesel with bio-solution can be considered as a clean and alternative fuel. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is relatively unstable on storage and European biodiesel standard EN-14214 calls for determining oxidation stability at 110 °C with a minimum induction time of 6 h by the Rancimat method (EN-14112). According to proposed National Mission on biodiesel in India, we have undertaken studies on stability of biodiesel from tree borne non-edible oil seeds Jatropha. Neat Jatropha biodiesel exhibited oxidation stability of 3.95 h. It is found possible to meet the desired EN specification for neat Jatropha biodiesel and metal contaminated Jatropha biodiesel by using antioxidants; it will have a cost implication, as antioxidants are costly chemicals. Research was conducted to increase the oxidation stability of metal contaminated Jatropha biodiesel by doping metal deactivator with antioxidant, with varying concentrations in order to meet the aforementioned standard required for oxidation stability. It was found that usage of antioxidant can be reduced by 30-50%, therefore the cost, even if very small amount of metal deactivator is doped in Jatropha biodiesel to meet EN-14112 specification. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study focuses on improving source apportionment of carbonaceous aerosol in South Asia and consists of three parts: (1) development of novel molecular marker-based profiles for real-world biofuel combustion, (2) application of these profiles to a year-long data set, and (3) evaluation of profiles by an in-depth sensitivity analysis. Emissions profiles for biomass fuels were developed through source testing of a residential stove commonly used in South Asia. Wood fuels were combusted at high and low rates, which corresponded to source profiles high in organic carbon (OC) or high in elemental carbon (EC), respectively. Crop wastes common to the region, including rice straw, mustard stalk, jute stalk, soybean stalk, and animal residue burnings, were also characterized. Biofuel profiles were used in a source apportionment study of OC and EC in Godavari, Nepal. This site is located in the foothills of the Himalayas and was selected for its well-mixed and regionally impacted air masses. At Godavari, daily samples of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were collected throughout the year of 2006, and the annual trends in particulate mass, OC, and EC followed the occurrence of a regional haze in South Asia. Maximum concentrations occurred during the dry winter season and minimum concentrations occurred during the summer monsoon season. Specific organic compounds unique to aerosol sources, molecular markers, were measured in monthly composite samples. These markers implicated motor vehicles, coal combustion, biomass burning, cow dung burning, vegetative detritus, and secondary organic aerosol as sources of carbonaceous aerosol. A molecular marker-based chemical mass balance (CMB) model provided a quantitative assessment of primary source contributions to carbonaceous aerosol. The new profiles were compared to widely used biomass burning profiles from the literature in a sensitivity analysis. This analysis indicated a high degree of stability in estimates of source contributions to OC when different biomass profiles were used. The majority of OC was unapportioned to primary sources and was estimated to be of secondary origin, while biomass combustion was the next-largest source of OC. The CMB apportionment of EC to primary sources was unstable due to the diversity of biomass burning conditions in the region. The model results suggested that biomass burning and fossil fuel were important contributors to EC, but could not reconcile their relative contributions.

AB  - Neem oil methyl ester (NOME) was tested in 4-stroke single cylinder water cooled diesel engine. Brake thermal efficiency of NO 100 has been found 63.11 % higher than that of diesel at part load whereas it reduces 11.2% with diesel fuel at full load. As NOME is concerned, HC is reduced at all load condition, whereas smoke is also reduced at full load condition. NOx has reduced slightly at all load condition, and EGT showed increasing trend at full load condition. Other emissions (CO, CO2 and O2) do not contribute bad effect on engine. Thus, NOME can be a substitute for diesel fuel in diesel engine.

AB  - Piteaο, Sweden, has the world's first biofuels plant to produce renewable low-carbon automotive fuel. The project will demonstrate the production of an advanced diesel fuel, dimethylether (DME), from forest biomass over the black liquor route and also the use of this fuel in heavy vehicles in commercial service. The BioDME Project plant will be built by Chemrec with other aspects of the project to be built by consortium members. The gasification process step combines two objectives production of green liquor from black liquor and upgrade of the organic part of the black liquor to synthesis gas. The operating principle of the gasifier is partial oxidation with oxygen in an entrained flow reactor followed by quenching in two steps to saturation and subsequently gas cooling in a counter-current condenser. The BioDME project will not only be a technical demonstration but will also showcase the opportunity for the pulp and paper industry to play a major role in the production of high-value, high-performance biofuels from low quality forest and agricultural residues.

AB  - Column grand composite curves and the exergy loss profiles produced by the Column-Targeting Tool of the Aspen Plus simulator are used to assess the performance of the existing distillation columns, and reduce the costs of operation by appropriate retrofits in a biodiesel production plant. Effectiveness of the retrofits is assessed by means of thermodynamics and economic improvements. We have considered a biodiesel plant utilizing three distillation columns to purify biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester) and byproduct glycerol as well as reduce the waste. The assessments of the base case simulation have indicated the need for modifications for the distillation columns. For column T202, the retrofits consisting of a feed preheating and reflux ratio modification have reduced the total exergy loss by 47%, while T301 and T302 columns exergy losses decreased by 61% and 52%, respectively. After the retrofits, the overall exergy loss for the three columns has decreased from 7491.86 kW to 3627.97 kW. The retrofits required a fixed capital cost of approximately $239,900 and saved approximately $1,900,000/year worth of electricity. The retrofits have reduced the consumption of energy considerably, and leaded to a more environmentally friendly operation for the biodiesel plant considered.

AB  - Solar fuels from water and CO2 are a topic of current large scientific and industrial interest. Research advances on bioroutes, concentrated solar thermal and low-temperature conversion using semiconductors and a photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) approach, are critically discussed and compared in an attempt to define challenges and current limits and to identify the priorities on which focus research and development (R&amp;D). The need to produce fuels that are easy to transport and store, which can be integrated into the existing energy infrastructure, is emphasized. The role of solar fuels produced from CO2 in comparison with solar H2 is analyzed. Solar fuels are complementary to solar to electrical energy conversion, but they still need intensified R&amp;D before possible commercialization. © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

AB  - One of the most promising renewable fuels proposed as an alternative to fossil fuels is biodiesel. The competitive potential of biodiesel is limited by the price of vegetable oils, which strongly influences the final price of biofuels. An appropriate planning and design of the whole production process, from the seed to the biodiesel end product, is essential in order to contain the fallout of energy inefficiencies in the high price of the end product. This study focuses on the characteristics of the production process currently used to produce biodiesel. Refined vegetable oil can be converted into biodiesel by means of a great variety of techniques and technologies, many of which are still not suitable for application on an industrial scale. The solution of greatest interest is homogeneous alkaline transesterification with KOH and methanol. Even when dealing with this type of conversion, it is impossible to establish a universal pattern to describe the conversion or purification stages because there are various possible solutions that make each system different from another. When we look more closely at the state of the art in industrial biodiesel production plants, we also encounter the potential problems introduced by the type and characteristics of the raw materials. Comparing some of the reference solutions that have inspired numerous installations, an optimization analysis was conducted using ASPENPLUS 2006, for the modeling of the process, and modeFRONTIER 4.1 for the optimization procedure. The optimization analysis was carried out using a multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization in order to define the configuration of the main parameters that guarantee the best trade-off between the maximization of the purity of some important compounds and the minimization of energy requirements in the process. The results of this analysis were Pareto frontiers that identify a family of configurations which define the best trade-off between the objectives. Using the Pareto frontiers we then selected the configuration that requires the minimum energy consumption. Among these optimal configurations there is one which guarantees the lowest specific energy consumption while all the optimal configurations obtained respected the requirements of EN 14214, in terms of biodiesel quality.

AB  - This paper presents the exergy analysis results for the production of several biofuels, i.e., SNG (synthetic natural gas), methanol, Fischer-Tropsch fuels, hydrogen, as well as heat and electricity, from several biowastes generated in the Dutch province of Friesland, selected as one of the typical European regions. Biowastes have been classified in 5 virtual streams according to their ultimate and proximate analysis. All production chains have been modeled in Aspen Plus in order to analyze their technical performance. The common steps for all the production chains are: pre-treatment, gasification, gas cleaning, water-gas-shift reactions, catalytic reactors, final gas separation and upgrading. Optionally a gas turbine and steam turbines are used to produce heat and electricity from unconverted gas and heat removal, respectively. The results show that, in terms of mass conversion, methanol production seems to be the most efficient process for all the biowastes. SNG synthesis is preferred when exergetic efficiency is the objective parameter, but hydrogen process is more efficient when the performance is analyzed by means of the 1st Law of Thermodynamics. The main exergy losses account for the gasification section, except in the electricity and heat production chain, where the combined cycle is less efficient. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes a preliminary analysis of two technological routes (based on hydrolysis and on gasification + Fischer-Tropsch conversion process) of biofuels production from cellulosic materials. In this paper it was considered the integration of the two alternative routes to a conventional distillery of ethanol production based on fermentation of sugarcane juice. Sugarcane bagasse is the biomass considered as input in both second-generation routes. Results show that the integration of gasification + FT process to a conventional distillery is slightly more efficient (from an energetic point of view) and also offers the advantage of products diversification (ethanol from the conventional plant, plus diesel, gasoline and more surplus electricity regarding the hydrolysis route). Considering typical Brazilian conditions, at this stage it is not possible to foresee any significant advantage of any of the alternatives, but potentially the gasification route would have an advantage regarding avoided GHG emissions depending on the emission factor of the electric sector in which cogeneration units will be installed. © 2009.

AB  - The paper assesses the life cycle of biodiesel from used cooking oil (UCO). Such life cycle involves 4 stages: 1) collection, 2) pre-treatment, 3) delivery and 4) transesterification of UCO. Generally, UCO is collected from restaurants, food industries and recycling centres by authorised companies. Then, UCO is pre-treated to remove solid particles and water to increase its quality. After that, it is charged in cistern trucks and delivered to the biodiesel facility to be then transesterified with methanol to biodiesel. The production of 1 ton of biodiesel is evaluated by a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to assess the environmental impact and by an Exergetic Life Cycle Assessment (ELCA) to account for the exergy input to the system. A detailed list of material and energy inputs is done using data from local companies and completed using Ecoinvent 1.2 database. The results show that the transesterification stage causes 68% of the total environmental impact. The major exergy inputs are uranium and natural gas. If targets set by the Spanish Renewable Energy Plan are achieved, the exergy input for producing biodiesel would be reduced by 8% in the present system and consequently environmental impacts and exergy input reduced up to 36% in 2010. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Alternatives to fossil fuels require both appropriate technological development and subsequent adoption by consumers. While electric or hybrid automotives seem to be an international trend, the Brazilian automotive industry has instead pursued biofuels, i.e., ethanol and biodiesel. Notwithstanding its ecological advantages, certain negative elements may serve as a barrier to its widespread use, such as price, origin, and accessibility of both final product and raw materials. Using the new institutional economic framework, this study aims to identify factors that influence decision-making for the Brazilian economic agents. The study was conducted using document analysis and in-depth interviews with consumers, private agents, and experts related to biofuel production. We conclude that the Brazilian experiences with ethanol and biodiesel differ significantly from one another; the first has reached a mature level of sustainability, while the second is still dependent on institutional initiatives in order to develop fully. Implications and possible future generalisations of the Brazilian experience to other countries are discussed. Copyright © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is receiving increasing attention as a partial substitute for home heating oil. The properties that make it a suitable fuel for use in diesel engines also make it suitable for heating systems using pressure jet burner technology. In the UK, however, there are a significant number of vaporising burners whose suitability for operation with biodiesel has not been properly studied. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate the use of different blends of biodiesel and kerosene in a production Aga that employed a sleeve-type vaporising burner. It was found that significant fouling of the burner well would occur within a short period of time, even with a blend as low as 5% by volume of biodiesel in kerosene. Further investigation revealed the build-up to consist of polymerised biodiesel, most likely triggered by heat. Factors contributing to the rate and extent of fouling are thought to include the type of vegetable oil used as feedstock for the biodiesel, as well as the degree of prior utilisation of the feedstock oil. Further investigation is warranted, possibly with the use of suitable fuel additives to inhibit the polymerisation process. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Some of the measures that are involved in scrambling biofuels to meet regulated demand are discussed. The EU has set a directive to obtain 5.75% of transportation fuel needs from biofuels by 2010. The UK has announced the Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation (RFTO) that requires petrol stations to offer minimum of B5 diesel by 2010. The existing regulations limit FAME contamination of jet fuel at less than 5mg per kg. A number of organizations and aircraft manufacturers are testing to examine the potential of increasing the limit to 100 mg per kg without causing adverse impact on safety, reliability, performance, or operatibility.

AB  - The switch to low-sulfur fuels, either particular grades of HFO or distillates, will begin to take effect in 2010, but alternatives offering even lower emissions, e.g., fuel cells and renewables, are still being seriously investigated. Wärtsilä's dual-fuel version of its smallest medium speed unit, the 20, is described. The company offers ship owners and operators a compact unit that brings fuel flexibility to auxiliary applications, such as generating sets, or as the prime mover in smaller vessels. Like the 32DF and 50DF, the 2ODF can run on natural gas, marine diesel oil (MDO), HFO, and biofuels, thereby providing maximum flexibility in fuel choice. The company claims that when a DF engine is running in gas mode, CO2 emissions are about 20% lower since natural gas has a lower carbon content than liquid fuels. Wärtsilä's lean-burn combustion technology results in low emission values and high engine efficiency. However, the switch to low-sulfur fuels is putting higher pressure on lubricant suppliers. Castrol has recognized that there is a widening skills gap onboard current vessels, which could lead to problems in selecting the correct lubricants, and launched a training aid program, Castrol Academy, designed to be used onboard or by companies' own training establishments. The system comprises a number of modules covering basic marine engineering as well as specific lubrication courses. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil has launched a program of seminars designed to help ship operators reduce overall lubricant costs and meet environmental challenges. The company also launched its detecting asphaltene contamination oil analysis program, which can prolong cylinder life and significantly save lubricant costs in four-stroke engines, in which residual fuel contamination is a problem that is growing with lower fuel quality and lower sulfur content.

AB  - As a renewable energy, biofuel has attracted great attention in China and the rest of world. Concerned with the national food security, China recently has shifted its biofuel development priority from grain-based to non-grain-based biofuels, including forest-based biodiesel, since 2007. Jatropha curcas is one of major biodiesel feedstocks. However, there is rising debate on availability of land for expanding Jatropha curcas areas. The overall goal of this paper is to evaluate potential land for Jatropha curcas used as feedstock for biodiesel in China. Based on remote sensing data on land use, data on meteorological, soil and land slope, and suitable environment for Jatropha curcas plantation, this study uses Agro Ecological Zone method and considers social-economic constraints to evaluate potential suitable land for Jatropha curcas plantation in China's major Jatropha curcas production region, Southwest China. The results show that while there are some potential lands to expand Jatropha curcas areas, amount of these lands will hardly meet the government's target for Jatropha curcas-based biodiesels development in the future. China may need to reconsider its long-term targets on the development of Jatropha curcas-based biodiesels. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.

AB  - Biodiesel, as an alternative fuel is steadily gaining attention to replace petroleum diesel partially or completely. The tribological performance of biodiesel is crucial for its application in automobiles. In the present study, effect of temperature on the tribological performance of palm biodiesel was investigated by using four ball wear machine. Tests were conducted at temperatures 30, 45, 60 and 75 °C, under a normal load of 40 kg for 1 h at speed 1200 rpm. For each temperature, the tribological properties of petroleum diesel (B0) and three biodiesel blends like B10, B20, B50 were investigated and compared. During the wear test, frictional torque was recorded on line. Wear scars in tested ball were investigated by optical microscopy. Results show that friction and wear increase with increasing temperature. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Among the alternative fuels, biodiesel and its blends are considered suitable and the most promising fuel for diesel engine. The properties of biodiesel are found similar to that of diesel. Many researchers have experimentally evaluated the performance characteristics of conventional diesel engines fuelled by biodiesel and its blends. However, experiments require enormous effort, money and time. Hence, a cycle simulation model incorporating a thermodynamic based single zone combustion model is developed to predict the performance of diesel engine. The effect of engine speed and compression ratio on brake power and brake thermal efficiency is analysed through the model. The fuel considered for the analysis are diesel, 20%, 40%, 60% blending of diesel and biodiesel derived from Karanja oil (Pongamia Glabra). The model predicts similar performance with diesel, 20% and 40% blending. However, with 60% blending, it reveals better performance in terms of brake power and brake thermal efficiency. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous culture of the freshwatermicroalga Choricystisminor was investigated for possible use in producing lipid feedstock for making biofuels. The effects of temperature (10-30 °C) and dilution rate (0.005-0.017 h-1) on lipid productivity in a nutrient sufficient medium in a 4 L stirred tank bioreactor under continuous illumination at an incident irradiance level of 550 μE·m-2s-1 and a controlled pH of 6 under carbon dioxide supplemented conditions are reported. RESULTS: The maximum lipid productivity was 82mg L-1 d-1 at 25 °C and a dilution rate of 0.014 h-1. Lipid contents of the biomasswere 21.3±1.7 g per 100 g of dry biomass, irrespective of the culture temperature and dilution rate. After the biomass had been grown in nutrient sufficient conditions in continuous culture, it was recovered and subjected to various postharvest treatments. With the best postharvest treatment, the neutral lipid contents of the algal biomass were raised∼6-fold relative to untreated biomass. CONCLUSION: At 82 mg L -1 d-1, or 21 000 L ha-1 year-1, the lipid productivity of C. minor was nearly four times the lipid productivity of oil palm, a highly productive crop. Therefore, C. minor is potentially a good source of renewable lipid feedstock for biofuels. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Particle emissions, volatility, and the concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were investigated for a pre-Euro I compression ignition engine to study the potential health impacts of employing ethanol fumigation technology. Engine testing was performed in two separate experimental campaigns with most testing performed at intermediate speed with four different load settings and various ethanol substitutions. A scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) was used to determine particle size distributions, a volatilization tandem differential mobility analyzer (V-TDMA)wasused to explore particle volatility, and a new profluorescent nitroxide probe, BPEAnit, was used to investigate the potential toxicity of particles. The greatest particulate mass reduction was achieved with ethanol fumigation at full load, which contributed to the formation of a nucleation mode. Ethanol fumigation increased the volatility of particles by coating the particles with organic material or by making extra organic material available as an external mixture. In addition, the particle-related ROS concentrations increased with ethanol fumigation and were associated with the formation of a nucleation mode. The smaller particles, the increased volatility, and the increase in potential particle toxicity with ethanol fumigation may provide a substantial barrier for the uptake of fumigation technology using ethanol as a supplementary fuel. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - An experimental investigation was conducted to evaluate the effects of using methanol as additive to biodiesel-diesel blends on the engine performance, emissions and combustion characteristics of a direct injection diesel engine under variable operating conditions. BD50 (50% biodiesel and 50% diesel in vol.) was prepared as the baseline fuel. Methanol was added to BD50 as an additive by volume percent of 5% and 10% (denoted as BDM5 and BDM10). The results indicate that the combustion starts later for BDM5 and BDM10 than for BD50 at low engine load, but is almost identical at high engine load. At low engine load of 1500 r/min, BDM5 and BDM10 show the similar peak cylinder pressure and peak of pressure rise rate to BD50, and higher peak of heat release rate than that of BD50. At low engine load of 1800 r/min, the peak cylinder pressure and the peak of pressure rise rate of BDM5 and BDM10 are lower than those of BD50, and the peak of heat release rate is similar to that of BD50. The crank angles at which the peak values occur are later for BDM5 and BDM10 than for BD50. At high engine load, the peak cylinder pressure, the peak of pressure rise rate and peak of heat release rate of BDM5 and BDM10 are higher than those of BD50, and the crank angle of peak values for all tested fuels are almost same. The power and torque outputs of BDM5 and BDM10 are slightly lower than those of BD50. BDM5 and BDM10 show dramatic reduction of smoke emissions. CO emissions are slightly lower, and NOx and HC emissions are almost similar to those of BD50 at speed characteristic of full engine load. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, a photosynthesis-fermentation model was proposed to merge the positive aspects of autotrophs and heterotrophs. Microalga Chlorella protothecoides was grown autotrophically for CO2 fixation and then metabolized heterotrophically for oil accumulation. Compared to typical heterotrophic metabolism, 69% higher lipid yield on glucose was achieved at the fermentation stage in the photosynthesis-fermentation model. An elementary flux mode study suggested that the enzyme Rubisco-catalyzed CO2 re-fixation, enhancing carbon efficiency from sugar to oil. This result may explain the higher lipid yield. In this new model, 61.5% less CO2 was released compared with typical heterotrophic metabolism. Immunoblotting and activity assay further showed that Rubisco functioned in sugar-bleaching cells at the fermentation stage. Overall, the photosynthesis-fermentation model with double CO2 fixation in both photosynthesis and fermentation stages, enhances carbon conversion ratio of sugar to oil and thus provides an efficient approach for the production of algal lipid. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Three types of cation-exchange resins (NKC-9, 001 × 7 and D61) as solid acid catalysts were employed to prepare biodiesel from acidified oils generated from waste frying oils. The results show that the catalytic activity of NKC-9 was higher than that of 001 × 7 and D61. The conversion of the esterification by NKC-9 increased with increasing in the amount of catalyst, reaction temperature and time and methanol/oil molar ratio. The maximal conversion of reaction is approximately 90.0%. Furthermore, NKC-9 resin exhibits good reusability. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis reveals that the production is simplex and mainly composed of C16:0 (palmitic), C18:2 (linoleic), and C18:1 (oleic) acids of methyl ester, respectively. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An integrated supercritical fluid technology with power cogeneration to produce biodiesel fuels, with no need for the costly separations involved with the conventional technology, is proposed, documented for technical and economic feasibility, and preliminarily designed. The core of the integrated system consists of the transesterification of various triglyceride sources (e.g., vegetable oils and animal fats) with supercritical methanol/ethanol. Part of the reaction products can be combusted by a diesel power generator integrated in the system which, in turn, provides the power needed to pressurize the system and the heat of the exhaust gases necessary in the transesterification step. The latter energy demand can also be satisfied by a fired heater, especially for higher plant capacities. Different versions of this system can be implemented based on the main target of the technology: biodiesel production or diesel engine applications, including power generation. The process options considered for biodiesel fuel production estimate break-even processing costs of biodiesel as low as $0.26/gal ($0.07/L) with a diesel power generator and $0.35/gal ($0.09/L) with a fired heater for a plant capacity of 15,000 gal/day (56,775 L/day). Both are significantly lower than the current processing costs of approximately $0.51/gal ($0.13/L) of biodiesel produced by conventional catalytic methods. A retail cost of biodiesel produced by the proposed method is likely to be competitive with the prices of diesel fuels. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The catalytic (homogeneous) hydrogenation of biodiesel's polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), synthesized by transesterification of vegetable (cotton seed) oil, selectively to monounsaturated FAME, could upgrade the final quality of biodiesel. The final fuel can be optimized to have a higher cetane number and improved oxidative stability. The low-temperature performance after hydrogenation (CFPP) might be worst, but this, could be further improved through selective wintering and/or blending. The homogeneous hydrogenation of FAMEs of cotton seed biodiesel was catalyzed by the catalyst precursor RhCl3 3H20 and STPP-TiOA. Four groups of hydrogenation experiments were carried out regarding the effects of pressure, temperature, reaction time and molecular ratio C@C/Rh. Partial hydrogenation of cotton seed FAMEs took place under mild conditions of pressure and temperature and high catalytic activities were observed in very short reaction times, and for high molecular ratios C@C/Rh. Biodiesel's quality optimization studies, based on existing empirical models of biodiesel properties, were carried out in order to identify optimum FAME compositions and those hydrogenation conditions that could possibly supply them. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fuel cells are inherently ultra clean, highly efficient, and reliable. Biodiesel and methanol can be used in a blend with conventional fuels without engine modification or without being as pure as a fuel. Biodiesel fueled cell is a variation of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell. The biodiesel fueled cell and direct methanol fuel cell are extremely promising power sources for portable applications due to their simple handling and processing of fuel.

AB  - In this study, characterization of Oriental beech wood (Fagus orientalis) with Turkish origin was investigated with aspect of structural, chemical, and thermochemical conversional properties. Liquefaction, supercritical fluid extraction, and pyrolysis of the samples were studied to obtain liquid fuel oils and chemicals. Beech wood was partly converted to liquefaction products in glycerol. The conversion products were 19.4, 32.3, and 64.6% by weight at 523, 543, and 563 K, respectively. The liquefaction yield sharply increased with increasing the temperature near critical temperature and after that. Ethanol is the best solvent for supercritical fluid extraction at lower temperatures. In the pyrolysis, increases of liquid yields are considerably sharp for all of the samples with increasing of pyrolysis temperature from 695 to 720 K. The highest increase of liquid yield was obtained from the beech wood sample with +0.063 mm particle size in the pyrolysis conditions. The maximum liquid yield was 36.3% at 720 K.

AB  - Biofuel production has been expanding for more than five years, leading to an increasing number of production sites worldwide and also to a tremendous diversification of processes and approaches to producing biofuel. Such a fast move in industry has sometimes proven in the past to potentially lead to underestimating safety management needs. The significant number of existing facilities producing so called first generation biofuel allows for a reasonable survey of safety issues from incidents. In 2006, INERIS initiated research work devoted to the analysis of safety-related issues including the implementation of an incidents database. Its purpose is to collect known and reasonably well documented incidents (explosions, fires, spills, derailments, and road accidents) that relate to the life cycle of biofuel supply chains. This paper focuses on the analysis of this database, which contains 100 incidents that occurred from January 2000 to early 2009. From the database, an attempt has been made to identify the root factors of incidents potentially impacting biofuel supply chains, using statistical methods like multiple correspondence analysis and ascendant hierarchical clustering. This multivariate analysis exercise has led us to identify five main incident typologies, which in turn allows us to draw appropriate information on safety issues pertaining to first-generation biofuel supply chains. Each typology is illustrated by actual cases of accidents. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels composed by fatty acid methyl esters are widely used as partly substituting fuels for diesel fossil fuels. Additionally, it is expected that the diesel biofuel norms will be extended to ethyl esters produced from bioethanol in the upcoming years. A precise knowledge of the standard enthalpy of formation is necessary for the calculation of some parameters useful for the analysis of the combustion process and emissions of a diesel engine operating with different fuels, such as the heating value, the adiabatic flame temperature or the kinetic mechanisms. However, experimental data for this property are scarce, and only available for short-chain, saturated methyl esters. In this work, four estimation methods for the calculation of the enthalpy of formation are examined and compared. Three of them are simple methods based on groups or bonds contribution, and another one is a computational method (with Gaussian 03 software). After presenting the implementation rules for each of them, conclusions are stated based on the results attained. Gaussian and Benson-Groups methods seem to be more accurate in predicting the actual values of the enthalpy of formation, both methods considering the separation between double bonds and the edge effects in the molecule. However, only the Gaussian method considers the effect of the position of the double bond in the molecule for all the unsaturated esters. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vegetable oils have an energy content suitable for use as a fuel in diesel engines. Some of these oils have already been evaluated as substitutes for diesel fuels. However, several operational and durability problems of using straight vegetable oils in diesel engines have been reported in the literature, caused by their relatively higher viscosity and low volatility compared to mineral diesel. This viscosity can be brought into the acceptable range by transesterification, by blending of vegetable oil with diesel, or by preheating the vegetable oil using the waste heat of exhaust gases. The reduction in the viscosity by blending or exhaust gas preheating saves the processing cost incurred in the transesterification process involving expensive chemicals. Experimental investigations were carried out for the combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of heated Karanja oil in a direct-injection compression ignition engine at different loads at a constant engine speed of 1500r/min. Analysis of the cylinder pressure rise, instantaneous heat release, and cumulative heat release was carried out. Combustion phasing of preheated Karanja oil was found to be identical with that of mineral diesel. Heating the vegetable oil substantially reduces the combustion duration. The brake specific fuel consumption and exhaust gas temperatures for heated Karanja oil were found to be higher than mineral diesel. The thermal efficiency was slightly lower for heated Karanja oil than for diesel. The carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and nitric oxide emissions were lower for heated Karanja oil than for diesel. © IMechE 2010.

AB  - Straight vegetable oil utilization as a diesel engine fuel has the advantages of eliminating the energy, time, and cost involved in biodiesel production. Since straight vegetable oils have quite high viscosity compared with mineral diesel, they have to be modified to bring their combustion-related properties closer to mineral diesel. In this experimental study, a heat exchanger was designed and used to utilize the waste heat of exhaust gases for reducing the viscosity of Karanja oil by preheating. Carbon deposits, wear of vital engine components, and various effects of utilizing preheated Karanja oil on lubricating oil were analysed during a long-term endurance test executed for 512h. Carbon deposits on various critical parts of the power cell were analysed by visual inspection. For pistons, the piston merit rating was determined. The effect on a lubricating oil because of heated Karanja oil vis-à-vis mineral diesel was evaluated by comparing the densities, viscosities, flash points, carbon residues, ash contents, copper corrosion effect and pentane, benzene insolubility measurements at intervals of every 128h for 512h. The wear of the cylinder liner, piston rings, gudgeon pin, and small- and big-end bearings for a Karanja-oil-fuelled engine were also measured and compared vis-à-vis mineral diesel-fuelled engine. © IMechE 2010.

Neat apricot seed kernel oil methyl ester and its blends with diesel fuel were tested in a compression ignition diesel engine to evaluate performance and emissions. Apricot seed kernel oil methyl ester and its blends can be successfully used in diesel engines without any modification. Lower concentration of apricot seed kernel oil methyl ester in blends gives a better improvement in the engine performance and exhaust emissions. Therefore lower percent of apricot seed kernel oil methyl ester can be used as additive. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the near future, the lignocellulosic C4 crops Miscanthus and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) are unlikely to outcompete sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) in net energetic yearly yield of transport biofuel ha-1. This holds both for the thermochemical conversion into liquid hydrocarbons and the enzymatic conversion into ethanol. Currently, Miscanthus and switchgrass would also not seem able to outcompete corn (Zea mays) in net energetic yearly yield of liquid transport biofuel ha-1, but further development of these lignocellulosic crops may gradually lead to a different outcome. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Soybean oil was transesterified using various mixtures of methanol and ethanol at a constant molar ratio of alcohol to oil of 12:1 in the presence of 1 wt% potassium hydroxide catalyst at 30 °C for 60 min. The effect of mixtures of methanol and ethanol on percentage yields and fuel properties of soybean oil methyl and ethyl esters (SME/SEE) was studied. The formation of methyl esters was faster in comparison to ethyl esters, as evidenced by a molar ratio of methyl to ethyl esters of 1.7:1 in the case of a 1:1 mixture of methanol and ethanol. High yields (94.6-97.9%) were obtained for all molar ratios of reactants studied. The resultant SME/SEE mixtures prepared from a methanol to ethanol molar ratio of 1:2 or greater exhibited enhanced low temperature properties and oxidative stability, as well as superior lubricity in comparison to neat SME. All other ratios that contained a higher percentage of methanol displayed similar behavior to pure SME. These results indicate that the fuel properties of soybean oil-based biodiesel can be improved by substituting a portion of the methanol reagent with ethanol during transesterification, albeit at higher production cost as a result of the higher price of ethanol versus methanol. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Oil analysis and antimicrobial activity from seeds of elite genotype of Pongamia pinnata was carried out in the current study. The highest oil yield (33%) from seeds was recovered in n-Hexane. Physico-chemical properties of crude oil established suitability of P. pinnata for its use as a potential biofuel crop. The total mono unsaturated fatty acid (oleic acid 46%) present in seed oil was more in comparison to polyunsaturated fatty acid (33%) as analyzed by GC-MS. Seed oil also showed inhibition against the tested fungal and bacterial cultures. However, the efficacy of antimicrobial activity of the seed oil at four concentration levels (50%, 80%, 90% and 100%) against various pathogenic indicators was found to be concentration-dependent. The obtained results confirmed the use of seed oil from well characterized elite genotype of Pongamia as diesel fuel and in pharmaceuticals. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L., a multipurpose, drought resistant, perennial plant belonging to Euphorbiaceae family has gained lot of importance for the production of biodiesel. The properties of the crop and its oil have persuaded investors, policy makers and clean development mechanism (CDM) project developers to consider Jatropha as a substitute for fossil fuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, basic agronomic properties of Jatropha are not thoroughly understood and the environmental effects have not been investigated yet. Grey literature reports are very optimistic on simultaneous wasteland reclamation capability and oil yields. Studies were undertaken at Solar Energy Centre, Gurgaon, India to evaluate the plant performance under different agro-practices with special reference to irrigation scheduling, VAM and biofertilizers' applications, plant spacing, pruning trials for maximizing tree architecture and higher biomass. Parallel experiments were undertaken to understand the scope of J. curcas for intercropping practices in the under storey of dominating monoculture tree stands (Prosopis, Acacia and Neem). © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the results of an environmental impact assessment of biodiesel production from soybean in Brazil. In order to achieve this objective, environmental impact indicators provided by Emergy Accounting (EA), Embodied Energy Analysis (EEA) and Material Flow Accounting (MFA) were used. The results showed that for one liter of biodiesel 8.8 kg of topsoil are lost in erosion, besides the cost of 0.2 kg of fertilizers, about 5.2 m2 of crop area, 7.33 kg of abiotic materials, 9.0 tons of water and 0.66 kg of air and about 0.86 kg of CO2 were released. About 0.27 kg of crude oil equivalent is required as inputs to produce one liter of biodiesel, which means an energy return of 2.48 J of biodiesel per Joule of fossil fuel invested. The transformity of biodiesel (3.90E + 05 seJ J-1) is higher than those calculated for fossil fuels as other biofuels, indicating a higher demand for direct and indirect environmental support. Similarly, the biodiesel emergy yield ratio (1.62) indicates that a very low net emergy is delivered to consumers, compared to alternatives. Obtained results show that when crop production and industrial conversion to fuel are supported by fossil fuels in the form of chemicals, goods, and process energy, the fraction of fuel that can actually be considered renewable is very low (around 31%). © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The preparation of a Li-doped MgO for biodiesel synthesis has been investigated by optimizing the catalyst composition and calcination temperatures. The results show that the formation of strong base sites is particularly promoted by the addition of Li, thus resulting in an increase of the biodiesel synthesis. The catalyst with the Li/Mg molar ratio of 0.08 and calcination temperature of 823 K exhibits the best performance. The biodiesel conversion decreases with further increasing Li/Mg molar ratio above 0.08, which is most likely attributed to the separated lithium hydroxide formed by excess Li ions and a concomitant decrease of BET values. In addition, the effects of methanol/oil molar ratio, reaction time, catalyst amount, and catalyst stability were also investigated for the optimized Li-doped MgO. The metal leaching from the Li-doped MgO catalysts was detected, indicating more studies are needed to stabilize the catalysts for its application in the large-scale biodiesel production facilities. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel was derived from okra (Hibiscus esculentus) seed oil by methanol-induced transesterification using an alkali catalyst. Transesterification of the tested okra seed oil under optimum conditions: 7:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, 1.00% (w/w) NaOCH3 catalyst, temperature 65 °C and 600 rpm agitation intensity exhibited 96.8% of okra oil methyl esters (OOMEs) yield. The OOMEs/biodiesel produced was analyzed by GC/MS, which showed that it mainly consisted of four fatty acids: linoleic (30.31%), palmitic (30.23%), oleic (29.09%) and stearic (4.93%). A small amount of 2-octyl cyclopropaneoctanoic acid with contribution 1.92% was also established. Fuel properties of OOMEs such as density, kinematic viscosity, cetane number, oxidative stability, lubricity, flash point, cold flow properties, sulfur contents and acid value were comparable with those of ASTM D 6751 and EN 14214, where applicable. It was concluded that okra seed oil is an acceptable feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Microalga Chlorella protothecoides can grow heterotrophically with glucose as the carbon source and accumulate high proportion of lipids. The microalgal lipids are suitable for biodiesel production. To further increase lipid yield and reduce biodiesel cost, sweet sorghum juice was investigated as an alternative carbon source to glucose in the present study. When the initial reducing sugar concentration was 10 g L-1 in the culture medium, the dry cell yield and lipid content were 5.1 g L-1 and 52.5% using enzymatic hydrolyzates of sweet sorghum juice as the carbon source after 120 h-culture in flasks. The lipid yield was 35.7% higher than that using glucose. When 3.0 g L-1 yeast extract was added to the medium, the dry cell yield and lipid productivity was increased to 1.2 g L-1 day-1 and 586.8 mg L-1 day-1. Biodiesel produced from the lipid of C. protothecoides through acid catalyzed transesterification was analyzed by GC-MS, and the three most abundant components were oleic acid methyl ester, cetane acid methyl ester and linoleic acid methyl ester. The results indicate that sweet sorghum juice could effectively enhance algal lipid production, and its application may reduce the cost of algae-based biodiesel. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Dual-fuelling in compression-ignition (CI) engines is a mode of combustion where a small pilot injection of high-cetane fuel (i.e. diesel) ignites a premixed high-octane fuel (i.e. methane) and air mixture. This allows conventional CI engines to lower their emissions of smoke and nitrogen oxides (NOx) while maintaining their high thermal efficiencies. However, poor ignitability of the main fuel-air charge results in increased emissions of unburnt hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO). Conventional pilot fuels such as diesel and biodiesel (methyl esters transesterified from raw plant oil) have been researched extensively in prior work, showing that in terms of performance and emissions they perform fairly similarly. This is because the physical, chemical and combustion properties of various methyl esters are comparable to those of conventional diesel. In order to reduce these emissions of HC and CO, alternative pilot fuels need to be considered. As fuels employed during normal CI engine operation, both dimethyl ether (DME, a gaseous CI engine fuel) and water-in-fuel emulsions (conventional biodiesel mixed with varying concentrations of water) have shown that they reduce smoke and NOx emissions significantly, while improving combustion quality. In this work, the performance of DME and water-in-biodiesel emulsions as pilot fuels was assessed. It was seen that the water-in-biodiesel emulsions did not perform as well as expected, as increased HC and CO emissions coupled with a mild change in NOx levels was encountered (compared to conventional pilot fuel, in this case neat biodiesel). The emulsions performed very poorly as pilot fuels below a certain BMEP threshold. DME, while producing higher levels of HC and CO than neat biodiesel, managed to reduce NOx significantly compared to neat biodiesel. Emissions of HC and CO, while higher than neat biodiesel, were not as high as levels seen with the emulsions. Thermal efficiency levels were generally maintained with the liquid pilot fuels, with the DME pilot producing comparatively lower levels. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel production from palm oil has been considered one of the most promising renewable resources for transportation fuel in Thailand. The objective of this study was to analyze the energy performance and potential of the palm oil methyl ester (PME) production in Thailand. The PME system was divided into four stages: the oil palm plantation, transportation, crude palm oil (CPO) production, and transesterification into biodiesel. The results showed that the highest fossil-based energy consumption was in the transesterification process, followed by the plantation, transportation, and CPO production. A net energy value and net energy ratio (NER) of 24.0 MJ/FU and 2.5, respectively, revealed that the PME system was quite energy efficient. In addition, if all the by-products from the CPO production (such as empty fruit branches, palm kernel shells, and biogas) were considered in terms of energy sources, the NER would be more than 3.0. The PME can be a viable substitute for diesel and can decrease the need for oil imports. Based on B100 demand in 2008, PME can be substituted for 478 million liters of diesel. Moreover, with palm oil output potential and B5 implementation, it can be substituted for 1134 million liters of diesel. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The last 20 years efforts to find a long-term and large-scale biofuel alternative to petrol and diesel for the transport sector have been intensified with a focus on liquid biofuels, such as ethanol, methanol and Fischer-Tropsh diesel derived from wood. The large-scale production of biomethane has so far largely been overlooked in comparative studies that focus on the long-term renewable options. The aim of this article fills this gap and to provide a broad and systematic assessment of the future potential of biomethane compared to other biofuels. In order to become a large-scale option, biomethane production from woody biomass via gasification needs to be developed and commercialized. However, biomethane exhibits a clear development path with relatively low financial and technical risks starting with local solutions utilizing wet biomass resources towards medium and eventually large-scale gasification with economics similar to liquid second generation biofuels. The disadvantage of being a gaseous fuel is not insurmountable and can furthermore be relaxed by the integration and dual-use of the existing distribution system for natural gas. This assessment concludes that more emphasize should be given to biomethane as a large-scale option given the opportunity to use woody biomass from gasification. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass integrated gasification combined cycle (BIGCC) plants could, in combined heat and power (CHP) generation, increase the power-to-heat ratio compared to conventional biomass steam turbine plants. Furthermore, biomass gasification could also be used for the efficient production of biofuels for transport. In this study, different applications of biomass gasification in connection to district heating (DH) are analysed and contrasted to conventional technology options. An application of the cost-optimizing energy system model MARKAL with a detailed description of the DH sector in a southwestern region of Sweden was developed within the study and used in the analysis. Policy measures for CO2 reduction and for promotion of "green" electricity are assumed, and required subsidy levels for large-scale production of transport biofuels are calculated. The model also operates with different supplies of biomass: a local supply at a lower cost and an international supply of refined biomass at a slightly higher cost. The study shows that investments in BIGCC CHP are often cost-efficient in cases with low ambitions regarding transport biofuels. However, due to limitations in heat demand and in local, lower cost, supply of biomass, investment in biofuel production means less investment in BIGCC CHP and, thereby, a smaller electricity production. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels nowadays are an important topic of study. The most significant point is the availability of bioethanol or biodiesel and their production from different raw materials. It is already known that large-scale production of first-generation biodiesel cannot be seen as an alternative to fossil fuels due to land requirements, competition with food, increase in fertilizer requirements and pressure on tropical forests among others. This fact does not necessarily apply to second-generation biofuels or small-scale niche productions. Straight vegetable oil (SVO) can be used directly in diesel engines with minor modifications. Our proposal is a small-scale SVO production system for self-supply in agricultural machinery. In this paper a model to provide SVO to local farmers in a specific area in Catalonia (Spain) is presented. We also present a discussion about the regulations to be changed in order to make possible the incorporation of SVO as engine fuel in diesel vehicles and a comparative analysis between the emissions of tractors fed with SVO and petrodiesel. Moreover, a quantitative economic analysis of modifying diesel engines and long-term operability costs are shown and a first-run economic analysis comparing the actual crop rotation with the proposed one and some alternatives is studied. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The introduction of biofuels from biomass for transport purposes in an energy system model shows that bioethanol and vegetable oil can compete with oil products without subsidies provided prices of imported energy carriers are high, i.e. crude oil prices around $ 100/bbl. About half of the biomass will be used for motor fuel substitutes, whose share of the final energy in the transportation sector will increase to 10% in 2030. This gives rise to a nearly 9% drop in CO2 emissions in the transportation sector as compared to an emission balance where all real local emissions are fully counted. Despite a strong enhancement of biomass and biomass fuels and quite high prices for oil and gas up to 2030, BtL products like synthetic gasoline and diesel from biomass do not play an important part in the model results unless fairly high penalties are set for CO2 emissions. In the case of global CO2 penalties below € 300 / tCO2, the use of biomass will even shift away from vehicle fuel production to biomass power plants and CHP. A CO2 penalty above € 100 / tCO2 in the transportation sector only, will, however, trigger the production of liquids and synthesis gases from biomass for use as BtL. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Given its importance as a practical phenomenon underlying the progress of learning technologies, attention should be paid to the role of subsidisation in learning theory, particularly in the case of nascent climate-related sociable learning technologies, in order to examine its benefits. Thus, this study focuses on subsidy procurement of energy technologies in several economies in the context of the component learning track in endogenous global clusters in order to suggest improvements to the adoption mechanism and examine the climate stabilization constraint. At the same time, the study attempts to determine the global progress ratio of the lithium-ion battery in order to analyse various endogenous learning scenarios for hybrid technologies. An integrated energy system model with highly disaggregated global regions (DNE21+) is used to execute this research in a medium time frame. Subsidisation of the learning track of battery technology encourages greater development of plug-in hybrid vehicles, promotes early diffusion of hybrid technologies, and relieves heavy dependency on crude oil and biofuels. The subsidies in the common learning domains in few economies benefit the nearby economies because of the technology spillover that occurs through numerous cross-feedback learning mechanisms. Endogenous learning with subsidies augments diffusion potentials, abates emissions, and shifts sectoral emissions. Crown Copyright © 2009.

AB  - For a better understanding of the chemistry involved during the combustion of components of diesel fuel, the structure of a laminar lean premixed methane flame doped with n-propylcyclohexane has been investigated. The inlet gases contained 7.1% (molar) methane, 36.8% oxygen, and 0.81% n-propylcyclohexane (C9H18), corresponding to an equivalence ratio of 0.68 and a C9H18/CH4 ratio of 11.4%. The flame has been stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa (50 Torr) using argon as diluent, with a gas velocity at the burner of 49.2 cm/s at 333 K. Quantified species included the usual methane C0-C2 combustion products, but also 17 C3-C5 hydrocarbons, seven C1-C3 oxygenated compounds, and only four cyclic C6+ compounds, namely benzene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, cyclohexene, and methylenecyclohexane. A new mechanism for the oxidation of n-propylcyclohexane has been proposed. It allows the proper simulation of profiles of most of the products measured in flames, as well as the satisfactory reproduction of experimental results obtained in a jet-stirred reactor. The main reaction pathways of consumption of n-propylcyclohexane have been derived from rate-of-production analysis. © 2009 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - To meet long-term environmental and energy security goals, the United States must reduce petroleum use in the light-duty vehicle fleet by 70% and greenhouse gas emissions by a factor of ten compared to business-as-usual growth projections for the year 2050. A wedge-based approach was used to quantify the scope of the problem in real terms, and to develop options for meeting mid-century targets. Four mitigation mechanisms were considered: (1) improvements in near-term vehicle technologies; (2) emphasis on low-carbon biofuels; (3) de-carbonization of the electric grid; and (4) demand-side travel-reduction initiatives. Projections from previous studies were used to characterize the potential of individual mitigation mechanisms, which were then integrated into a light-duty vehicle fleet model; particular emphasis was given to systemic constraints on scale and rates of change. Based on these projections, two different greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation implementation plans were considered ("evolutionary" and "aggressive"). Fleet model projections indicate that both the evolutionary and aggressive approaches can effectively end US dependence on foreign oil, but achieving an 80% GHG reduction requires changes that extend significantly beyond even the aggressive case, which was projected to achieve a 65% reduction. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The diesel fuel was mixed with the rice husk bio-oil using some emulsifiers based on the theory of Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance (HLB). The lubricity of the bio-oil/diesel fuel blend was studied on a High Frequency Reciprocating Test Rig (HFRR) according to ASTM D 6079-2004. The microscopic topography and chemical composition on the worn surface were analyzed respectively using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The profile and surface roughness of the rubbed trace were measured using a profilometer. The chemical group and composition were studied by a Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR). The results showed that the lubrication ability of the present fuel blend was better than that of the Chinese conventional diesel fuel (number zero). However, the anti-corrosion and anti-wear properties of the fuel blend were not satisfactory in comparison with those of conventional diesel fuel. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biofuel development has gained the attention of researchers in recent years owing to the rate of depletion of fossil fuels. Several processes are currently employed in the conventional production of different biofuels: the production of biodiesel is catalytically performed either through the transesterification of triglycerides using alcohol or the deoxygenative ecofining of triglycerides in a non-alcohol environment; bio-oil is produced by the pyrolysis of biomass; bio-ethanol is produced by the fermentation of sugars obtained from starch or cellulosic based biomass, while bio-gasoline is produced from the catalytic cracking of triglycerides. Owing to the enormous dependency of transport vehicles running on gasoline engines, the development of bio-gasoline may well reduced the dependence of the fuel market on fossil fuels. The present article summarizes recent progresses and future prospects of biofuel production via catalytic cracking technology. This technology can be implemented in current petroleum refineries with minor modifications. However, reactor design and catalyst choice are important issues and have to be addressed before successful implementation of this technology in commercial ventures. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Tung oil was used to produce biodiesel by transesterification with methanol catalyzed by potassium hydroxide and the influence of the transesterification temperatures on the properties of the Tung oil biodiesel was investigated. FT-IR, UV, and GC-MS results indicated that the triconjugated double bonds of Tung oil were stable during the transesterification procedure between 25 and 60 °C. The results of properties showed that Tung oil biodiesel had a low cold filter plugging point (CFPP, -19 °C) and a higher kinetic viscosity (KV, 7.070 mm2/s). Acid value (AV), KV, and CFPP increased with the increase of storing time. Blending Tung oil biodiesel with 0# diesel could improve its stability. B20 or lower blends could still meet the specification of ASTM D7467 after storage for a month. They were more stable than pure Tung oil biodiesel. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Methyl and ethyl esters were prepared from camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] oil by homogenous base-catalyzed transesterification for evaluation as biodiesel fuels. Camelina oil contained high percentages of linolenic (32.6 wt.%), linoleic (19.6 wt.%), and oleic (18.6 wt.%) acids. Consequently, camelina oil methyl and ethyl esters (CSME and CSEE) exhibited poor oxidative stabilities and high iodine values versus methyl esters prepared from canola, palm, and soybean oils (CME, PME, and SME). Other fuel properties of CSME and CSEE were similar to CME, PME, and SME, such as low temperature operability, acid value, cetane number, kinematic viscosity, lubricity, sulfur and phosphorous contents, as well as surface tension. As blend components in ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel, CSME and CSEE were essentially indistinguishable from SME and soybean oil ethyl ester blends with regard to low temperature operability, kinematic viscosity, lubricity, and surface tension.

AB  - Biodiesel production from canola oil with methanol was performed in the presence of a base-catalyst by a circulation process at room temperature. In this process, the transesterification was accelerated by ultrasonic irradiation of low frequency (20 kHz) with an input capacity of 1 kW. The influences of various parameters on the transesterification reaction, including the amount of catalyst, the molar ratio of methanol to oil and the reaction time, were investigated. The objective of this work was to produce biodiesel satisfying the biodiesel-fuel standards of low energy consumption and material savings. The optimal conditions were: methanol/oil molar ratio of 5:1 and 0.7 wt.% catalyst in oil. Under these conditions, the conversion of triglycerides to fatty acid methyl esters was greater than 99% within the reaction time of 50 min. Crude biodiesel was purified by washing with tap water and drying at 70 °C under reduced pressure. © 2009.

AB  - The continuous-flow transesterification of soybean oil with methanol using a rotating packed bed (RPB) for the production of fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel) is presented herein. The RPB, which provides high centrifugal force and has an adjustable rotational speed, is employed as a novel transesterification reactor. In this study, biodiesel is synthesized via the methanolysis of soybean oil using potassium hydroxide as the catalyst. The following variables were investigated for their effects on transesterification efficiency: the methanol-oil molar ratio, the estimated hydraulic retention time, the rotational speed of the packed-bed rotator, the reaction temperature, and the catalyst dosage. The yield of the fatty acid methyl esters (YFAME) in the RPB system depends significantly on the experimental conditions, which influence the residence time distribution, the transesterification reaction rate, and the micromixing intensity. Due to its excellent micromixing characteristics, the RPB system shows satisfactory transesterification efficiency. The values of YFAME, productivity of FAMEs (PFAME), and PFAME per unit reactor volume (PFAME/VR) in the RPB are used to evaluate the performance for biodiesel production and allow for further comparison with other continuous transesterification reactors. Consequently, a RPB is considered a practical transesterification reactor with high transesterification efficiency. © 2009.

AB  - In this study, a pilot scale of 100 t/year biodiesel production system, mainly consisting of a fixed-bed and a down-stream plug-flow reactors, was setup to test different feedstock oils, especially a kind of high-acidified oil, trap grease, for their feasibility as biodiesel feedstock in China. The tested oils include three kinds of typical oil from Guangdong Province, China: rapeseed oil, Chinese wood oil, and trap grease. At the same time the optimum residence time for a plug-flow reactor to perform transesterification reaction was investigated in this study. At the temperature of 65 °C, methanol/oil molar ratio of 6:1 and KOH load of 1.2 wt% of oil, the optimum residence time was found to be 19 min. A type of ion-exchange resin was used to fill in the fixed-bed reactor and used as the esterification catalyst for pretreating on the high-acidified oil. For the fresh catalyst, the acid value of trap grease could be reduced from 114 mg KOH/g to about 2 mg KOH/g after 13 h at temperature 75 °C, catalyst load of 15 wt% of oil, methanol addition of 20 wt% of oil. The lifetime test for the catalyst indicated that its life is over 30 days. The quality of biodiesel derived from three feedstock oils is compared with newly published China BD100 standard of GB/T20828-2007. A comparison of the results reveals that the biodiesel generated through this system could satisfactorily meet China BD100 standard. It indicates that the designed process in this system has a good adaptability for different kinds of oil. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work was to study technical and economic feasibilities of converting residual oils recovered from spent bleaching earth generated at soybean oil refineries into useable biodiesel. Experimental results showed that fatty acids in the SBE residual oil were hexadecenoic acid (58.19%), stearic acid (21.49%) and oleic acid (20.32%), which were similar to those of vegetable oils. The methyl ester conversion via a transesterification process gave a yield between 85 and 90%. The biodiesel qualities were in reasonable agreement with both EN 14214 and ASTM D6751 standards. A preliminary financial analysis showed that the production cost of biodiesel from SBE oils was significantly lower than the pre-tax price of fossil diesel or those made of vegetable oils or waste cooking oils. The effects of the crude oil price and the investment on the production cost and the investment return period were also conducted. The result showed that the investment would return faster at higher crude oil price. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biofuel (biodiesel, bioethanol) is considered one of the most promising alternative fuels to petrol fuels. The objective of the work is to study the characteristics of the particle size distribution, the reaction characteristics of nanoparticles on the catalyst, and the exhaust emission characteristics when a common rail direct injection (CRDI) diesel engine is run on biofuel-blended diesel fuels. In this study, the engine performance, emission characteristics, and particle size distribution of a CRDI diesel engine that was equipped with a warm-up catalytic converters (WCC) or a catalyzed particulate filter (CPF) were examined in an ECE (Economic Commission Europe) R49 test and a European stationary cycle (ESC) test. The engine performance under a biofuel-blended diesel fuel was similar to that under D100 fuel, and the high fuel consumption was due to the lowered calorific value that ensued from mixing with biofuels. The use of a biodiesel-diesel blend fuel reduced the total hydrocarbon (THC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions but increased nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions due to the increased oxygen content in the fuel. The smoke emission was reduced by 50% with the use of the bioethanol-diesel blend. Emission conversion efficiencies in the WCC and CPF under biofuel-blended diesel fuels were similar to those under D100 fuel. The use of biofuel-blended diesel fuel reduced the total number of particles emitted from the engine; however, the use of biodiesel-diesel blends resulted in more emissions of particles that were smaller than 50 nm, when compared with the use of D100. The use of a mixed fuel of biodiesel and bioethanol (BD15E5) was much more effective for the reduction of the particle number and particle mass, when compared to the use of BD20 fuel. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the injection and atomization characteristics of biodiesel-ethanol blended fuel. The injection performance of biodiesel-ethanol blended fuel was analyzed from the injection rate characteristics using the injection rate measuring system, and the effective injection velocity and effective spray diameter using the nozzle flow model. Moreover, the atomization characteristics, such as local and overall SMD distributions, overall axial velocity and droplet arrival time were analyzed and compared with these from diesel and biodiesel fuels to obtain the atomization characteristics of biodiesel-ethanol blended fuel. It was revealed that ethanol fuel affects the decrease of the peak injection rate and the shortening of the injection delay due to the decrease of fuel properties, such as fuel density and dynamic viscosity. In addition, the ethanol addition improved the atomization performance of biodiesel fuel, because the ethanol blended fuel has a low kinematic viscosity and surface tension, then that has more active interaction with the ambient gas, compared to BD100. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present research is focused on the GC-FID determination of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) in diesel blends, by means of an ionic liquid stationary phase, characterized by a dicationic 1,9-di(3-vinyl-imidazolium)nonane bis(trifluoromethyl)sulfonylimidate structure (SLB-IL100). The high polarity of the ionic liquid stationary phase allowed the separation of the FAMEs, from the less-retained hydrocarbons, thus avoiding the requirement of a hydrocarbon LC pre-separation. The results derived from the analyses of a soybean FAMEs B20 sample, carried out on an SLB-IL100 conventional column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.20 mm df), were compared with those attained on a polyethylene glycol column, of equivalent dimensions. Conventional and fast GC methods, for the analysis of FAMEs in diesel blends, were developed on an SLB-IL100 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.20 μm df and on an SLB-IL100 12 m × 0.10 mm i.d. × 0.08 μm df column, respectively. The optimized IL methods were subjected to validation: retention time and peak area intra-day precision (n = 5) were good, with CV % values lower than 0.08% and 4.9%, respectively. With regards to the quantitation of FAMEs in biodiesel blends, a five points calibration curve was constructed, using C17:0 as internal standard. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study employed a recently developed experimental technique to investigate the effect of iodine number on NOx formation in laminar partially premixed flames of three vaporized biofuels: canola methyl ester, soy methyl ester, and methyl stearate. The iodine numbers for the selected fuels varied over a wide range from 0.5 to 141. Key measurements included NOx concentration and temperature fields. The peak NOx concentration occurred in the near-burner region for all biofuels: 1166 ppm for soy, 1067 ppm for canola, and 414 ppm for the methyl stearate. We observed that the peak NOx concentration significantly increased with the iodine number, indicating a strong correlation between the chemical structure of the fuel and NOx emission.

Although yards still have order backlogs, the dearth of new orders is impacting severely on the engine companies who face a bleak future, at least in the medium term. With the passenger vessel sector, a traditional main user of four-stroke engines, suffering badly, the main medium speed companies are tending to concentrate on other markets such as land-based power generation, where demand for four-stroke diesel and gas engines is comparatively strong. A discussion covers Hangzhou ZhongGao's (ZGPT) Hangzhou plant that is capable of producing diesel engines of up to 6000 bhp; fuel sharing for LNG, which is available in the 1000 kw/cylinder 51/60DF engine; search for alternative fuels, e.g., biofuels from jatropha oil, fish oil, and chicken oil; and the repower project for Tier II, in which two inline L250 engines were successfully installed on a passenger/vehicle ferry.

AB  - Waste edible oil is the high quality material from which biodiesel fuels can be made. The water droplets in wasted edible oil affect the processing courses and the product quality. A new process of waste edible oil dehydration based on hydrocyclone technology has been designed. Preliminary industrial experiments have been carried out to prove the feasibility of dehydration using a hydrocyclone. The effects of several dimensionless units, such as Reynolds number, Euler number, and pressure drop ratio, were studied. An increase in Reynolds number will decrease the pressure drop ratio. With an increase in the Reynolds number, the Euler number increases gradually. Under the condition that the Reynolds number of inlet is ranging from 5,000 to 5,800, the water concentration can decrease from 0.5-3.0 vol.% to less than 0.30 vol.%.

AB  - Algae was initially examined as a potential replacement fuel source for fossil fuels in the 1970s, but prohibitive production costs and limitations discouraged the commercial development of algaebased fuel production. Subsequent studies, continued through the 1980s and heightened in the last 15 years, illustrate that research developments are enabling the commercial potential of microalgae to shift from aquaculture, fine chemicals, and health food to fuel production for large-scale production. Cultivation models practiced so far are through open raceway ponds and photobioreactors. The feasibility of the process depends on the cultivation medium coating, which gives high productivity, a desirable end product, and the components of the medium are easily available. Abellon Cleanenergy is a company focusing on developing feasible process parameters for biofuel production. The present study is on algae cultivation for viable commercial propositions through low-cost cultivation mediums with enhanced growth. It is the first of its kind from India reporting experimental results for Dunaliella tertiolecta (marine microalgae) in a fertilizer-based medium (AG 11), showing high oil yield at a low ingredient cost compared to other synthetic media. © 2009 by Begell House, Inc.

AB  - The use of biofuels in transportation is increasing and promoted in many areas with the aims of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector, securing the energy supply, and improving the self-sufficiency and employment. However, a number of recent studies have concluded that large-scale production of biofuels may cause significant environmental and social problems. Firstly, greenhouse benefits from substituting fossil fuels with biofuels may be questionable due to auxiliary material and energy inputs required, direct land-use impacts and, in particular, due to indirect system impacts e.g. land-use changes leading to deforestation. Secondly, other environmental impacts, such as nutrient losses, toxic emissions, and biodiversity losses, may also be significant and are not well known, in particular those related to technologies still under development. Thirdly, production of biofuels from raw materials that also are, suitable for food production, have been found to increase food prices, thus causing social problems. Consequently, research on and development of biofuels is more and more focusing on raw materials not directly competing with food production. In addition, a number of initiatives on sustainability criteria for biofuels have been announced by various institutions, with the aim of ensuring that the production of biofuels does not cause serious harm to the environment and society. A sustainability assessment is an extremely complicated and challenging task due to the lack of a unique, objective, and commonly agreed methodology, even though life cycle assessment (LCA) provides a generally accepted methodological background. The definitions of system boundary and reference scenario and other assumptions will have a significant impact on the results. In addition, the sustainability criteria included in different approaches and studies vary, which makes the comparison of the results difficult. This report presents perspectives on varying challenges and problems that are encountered when assessing the sustainability of biofuels in general. The report aims to identify the most critical factors of different environmental implications that are caused by increased production and use of biofuels. The main uncertainties and sensitivities associated with the assessment task are discussed and suggestions for further research needs are provided. The technological focus is on evolving technologies of highest interest from the Finnish point of view, that are the production of FT diesel from forest residues, production of NExBTL diesel from palm oil and tallow, and bioethanol production based on domestic lignocellulosic raw materials. Critical sustainability aspects of imported Brazilian bioethanol made from sugar cane are also addressed. The report also provides a brief summary and assessment of sustainability criteria relevant for biofuels that have been proposed by various organisations, institutions, and countries. Finally, the implications of three different biofuel scenarios on the Finnish economy are briefly assessed. The most critical factors with regard to environmental impacts of production and use of biofuels were noted to be site-specific features, direct soil implications through cultivation or harvesting of raw materials, identification, quantification and allocation of indirect impacts through market mechanisms, substitution credits from the use of co-products and biofuels, and lack of data concerning technologies still under development. In addition, indicators used to measure greenhouse or other environmental impacts may have a significant impact on the results and thus need to be carefully considered in order to avoid the drawing of misleading conclusions. According to macro-economic scenario analysis, the increased use of biofuels has the effect of raising both consumer prices and costs of production. Consequently, it tends to drive down consumption and production in most sectors of the economy, and also makes investment less attractive. While the effects of increased domestic biofuel production are slightly negative at the level of the whole economy, the increased demand for crops and wood obviously increase activity in agriculture and in particular, in forestry. Further research work is certainly required in various areas and dimensions related to the sustainability of biofuels. Topics that should be further elaborated include e.g. the assessment procedure of sustainability, case studies of current and new technologies and raw materials, uncertainties related to these, sitespecificity and perceived harmful effects. More data and knowledge is also required for socio-economic dimension of sustainability and economic implications of biofuels towards a specific reference scenario. The need for case-specific and more comprehensive analysis with different perspectives and indicators is obvious. Both micro-level bottom-up and macro-level top-down analyses are required to ensure that biomass use is as sustainable as possible with regard to its various dimensions. Copyright © VTT 2009.

AB  - Over the last decade, biofuels have been championed in the United States as a new source of income for rural communities, as a way to reduce dependence on foreign oil, and most recently as a solution to the country's energy and climate change problems. These latter concerns are now the main driver behind the promise of biofuels, leading the United States and other governments across the world to encourage greater production and use. But as the market for biofuels expands, so too do the social, economic, and environmental impacts. Rapid growth in biofuels use in the past five years has contributed to a sharp increase in food, feed grain, and soybean prices in the United States and abroad. These price fluctuations have fueled a global debate over "food versus fuel."At the same time, the global economic recession has led the U.S. biofuels industry to contract, threatening jobs and livelihoods. Studies suggest that the environmental costs of producing "first-generation" biofuels such as corn-based ethanol on a large scale likely outweigh the benefits. These costs include increased water pollution, the loss of wildlife habitat, and declining freshwater resources. Of particular concern is the link between biofuels expansion and the global conversion of land for agriculture, as biofuel crops compete with forests and food crops for limited land and other resources. Corn ethanol leads to only minimal, if any, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, an oft-touted benefit and justification for expanding biofuels production. Current best estimates suggest that corn ethanol provides only a 12 to 18 percent net reduction in emissions, on average, compared to gasoline. If land that is rich in carbon is converted from forests or other natural ecosystems to biofuels production, these benefits can fall away completely. These concerns point to a crossroads for the U.S. biofuels industry. The country must now choose between a business-as-usual approach that worsens environmental and climate problems, or a more cautious approach during which decision makers take the time to "get biofuels right" before rushing forward with more production. Taking the more sustainable path includes an immediate transition to "second- generation" biofuels while phasing out reliance on unsustainable first-generation fuels. Advanced biofuels can be produced not just from annual crops, but also from fast-growing trees and grasses as well as from a range of organic wastes and potentially even algae. The feedstocks can be grown on marginal land that does not have to compete with food production and that can be cultivated in ways that minimize harmful effects on water quality and wildlife habitat. These feedstocks may also require fewer fossil fuel inputs and retain more carbon in their soils than corn and soybeans, enhancing their ability to mitigate climate change. Research is now under way on the conversion of cellulose to biofuel, and dozens of entrepreneurs are working to commercialize this and other advanced biofuel technologies. There is no guarantee, however, that the production of advanced biofuels at a large scale will be environmentally beneficial, although current assessments show much promise. Three broad efforts in U.S. policy would make biofuels production more environmentally sustainable and help ensure that the use of biofuels for transportation contributes to both energy security and global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions: 1. Spur the rapid development of cellulosic and other advanced biofuels that significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, using existing economic instruments and other tools. 2.Develop sustainability standards and make government support for biofuels conditional on meeting these standards. 3. Create a holistic energy policy across all transportation-related sectors. Reforming U.S. biofuel policies will require overcoming an array of economic forces that uphold the current industry structure. Present policies reward the least promising biofuels, and if they are not reformed, rising damage to the landscape and climate will fuel greater opposition. Although second-generation biofuels are not a panacea, they offer the prospect of a more sustainable energy future. Getting there will require careful analysis of biofuel production, distribution, and use, including alternate ways to grow feedstock, power refineries, and use byproducts. Decision makers should also consider wider transportation solutions such as more fuel-efficient vehicles, investments in public transportation, ways to reduce congestion, and urban planning that promotes biking and walking. The solution to the biofuels challenge is not simply a matter of substituting different feed-stocks. Rather, it is about finding a new model that takes the United States down a truly red, white, and green path. © Worldwatch Institute, 2009.

AB  - A survey covers the potential of croton tiglium Linn as a biofuels source in terms of its possible economic and environmental advantages. Croton oil, extracted and sold as crude fuel for engines or refined into biodiesel is a significant resource reflecting that agriculture can become an attractive energy source. The energy problem of recent years is an environmental emergency that needs a concrete and rapid resolution. Bioenergy use would be an opportunity because it is locally available and is renewable. The discussion covers introduction; the croton tiglium Linn plant and its composition; the production of croton tiglium Linn oil, its composition and properties, and a comparison of the cetane numbers of diesel, jatropha methyl ester, and methyl ester of croton tiglium Linn; and conclusions. Italy (about 595,000 tonnes/yr) is the third largest producer of biodiesel after Germany (2,189,000 tonnes) and France (1,815,000 tonnes). The greater part of biodiesel used in Italy is from France, Spain, and Germany in Europe, Argentina and Brazil in South America, and Canada. About 60% of the biodiesel produced in Italy is exported to Germany, France, and Austria while the by-product of transesterification, namely, glycerin, is in part exported to countries in Asia. The use of croton oil is now being studied experimentally. An analysis in depth is not yet possible because of a lack of data. Croton oil when used as fuel does not emit hydrocarbons, particulates, and aromatics. Its use as fuel will not impinge on the foodstuffs sector. It would seem croton oil can satisfy diverse standards as a biofuel but a study in depth is needed for its possible use at the national level. The croton tiglium Linn plant is cultivated also in other countries in Europe.

AB  - We used immobilized lipase from Candida sp. 99-125 to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from crude oil and methanol. We studied the effects of phospholipids on activity of immobilized lipase, reaction velocity, stability of immobilized lipase and the stability of immobilized lipase in crude and refined oil. Results showed that the activity of the lipase immersed in petroleum ether with 1% phospholipids dropped more quickly than the lipase in petroleum ether without phospholipids. When soybean oil was used without phospholipids as material, the FAMEs yield of 15 min was 26.2%, whereas the yield decreased to 12.4% when there were 5% phospholipids in the soybean oil. However when the phospholipids content was below 1%, the stability of the lipase did not change obviously. The lipase was stable when used to catalyze crude soybean oil and crude jatropha oil, after 10 cycles the FAMEs yield was still above 70%. This lipase showed great potential for industrial production of biodiesel from crude oil. © 2009 Institute of Microbiology, CAS & CSM, All rights reserved.

AB  - Biofuel industries are becoming established in many developing countries. They have extensive biomass resources that are becoming more valuable as demand for biofuels increases. The approaches to biofuel development in different parts of the world vary. The expansion of biofuel production will depend largely on government policies with ambitious goals, such as decreasing dependence on fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Biofuels alone will not enable these goals to be met. Their advantages, however, are expected to increase if technologies that allow for the use of feed-stocks that are less demanding to produce become more attractive economically. Despite strong hopes for higher grain prices, there is still much uncertainty about the effects of an increased demand for grains for biofuel production. Food and feed markets could well be affected, and production adjustments may offset the higher prices to the farmer. Current issues hindering biofuel productions are lack of education, distribution, excess corruption, and very low levels of foreign aid. People in developing countries are often unable to afford these without assistance or financing such as microloans. International organizations should work out modalities to make improved facilities for biofuel use and better alternatives accessible to those who cannot afford them.

AB  - Global acceptance and use of biofuels is growing rapidly in the transportation sector. Diminishing reserves of limited and costly fossil fuel resources and a growing realization that world peak oil production will most likely occur within the next decade is driving significant investment in sustainable biofuels. Legislative, regulatory and market forces are driving developments which seek to reduce vehicle emissions, improve fuel efficiency, lower environmental greenhouse gases and strengthen the economy. The use of alternate, sustainable, renewable fuels, preferably of domestic origin, is fostering considerable investment in new technologies. One promising technology is the addition of aliphatic alcohols to gasoline and diesel fuels.The compatibility of seal and hose materials commonly used in automotive fuel systems with conventional hydrocarbon fuels is well known. Over the past forty-five years fluorohydrocarbon elastomers have been successfully used in passenger car and truck and off- highway gasoline and petrodiesel fuel delivery and metering systems. More recently, biofuels such as ethanol have become technically and economically attractive blending constituents for gasoline and diesel fuels. These biomass fuels present their own set of material compatibility challenges to automotive fuel storage, delivery, and metering system component hardware. In this presentation the compatibility of selected fluoroelastomers with ethanol and butanol, and their respective alcohol-based blend fuels, will be reviewed. Fluoroelastomers that have historically been used for petroleum based fuels will be compared to several new types that display improved compatibility and sealing functionality with alcohol-based fuels. Accelerated long term testing results will be presented that characterize physical properties and property retention in bioalcohols through 1008 hours at 40°C. Properties relevant to sealing applications and hose will also be discussed and best in class elastomers will be highlighted, so that, in gaining a better understanding of the respective capabilities of high performance fluorohydrocarbon elastomers, the engineer may design more robust sealing systems for bioalcohol service. © 2009 SAE International.

AB  - Increasing interest in biofuels-specifically, biodiesel as a pathway to energy diversity and security-have necessitated the need for research on the performance and utilization of these fuels and fuel blends in current and future vehicle fleets. One critical research area is related to achieving a full understanding of the impact of biodiesel fuel blends on advanced emission control systems. In addition, the use of biodiesel fuel blends can degrade diesel engine oil performance and impact the oil drain interval requirements. There is limited information related to the impact of biodiesel fuel blends on oil dilution. This paper assesses the oil dilution impacts on an engine operating in conjunction with a diesel particle filter (DPF), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) storage, a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) emission control system, and a 20% biodiesel (soy-derived) fuel blend. The main focus was on the biodiesel oil dilution levels observed during an accelerated aging protocol and an assessment of the potential impacts on the engine and emissions control systems. For the NOx storage system (which requires a late in-cylinder fuel injection for regeneration), biodiesel oil dilution levels ranged from 5%-10%. For the SCR system (which used a urea solution as a reductant and late in-cylinder fuel injection for diesel particle filter regeneration), biodiesel oil dilution ranged from &lt;4%-8%. These observations were made over typical oil drain intervals. Despite these observed biodiesel oil dilution levels, there were no observed impacts on performance of the engine or the emission control systems. © 2009 SAE International.

AB  - This work was concerned with evaluation of the performance and emissions of potential future biofuels during advanced spark ignition engine operation. The fuels prepared included three variants of gasoline, three gasoline-ethanol blends and a gasoline-butanol fuel altogether covering a range of oxygen mass concentrations and octane numbers to identify key influencing parameters. The combustion of the fuels was evaluated in a turbocharged multi-cylinder direct fuel injection research engine equipped with a standard three-way catalyst and an external EGR circuit that allowed use of either cooled or non-cooled EGR. The engine operating effects studied at both part and boosted high load conditions included fuel injection timing and pressure, excess air tolerance, EGR tolerance and spark retard limits. A number of blends were also mapped at suitable sites across the European drive cycle under downsized engine conditions. Relative in-vehicle fuel economies were then determined via drive cycle simulation and compared to a naturally aspirated gasoline PFI engine. © 2009 SAE International.

AB  - Fuel additives are being used more frequently to meet "premium diesel fuel" requirements. Although these additives improve performance, they also affect the water separation characteristics. This program was designed to determine the effects of various additives on fuel/water separation in low- and ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel. The additives studied include detergents and lubricity additives. A soy-based biofuel is also considered. The fuel/water separation tests conducted with coalescer filter technology generally produced higher efficiencies while the addition of a detergent additive package at 175-ppm generally produced lower water separation efficiencies. © 2009 SAE International.

AB  - In an effort to reduce CO2 emissions, governments are increasingly mandating the use of various levels of biofuels. While this is strongly supported in principle within the energy and transportation industries, the impact of these mandates on the transport stock's CO2 emissions and overall operating efficiency has yet to be fully explored. This paper provides information on studies to assess biodiesel influences and effects on engine performance, driveability, emissions and fuel consumption on state-of-the-art Euro IV compliant Toyota Avensis D4-D vehicles with DPNR aftertreatment systems. Two fuel matrices (Phases 1 &amp; 2) were designed to look at the impact of fuel composition on vehicle operation using a wide range of critical parameters such as cetane number, density, distillation and biofuel (FAME) level and type, which can be found within the current global range of Diesel fuel qualities. Vehicle test results from Phase 1 indicated a surprisingly large impact of CN on fuel consumption in addition to an expected effect of fuel calorific value. The CN effect was not so apparent in Phase 2 where fuels were of a much narrower cetane range. Compared to base fuels, FAME biofuel blends, at levels of B30 and below, typically showed reductions in HC emissions, a negligible impact or reductions in CO emissions and a negligible impact or increase in NOx emissions. B100 RME gave amongst the highest overall CO and CO2 emissions. At equivalent blend level of B20, RME tended to give amongst the highest HC, CO and NOx emissions compared to JME or CME. The higher cetane premium fuels tested in this study (CN &gt; 60), gave the lowest overall fuel consumption, HC and CO emissions. Hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO) component offered further emissions advantages when blended at B5 level into a high cetane fuel, as well as giving significant emissions benefits at B20 level over standard European EN590 Diesel. © 2009 SAE International.

AB  - The main objective of the present work is to investigate the combination of an atmospheric and a pressurised air blown biomass gasifier towards Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis of second generation biofuels and co-production of power. The complete process was simulated in AspenPlus™ software including sub-models for the gasification, gas cleaning and conditioning as well as for the FT reactor. A sensitivity analysis on exergetic performance was performed mainly examining the recycling of FT-tail gas. For the base case of 80% FT CO conversion without any recirculation, the exergetic efficiency was found to be 34.3% with atmospheric gasification and 30.64% for pressurised gasification. Recirculation of the non-reacted CO, H2 as well as light gas products of the FT-reactor back to the atmospheric gasifier can increase the overall efficiency up to 48.1 %.

AB  - A report covers the contribution of the Stazione Sperimentale per i Combustibili on standards and measurements for bio-fuels in terms of facilitating global trade at Brussels (March 19-20, 2009). In recent years in Europe, with the incentive of the directive 2003/30/CE to promote bio-fuels, there has been a constant increase in their production and use in transport to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and to make Europe less dependent on fossil fuels. The spread of these bio-fuels such as bio-ethanol and bio-diesel is global such that the differences in their technical standards from country to country may brake their dissemination. The tripartite agreement of the Union European, USA, and Brazil of February 2007 developed task forces, one for bio-diesel and one for bio-ethanol. The International Biofuels Forum of March 2007 that also included China, South Africa, and India had as objective the sustainable production and use of bio-fuels in the world. The conference of March 2009 led by the Direzione Generale Trasporti (DG TREN) of the European Commission with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Instituti de Metrologia, Normalização E Qualidade Industrial of Brazil (INMETRO) published a white paper on bio-fuels in terms of three categories, A, similar parameters; B, parameters with significant differences regarding the limits and the testing methods; and C, parameters with fundamental differences. The task force on bio-diesel found a number of parameters in categories B and C. A number of other observations are made with respect to bio-fuels and the three categories. The white paper on internationally compatible bio-ethanol standards also found the following in Category A (similarity) color, appearance, density, sulfate, sulfur, copper, iron, and sodium content, and electrolytic conductivity. In Category B (significant differences) it found ethanol content, acidity, phosphorus content, pHe, gum/evaporation residue, and chloride content. In Category C (fundamental differences) it found water content. A similar comparison was made for bio-diesel.

AB  - The South African government has banned planting of Jatropha curcas L. (Jatropha), potentially a multipurpose tree and biofuel source, owing to insufficient knowledge about the species. Use of allometry as a non-destructive method of monitoring growth and biomass attributes of Jatropha was investigated. The objectives were to examine: reliability of allometry between above-ground variables and basal diameter and crown depth of Jatropha; effects of below-ground interspecies competition and tree spacing on allometry; and validity of these relationships with independent data. The study site was Ukulinga Research Farm, South Africa. Destructive sampling was carried out in March 2008, and tree height and basal diameter were measured periodically during March 2005 to April 2007. Regression analysis and analyses of covariance were used to analyse the data. The height-diameter equation developed by destructive sampling was validated using independent data. Highly significant allometric regressions resulted from using basal diameter (r ≥ 0.89) and crown depth (r ≥ 0.94). Stem diameter had linear relationships with wood and foliage biomass percentages (r = 0.91). Height-diameter equations were equivalent across competition and tree spacing treatments. Predicted and measured tree heights were linearly related (r > 0.97). It could be concluded that above-ground allometry of Jatropha was very reliable and not significantly affected by either below-ground interspecies competition or tree spacing. The site-specific allometric equations are useful for accurate and non-destructive estimations of Jatropha growth under various growing and (non-pruning) tree management conditions. The equations presented here are, however, not universally applicable. © NISC (Pty) Ltd.

AB  - The primary energy consumption in the world has increased continuously. The most important primary energy source is oil. The supply of automotive fuels today is based almost entirely on oil, and the demand for liquid transportation fuels worldwide will rise significantly in the next fifty years. Growing energy consumption and decreasing fossil resources are reasons for increasing prices of fossil fuel. Besides limited availability, contribution to greenhouse effect and pollutant emission represent another problem offossilfuel. Both of these problems can be overcome by increased application of renewable biofuels. Therefore, great effort is made to supplement the primary energy sources by including renewable energies. There are alternative fuels 1st and 2nd generation. Some of them show high potential for reduction of engine out emission. But there are economical and technical barriers when such fuels are applied. This paper shows both advantage and disadvantage of alternative fuels, especially when used for diesel engines.

AB  - The growing demand coupled with high cost and uncertainty of crude oil supplies had led to an extensive search for a suitable alternate fuel which can be obtained from renewable sources. Among the many contestants, vegetable oil seems to be a viable alternative for use in diesel engines due to the fact that is adoption requires no modification to the prime-mover. However drawbacks associated with vegetable oils such as high viscosity and low volatility call for low heat rejection (LHR) engine, which is constructed with the provision of air gap of 3-mm in the threaded piston and in the liner, with superni-90 (a low thermal conductivity nickel alloy material) inserts, and ceramic coating (5001) on inside surface of cylinder head. Performance evaluation of the LHR diesel engine is carried out with pongamia oil based bio-diesel by varying injection timings and injection pressures. Brake thermal efficiency (BTE) increased by 24%, while at peak load operation, smoke levels decreased by 16% relatively with LHR engine with pongamia oil based bio-diesel at an injection timing of 30°bTDC (before top dead centre) in comparison with the conventional engine with pure diesel operation at 27°bTDC and an injection pressure of 190 bars.

AB  - As an alternative fuel biodiesel produced from jatropha by transesterification has the potential to overcome the energy crisis, to meet the strict environmental emission regulations due to its technical feasibility, economic effeciency and for environmental safeguard. Pursuing the present experiment, ethanol is also used for the transesterification considering its renewable nature over toxic methanol. In this experiment ethanol and methanol esters are produced to procure blends with diesel for the evaluation and characterisation of biodiesel in respect of fuel charactersitics and then comparisons were made with standard diesel and raw oil. Satisfactory results were obtained in terms of fuel values and twenty percent blending of esters can be recomended for the use in transportation sector. Two hour engine testing was also conducted for the determination of emission potential of the blends and comparison over diesel revealed that emission of Carbon Monoxide and Hydrocarbon reduced in case of biodiesel possibly due to its higher oxygen contents. NOx emission increased slightly in case of blends over diesel and therefore necessary engine modifications is recomended before of its commercial release. Copyright © Enviromedia.

AB  - Efforts are under way in many countries, to search for suitable alternative diesel fuels that are environment friendly. The need to search for these fuels arises mainly from the standpoint of preserving the global environment and the concern about long-term supplies of conventional hydrocarbon-based diesel fuels. Among the different possible sources, diesel fuels derived from vegetable oils and its esters(biodiesel) present a promising alternative to substitute diesel fuels. Keeping in view the Indian scenario where biodiesel is mainly prepared form non-edible oils, an unutilized and easily available oil source in rural India is tested for biodiesel production. The kernel of balanites fruit contains 45-50% of oil on weight basis. The crude oil obtained after oil extraction, allowed undergoing a transesterification process with methanol, potassium hydroxide used as a catalyst. During the study, it was found that the transesterification reaction of methanol with balanites oil in the molar ratio of 8:1 with KOH 1.25% by weight of oil as a catalyst gives maximum ester yield of 95% for the reaction time of 60 minutes. The biodiesel thus obtained is characterized for its physical properties. The viscosity of biodiesel was reduced by 89% after transesterification where as the calorific value is 95% less than that of diesel. The properties of balanites oil methyl esters are quiet comparable with diesel. Copyright © Enviromedia.

AB  - This paper presents an investigation on the performance of an oil burner system utilizing various palm biodiesel blends. Biofuel used in this study is a blend of diesel and palm olein, called palm biodiesel. The performance of burner system using palm biodiesel is based on its temperature profile and emissions generated such as nitrous oxide (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and carbon monoxide (CO). In this study, Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) is extensively used to simulate the combustion process in the combustion chamber. The results were validated with experimental result. The experimental data was obtained from the burner test rig. The simulation covered three main areas which are cold flow (non reacting flow), evaporation of liquid spray and Eddy Dissipation combustion. The turbulence model used is k-e model while discrete phase modeled (DPM) was modeled using Lagrangian framework. The CFD results showed reasonable agreement with experimental for flame length while for the temperature profile the simulation results were over predicted.

AB  - The market situation and political framework in Germany for biodiesel and vegetable oil in 2008 in comparison to 2007 is discussed. Although utilization of biodiesel as an admixture component in fossil diesel fuel increased by 190,000 metric tons (MT) to 1.613 million metric tons (MMT), a slump of 739,000 MT in sales of pure fuel offset this positive development. Although the German Bundesrat campaigned to adjust tax concessions in favor of biodiesel and PVO to once more provide a perspective for the regional marketing of pure fuel and subsequently the small- and medium-sized plant operators, the federal government ultimately pushed through its Draft Law on the Amendment of the Promotion of Biofuels by way of the Bundestag resolution. Germany is going its own way as regards to its incorporation of the directive into national law. The background of the debate lies in the requirements of the EU directive and the laws that specify the verification of sustainable biomass production through equivalent certification systems.

AB  - This paper presents effects of using vegetable oil-based additive combined with metal-based additive on exhaust emissions of 4-stroke diesel engine fueled with biodiesel. Tests were conducted using biodiesel from palm blended with diesel, palm polyol and MgO as a post-flame additive. A test with 100% conventional diesel fuel was also conducted for comparison purposes. PaImbiodiesel blended fuel with and without additive generally produced less emission compared to ordinary diesel. Moreover, post flame additives was found successfully diminishing poisonous exhaust gases from diesel engine combustion, eliminating stringent environmental issues on atmospheric pollution.

AB  - In the present report, crude glycerol, waste discharged from bio-diesel production, was used as carbon substrate for three natural Yarrowia lipolytica strains (LFMB 19, LFMB 20 and ACA-YC 5033) during growth in nitrogen-limited submerged shake-flask experiments. In media with initial glycerol concentration of 30 g/L, all strains presented satisfactory microbial growth and complete glycerol uptake. Although culture conditions favored the secretion of citric acid (and potentially the accumulation of storage lipid), for the strains LFMB 19 and LFMB 20, polyol mannitol was the principal metabolic product synthesized (maximum quantity 6.0 g/L, yield 0.20-0.26 g per g of glycerol consumed). The above strains produced small quantities of lipids and citric acid. In contrast, Y. lipolytica ACA-YC 5033 produced simultaneously higher quantities of lipid and citric acid and was further grown on crude glycerol in nitrogen-limited experiments, with constant nitrogen and increasing glycerol concentrations (70-120 g/L). Citric acid and lipid concentrations increased with increment of glycerol; maximum total citric acid 50.1 g/L was produced (yield 0.44 g per g of glycerol) while simultaneously 2.0 g/L of fat were accumulated inside the cells (0.31 g of lipid per g of dry weight). Cellular lipids were mainly composed of neutral fraction, the concentration of which substantially increased with time. Moreover, in any case, the phospholipid fraction was more unsaturated compared with total and neutral lipids, while at the early growth step, microbial lipid was more rich in saturated fatty acids (e.g. C16:0 and C18:0) compared with the stationary phase. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - This paper analyses Brazil's experience with biofuels, focusing on the central role of the federal government as the main force driving the implementation of alternative locally produced ethanol (ethyl alcohol) and biodiesel. The pioneering, large scale ethanol programme that started over 30 years ago can be considered the most successful experience with the use of biofuels to date, as the government was able to rapidly implement the use of ethanol (ethyl alcohol) as a substitute for petrol in the 1970s and 1980s. The work contributes to the general discussion of sustainable and renewable energy sources and sets out the key policy mechanisms used. The paper also innovatively looks at the second large governmental intervention in the renewable fuels market - the biodiesel programme. In addition to the contribution to the debate surrounding command-and-control measures and economic incentive instruments, the paper analyses how lessons learned from the ethanol experiment were taken into consideration in the design and implementation of the biodiesel mandate, including social and environmental facets. It emphasizes the uniqueness of producing sugarcane ethanol in the Brazilian context and how attempts to carry out similar fast growing biofuels programmes may not be possible in other parts of the world.

AB  - Interest in rapeseed cultivation for fuel production purposes is related with possibility of its oil utilization in biofuel production. Need for such production is a result of very fast development of road transport, which, through emission of significant amounts of CO2, sulphur compounds and numerous heavy metals, contributes to environment pollution. The process of rapeseed natural drying, as well as drying in a dryer, is one of the stages of post-harvest processing which has a significant effect on this plant, especially when its chemical composition is taken into consideration. The goal of this research was determination of differences in quality characteristics of rapeseed which had undergone natural drying and seeds delivered to Oil Comp. Kruszwica and dried there in raw material dryer, as well as assessment of their usability for biofuel production. © 2008 Institute of Agrophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - In this study we discuss the potential of integrated adaptation and mitigation strategies to addess problems arising from climate change. This 'Ad-Mit' or 'Mit-Ad' approach is illustrated through the case of crop diversification by family farmers to crops used for vegetable oil and biodiesel production in the northeastern semi-arid region of Brazil. Impact assessments of some climate change scenarios indicate this region to be one of the most vulnerable in the country. Small farmers from the northeastern semi-arid region are among the low-income social groups most vulnerable to climate change. Improvement of the social and economic conditions in these rural communities through the growth of vegetable oil crops is an important adaptation strategy vis-a-vis future climate change, constituting an income-generation activity in the biodiesel production chain. The use of vegetable oils as a feedstock for biodiesel production and fuel reduces CO2 emissions due to the displacement of diesel oil, thus it also contributes to a mitigation strategy. Potential barriers to an increase in vegetable oil production by small farmers in the region are identified, including capacity building and logistics requirements. We discuss public policies and measures that could help overcome these barriers in the northeastern semi-arid region, and suggest the following: the use of selected seeds of several vegetable oil crops alongside subsistence crops, capacity building and technological and financial support to small farmers, and the building of logistics infrastructure and the appropriate institutional setting. © Inter-Research 2009.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis oils from lignocellulosic biomass are promising second-generation biofuels. Unfortunately, the application range for such oils is limited because of the high acidity (pH~2.5) and the presence of oxygen in a variety of chemical functionalities, and upgrading of the oils is required for most applications. Herein, we report an experimental study on the upgrading of fast pyrolysis oil by catalytic hydrotreatment. A variety of heterogeneous noble-metal catalysts were tested for this purpose (Ru/C, Ru/TiO2, Ru/Al2O3, Pt/C, and Pd/C), and the results were compared to those obtained with typical hydrotreatment catalysts (sulfided NiMo/Al 2O3 and CoMo/Al2O3). The reactions were carried out at temperatures of 250 and 350 °C and pressures of 100 and 200 bar. The Ru/C catalyst was found to be superior to the classical hydrotreating catalysts with respect to oil yield (up to 60 wt %) and deoxygenation level (up to 90 wt %). The upgraded products were less acidic and contained less water than the original fast pyrolysis oil. The HHV was about 40 MJ/kg, which is about twice the value of pyrolysis oil. Analyses of the products by 1H NMR spectroscopy and 2D GC showed that the upgraded pyrolysis oil had lower contents of organic acids, aldehydes, ketones, and ethers than the feed, whereas the amounts of phenolics, aromatics, and alkanes were considerably higher. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Because of their high viscosity and density, crude fats and oils extracted from animal or vegetable sources (containing mainly triglycerides) cannot be directly combusted in modern diesel engines; therefore, they must be converted into biofuels. This important transformation is currently a technological bottleneck for the generation of biofuels either by thermocatalytic cracking to produce diesel-like hydrocarbons or by alcoholysis to yield mono-alcohol fatty acid esters (biodiesel). Although both transformations are relatively simple chemical reactions (thermolysis ((hydro)cracking) and (trans)esterification of triglycerides), they have several drawbacks, mainly related to catalyst efficiency and water and energy consumption. The most recent catalytic approaches and achievements, such as alcoholysis of triglycerides under multiphase conditions using classical acid or base catalysts as well as biocatalysts, are highlighted and discussed. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Multiple alternative vehicle and fuel options are being proposed to alleviate the threats of climate change, urban air pollution, and oil dependence caused by the transportation sector. We report here on the results from an extensive computer model developed over the last decade to simulate and compare the societal benefits of deploying various alternative transportation options including hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids fueled by gasoline, diesel fuel, natural gas, and ethanol, and all-electric vehicles powered by either batteries or fuel cells. These simulations compare the societal benefits over a 100-year time horizon of each vehicle/fuel combination in terms of reduced local air pollution, greenhouse gas pollution, and oil consumption compared to gasoline cars. The model demonstrates that partially electrified vehicles such as hybrids and plug-in hybrids will appreciably cut greenhouse gas pollution and oil consumption, particularly if biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol can displace a large amount of gasoline. But if we are to achieve an 80% reduction in greenhouse gases below 1990 levels, eliminate most oil imports and most urban air pollution, then society must transition to all-electric vehicles powered by some combination of fuel cells and batteries. We cannot achieve our transportation sector goals if most vehicles still rely on internal combustion engines for some of their motive power. We conclude that society must rely on a portfolio of alternative vehicles to achieve our societal objectives, beginning with hybrids, plug-in hybrids, biofuels, and transitioning to all-electric fuel cell and battery electric vehicles over time. © 2009 Professor T.

AB  - The hypothesis of this study is that there is a statistical relationship between the lung cancer mortality rate and the intensity of fuel consumption (measured in gallons/square mile) at a particular location. We estimate cross-section regressions of the mortality rate due to lung cancer against the intensity of fuel consumption using local data for the entire US, before the US Clean Air Act (CAA) in 1974 and after the most recent policy revisions in 2004. The cancer rate improvement estimate suggests that up to 10 lung cancer deaths per 100,000 residents are avoided in the largest urban areas with highest fuel consumption per square mile. In New York City, for instance, the mortality reduction may be worth about $5.7 billion annually. Across the US, the estimated value of statistical life (VSL) benefit is $27.2 billion annually. There are likely three inseparable reasons that contributed importantly to this welfare improvement. First, the CAA regulations mandated reduction in specific carcinogenic chemicals or smog components. Second, technologies such as the catalytic converter (CC) and low-particulate diesel engine were adopted. Third, biofuels have had important roles, making the adoption of clean air technology possible and substituting for high emission fuels. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Use of bioenergy as a renewable resource is increasing in many parts of the world and can generate significant environmental, economic and social benefits if managed with due regard to sustainability constraints. This work reviews the environmental, social and economic constraints on key feedstocks for UK heat, power and transport fuel. Key sustainability constraints include greenhouse gas savings achieved for different fuels, land availability, air quality impacts and facility siting. Applying those constraints, we estimate that existing technologies would facilitate a sustainability constrained level of medium-term bioenergy/biofuel supply to the UK of 4.9% of total energy demand, broken down into 4.3% of heat demands, 4.3% of electricity, and 5.8% of transport fuel. This suggests that attempts to increase the supply above these levels could have counterproductive sustainability impacts in the absence of compensating technology developments or identification of additional resources. The barriers that currently prevent this level of supply being achieved have been analysed and classified. This suggests that the biggest policy impacts would be in stimulating the market for heat demand in rural areas, supporting feedstock prices in a manner that incentivised efficient use/maximum greenhouse gas savings and targeting investment capital that improves yield and reduces land-take. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The sustainability of biofuels, including the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction that they achieve, is getting increased attention. Life cycle analyses (LCAs) of biofuels production routes show that the GHG savings may vary significantly for different biofuels. An increasing number of governments are therefore looking for options to differentiate between biofuels according to their actual GHG savings. Accurate calculations of GHG savings thus become increasingly important. This paper deals with an omission of current LCAs for ethanol and ETBE blends, which leads to an underestimation of their calculated GHG savings. Current studies do not take into account that refiners will adjust their refinery operation when bioethanol or ETBE is added, because of the different characteristics of these products. The analysis indicates that the net effect of these refinery modifications on the GHG savings is positive, i.e. GHG-emissions reduce in both cases. The emission reduction is highest in the case of ETBE. We recommend to include this effect in future LCA calculations for ethanol and ETBE. As the calculation model used for this study is only a simplified representation of the EU refinery sector, we also advise to perform a more detailed analysis of these effects using more elaborate refinery models. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel production is undergoing rapid technological reforms in industries and academia. This has become more obvious and relevant since the recent increase in the petroleum prices and the growing awareness relating to the environmental consequences of the fuel overdependency. In this paper, various technological methods to produce biodiesel being used in industries and academia are reviewed. Catalytic transesterification, the most common method in the production of biofuel, is emphasized in the review. The two most common types of catalysts; homogeneous liquids and heterogeneous solids, are discussed at length in the paper. Two types of processes; batch and continuous processes, are also presented. Although batch production of biodiesel is favored over continuous process in many laboratory and larger scale efforts, the latter is expected to gain wider acceptance in the near future, considering its added advantages associated with higher production capacity and lower operating costs to ensure long term supply of biodiesel. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Due to renewability, high production rate, technical feasibility and role in reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) emission, palm oil is in the right position to supply the energy needs by the incorporation into the diesel supply. As a leading producer of palm oil, Malaysia has embarked on a comprehensive palm biofuel program since 1982. It has successfully established the use of palm biodiesel blend (B5) as a suitable fuel for the transport and industrial sectors through the introduction of the National Biofuel Policy. The current scenario of biodiesel program in Malaysia, as well as biofuel policies with respect to its use, technology, export, environmental issues and implementation aspects are thoroughly discussed. The roles of the policy towards the prosperity of the stakeholders, oil price and the reduction of greenhouse gasses are also highlighted. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biomass gasification with subsequent synthesis to liquid or gaseous biofuels generates heat possible to use in district heating (DH) systems. The purpose here is to estimate the heat sink capacity of DH systems in the individual EU nations and assess the possibilities for biomass-gasification-based co-generation of synthetic biofuels for transportation and heat (CBH) for DH systems in the EU countries. The possibilities are assessed (i) assuming different levels of competiveness relative to other heat supply options of CBH corresponding to the EU target for renewable energy for transportation for 2020 and (ii) assuming that the potential expansion of the DH systems by 2020 is met with CBH. In general, the size of the DH heat sinks represented by the existing national aggregated DH systems can accommodate CBH at a scale that is significant compared to the 2020 renewable transportation target. The possibilities for CBH also depend on its cost-competitiveness compared to, e.g., fossil-fuel-based CHP. The possible expansion of the DH systems by 2020 represents an important opportunity for CBH and is also influenced by the potential increase in the use of other heat supply options, such as, industrial waste heat, waste incineration, and CHP. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Thai Government's search for alternatives to imported petroleum led to the consideration of mandating 10% biofuel blends (biodiesel and gasohol) by 2012. Concerns over the effects of biofuel combustion on ground level ozone formation in relation to their conventional counterparts need addressing. Ozone formation in Bangkok is explored using a trajectory box model. The model is compared against O3, NO, and NO2 time concentration data from air monitoring stations operated by the Thai Pollution Control Department. Four high ozone days in 2006 were selected for modeling. Both the traditional trajectory approach and a citywide average approach were used. The model performs well with both approaches but slightly better with the citywide average. Highly uncertain and missing data are derived within realistic bounds using a genetic algorithm optimization. It was found that 10% biofuel substitution will lead to as much as a 16 ppb peak O3 increase on these four days compared to a 48 ppb increase due to the predicted vehicle fleet size increase between 2006 and 2012. The approach also suggests that when detailed meteorological data is not available to run three dimensional airshed models, and if the air is stagnant or predominately remains over an urban area during the day, that a simple low cost trajectory analysis of O3 formation may be applicable. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The study of light-duty diesel engine exhaust emissions is important due to their impact on atmospheric chemistry and air pollution. In this study, both the gas and the particulate phase of fuel exhaust were analyzed to investigate the effects of diesel reformulation and engine operating parameters. The research was focused on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds on particulate phase due to their high toxicity. These were analyzed using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) methodology. Although PAH profiles changed for diesel fuels with low-sulfur content and different percentages of aromatic hydrocarbons (5-25%), no significant differences for total PAH concentrations were detected. However, rape oil methyl ester biodiesel showed a greater number of PAH compounds, but in lower concentrations (close to 50%) than the reformulated diesel fuels. In addition, four engine operating conditions were evaluated, and the results showed that, during cold start, higher concentrations were observed for high molecular weight PAHs than during idling cycle and that the acceleration cycles provided higher concentrations than the steady-state conditions. Correlations between particulate PAHs and gas phase products were also observed. The emission of PAH compounds from the incomplete combustion of diesel fuel depended greatly on the source of the fuel and the driving patterns. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. is a small, woody tree of the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant can grow on marginal land in the tropical and subtropical regions and produces seeds containing up to 30% oil. Several Asian countries have selected Jatropha for large scale planting as a biodiesel feedstock. Nevertheless, Jatropha also possesses several undesirable traits that may limit its wide adoption. An improved understanding of plant development and the regulation of fatty acid (FA) and triacylglyceride biosynthesis in Jatropha is particularly facilitative for the development of elite crops. Here, we show that a tobacco rattle virus (TRV) vector can trigger virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in Jatropha. Our optimized method produced robust and reliable gene silencing in plants agroinoculated with recombinant TRV harbouring Jatropha gene sequences. We used VIGS to investigate possible functions of 13 Jatropha genes of several functional categories, including FA biosynthesis, developmental regulation and toxin biosynthesis, etc. Based on the effects of VIGS on the FA composition of newly emerged leaves, we determined the function of several genes implicated in FA biosynthesis. Moreover, VIGS was able to discriminate independent functions of related gene family members. Our results show that VIGS can be used for high-throughput screening of Jatropha genes whose functions can be assayed in leaves. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Analysis of several different schemes for industrial FAME production at higher pressure and temperature (catalytic or non-catalytic synthesis) was realized with the aim to find the best route to reduce the energy consumption (EC) and to improve the life cycle energy efficiency. Obtained results indicated that the EC (MJ/kg FAME) mainly depends on degree of conversion of triglycerides being almost 25% smaller if degree of conversion increase from 97 mass% to complete conversion. Further significant decrease of EC might be obtained at subcritical conditions but only after substantial decrease of methanol to oil molar ratio (from 42 to 15) which requires use of appropriate catalyst. On account of that, the kinetics of heterogeneous catalyzed methanolysis of triglycerides was analyzed using data published in literature (CaO) as well as own experimental data (K2CO3/Al-O-Si) with a goal to obtain reliable kinetic rate constant which might be used for process simulation. This study shows that if heterogeneous process of biodiesel synthesis is realized at subcritical conditions then further decrease of EC is possible. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The continuous fast pyrolysis of soybean oil in a pilot plant was investigated. The experimental runs were carried out according to an experimental design alternating the temperature (from 450 to 600 °C) and the concentration of water (from 0% to 10%). The liquid products were analyzed by gas chromatography and by true boiling point (TPB) distillation. A simple distillation was used to obtain purified products such as gasoline and diesel. Physical-chemical analysis showed that these biofuels are similar to fossil fuels. Mass and energy balances were carried out in order to determine the vaporization enthalpy and the reaction enthalpy for each experiment. The thermal analysis showed that it is possible to use the products as an energy source for the process. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A recent rise in crab aquaculture activities has intensified the generation of waste shells. In the present study, the waste shells were utilized as a source of calcium oxide to transesterify palm olein into methyl esters (biodiesel). Characterization results revealed that the main component of the shell is calcium carbonate which transformed into calcium oxide when activated above 700 °C for 2 h. Parametric studies have been investigated and optimal conditions were found to be methanol/oil mass ratio, 0.5:1; catalyst amount, 5 wt.%; reaction temperature, 65 °C; and a stirring rate of 500 rpm. The waste catalyst performs equally well as laboratory CaO, thus creating another low-cost catalyst source for producing biodiesel. Reusability results confirmed that the prepared catalyst is able to be reemployed up to 11 times. Statistical analysis has been performed using a Central Composite Design to evaluate the contribution and performance of the parameters on biodiesel purity. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of the present work was: (i) to enable biodiesel production from acid waste lard; (ii) to study the esterification reaction as possible pre-treatment at different temperatures, catalyst amount and reaction times; (iii) to evaluate biodiesel quality according to EN 14214 after basic transesterification of the pre-treated fat; and (iv) to predict the impact of using such waste as raw material in mixture with soybean oil. Temperature and catalyst amount were the most important reaction conditions which mostly affected biodiesel quality, namely viscosity and purity. The selected pre-treatment conditions were 65 °C, 2.0 wt% H2SO4 and 5 h, which allowed obtaining a product with a viscosity of 4.81 mm2 s-1 and a purity of 99.6 wt%. The proposed pre-treatment was effective to enable acid wastes as single raw materials for biodiesel production with acceptable quality; however, low yields were obtained (65 wt%). Alkali transesterification of a mixture of waste lard and soybean oil resulted in a product with a purity of 99.8 wt% and a yield of 77.8 wt%, showing that blending might be an interesting alternative to recycle such wastes. Also, because in addition to using conventional and relatively economical processes, some biodiesel properties depending on the raw material composition (such as the iodine value) might even be improved. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper higher fatty acids composition, peroxide and acidic value and density of raw commercial rape oil and of oil fraction formed after each of five cycles of oil heating conducted in two ways - with and without potato chips frying, were compared. After each heating, which duration corresponded to time necessary for potato chips frying, oil was left to cool down (to room temperature) and stored in conditions similar to ones found in small gastronomy. Goal of undertaken research was usability assessment of used frying rape oil as a substrate for biofuel production. Utilization of used frying rape oil as fuel seems to be grounded by favourable ratio of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in oil fraction, which properties stabilize as a result of surface contact with potato chips, as well as by ecological (utilization of waste), energetic (replacement of conventional crude oil based fuels) and economical (utilization of cheap wastes) reasons. © 2008 Institute of Agrophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The anaerobic digestion of glycerol derived from biodiesel manufacturing, in which COD was found to be 1010 g/kg, was studied in batch laboratory-scale reactors at mesophilic temperature using granular and non-granular sludge. Due to the high KOH concentration of this by-product, H3PO4 was added to recover this alkaline catalyst as agricultural fertilizer (potassium phosphates). Although it would not be economically viable, a volume of glycerol was distilled and utilised as reference substrate. The anaerobic revalorisation of glycerol using granular sludge achieved a biodegradability of around 100%, while the methane yield coefficient was 0.306 m3 CH4/kg acidified glycerol. Anaerobic digestion could be a good option for revalorising this available, impure and low priced by-product derived from the surplus of biodiesel companies. The organic loading rate studied was 0.21-0.38 g COD/g VSS d, although an inhibition phenomenon was observed at the highest load. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dimethyl/diethyl carbonate was adopted as extraction solvent and transesterification reagent at the same time for in situ lipase-catalyzed reactive extraction of oilseeds for biodiesel production in this work. Fatty acid methyl esters and ethyl esters were respectively obtained with higher yields than those achieved by conventional two-step extraction/transesterification. The augment ranged from 15.7% to 31.7%. The key parameters such as solvent/seed ratio and water content were further investigated to find their effects on the in situ reactive extraction. The highest yields of Pistacia chinensis Bunge methyl ester, P. chinensis Bunge ethyl ester, Jatropha curcas L methyl ester and J. curcas L ethyl ester could attain 89.6%, 90.7%, 95.9% and 94.5%, respectively under the optimized conditions.

AB  - Used cooking or frying oils are of increasing interest as inexpensive feedstock for biodiesel production. In this work, used frying oils obtained from 16 local restaurants were investigated regarding their fatty acid profile vs. the fatty acid profile of the oil or fat prior to use. The fatty acid profiles were analyzed by gas chromatography and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Besides the fatty acid profile, the acid value and dynamic viscosity of the samples were determined. Dynamic viscosity was determined because of non-Newtonian behavior of some samples. The results indicate that oils and fats experience various degrees of increase in saturation during cooking/frying use, with the magnitude of these changes varying from sample to sample, i.e., a high degree of randomness of composition is found in used frying oil samples. Properties of the samples that were investigated were acid value and viscosity which consistently increased with use, also in a random fashion. Multiple independent samples obtained from the same restaurants indicate that there is little consistency of used cooking oil obtained from the same source. These results are discussed with regards to the potential fuel properties of biodiesel derived from these used frying oils.

AB  - The aim of this work is to study the transesterification of vegetable oil with a high acid number at unchanged reaction conditions. Rapeseed oil was used as the raw material and its acid number was changed by the addition of oleic acid (from 0.89 to 12.25 mg KOH/g). Methanol was used for transesterification (molar ratio of oil to methanol 1:6) and potassium hydroxide was used as a catalyst. After the reaction time, the residue of the catalyst was neutralised by gaseous carbon dioxide and the methanol excess was removed. After the separation of two phases, each of them was analyzed (in the ester phase: yield, content of methyl ester and acid number; in the glycerol phase: yield, density, viscosity, content of glycerol, soaps, methyl ester, potassium carbonate and hydrogen carbonate). The obtained data was compared with theoretical material balances and the effect on the saponification of oil was discussed. The results show that the yield of methyl ester (biodiesel) is significantly affected by a higher acid number, as well as enhanced soap formation. On the other hand, the conversion of the oil and acid number of the ester phase remain at constant values in studied borders. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of biodiesel produced from the transesterification of vegetable oils with methanol and ethanol is currently seen as an interesting alternative to fossil fuels. The output/input energy relation in the biodiesel production life cycle can be an important indicator of the techno-economic and environmental feasibility evaluation of production of biodiesel from different oleaginous plants. Due to increasing environmental concerns about the emissions from fuel-derived atmospheric pollutants, alternative sources of energy have been receiving greater attention. This work does not look to carry out a complete life cycle assessment (LCA) but rather just to focus on the energy balance in the Palm Oil-Derived Methyl Ester (PME) life cycle, taking into account practices in Brazil and Colombia. This work will show the differences between the results attained for the two cases. The output/input energy relation for the evaluated case studies ranged from 3.8 to 5.7, with an average value of 4.8. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, the biodiesel produced from soybean crude oil was prepared by a method of alkaline-catalyzed transesterification. The important properties of biodiesel were compared with those of diesel. Diesel and biodiesel were used as fuels in the compression ignition engine, and its performance, emissions and combustion characteristics of the engine were analyzed. The results showed that biodiesel exhibited the similar combustion stages to that of diesel, however, biodiesel showed an earlier start of combustion. At lower engine loads, the peak cylinder pressure, the peak rate of pressure rise and the peak of heat release rate during premixed combustion phase were higher for biodiesel than for diesel. At higher engine loads, the peak cylinder pressure of biodiesel was almost similar to that of diesel, but the peak rate of pressure rise and the peak of heat release rate were lower for biodiesel. The power output of biodiesel was almost identical with that of diesel. The brake specific fuel consumption was higher for biodiesel due to its lower heating value. Biodiesel provided significant reduction in CO, HC, NOx and smoke under speed characteristic at full engine load. Based on this study, biodiesel can be used as a substitute for diesel in diesel engine. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Transportation liquid biofuels can be used in internal combustion engines are bioethanol and biodiesel. Biofuels, commercial gasoline and diesel fuel, and their blends were used as the fuel of a internal combustion engine. Over the last decade, interest in biofuels have been driven by a variety of concerns including environmental benefits, reducing reliance on imported oil and using renewable domestic energy sources. Biodiesel is the best candidate for diesel fuels in diesel engines. Criteria pollutant emissions from biodiesel blends are now becoming a relevant subject due to the increase in consumption of this renewable fuel worldwide. Biodiesel is the first and only alternative fuel to commercial diesel to have a complete evaluation of emission results. The exhaust gas emissions are reduced with increase in biodiesel concentration of fuel blend. The emission forming gasses such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide from combustion of biodiesel hydrocarbons generally is less than diesel fuel. The lower percentage of biodiesel blends emits very low amount of carbon dioxide in comparison with diesel. The engine emits more carbon monoxide using diesel as compared to that of biodiesel blends under all loading conditions. With increasing biodiesel percentage, carbon monoxide emission level decreases. Sulfur emissions are essentially eliminated with pure biodiesel. The torque values of commercial diesel fuel are greater than those of biodiesel. The brake power of biodiesel was nearly the same as with diesel fuel. The specific fuel consumption values of biodiesel are greater than those of commercial diesel fuel. The effective efficiency and effective pressure values of commercial diesel fuel are greater than those of biodiesel. Biodiesels improve the lubrication properties of the diesel fuel blend. Biodiesel reduced long term engine wear in diesel engines. Even biodiesel levels below1% can provide up to a 30% increase in lubricity.

AB  - Nowadays ethanol is the most popular fuel. Biothanol is ethyl alcohol, grain alcohol, or chemically C 2H 5OH or EtOH. The use of ethanol as a motor fuel has as long a history as the car itself. Ethanol can be produced from cellulose feedstocks such as corn stalks, rice straw, sugar cane bagasse, pulpwood, switchgrass, and municipal solid waste is called bioethanol. Bioethanol is a renewable green fuel that can be produced by hydrolysis and fermentation processes. Global production of bioethanol reached 13.5 billion gallons in 2006. Bioethanol currently accounts for more than 94% of global biofuel production, with the majority coming from sugarcane. Estimates show that bioethanol in the EU becomes competitive when the oil price reaches US§70 a barrel while in the United States it becomes competitive at US§50-60 a barrel. For Brazil the threshold is much lower - between US§25 and US§30 a barrel. EU accounts for about 10% of global bioethanol production. EU bioethanol is generally produced using a combination of sugar beets and wheat. France is currently the front-runner in the EU's attempt to boost bioethanol use, accounting for 2% of global production, mainly from sugar beet and wheat. Bioethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions because the carbon content of the alcohol is primarily derived from photosynthetic carbon of biomass. © Sila Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Liquid biofuels such as bioethanol and biodiesel are important for the future because they replace petroleum fuels. The liquid biofuel derived from renewable sources of feedstock; typically plants such as wheat, sugar beet, corn, straw, and wood; is called as bioethanol. Biodiesel fuels are derived from vegetable oils and animal fats through a chemical process called as transesterification. Renewable biofuels can be produced from biorenewable feedstocks via thermochemical and biochemical conversion technologies such as liquefaction, pyrolysis, gasification, hydrlysis, fermentation etc. Thermochemical and biochemical conversion products from biorenewables are upgraded before ultimate refining processes. The upgrading includes fractionation for separation of primary products. © Sila Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - The fast development of the world's bioethanol industry initiated debates on "food versus fuel" and the industry's environmental impact. Lignocellulosic biomass does not compete with food crops because it utilizes waste resources; however, the processing of a renewable energy source usually involves the consumption of non-renewable resources. To justify the production of second generation biofuels it is necessary to confirm that the energy produced from the lignocellulosic biomass is greater than the energy consumed in the ethanol production. The exergy analysis provides a unified and effective tool for the evaluation of the global process efficiency. This methodology requires an analysis of each stage of the production process. In this work, the stage of enzymatic hydrolysis was chosen as a case study because it is a decisive step in production process performance. The exergy analysis concept has been applied to evaluate two types of enzymatic hydrolysis reactors of lignocellulosic biomass for the production process of second generation bioethanol fuels from renewable resources, with the support of ASPEN-HYSYS® and other software developed by the authors. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the context of fast depletion of fossil fuels and increase of pollution levels with conventional fuels, the search for alternate fuels has become pertinent. Alcohols and vegetable oils are probable candidates to replace diesel fuels as they are renewable in nature. However, use of alcohols in internal combustion engines is limited, as the properties of alcohol fuels are not compatible with diesel fuels. Hence much emphasis is given to the non-edible vegetable oils as alternate fuels in internal combustion engines. However, the drawbacks of low volatility and high viscosity associated with non-edible vegetable oils call for hot combustion chamber, provided by low heat rejection diesel engine. The crude vegetable oils are converted into bio-diesel by the process of esterification, to reduce the molecular weight and viscosity of crude oil. The Investigations are carried out on low heat rejection diesel engines which consists of different degree of insulations such as i) air gap insulated piston with superni crown, air gap insulated liner with superni insert and ii) air gap insulated piston with superni crown, air gap insulated liner with superni insert and ceramic coated cylinder head with esterfied pongamia oil (bio-diesel) with varied injection pressures. Performance is improved with high degree of insulation with vegetable oil in comparison with conventional engine with pure diesel operation © Research India Publications.

AB  - In recent years much research has been carried out to find the best alternative fuel to the conventional petroleum product. The use of all these renewable fuels like ethanol, biogas and biodiesel is very significant, which find a lot of application in the transportation and irrigation sector. As an agriculture country like India, an ample amount of diesel is required for running the water pumps from the diesel engine. In an agricultural state like Punjab a large amount of work is carried out around the years by diesel powered tube wells as the rainy period is very short due to its geographical position. This has created a wide gap between the demand and supply of diesel fuel and it is having a society economic impact on the poor farmers. The focus of present research is to find out the proper set up for the production of bio-diesel from Jatropha oil for the rural areas so that the biodiesel may be applied in irrigation purpose. Further, an experiment program examining performance has been carried out to investigate different design parameters, which influence the engine performance of the 4-stroke vertical single cylinder direct injection compression ignition engine running on 100% biodiesel as fuel. Initially, a small amount of bio-diesel from Jatropha seeds has been prepared and various samples of biodiesel were tested and analyzed for various fuel properties. Then CI engine was run on the different blends of biodiesel fuels (B20, B40, B60, B80, B100 and conventional diesel fuel) and engine performance was examined experimentally. Experimental analysis of engine performance indicates that the low-level blends of biodiesel (B20 and less) does not require any engine modifications and can provide the same payload capacity and range as conventional diesel with slight reduction of engine efficiency. Experimental results further show that a small modification is essential in case of higher blends of biodiesel, as pure biodiesel does not perform well in cold weather conditions because of thickening; and henceforth requires some special arrangements to compensate for this. Diesel fuels blended with biodiesel are better lubricators, which reduces engine wear and tear, making the life of engine components last longer. The experimental investigation shows that the brake thermal efficiency decreases with increase of bio diesel fuel. It is also examined that fuel consumption (Kg/min) also increases with the load for different blends of bio diesel (B20, B40, B60, B80 and B100). The objective of this study is finding the possibility of using 100% bio diesel fuel with slight modification in the engine for the irrigation purpose. © Research India Publications.

AB  - This study assesses the direct and indirect environmental impacts to be expected if Switzerland should replace one percent of its current diesel consumption with imports of A) soybean methyl ester (SME) from Brazil, or B) palm methyl ester (PME) from Malaysia. In order to take into account possible future consequences, what-if scenarios were developed and assessed by means of a consequential LCA. In contrast to attributional LCA, the consequential approach uses system enlargement to include the marginal products affected by a change of the physical flows in the central life cycle. This means that the LCA considers all inputs and outputs which are linked to biodiesel production and that the product system is subsequently expanded to include the marginal products affected. Both future systems are assessed in comparison with the environmental scores of the fossil equivalent to biodiesel, i.e. diesel low in sulphur. The environmental burdens are measured by means of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), land occupation and various non-aggregated and aggregated environmental impact indicators. In sum, the environmental impacts of an increased SME consumption depend on the environmental scores of the marginal replacement products on the world market, rather than on local production factors. In other words, the marginal products assumed to be affected are most important for the results obtained, i.e. in particular the marginal vegetable oil, fodder cake and land areas. In this study it is SME production increased at the expense of the available soybean oil which shifts the impacts associated with soybean oil production to the production of the marginal vegetable oils on the world market. In this perspective, it is not relevant in which country biodiesel production takes place, but rather which vegetable oil is involved. With respect to PME, the most relevant determining factor for the environmental impacts is the land area affected by the increased cultivation of oil palms. Currently, this expansion displaces primarily peat land and rain forest. This causes GHG emissions which are much higher than the emissions of the fossil reference. All in all, both PME from Malaysia and SME from Brazil cause more environmental impact than allowed by the Swiss tax redemption on agro-biofuels (max. 60% GHG emissions and 125% UBP of the fossil reference). © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Chemical compounds, including plant-based phytoestrogens, can function, as hormone mimics and alter endocrine signaling in wildlife. In the present study, the waste streams from 19 plant-processing industries, including biofuel manufacturers, were sampled and analyzed, for the phytoestrogens genistein, daidzein, coumestrol, formononetin, biochanin A, and zearalenone, via liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Eight of these industries contained phytoestrogens at environmentally relevant levels (≥1,000 ng/ L), with the highest at approximately 250,000 ng/L. The influent and effluent streams of three municipal wastewater treatment plants receiving flow from some of these industries also were sampled and analyzed for the same phytoestrogens. It appeared that aerobic biological treatment, such as activated sludge, was able to remove these compounds from the liquid stream. Nevertheless, the effluent stream from one of the wastewater treatment plants had a phytoestrogen concentration above 1,000 ng/L. Results of the present study indicate the need for caution when designing facilities to treat the effluents from biofuel and other plant-processing industries. © 2009 SETAC.

AB  - The recent Introduction of biodiesel blends to the U.S. market has coincided with an increase In the reported problems of fouling of fuel filters and fuel injection equipment, manifested In power loss, noise, vibration, and increased filter changes. However, the Introduction of biodiesel has to a large extent coincided with the introduction of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel and changes in engine technology, leading to higher fuel injection pressures. It Is thus proposed that current incidences of fouling are not a problem brought about solely as a result of the introduction of biodiesel. A review of known fuel degradation mechanisms suggests that the effects of Increased fuel pressure and also high shear environments should be examined as a probable cause of increasing deposit formation. Deposit formation on both fuel filters and injectors has previously been attributed to a variety of sources including: Biological contamination, both aerobic and non-aerobic, water contamination, adulteration with lubricating oil, fuel additive interactions, and biodiesel degradation. The deposits currently being encountered appear to be more akin to the high carbon content particles found in diesel exhaust than those previously described and are frequently found In the presence of deposit precursor molecules. This paper concentrates on the issue of fuel filter fouling, presents the analysis of currently encountered deposits, relates these results to some of the degradation mechanisms alluded to above, and suggests possible precursor molecules In fuels both pre and post stressing to support the proposed mechanisms. It Is also shown that existing fuel quality tests do not correlate well with reported fouling propensity, suggesting that new test methods are required to ensure future fuels are fit for purpose.

AB  - The sustainability performance of five potential UK biodiesel feedstocks is reviewed and their greenhouse gas performance investigated using the carbon and sustainability reporting methods of the UK Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO). Of the feedstocks examined, and for which the RTFO supplies default carbon intensity values, only used cooking oil has guaranteed sustainability benefits. The other feedstocks have CO2e payback periods of 25-5503 years if grown on converted forest or grassland, yet the RTFO currently requires no guarantee that this conversion has not taken place and requires no avoidance of indirect effects. As currently designed, the RTFO risks substantial, adverse environmental effects. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bioenergy is seen as one of the key options to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and substitute fossil fuels. Bioenergy is also an atypical energy source due to its diversity and inter-linkages with many other technological and policy areas. The goal of this paper is to analyze the Portuguese possibilities for bioenergy provision from biomass. The potentials of biomass, conversion technologies and legal framework are analysed and discussed. The result of this analysis shows that there are still unused potentials especially from forestry, which can contribute significantly to cover the bioenergy targets. However, the Portuguese experience with conversion technologies is limited to combustion, which is a drawback that must be solved so as to the bioenergy potential can be used. Research and Development projects, as well as demonstration projects are needed in order to improve the efficiency of the technological processes. At political level, Portuguese governments have been following the policies and strategies of the European Commission in the energy sector. However, energy crops market, due to the inter-linkage with agricultural policy, seems to need some additional political push. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work, we report the measurement of the viscosity of biodiesels derived from waste cooking oil and vegetable oil under high pressure. Using a falling sinker-type viscometer, dynamic viscosity measurements were made at pressures up to 140 MPa which are typically to be found in common-rail automotive diesel engines. Reproducible and reliable viscosity data were obtained from sinker fall times and calibration data. The biodiesel viscosities were compared to that of petrochemical diesel fuels also under high pressure. Both fuel types were found to increase exponentially with pressure with the biodiesels being slightly the more viscous. Above 140 MPa, a marked increase in sinker fall time was observed. This was due to a pressure-freezing effect which is known to also occur with longer chain molecules found in petrochemical diesel, oils, fatty acids and biodiesel. © 2009 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Autotrophic growth of Porphyridium cruentum under 18:12 h and 12:12 h light:dark cycles showed the maximum cell concentration of 2.1 g-dry wt./L, whereas the specific growth rate, 0.042 (1/h), at 18:6 h is faster than that of 12:12 h, 0.031 (1/h), respectively. The highest lipid accumulation level, 19.3 (%, w/w), was achieved at 12:12 h cycle. Under dark cultivation condition with 10 g/L of glucose, the lipid accumulation in the cell was 10.9 (%, w/w), whereas the heterotrophic growth with glycerol as the carbon resource showed low level of cell concentration and lipid production, compared to that of glucose. The glucose was decided to be a suitable carbon resource for the heterotrophic growth of P. cruentum. The lipids from P. cruentum seemed be feasible for biodiesel production, because over 30% of the lipid was C16-C18:1. The cultivation time and temperature were important factors to increase the maximum cell concentration. Extending the cultivation time helps maintain the maximum cell concentration, and higher lipid accumulation was achieved at 25 °C, compared to 35 °C. The fed-batch cultures showed that, under the light condition, the specific production rate was slightly decreased to 0.4% lipid/g-dry wt./day at the later stage, whereas, under the dark condition, the specific production rate was maintained to be a maximum value of 1.1% lipid/g-dry wt./day, even in the later stage of cultivation. The results indicate that the heterotrophic or 12:12 h cyclic mixotrophic growth of P. cruentum could be used for the production of biodiesel in long-term fed-batch cultivation of P. cruentum. © 2009.

AB  - The hikes in hydrocarbon prices during the last years have lead to concern about investment choices in the energy system and uncertainty about the costs for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. On the one hand, high prices of oil and natural gas increase the use of coal; on the other hand, the cost difference between fossil-based energy and non-carbon energy options decreases. We use the global energy model TIMER to explore the energy system impacts of exogenously forced low, medium and high hydrocarbon price scenarios, with and without climate policy. We find that without climate policy high hydrocarbon prices drive electricity production from natural gas to coal. In the transport sector, high hydrocarbon prices lead to the introduction of alternative fuels, especially biofuels and coal-based hydrogen. This leads to increased emissions of CO2. With climate policy, high hydrocarbon prices cause a shift in electricity production from a dominant position of natural gas with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) to coal-with-CCS, nuclear and wind. In the transport sector, the introduction of hydrogen opens up the possibility of CCS, leading to a higher mitigation potential at the same costs. In a more dynamic simulation of carbon price and oil price interaction the effects might be dampened somewhat. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Some European experts on normalization of transport fuels have recently suggested the suppression of the cetane-number limitation from the European biodiesel norm when its final destination is blending with diesel fuel. Although this measure should not affect the range of oils used for biodiesel production (only few of them lead to biodiesel fuels with cetane numbers below this limit), the trend of cetane number to decrease with increasing unsaturation could reinforce the arguments to maintain the iodine-number limitation as an indirect limit for the cetane number. The iodine number has frequently been subjected to controversy because its stringent limitation in Europe prevents from using differently unsaturated fatty oils for biodiesel production. Some of the arguments in favour of extending or eliminating the iodine-number limitation in the norm are exposed here. Previously, a correlation for the estimation of the cetane number based on a literature review is proposed. From this correlation, a procedure is proposed for the estimation of the limiting effect of the current cetane-number limitation on the unsaturation degree of biodiesel fuels. Finally, the impact of the elimination of the cetane-number limitation on the use of different oils for biodiesel production is analyzed. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Two microalgae species (Scenedesmus obliquus and Neochloris oleoabundans) were cultivated in closed sleeve photobioreactors in order to select the best oil producer for further large-scale open raceway pond cultivations, aiming at biofuel production. Scenedesmus obliquus reached a higher maximum biomass concentration (1.41 g l-1) with a lower lipid content (12.8% w/w), as compared to N. oleoabundans [maximum biomass concentration of 0.92 g l -1 with 16.5% (w/w) lipid content]. Both microalgae showed adequate fatty acid composition and iodine values as substitutes for diesel fuel. Based on these results, N. oleoabundans was selected for further open raceway pond cultivations. Under these conditions, N. oleoabundans reached a maximum biomass concentration of 2.8 g l-1 with 11% (w/w) of lipid content. A high correlation between the Nile Red fluorescence intensity measured by flow cytometry and total lipid content assayed by the traditional gravimetric lipid analysis was found for both microalgae, making this method a suitable and quick technique for the screening of microalgae strains for lipid production and optimization of biofuel production bioprocesses. Medium growth optimization for enhancement of microalgal oil production is now in progress. © 2008 Humana Press.

AB  - We assessed current water consumption during liquid fuel production, evaluating major steps of fuel lifecycle for five fuel pathways: bioethanol from corn, bioethanol from cellulosic feedstocks, gasoline from U.S. conventional crude obtained from onshore wells, gasoline from Saudi Arabian crude, and gasoline from Canadian oil sands. Our analysis revealed that the amount of irrigation water used to grow biofuel feedstocks varies significantly from one region to another and that water consumption for biofuel production varies with processing technology. In oil exploration and production, water consumption depends on the source and location of crude, the recovery technology, and the amount of produced water re-injected for oil recovery. Our results also indicate that crop irrigation is the most important factor determining water consumption in the production of corn ethanol. Nearly 70% of U.S. corn used for ethanol is produced in regions where 10-17 liters of water are consumed to produce one liter of ethanol. Ethanol production plants are less water intensive and there is a downward trend in water consumption. Water requirements for switchgrass ethanol production vary from 1.9 to 9.8 liters for each liter of ethanol produced. We found that water is consumed at a rate of 2.8-6.6 liters for each liter of gasoline produced for more than 90% of crude oil obtained from conventional onshore sources in the U.S. and more than half of crude oil imported from Saudi Arabia. For more than 55% of crude oil from Canadian oil sands, about 5.2 liters of water are consumed for each liter of gasoline produced. Our analysis highlighted the vital importance of water management during the feedstock production and conversion stage of the fuel lifecycle. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The physicochemical properties, fatty acids profile and triglyceride compositions of the stillingia oil were analyzed. The stillingia oil was found to contain 98.79% neutral lipids, 0.22% phospholipids and 0.99% glycolipids, which exhibited varying contents of fatty acids. The major triglyceride was double linoleic acid linolenic acid triglyceride, which accounted for approximately 79.49% of the total triglycerides. Preparation of biodiesel from stillingia oil was investigated by enzyme transesterification with methanol as the acyl acceptor. The results showed that lipase type (Novozym 435, Lipozyme TLIM and Lipozyme RMIM), reaction systems (in solvent-free and tert-butanol system) and operational parameters (lipase loading, reaction time, temperature, and molar ratio of alcohol to oil) influenced the biodiesel yield. Fuel properties of biodiesel from stillingia oil were evaluated and all were in acceptable range for use as biodiesel in diesel engines, and had remarkable flash point and satisfactory cold flow properties. It was concluded that stillingia oil was an alternative potential feedstock oil for biodiesel production. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of waste fish oil was performed in a continuous pyrolysis pilot plant. The experiment was carried out under steady-state conditions in which 10 kg of biomass was added at a feed rate of 3.2 kg h-1. A bio-oil yield of 72-73% was obtained with a controlled reaction temperature of 525 °C. The bio-oil was distilled to obtain purified products with boiling ranges corresponding to light bio-oil and heavy bio-oil. These biofuels were characterized according to their physico-chemical properties, and compared with the Brazilian-fuel specifications for conventional gasoline and diesel fuels. The results show that the fast pyrolysis process represents an alternative technique for the production of biofuels from waste fish oil with characteristics similar to petroleum fuels. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the present paper a factor analysis is presented for the enzymatic transesterification of waste oil for biodiesel production. The experimental data on batch reactor evidence two key variables: enzyme loading and mixing conditions. These variables were subjected to a factor analysis and their combined effect on the reaction performance was determined. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used based on a linear first order model (steepest ascent method) and on a second order one in proximity of the optimal solution. The result was a model able to predict reaction performance within the range of mixing rates and enzyme amount considered for model formulation and outside of it, as shown in the final validation. Best performances were obtained at high stirring and high enzyme loading. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of the study was to explore the effects of pre-sowing seed treatments on germination behaviour and to assess the possibilities of increasing the germination rate of Jatropha curcas. Seeds of twenty jatropha accessions obtained from seven different sources were subjected to three pre-sowing treatments viz., control (T0): unsoaked seeds directly sown in the polybag and apply water up to saturation; T1: seed placed on filter paper in the petridis and moistened once with the water; and T2: seeds kept under stone sand and moistened once with the water. Seeds in T1 and T2 were kept for 72 h before sown in the polybag. The study was conducted in the Glass House of Plant Biotechnology Laboratory, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. Study revealed that pre-sowing treatments significantly (p&lt;0.01) enhanced seed germination parameters of Jatropha. Seed germination started 5 days after sowing and continued up to 12 days. The highest germination percentage (95.85%) was observed in T2 and 100% germination was observed in the genotypes viz., UKM-JC-011, UKM-JC-012, UKM-JC-014, UKM-JC-016 and UKM-JC-020 in T1 and T2. None of the genotypes showed 100% germination in T0. The highest Germination Index (GI) and Seedling Vigor Index (SVI) was found in T2 and the lowest in T0. T2 was found more effective in respect to faster germination, high germination percentage, germination index, seedling vigor index, speed and energy of germination. Five accessions viz., UKM-JC-012, UKM-JC-014, UKM-JC-016, UKM-JC-017 and UKM-JC-019 were found suitable in all the treatments including control. © 2009 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

AB  - Microalgal biomass production offers a number of advantages over conventional biomass production, including higher productivities, use of otherwise nonproductive land, reuse and recovery of waste nutrients, use of saline or brackish waters, and reuse of CO2 from power-plant flue gas or similar sources. Microalgal biomass production and utilization offers potential for greenhouse gas (GHG) avoidance by providing biofuel replacement of fossil fuels and carbon-neutral animal feeds. This paper presents an initial analysis of the potential for GHG avoidance using a proposed algal biomass production system coupled to recovery of flue-gas CO2 combined with waste sludge and/or animal manure utilization. A model is constructed around a 50-MW natural gas-fired electrical generation plant operating at 50% capacity as a semibase-load facility. This facility is projected to produce 216 million kWh/240-day season while releasing 30.3 million kg-C/season of GHG- CO 2. An algal system designed to capture 70% of flue-gas CO2 would produce 42,400 t (dry wt) of algal biomass/season and requires 880 ha of high-rate algal ponds operating at a productivity of 20 g-dry-wt/ m2 -day. This algal biomass is assumed to be fractionated into 20% extractable algal oil, useful for biodiesel, with the 50% protein content providing animal feed replacement and 30% residual algal biomass digested to produce methane gas, providing gross GHG avoidances of 20, 8.5, and 7.8%, respectively. The total gross GHG avoidance potential of 36.3% results in a net GHG avoidance of 26.3% after accounting for 10% parasitic energy costs. Parasitic energy is required to deliver CO2 to the algal culture and to harvest and process algal biomass and algal products. At CO2 utilization efficiencies predicted to range from 60-80%, net GHG avoidances are estimated to range from 22-30%. To provide nutrients for algal growth and to ensure optimal algae digestion, importation of 53 t/day of waste paper, municipal sludge, or animal manure would be required. This analysis does not address the economics of the processes considered. Rather, the focus is directed at determination of the technical feasibility of applying integrated algal processes for fossil-fuel replacement and power-plant GHG avoidance. The technology discussed remains in early stages of development, with many important technical issues yet to be addressed. Although theoretically promising, successful integration of waste treatment processes with algal recovery of flue-gas CO2 will require pilot-scale trials and field demonstrations to more precisely define the many detailed design requirements. © 2009 ASCE.

AB  - Problem Statement: Oil palm Empty Fruit Bunches (EFB) are abundant biomass in Malaysia. Studies about production of biofuels using slow pyrolysis of EFB are still lacking. So, this study was aimed to understand the physical and chemical properties of the bio-oil and its simple blends. Approach: EFB was slow pyrolysed with internal heating at terminal temperature of 600°C in a pilot kiln and the main product is the EFB char and the condensates from the emissions were separated into aqueous and tarry fractions. Results: 13 wt% of tarry component (referred as EFB oil) was obtained as small fraction of co-product. The chemical composition of the EFB oil acquired was analyzed by GC-MS and its elemental composition, stability, miscibility, oil fuel properties and corrosion characteristics were determined. The empirical formula of the EFB oil with heating value of 31.44 MJ kg-1 was established as CH1.41N0.03O0.24. Characterizations of bio-oil, diesel and emulsifier blends were performed. Conclusions/Recommendations: The experimental results showed that the emulsions of EFB oil obtained may be directly used as a fuel oil for combustion in a boiler or a furnace without any upgrading. Alternatively, the fuel may be refined to be used by vehicles. © 2009 Science Publications.

AB  - Producing biofuel from microalgae has gained renewed interest recently. Schizochytrium limacinum is a heterotrophic microalga that is capable of producing high levels of biomass and total fatty acid. The objective of this work is to explore the potential of producing biodiesel fuel from this alga using different biodiesel preparation methods, including oil extraction followed by transesterification (a two-stage method) or direction transesterification of algal biomass (a one-stage method). When freeze-dried biomass was used as feedstock, the two-stage method resulted in 57% of crude biodiesel yield (based on algal biomass) with a fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) content of 66.37%. The one-stage method (with chloroform, hexane, or petroleum ether used in transesterification) led to a high yield of crude biodiesel, whereas only chloroform-based transesterification led to a high FAME content. When wet biomass was used as feedstock, the one-stage method resulted in a much-lower biodiesel yield. The biodiesel prepared via the direct transesterification of dry biomass was subjected to ASTMstandard tests. Parameters such as free glycerol, total glycerol, acid number, soap content, corrosiveness to copper, flash point, viscosity, and particulate matter met the ASTM standards, while the water and sediment content, as well as the sulfur content did not pass the standard. Collectively, the results indicate the alga S. limanicum is a suitable feedstock for producing biodiesel via the direct transesterification method. copyright © 2009 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Process integration and intensification is increasingly applied also in the biodiesel production, as shown by recent research papers. This study takes previous work on reactive separation processes for biodiesel production to a new level by proposing an innovative technology based on reactive absorption using solid acid catalysts. This is a major step forward since reactive absorption offers significant benefits over reactive distillation, such as: reduced capital investment and operating costs due to the absence of the reboiler and condenser, higher conversion and selectivity as no products are recycled in the form of reflux or boil-up vapors, as well as no occurrence of thermal degradation of the products due to a lower temperature profile in the column. Rigorous simulations embedding experimental results were performed in AspenTech AspenONE engineering suite to design this novel reactive absorption process and evaluate the technical and economical feasibility. The main results are given for a plant producing 10 ktpy biodiesel from waste vegetable oil with high free fatty acids content, using solid acids as green catalysts. This innovative process eliminates all conventional catalyst-related operations, and efficiently uses the raw materials and the reactor volume in an integrated setup that allows significant savings in CapEx and OpEx of the plant. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are toxic carcinogens so their reductions in diesel-engine emissions are desirable. This study investigated emissions of carbonyl compounds (CBCs) from an HDDE (heavy-duty diesel engine) at US transient cycle test, using five test fuels: premium diesel fuel (D100), P100 (100% palm-biodiesel), P20 (20% palm-biodiesel + 80% premium diesel fuel), PF80P20 (80% paraffinic fuel + 20% palm-biodiesel), and PF95P05 (95% paraffinic fuel + 5% palm-biodiesel). Experimental results indicate that formaldehyde was the major carbonyl in the exhaust, accounting for 70.1-76.2% of total CBC concentrations for all test fuels. In comparison with D100 (172 mg BHP-1 h-1), the reductions of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde emission factor for P100, P20, PF80P20, and PF95P05 were (-16.8%, -61.8%), (-10.0%, -39.0%), (21.3%, 1.10%), and (31.1%, 19.5%), respectively. Using P100 and P20 instead of D100 in the HDDE increased CBC concentrations by 14.5% and 3.28%, respectively, but using PF80P20 and PF95P05 significantly reduced CBC concentrations by 30.3% and 23.7%, respectively. Using P100 and P20 instead of D100 (2867 ton yr-1) in the HDDE increased CBC emissions by 240 and 224 ton yr-1, respectively, but using PF80P20, and PF95P05 instead of D100 in the HDDE decreased CBC emissions by 711 and 899 ton yr-1, respectively. The above results indicate that the wide usage of paraffinic-palmbiodiesel blends as alternative fuels could protect the environment. Crown Copyright © 2009.

AB  - Background: Response surface methodology (RSM), based on central composite rotatable design (CCRD), was used to optimize four transesterification reaction variables: methanol-to-oil molar ratio (3:1-12:1), catalyst (NaOCH3) concentration (0.5-1.25 wt% in relation to oil mass), reaction temperature (45-65°C) and reaction time (30-90 min) at two levels (24 experimental design) to produce rice bran oilmethyl esters (RBOME). Results: The molar ratio of methanol to oil and reaction temperatures were the most significant (P &lt; 0.01) factors affecting the yield of RBOME. A linear relationship was found between the observed and predicted values (R2 = 0.9520). Using multiple regression analysis a quadratic polynomial equation was established for methyl ester yield. The quadratic term of catalyst concentration showed a significant (P &lt; 0.01) effect on esters yield. The interaction terms of methanol to oil molar ratio and catalyst concentration with reaction time exhibited a positive effect on themethyl esters yield (P &lt; 0.05). The optimum reaction conditions for transesterification of rice bran oil were 7.5:1 methanol-to-oil ratio, 0.88% catalyst concentration, 55°C reaction temperature and 60 min reaction time, resulting in a RBOME yield of 83.3%. Gas chromatographic analysis of RBOME produced in the present experiment revealed linoleic, oleic, palmitic and stearic acids to be the major fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). Conclusion: RSM was found to be a suitable technique for optimizing transesterification of rice bran oil. Fuel properties of RBOME as measured according to accepted methods were found to satisfy almost all prescribed ASTM (D 6751) and EN 14214 specifications. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - The term biomass includes any organic substance of biological origin that can be used as a source of energy or as a raw material in the industrial field. In Italy biomass constitutes the most important renewable source, contributing to the nation's energy budget, after hydroelectric power: in 2005, including refuse, biomass provided just over 2.5% of primary energy, mostly devoted to the production of thermal energy and electricity. The processes ripe for the exploitation of biomass energy which are used significantly in Italy are direct combustion of biomass as such and biogas production from anaerobic fermentation of animal husbandry, civil or agro-industrial waste. In the European Union, the prospects for the use of biomass for energy purposes should be seen in the context of a strategy that sets the aim of producing 20% of energy from renewable sources by 2020. In the biofuel sector, given the excess of petrol in the European market and the lack of a distribution network for ethanol, more attention will be paid, in the short-medium term, to the chances of opening up the market for diesel derived from vegetable oils. However in Europe the biodiesel yield per cultivated hectare is modest. In Italy, this is aggravated by the limited quantity of land that can be used for oil rich crops, which in any case makes it hard to reach an adequate critical mass. It follows that, given the aims set in the EU context, significant biodiesel production would have to be based on imported feedstock, with economical and regulatory implications, as well as environmental and social ones. The production of electricity from biomass has grown steadily over the last few years. In 2006 it was 6.7 TWh. It would be desirable for this trend to continue, since it could also contribute to the solution to the age old problems of rubbish disposal. An yearly output of 16 TWh can be hypothesised for 2020. In the short to medium term it will be necessary to concentrate on small size cogeneration plants, 2-300 kW÷1-2 MW, for the production of electricity, steam and hot water intended for mountain and rural areas, in order to exploit as efficiently as possible the local availability of raw materials. In the large urban areas it is necessary to make priority investments in the thermal conversion of solid urban waste for the cogeneration of electricity, steam and hot water to be integrated with networks for industrial use (especially for small and medium industries) and domestic use (district heating).

AB  - A wide variety of terrestrial biomass feed stocks have been identified as suitable candidates for fractionation and conversion into biofuels. In particular, microalgae have been promoted as a future source of transportation fuels primarily because of their stated potential to produce up to 10 times more oil per acre than traditional biofuel crops. Their ability to grow relatively fast, be harvested on a daily basis, and grown in earthen ponds or closed photobioreactors that occupy marginal or poor crop lands using salt or brackish water, are often referenced. When these attractive traits are coupled with the potential to concomitantly harvest valuable co-products such as biopolymers, proteins, and animal feeds, one can see why microalgae are often touted as biotechnology's green gold. The development of large-scale microalgae farms, however, has been slowed by limitations in downstream processing technology. For example, traditional methods to dewater, extract, and recover bio-oil from oil-seeds possess little utility for microalgae. The extreme requirement of dewatering poses tremendous hurdles for any technology processing biofuels from microalgae. To further complicate matters, identifying the most appropriate paths for appropriate extraction technology depends heavily on the microalgal species and its cultivation status, both of which are highly characterized for higher plants as compared to microalgae. In this review we discuss existing extraction methodologies as they have and can be applied to microalgae. Commentary is provided on their potential as a unit operation that exists within the framework of an industrial-scale microalgal cultivation process that extends from the production of biomass in photobioreactors to the fractionation of the recovered bio-oil.

AB  - Made from vegetable oil, waste oil, or animal fats, biodiesel fuel is renewable and nearly carbon neutral; it requires little engine modification, and over time can reduce the United States' dependence on foreign oil. Over the past few decades, the production of biodiesel has increased significantly. Here at the University of Cincinnati (UC), biodiesel is being generated from fryer oil from campus dining halls to reduce diesel use and enhance sustainability on the campus. A secondary goal is to use this process as a real world classroom for students, K-12 teachers, and interested community members wishing to optimize conversion of waste cooking oil to biodiesel. The production of biodiesel at the UC is accomplished via transesterification, whereby waste fryer oil and methanol are converted, with the aid of the catalyst sodium hydroxide, to methyl esters, or biodiesel, and glycerol. The pretreatment, titration/pilot test, full-scale production, and purification processes are quantitatively described here, as are the estimated costs and potential uses of biodiesel on campus. © 2009 by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - PM2.5 emissions and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in PM2.5 of pure biodiesel derived from different feedstocks were investigated and compared with diesel fuel. B100-1 (soyabean oil derived), B100-2 (waste oil derived) and diesel fuel were tested on a diesel engine bench at four operating conditions, including two steady speeds of different loads. The fine particles were collected by fiber quartz filter and particle phase PAHs were analyzed by GC-MS. Compared with diesel fuel, biodiesel decreased PM2.5 emission rates with a maximal reduction rate of 37.3% at operating modes of high loads, while increased PM2.5 emission rates at low loads. PAHs emission rates from biodiesel decreased at all tested modes, with a maximal reduction rate of 77.6%. The emission rates of PM2.5 and PAHs of B100-2 were 14.7% and 17.8% times of B100-1. Low molecular weight PAHs dominated in the emission of three fuels with phenanthrene as maxima and 2-ring and 3-ring PAHs accounted for more than 50% of the total PAHs. Toxic equivalence of PAHs emissions of biodiesel was decreased greatly compared with that of diesel.

AB  - Diesel-like fuels were synthesized by a pyrolysis method using soybean oil (pyrodiesel, PD) and soybean soapstock (SPD), respectively, as starting material. These pyrodiesel samples were compared with soy biodiesel (BD) samples. All these three biofuels (PD, SPD and BD) and their blends with high sulfur (HSD) and low sulfur (LSD) diesel fuels were evaluated by measuring a number of fuel properties, such as oxidative stability, low-temperature performance, acid value and corrosion properties. Compared to BD blends, PD and SPD and their blends were found to have better oxidative stability, though inferior acid values. SPD and its blends have better flow performance at low-temperature compared to BD and PD blends. All the biofuels and their blends met the copper corrosion requirement prescribed by US and European standard. Based on the results reported here, pyrodiesels from these two-different feedstocks have potential and will require some upgrading or change in pyrolysis conditions, if they are to be used as fuel blending component. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The recent moves towards the insertion of biofuels in the energy matrix of a number of countries are opening new prospects for agricultural production and for agroindustrial chains. The emergence of this new productive base raises new research issues: in what circumstances are the structuring, organization and implementation of these biodiesel productive chains taking place in Brazil? What are the effects of biodiesel production on local economies? Hence, the central objective of this study is identifying their economic and social impacts at the regions where they are installed. The analytical structure was constructed based on theories of regional and spatial economy: location coefficient, shift-share, theories of industrial location. A preliminary analysis identified that a biodiesel productive arrangement is emerging in the State of Piauí, Northeastern Brazil, with the purpose of stimulating regional development using alternative oil-bearing crops. However, the agricultural project in the town of Canto do Buriti/PI has faced problems of both a cultural and productive nature. Preliminary findings reveal productive, organizational, managerial and governance related difficulties and challenges that need to be faced when establishing a new productive base in a location that up to that point lacks a productive tradition.

AB  - Droplet size and dynamics of blended palm oil-based fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and diesel oil spray were mechanistically investigated using a phase Doppler anemometry. A two-fluid atomizer was applied for dispersing viscous blends of blended biodiesel oil with designated flow rates. It was experimentally found that the atomizer could generate a spray with large droplets with Sauter mean diameters of ca. 30 μm at low air injection pressure. Such large droplets traveled with a low velocity along their trajectory after emerging from the nozzle tip. The viscosity of blended biodiesel could significantly affect the atomizing process, resulting in the controlled droplet size distribution. Blended biodiesel with a certain fraction of palm oil-based FAME would be consistently atomized owing to its low viscosity. However, the viscosity could exert only a small effect on the droplet velocity profile with the air injection pressure higher than 0.2 MPa. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The massive investment in new jatropha plantations worldwide is not sufficiently based on a profound scientific knowledge of its ecology. In this article, we define the climatic conditions in its area of natural distribution by combining the locations of herbarium specimens with corresponding climatic information, and compare these conditions with those in 83 jatropha plantations worldwide. Most specimens (87%) were found in tropical savannah and monsoon climates (Am, Aw) and in temperate climates without dry season and with hot summer (Cfa), while very few were found in semi-arid (BS) and none in arid climates (BW). Ninety-five percent of the specimens grew in areas with a mean annual rainfall above 944 mm year-1 and an average minimum temperature of the coldest month (Tmin) above 10.5 °C. The mean annual temperature range was 19.3-27.2 °C. The climatic conditions at the plantations were different from those of the natural distribution specimens for all studied climatic variables, except average maximum temperature in the warmest month. Roughly 40% of the plantations were situated in regions with a drier climate than in 95% of the area of the herbarium specimens, and 28% of the plantations were situated in areas with Tmin below 10.5 °C. The observed precipitation preferences indicate that jatropha is not common in regions with arid and semi-arid climates. Plantations in arid and semi-arid areas hold the risk of low productivity or irrigation requirement. Plantations in regions with frost risk hold the risk of damage due to frost. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Field experiment was carried out at Enshas Experiment Station; Jatropha was transplanted and treated after the second year of the transplanting by different amounts of water stress, viz. 125%, 100%, 75% and 50% of potential evapotranspiration (ETp). The study aims to ensure the multiple benefits of Jatropha and its suitability under Egypt's climate in unused lands under scarce water conditions. The results revealed that the average water consumption rate of Jatropha is 6 L week-1 throughout the growing season, which means that Jatropha can survive and produce full yield with high quality seeds under minimum water requirements compared to other crops. The yield of extracted oil was 85.5, 175.2, 90.5 and 66.5 kg ha-1 at 125%, 100%, 75% and 50% of ETp, respectively. The lowest values of total lipid (oil) (25% and 24.5% of Jatropha seeds) were recorded with Jatropha trees that were irrigated by 125% and 50% of ETp, respectively. On the other hand, the treatment that was irrigated by 100% of ETp (control) recorded the highest value of total oil in the seeds (29.93%). The results also revealed that there are no significant differences among the values of the determined oil characteristics due to different water stress ratios. From the results, it could be concluded that the highest characteristics of Jatropha seed oil were recorded with 100% of ETp. In addition water stress had no significant effect on the fatty acid composition of Jatropha seed oil. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Experiments were carried out on a diesel engine operating on Euro V diesel fuel, pure biodiesel and biodiesel blended with methanol. The blended fuels contain 5%, 10% and 15% by volume of methanol. Experiments were conducted under five engine loads at a steady speed of 1800 rev min-1 to assess the performance and the emissions of the engine associated with the application of the different fuels. The results indicate an increase of brake specific fuel consumption and brake thermal efficiency when the diesel engine was operated with biodiesel and the blended fuels, compared with the diesel fuel. The blended fuels could lead to higher CO and HC emissions than biodiesel, higher CO emission but lower HC emission than the diesel fuel. There are simultaneous reductions of NOx and PM to a level below those of the diesel fuel. Regarding the unregulated emissions, compared with the diesel fuel, the blended fuels generate higher formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and unburned methanol emissions, lower 1,3-butadiene and benzene emissions, while the toluene and xylene emissions not significantly different. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Despite its worldwide success, the innovation systems approach is often criticised for being theoretically underdeveloped. This paper aims to contribute to the conceptual and methodological basis of the (technological) innovation systems approach. We propose an alteration that improves the analysis of dynamics, especially with respect to emerging innovation systems. We do this by expanding on the technological innovation systems and system functions literature, and by employing the method of 'event history analysis'. By mapping events, the interactions between system functions and their development over time can be analysed. Based on this it becomes possible to identify forms of positive feedback, i.e. cumulative causation. As an illustration of the approach, we assess the biofuels innovation system in The Netherlands as it evolved from 1990 to 2007. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - As a promising source of biodiesel, Chlorella has drawn more and more attention of researcher, while rapid screening of enhanced lipid production becomes essential. Here we investigated lyophilized alga powders as the starting material and optimized Nile red method for quantitative measurement of neutral lipids in Chlorella with a high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.99) between gravimetric and spectrofluorimetric quantification. Using this method, Chlorella vulgaris were screened out of several Chlorella strains with the highest lipid content and orthogonal design experiments were performed to search for the significant factors affecting lipid accumulation. Our data implied that the sensitivity and versatility enable this method a useful tool in optimizing culture and accumulation condition of lipid production in alga and figured out several factors significantly influenced lipid production in C. vulgaris. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Corn-based ethanol is exponentially growing in the US, as is the need for valuable uses for coproducts of the production process, such as distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS). Currently, DDGS is used as livestock feed, thereby replacing some corn components in animal diets. As the industry continues to grow, there will be an increased need to find additional uses for DDGS. Physical and chemical properties of coproduct streams are becoming increasingly investigated, as these characteristics affect many aspects of utilization, such as target species, optimal dietary substitution rates, transportation, flowability, and behavior during storage. Potential avenues for future use of DDGS may include value-added feed, food, and industrial products. Additionally, much interest lies in extracting oil from DDGS to produce bio diesel and other products. If oil is extracted from DDGS, the resulting chemical and physical properties of the remaining constituents may be substantially altered. The objective of this study was to quantify, using standard laboratory methods, physical and chemical property values for low-oil DDGS. The extracted DDGS exhibited water activity, thermal properties, bulk density, and angle of repose values similar to unmodified DDGS. Color values were substantially lighter, however. Additionally, fat levels (2.7% db) were much lower, while protein (34.0% db) and fiber (8.4% db) were higher than traditional DDGS. Results from this study will be valuable to ethanol manufacturers and livestock producers alike, as more uses for ethanol coproducts are implemented. Thus more value can be extracted from the humble kernel of corn.

AB  - Although Jatropha curcas, an important tropical biofuel crop, is reputed for its drought resistance, its ability to perform under dry conditions has hardly been investigated. In a greenhouse experiment we investigated the plant-water relationships of Jatropha seedlings from different accessions under different levels of drought stress. There was little difference in plant-water relations between accessions. Drought significantly reduced leaf area, biomass and relative growth rate, but had no effect on specific leaf area, daily range in leaf water potential, leaf water content, transpiration efficiency or aboveground biomass water productivity, corrected for atmospheric conditions. Stem wood density was equally low (0.26 g cm-3) for all treatments. Stem water content was lowest for dry treatment seedlings. Based on these results, Jatropha could be characterized as a stem-succulent tree. In contrast to other stem-succulent deciduous trees, leaves were not shed immediately after the seedlings were confronted with drought. Instead, at the onset of drought, leaves with a higher adaxial stomatal density were formed, after which leaves were only gradually shed. The role of the succulent stem in the water economy of Jatropha was confined to balancing the small water losses of the leaves during drought. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The pyrolysis reactions of soybean oils have been studied. The pyrolytic products were analyzed by GC-MS and FTIR and show the formation of olefins, paraffins, carboxylic acids and aldehydes. Several kinds of catalysts were compared. It was found that the amounts of carboxylic acids and aldehydes were significantly decreased by using base catalysts such as Na2CO3 and K2CO3. The low acid value pyrolytic products showed good cold flow properties and good solubility in diesel oil at low temperature. The results presented in this work have shown that the pyrolysis of soybean oils generates fuels that have chemical composition similar to petroleum based fuels. Crown Copyright © 2009.

AB  - Biodiesel could be synthesized using Brønsted acidic ionic liquid N-methyl-2-pyrrolidonium methyl sulfonate ([NMP][CH3SO3]) as a catalyst, specially with free long-chain fatty acids or their mixtures, as well as with low-molecular weight alcohols as substrates. This catalyst showed good catalytic and reusable performance under mild conditions and without any additional organic solvent. The ionic liquid could be reused eight times after the water in the ionic liquid was removed. The yields of fatty acid alkyl esters could reach between 93.6% and 95.3% after the esterifications were carried out at 70 °C for 8 h. Therefore, an efficient and environmentally friendly catalyst was provided for the synthesis of biodiesel from low-cost feedstocks such as waste oils. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Neat mahua oil poses some problems when subjected to prolonged usage in CI engine. The transesterification of mahua oil can reduce these problems. The use of biodiesel fuel as substitute for conventional petroleum fuel in heavy-duty diesel engine is receiving an increasing amount of attention. This interest is based on the properties of bio-diesel including the fact that it is produced from a renewable resource, its biodegradability and potential to exhaust emissions. A Cummins 6BTA 5.9 G2- 1, 158 HP rated power, turbocharged, DI, water cooled diesel engine was run on diesel, methyl ester of mahua oil and its blends at constant speed of 1500 rpm under variable load conditions. The volumetric blending ratios of biodiesel with conventional diesel fuel were set at 0, 20, 40, 60, and 100. Engine performance (brake specific fuel consumption, brake specific energy consumption, thermal efficiency and exhaust gas temperature) and emissions (CO, HC and NOx) were measured to evaluate and compute the behavior of the diesel engine running on biodiesel. The results indicate that with the increase of biodiesel in the blends CO, HC reduces significantly, fuel consumption and NOx emission of biodiesel increases slightly compared with diesel. Brake specific energy consumption decreases and thermal efficiency of engine slightly increases when operating on 20% biodiesel than that operating on diesel. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Alcohols have been used as a fuel for engines since 19th century. Among the various alcohols, ethanol is known as the most suited renewable, bio-based and ecofriendly fuel for spark-ignition (SI) engines. The most attractive properties of ethanol as an SI engine fuel are that it can be produced from renewable energy sources such as sugar, cane, cassava, many types of waste biomass materials, corn and barley. In addition, ethanol has higher evaporation heat, octane number and flammability temperature therefore it has positive influence on engine performance and reduces exhaust emissions. In this study, the effects of unleaded gasoline (E0) and unleaded gasoline-ethanol blends (E50 and E85) on engine performance and pollutant emissions were investigated experimentally in a single cylinder four-stroke spark-ignition engine at two compression ratios (10:1 and 11:1). The engine speed was changed from 1500 to 5000 rpm at wide open throttle (WOT). The results of the engine test showed that ethanol addition to unleaded gasoline increase the engine torque, power and fuel consumption and reduce carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. It was also found that ethanol-gasoline blends allow increasing compression ratio (CR) without knock occurrence. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nanosized particles emitted from automotive engines continue to attract concern because of their adverse health effects and their impact on the environment. Automotive engines are a major source of fine and ultrafine particles emitted into the atmosphere. Through stricter emission regulations and the introduction of advanced technologies, the specific particulate mass emissions (in g/km and g/kWh) from internal combustion engines have decreased by about 1 order of magnitude since the 1980s. However, the number concentration of nanoparticles (No./m3) emitted from internal combustion engines may continue to increase considerably and has recently attracted the attention of the Particle Measurement Programme (PMP). This program is intended to evaluate engine nanoparticle measurement systems for use in future emission regulations. In the study reported in this paper, two latest-generation engines, one spark-ignited and the other compression-ignited, were used for a comparison of the particulate emission characteristics, including number density. Both engines were single-cylinder with the same displacement volume of 500 cm 3, and neither included after-treatment traps or catalytic converters. Test fuels used for the study were: gasoline and E85 (mixture of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline, sometimes called gasohol) for the spark-ignited engine having a compression ratio of 10; and ultralow sulfur diesel (ULSD) and BD100 (100% biodiesel, i.e. soybean methyl ester) for the compression-ignited engine having a compression ratio of 15. A fast-response particle spectrometer (DMS500) with heated sample line was used for continuous measurement of the particle size and number distribution in the size range of 5-1000 nm (aerodynamic diameter). The experimental results showed that particle number peaked within the range of 10-300 nm under all engine operating conditions, regardless of engine combustion type. An observed shift toward larger particle size with increasing engine load could be explained by particle coagulation. The effect of the different fuels on nanoparticle size distributions was dependent on the engine type (spark-ignition or compression-ignition). © 2009 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Camelina sativa oil provides a reliable solution for biodiesel production by providing a sustainable, lowinput biofuel feedstock option in some climates. In the present study, optimization of the transesterification of camelina sativa oil using different heterogeneous metal oxide catalysts, i.e., BaO, SrO, MgO, and CaO, was evaluated. The results of comparative experiments showed that the most effective catalyst was 1 wt % BaO, which showed an >80% yield of camelina to biodiesel conversion in 3 h at 100 °C. The relative order of the effectiveness of the catalysts was BaO > SrO > CaO > MgO. These catalysts were characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) to obtain their physical and chemical properties. The important variables affecting the methyl ester yield during the transesterification reaction are the molar ratio of alcohol/oil, catalyst amount, and reaction temperature. The fuel properties of biodiesel produced were compared to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards for biodiesel.© 2009 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Hydrocracking of vegetable oils is a prominent technology for the production of biofuels. This work compares the product yields and quality of hydrocracking fresh and used cooking oil under nominal operating conditions. Cracking, heteroatom removal and saturation reaction mechanisms are evaluated for both feedstock types and for three typical hydrocracking temperatures. The assessment of both feedstocks indicates that they are both suitable for high diesel yields with smaller kerosene/jet and gasoline/naphtha yields. As temperature increases, diesel selectivity increases for both feedstock types. However, the used oil feedstock exhibits higher kerosene/jet and naphtha selectivity at low temperatures (350 °C) and lower at the highest hydrocracking temperature (390 °C). © 2009 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Studies of aldol condensation/hydrogenation reactions of 2-hexanone were carried out over Pd/CeZrOx and CeZrOx catalysts at temperatures between 573 and 673 K, and pressures of 5-26 bar. These studies were formulated to address the catalytic upgrading to transportation fuels of the mono-functional oxygenated compounds (consisting primarily of C4-C6 ketones, alcohols, carboxylic acids and heterocyclics) formed by the catalytic conversion of polyols over a Pt-Re/C catalyst. Characterization by XRD, TPR and NH3/CO2-TPD showed that Pd/CeZrOx catalyst consists of a partially reducible solid solution of cerium and zirconium oxides, and possesses both acidic and basic functionalities. Reaction kinetics studies show that in addition to the expected C12 condensation product (7-methyl-5-undecanone), the CeZrOx-based catalysts produce C18 and C9 secondary species, along with light alkanes (≤C7). Low loadings of Pd (e.g., 0.25 wt%) lead to optimal activity and selectivity for the production of C12 species. The high apparent activation energy of the formation of C9 (140 kJ/mol) compared to the formation of C12 and C18 species (15 and 28 kJ/mol, respectively) indicates that these species may be formed as a result of the decomposition of heavier condensation products. The self-coupling of 2-hexanone was found to be positive order in both 2-hexanone and hydrogen. The addition of primary alcohols and carboxylic acids as well as water and CO2 to the feed was found to reversibly inhibit the self-coupling activity of 2-hexanone. This inhibition is strongest in the presence of CO2, and TPSR studies indicate that CO2 is removed from the surface by conversion to CO in the presence of reduced ceria species. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The biorefinery concept is a very powerful concept to optimise the conversion of biomass resources to value-added products with a minimum loss of energy and mass and a maximum overall value of the production chain. We here report our activities on the application of this concept to valorise the Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) shrub, a (sub)-tropical plant producing a high quality plant oil that may be converted to biodiesel in good yields. Within a research consortium of Dutch and Indonesian researchers, we are exploring high added value outlets for byproducts of the JCL plant (leaves, latex) and seed processing units (press cake). As an example, we here report fast pyrolysis experiments to convert the nut shells to fast pyrolysis oil, a promising second generation biofuel. The fast pyrolysis experiments were carried out in a continuous bench scale pyrolyser at a throughput of 2.27 kg/h at 480 °C and atmospheric pressure. The nut shell pyrolysis oil was obtained in 50 wt.% yield, the remainder being char (23 wt.%), gas (17 wt.%) and ash. Relevant product properties of the oil were determined and indicate that the oil is inhomogeneous in nature. © 2009 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - This paper considers the contribution that biorefineries, through the production of second-generation biofuels from lignocellulosic feedstocks, can make in the Republic of Ireland to the mandated 10% transport biofuel quotient for 2020. An emphasis is placed on the avoidance of land-use conflict issues and, hence, on the prioritization of waste/residue utilization before dedicated energy crops are grown. It is concluded that up to 5.3% of the 2010 demand for biofuels can be met from the utilization of feasible quantities of wastes and residues in near-term biorefining technologies and that 5% of the 2020 petrol and diesel demand can be met via processing a similar quantity of waste in advanced biorefining processes based on consolidated bioprocessing micro-organisms and syngas-reforming catalysts. The remaining biofuel requirements for 2020 can be met by processing energy crops. Between 1.4% and 15.9% of the agricultural area of Ireland is required for the production of these crops, depending on the particular feedstock and technology employed. The production of a high-yielding Miscanthus crop that is harvested directly after senescence will place the minimum requirement on Irish land. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This paper deals with a biorefinery classification approach developed within International Energy Agency (IEA) Bioenergy Task 42. Since production of transportation biofuels is seen as the driving force for future biorefinery developments, a selection of the most interesting transportation biofuels until 2020 is based on their characteristics to be mixed with gasoline, diesel and natural gas, reflecting the main advantage of using the already-existing infrastructure for easier market introduction. This classification approach relies on four main features: (1) platforms; (2) products; (3) feedstock; and (4) processes. The platforms are the most important feature in this classification approach: they are key intermediates between raw materials and final products, and can be used to link different biorefinery concepts. The adequate combination of these four features represents each individual biorefinery system. The combination of individual biorefinery systems, linked through their platforms, products or feedstocks, provides an overview of the most promising biorefinery systems in a classification network. According to the proposed approach, a biorefinery is described by a standard format as 'platform(s) - products - and feedstock(s)'. Processes can be added to the description, if further specification is required. Selected examples of biorefinery classification are provided; for example, (1) one platform (C6 sugars) biorefinery for bioethanol and animal feed from starch crops (corn); and (2) four platforms (lignin/syngas, C5/C6 sugars) biorefinery for synthetic liquid biofuels (Fischer-Tropsch diesel), bioethanol and animal feed from lignocellulosic crops (switchgrass). This classification approach is flexible as new subgroups can be added according to future developments in the biorefinery area. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Interspecific hybridization in Jatropha species plays a significant role in crop improvement by transferring useful traits such as yield, high oil content, maximum number of seeds, more femaleness, and hard stems for promoting Jatropha as a biofuel crop. The wide crosses among the species resulted in limited success due to pollen incompatability. Hence, the objective of the study was to assess preand postzygotic barriers through pollen-pistil interaction between cultivated Jatropha curcas and other three wild Jatropha species. In this study, the cross J. curcas × J. gossypifolia, even though the pollen tubes reached ovaries after pollination, failed to produce seeds, and the cross between J. curcas × J. podagrica indicated incompatibility signs of bulged pollen tubes coupled with reverse direction of pollen tube growth. The interspecific cross of J. curcas with J. villosa showed crossability barriers of crinkled and twisted growth pattern of pollen tubes and failed to reach ovary. In the case of selfing (J. curcas × J. curcas), pollen tubes reached ovary within an hour and produced normal seeds. Reciprocal crosses of these species exhibited successful fertilization of pollen tubes, but seed set was very low or no seed set was noticed. © Crop Science Society of America.

AB  - Current interest in the large-scale use of biofuels has grown in response to both energy security and climate change concerns; however, it is also increasingly apparent that these benefits can come only at the expense of increased demand for agricultural resources such as land and water. Furthermore, recent studies also suggest that changes in land use patterns for energy crop cultivation can incur significant carbon debts that can only be recovered after many years of operation. The environmental feasibility of the use of energy crops to make biofuels can thus be viewed in terms of three main performance indicators-the land use, water and carbon footprints arising from a given level of system output. An optimal solution thus needs to account for tradeoffs that may be inherent in the conflicting objectives. This work presents a fuzzy multiple-objective modeling approach for determining optimal bioenergy system configuration given targets for the three footprint metrics. The fuzzy optimization approach is integrated with an input-output-based life cycle model for establishing system material and energy balances. The approach is demonstrated here through the analysis of different scenarios for the integrated production of biodiesel, ethanol and electricity under anticipated energy demand conditions in the Philippines. © 2009.

AB  - In this work three scenarios of biomass production, conversion and utilization of different biofuels (sunflower crude oil, sunflower refined oil and sunflower methyl-ester) in a rural context are compared. The analysis is referred to the district of Pisa, in Italy. Technical feasibility was analysed by comparing process schemes and safety issues, while environmental impacts were studied by applying the methodology of life cycle assessment. Scenarios involving upgrading of crude sunflower oil (refined oil and biodiesel) require complex plants and the management of dangerous materials, and they produce considerable amounts of wastewater. These scenarios need larger plant size, more complex organization (farm cooperatives) and higher costs than the simple mechanical operations associated with crude oil production. On the other hand the use of low-quality fuels in internal combustion engines can lead to short engine lifetime and high pollutant emissions. The life cycle analysis shows that the biofuel upgrading processes (refining and transesterification) and oil transport have a low influence on the environmental impact, compared to seed cultivation, which is the most impacting step. However fuel upgrading allows a significant reduction in polluting emission during combustion; as a consequence biodiesel results the most sustainable biofuel. © 2009 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The reduction of oil resources and the consequent increasing price of oil distillates as well as the environmental concerns of conventional fuels has renewed and increased interest on the preparation of biofuels from renewable resources. One of those interests is nowadays focused on biodiesel, which is usually prepared from crude and refined triglyceride containing raw materials, such as vegetable oils, animal fats and wastes—for instance waste cooking oil and yellow and brown grease. Since several commercial interests converge on this kind of feedstock, one of the priorities being crops for human food supply, the research efforts on biodiesel production are diverting towards the use of low quality triglyceride-containing raw materials. Nevertheless, all of these feedstocks feature high water and free fatty acids (FFAs) content, which strongly affects the behaviour of conventional homogeneous base catalysts. These catalysts are primarily NaOH and KOH, but also NaOCH3 and KOCH3 are employed—as solutions in methanol—mainly in large-scale production plants. In this context, an appropriate solid acid catalyst which could simultaneously carry out esterification of FFAs and transesterification of triglycerides would be of great interest for biodiesel production. Moreover, a heterogeneous acid catalyst could be easily incorporated into a packed bed continuous flow reactor, simplifying product separation and purification and reducing waste generation. The present review attempts to provide a wide overview on the possibility of heterogeneous acid catalysts for biodiesel production replacing the homogeneous conventional process. In this way, three aspects of solid acid catalysis for biodiesel production will be reviewed. The first section deals with the solid acid-catalyzed esterification of FFAs, the second topic relates to the transesterification of triglycerides, while the third deals with solid acid-catalyzed transformation of bioglycerol into oxygenated compounds for biodiesel formulation. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Composition of higher fatty acids, peroxide value (PV), acidic value (AV), as well as colour of raw, commercial rape oil and oil fraction formed after each of seven heating cycles of the oil conducted in two ways - with and without frying potato chips, were compared. After each heating of the oil, the duration of which corresponded with time required to fry potato chips, it was cooled down to room temperature and stored in conditions simulating those of a small gastronomy restaurant. The goal of undertaken research was evaluation of physicochemical properties and usability of post-frying sunflower oil as a substrate for biofuel production. Utilization of post-frying sunflower oil as a fuel seems to be justifiable when the beneficial ratio of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in oil fraction, a property that stabilizes as a result of surface contact with potato chips, as well as ecological (utilization of waste) and economic (partial substitution of crude oil derived fuels) benefits are taken into consideration. © 2009 Institute of Agrophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The complicated and controversial regulation passed by California mandates that the carbon intensity of fuels be reduced by 10% by 2020, which will reduce gasoline and diesel fuel consumption by 20-25%, quadruple the use of low-carbon fuels, and cut harmful emissions by 16 million ton. The regulation is also projected to transform the state's energy infrastructure by essentially forcing the petroleum industry to turn to other technologies, such as electric, hydrogen, biofuels, etc. The standard is also expected to drive the availability of plug-in hybrid, battery electric and fuel-cell powered cars while promoting investments in electric charging stations and hydrogen fueling stations. At least 13 states, plus the US federal government and the EU, are expected to follow California's lead with similar laws. The regulation requires providers, refiners, importers, and blenders to ensure that the fuels they provide for the California market meet an average declining standard of carbon intensity. Under the regulation, fuel providers must show that their products meet the standard for each annual compliance period, tracking their fuel's carbon intensity through a system of credits and deficits. The amount of credits earned or purchased from another party must be equal to or greater than the deficits. Credits may be banked and traded within the LCFS market to meet obligations.

AB  - Conversion of vegetable oils predominantly composed of triglycerides using pyrolysis type reactions represents a promising option for the production of renewable fuels and chemicals. The purpose of this article was to compare catalytic cracking with thermal cracking on production of gaseous hydrocarbon and gasoline conversion by cottonseed oil, and to discuss the difference on composition of products from catalytic cracking and thermal cracking. Reaction products are heavily dependant on the catalyst type (catalyst activation) and reaction conditions. They can range from dry gas to light distillate, such as dry gas, liquefied petroleum gas and gasoline. When the temperature of catalytic cracking is over 460 °C, the effects of thermal cracking must be considerable. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The biofuels include bioethanol, biobutanol, biodiesel, vegetable oils, biomethanol, pyrolysis oils, biogas, and biohydrogen. There are two global biomass based liquid transportation fuels that might replace gasoline and diesel fuel. These are bioethanol and biodiesel. World production of biofuel was about 68 billion L in 2007. The primary feedstocks of bioethanol are sugarcane and corn. Bioethanol is a gasoline additive/substitute. Bioethanol is by far the most widely used biofuel for transportation worldwide. About 60% of global bioethanol production comes from sugarcane and 40% from other crops. Biodiesel refers to a diesel-equivalent mono alkyl ester based oxygenated fuel. Biodiesel production using inedible vegetable oil, waste oil and grease has become more attractive recently. The economic performance of a biodiesel plant can be determined once certain factors are identified, such as plant capacity, process technology, raw material cost and chemical costs. The central policy of biofuel concerns job creation, greater efficiency in the general business environment, and protection of the environment. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We studied the spray characteristics of inedible oil using experimental and simulation methods. Spray penetration, spray cone angle and spray tip speed were measured at different biodiesel ratios in a constant volume vessel with wide visualization and high back pressure, using a high-speed camera. The characteristics of biodiesel spray were simulated under the same conditions using Star-CD software. The experimental results showed that, as the ratio of biodiesel in the blends increased, spray penetration and spray speed increased, but the spray cone angle decreased. Throughout the spray injection period, the region at 0.05-0.475S (spray tip penetration) was a key area affecting spray cone angle. From 0.8 ms after injection, the spray penetration deviation ratios started to increase with increasing biodiesel blend ratios. Simulation results showed similar macroscopic spray characteristics to the experimental results for jatropha oil. The results also showed that the Sauter mean diameter of blend fuels was greater than that of diesel, and spray was more concentrated, due to the higher viscosity and surface tension of the biodiesel, compared with conventional diesel fuel. The macroscopic and microscopic spray properties of blended fuels containing 5%, 10% and 20% biodiesel were similar to diesel. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bio-diesel fuels are non-petroleum-based diesel fuels consisting of long chain alkyl esters produced by the transesterification of vegetable oils, that are intended for use (neat or blended with conventional fuels) in unmodified diesel engines. There have been few reports of studies proposing theoretical models for bio-diesel combustion simulations. In this study, we developed combustion models based on ones developed previously. We compiled the liquid fuel properties, and the existing detailed mechanism of methyl butanoate ester (MB, C5H10O2) oxidation was supplemented by sub-mechanisms for two proposed fuel constituent components, C7H16 and C7H8O (and then, by mp2d, C4H6O2 and propyne, C3H4) to represent the combustion model for rapeseed methyl ester described by the chemical formula, C19H34O2 (or C19H36O2). The main fuel vapor thermal properties were taken as those of methyl palmitate C19H36O2 in the NASA polynomial form of the Burcat database. The special global reaction was introduced to "crack" the main fuel into its constituent components. This general reaction included 309 species and 1472 reactions, including soot and NOx formation processes. The detailed combustion mechanism was validated using shock-tube ignition-delay data under diesel engine conditions. For constant volume and diesel engine (Volvo D12C) combustion modeling, this mechanism could be reduced to 88 species participating in 363 reactions. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Guizotia abyssinica seeds, a common bird feedstock, have been explored for the potential of biodiesel synthesis. The oil was extracted from the seeds by solvent extraction and composition of G. abyssinica oil was examined. The reaction parameters for biodiesel synthesis have been optimized. Temperature, oil: methanol ratio, catalyst type and catalyst concentration were found to have significant role on ester conversion. According to this study, the maximum yield of ester (98.7%) can be obtained with optimized sodium methoxide catalyst dosage (0.6%) at an operational temperature of 65 °C. Methyl ester of G. abyssinica oil was also studied for its oxidation stability and low temperature properties. Further, the synthesized product was blended in diesel at 5-20% ratios and evaluated for physico-chemical properties. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hydrocracking of used cooking oil is studied as a potential process for biofuels production. In this work several parameters are considered for evaluating the effectiveness of this technology, including hydrocracking temperature, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) and days on stream (DOS). Conversion and total biofuels production is favored by increasing temperature and decreasing LHSV. However moderate reaction temperatures and LHSVs are more attractive for diesel production, whereas higher temperatures and smaller LHSVs are more suitable for gasoline production. Furthermore heteroatom (S, N and O) removal increases as hydrocracking temperature increases, with de-oxygenation being particularly favorable. Saturation, however, is not favored with temperature indicating the necessity of a pre-treatment step prior to hydrocracking to enable saturation of the double bonds and heteroatom removal. Finally the impact of extended operation (catalyst life) on product yields and qualities indicates that all reactions are affected yet at different rates. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biofuels have a tremendous potential to reduce problems caused by our dependence on fossil fuels. The current roadblock with biofuels is the lack of economical conversion technologies. Heterogeneous catalysis offers immense potential in helping to make lignocellulosic biofuels a commercial reality. In this article we discuss the central role of heterogeneous catalysis in biomass conversion. We review the science of catalysis and the different routes to make biofuels. During the last several decades multiple new spectroscopic, theoretical, and synthesis tools are available that allow us to study catalysis at a molecular level. These new tools will allow us to rapidly develop new catalytic processes for the production of cost-efficient lignocellulosic biofuels. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Substitution of soy-based biodiesel fuels for petroleum diesel will alter life cycle emissions for construction vehicles. A life cycle inventory was used to estimate fuel cycle energy consumption and emissions of selected pollutants and greenhouse gases. Real-world measurements using a portable emission measurement system (PEMS) were made for five backhoes, four front-end loaders, and six motor graders on both fuels from which fuel consumption and tailpipe emission factors of CO, HC, NOx, and PM were estimated. Life cycle fossil energy reductions are estimated at 9% for B20 and 42% for B100 versus petroleum diesel based on the current national energy mix. Fuel cycle emissions will contribute a larger share of total life cycle emissions as new engines enter the in-use fleet. The average differences in life cycle emissions for B20 versus diesel are: 3.5% higher for NOx; 11.8% lower for PM, 1.6% higher for HC, and 4.1% lower for CO. Local urban tailpipe emissions are estimated to be 24% lower for HC, 20% lower for CO, 17% lower for PM, and 0.9% lower for NOx. Thus, there are environmental trade-offs such as for rural vs urban areas. The key sources of uncertainty in the B20 LCI are vehicle emission factors. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Three light-duty vehicles in five different configurations [a Honda Accord operating with diesel with a closed-coupled oxidation catalyst and an underfloor catalyst replaced in some tests with a diesel particle filter (DPF), a Toyota Corolla operating with gasoline, and a VW Golf alternatively operating with petrodiesel or biodiesel] were tested in a dynamometer facility to develop an improved understanding of the factors affecting the toxicity of particulate exhaust emissions. The vehicles were tested using a variety of real-world driving cycles, more than the certification test (New European Driving Cycle). Particle samples were collected and analyzed for elemental and organic carbon (EC and OC, respectively), water soluble and water insoluble organic carbon (WSOC and WISOC, respectively), and inorganic ions, and the emission rates (mg/km) for each vehicle/configuration were determined. A dithiothreitol (DTT) assay was used to assess the oxidative potential of the particulate matter (PM) samples. The DPF-equipped diesel and gasoline vehicles were characterized by the lowest overall PM mass emissions, while the diesel and biodiesel cars produced the most potent exhaust in terms of oxidative activity. When the DPF was fitted on the Honda Accord diesel vehicle, the mass emission rates and distance-based oxidative potential were both decreased by 98%, compared to the original configuration. Correlation analysis showed that the DTT consumption rate was highly associated with WSOC, WISOC, and OC (R = 0.98, 0.93, and 0.94, respectively), consistent with previous findings. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Volatility and flash point for the pseudo-binary mixtures of sunflowerseed-based biodiesel + ethanol were measured over the entire composition range. The biodiesel was prepared by the transesterification of sunflowerseed oil in supercritical methanol without using any catalyst. The vapor pressures of mixtures of biodiesel + ethanol as a function of temperature were measured by comparative ebulliometry with an inclined ebulliometer. The vapor pressures versus composition at different temperatures and temperatures versus composition at different pressures were obtained from Antoine correlations. It is found that ethanol can adjust effectively the volatility and flash point of the biodiesel. The correlation of the flash points with the vapor pressure data for the pseudo-binary mixtures of biodiesel + ethanol displays agreement with the experimental data obtained by closed cup test. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - During the last years, the demand for biofuels has increased significantly. In Brazil, a production of 1 billion liters of biodiesel was produced by the end of 2007, due to its obligatory use in the composition of the diesel for vehicle use. In this production, a hundred thousand tons of glycerol are produced as by-product, for which alternative uses are needed. As glycerol has already been studied by other conventional characterization methods in the past, thermal analysis has been used mostly for characterization of sub ambient temperature properties of glycerol. In this paper, thermogravimetry (TG), derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were used for its thermal characterization above room temperature. Thermal stability was determined from experimental data, which show that even in air, only a very small part of the volatilized glycerol is burned out. A thermogravimetric quantitative method was developed to determinate the water content of glycerol-water mixtures, which also was used to quantify the water impurity in proanalysis samples of glycerol, showing compatible results with those obtained by Karl Fischer method. © Akadémiai Kiadó, 2009.

AB  - The term biofuel is referred to liquid, gas, and solid fuels predominantly produced from biomass. Biofuels include bioethanol, biomethanol, vegetable oils, biodiesel, biogas, bio-synthetic gas (bio-syngas), bio-oil, bio-char, Fischer-Tropsch liquids, and biohydrogen. Biomethanol can be produced from biomass using bio-syngas obtained from steam reforming process of biomass. Biomethanol is considerably easier to recover than the bioethanol from biomass. Ethanol forms an azeotrope with water so it is expensive to purify the ethanol during recovery. Methanol recycles easier because it does not form an azeotrope. Gasoline and ethanol mixtures are called gasohol. Diesohol is a mixture of diesel fuel and hydrated ethanol that is blended using a chemical emulsifier. Diesohol is used in compression ignition engines as an alternative diesel fuel. The reductions of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide were 32 and 29% for CO emissions and 43 and 45% for CO2 emissions of E15 gasohol and diesohol, respectively. The reductions of unburned hydrocarbon were 27 and 24% for E15 blends and 74 and 69.8% for E60 blends of gasohol and diesohol, respectively.

AB  - Thermogravimetry has been widely used for the characterization of several biomasses but the most useful information given by this technique has been normally concerned to the relative amounts of humidity, hemi-cellulose, cellulose and lignin present in the biomass. TG-FTIR has been used to yield qualitative data about the pyrolysis products, in an exploratory way, by some authors. In the present paper, this technique was employed to reach comparative data about the products of pyrolysis of biomasses that are potentially available at economic bases for the production of biofuels. Agricultural residues such as coconut shell, sugarcane bagasse, corn stalks and peanut shell were chosen to be investigated. For all samples, the thermogravimetric curves showed a mass loss between 35 and 400 °C changed up to 73%, while that the loss between 400 and 800 °C changed up to 26%. TG-FTIR indicated tendencies in the rate of the formation of important species during the pyrolysis process of the four biomasses studied. The interpretation of the spectra allowed the proposition of characteristic absorbance ratios and the comparison of these values allowed inferences about the relative abundances of components formed in the pyrolysis of the biomasses. As an example of the possible inferences reached, among the species formed in the pyrolysis condensate, called bio-oil, the formation of carboxylic acids has to be specially considered due to their corrosivity. Thus, the data produced indicated that a bio-oil derived from peanut shell should be a little less acidic while the one derived from sugarcane bagasse should be showed more acidic among the biomasses studied. © 2009 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - A marine microalga, strain JPCC GA0024 was selected as high amount of neutral lipid producers from marine microalgal culture collection toward biofuel production. The strain was tentatively identified as Scenedesmus rubescens by 18S rDNA analysis. The growth of strain JPCC GA0024 was influenced by artificial seawater concentrations. The optimum growth of 0.79 g/l was obtained at 100% artificial seawater. The lipid accumulation reached 73.0% of dry cell weight at 100% artificial seawater without additional nutrients for 11 days. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis indicates that lipid fraction mainly contained hydrocarbons including mainly hexadecane (C16 H34) and 1-docosene (C22 H44). Furthermore, calorimetric analysis revealed that the energy content of strain JPCC GA0024 was 6,160 kcal/kg (25.8 MJ/kg) of calorific value, which was equivalent to the coal engery. The strain JPCC GA0024, S.rubescens, will become a promising resource that can grow as a dominant species in the seawater for the production of both liquid and solid biofuels. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The boreal forests of Scandinavia offer a considerable resource base, and use of the resource for the production of less carbon-intensive alternative transport fuel is one strategy being considered in Norway. Here, we quantify the resource potential and investigate the environmental implications of woodbased transportation relative to a fossil reference system for a specific region in Norway. We apply a well-to-wheel life cycle assessment to evaluate four E85 production system designs based on two distinct wood-to-ethanol conversion technologies. We form best and worst case scenarios to assess the sensitivity of impact results through the adjustment of key parameters, such as biomass-to-ethanol conversion efficiency and upstream biomass transport distance. Depending on the system design, global warming emission reductions of 46% to 68% per-MJ-gasoline avoided can be realized in the region, along with reductions in most of the other environmental impact categories considered. We find that the region's surplus forest-bioenergy resources are vast; use for the production of bioethanol today would have resulted in the displacement of 55% to 68% of the region's gasoline-based global warming emission-or 6% to 8% of Norway's total global warming emissions associated with road transportation. © 2009 by Yale University.

AB  - Biodiesel from microalgae seems to be the only renewable biofuel that has the potential to completely replace the petroleum-derived transport fuels. Therefore, improving lipid content of microalgal strains could be a cost-effective second generation feedstock for biodiesel production. Lipid accumulation in Scenedesmus obliquus was studied under various culture conditions. The most significant increase in lipid reached 43% of dry cell weight (dcw), which was recorded under N-deficiency (against 12.7% under control condition). Under P-deficiency and thiosulphate supplementation the lipid content also increased up to 30% (dcw). Application of response surface methodology in combination with central composite rotary design (CCRD) resulted in a lipid yield of 61.3% (against 58.3% obtained experimentally) at 0.04, 0.03, and 1.0 g l-1 of nitrate, phosphate, and sodium thiosulphate, respectively for time culture of 8 days. Scenedesmus cells pre-grown in glucose (1.5%)-supplemented N 11 medium when subjected to the above optimized condition, the lipid accumulation was boosted up to 2.16 g l-1, the value ~40-fold higher with respect to the control condition. The presence of palmitate and oleate as the major constituents makes S. obliquus biomass a suitable feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The characteristics of carbonyl compounds emissions were investigated on a direct injection, turbocharged diesel engine fueled with pure biodiesel derived from soybean oil. The gas-phase carbonyls were collected by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH)-coated silica cartridges from diluted exhaust and analyzed by HPLC with UV detector. A commercial standard mixture including 14 carbonyl compounds was used for quantitative analysis. The experimental results indicate that biodiesel-fueled engine almost has triple carbonyls emissions of diesel-fueled engine. The weighted carbonyls emission of 8-mode test cycle of biodiesel is 90.8 mg (kW h)-1 and that of diesel is 30.7 mg (kW h)-1. The formaldehyde is the most abundant compound of carbonyls for both biodiesel and diesel, taking part for 46.2% and 62.7% respectively. The next most significant compounds are acetaldehyde, acrolein and acetone for both fuels. The engine fueled with biodiesel emits a comparatively high content of propionaldehyde and methacrolein. Biodiesel, as an alternative fuel, has lower specific reactivity (SR) caused by carbonyls compared with diesel. When fueled with biodiesel, carbonyl compounds make more contribution to total hydrocarbon emission. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The governments of Brazil and India are planning a large expansion of bioethanol and biodiesel production in the next decade. Considering that limitation of suitable land and/or competition with other land uses might occur in both countries, assessments of potential crop productivity can contribute to an improved planning of land requirements for biofuels under high productivity or marginal conditions. In this paper we model the potential productivity of sugarcane and jatropha in both countries. Land requirements for such expansions are calculated according to policy scenarios based on government targets for biofuel production in 2015. Spatial variations in the potential productivity lead to rather different land requirements, depending on where plantations are located. If jatropha is not irrigated, land requirements to fulfill the Indian government plans in 2015 would be of 410 000 to 95 000 km2 if grown in low or high productivity areas respectively (mean of 212 000 km2). In Brazil land requirements, are of 18 000-89 000 km2 (mean of 29 000 km2), suggesting a promising substitute to soybean biodiesel. Although future demand for sugarcane ethanol in Brazil is approximately ten times larger than in India, land requirements are comparable in both countries due to large differences in ethanol production systems. In Brazil this requirement ranges from 25 000 to 211 000 km2 (mean of 33 000 km2) and in India from 7000 to 161 000 km2 (mean 17 000 km2). Irrigation could reduce the land requirements by 63% and 41% (24% and 15%) in India (Brazil) for jatropha and sugarcane respectively. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - High amounts of acid compounds in bio-oil not only lead to the deleterious properties such as corrosiveness and high acidity, but also set up many obstacles to its wide applications. By hydrotreating the bio-oil under mild conditions, some carboxylic acid compounds could be converted to alcohols which would esterify with the unconverted acids in the bio-oil to produce esters. The properties of the bio-oil could be improved by this method. In the paper, the raw bio-oil was produced by vacuum pyrolysis of pine sawdust. The optimal production conditions were investigated. A series of nickel-based catalysts were prepared. Their catalytic activities were evaluated by upgrading of model compound (glacial acetic acid). Results showed that the reduced Mo-10Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst had the highest activity with the acetic acid conversion of 33.2%. Upgrading of the raw bio-oil was investigated over reduced Mo-10Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. After the upgrading process, the pH value of the bio-oil increased from 2.16 to 2.84. The water content increased from 46.2 wt.% to 58.99 wt.%. The H element content in the bio-oil increased from 6.61 wt.% to 6.93 wt.%. The dynamic viscosity decreased a little. The results of GC-MS spectrometry analysis showed that the ester compounds in the upgraded bio-oil increased by 3 times. It is possible to improve the properties of bio-oil by hydrotreating and esterifying carboxyl group compounds in the bio-oil. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The provision of biofuels today is based on energy crops rather than residual biomass, which results in the requirement of agricultural land area. The side products may serve as animal feed and thus prevent cultivation of other feedstock and the use of corresponding land area. These effects of biofuel provision have to be taken into account for a comprising assessment of land area requirement for biofuel provision. Between 18.5 and 21.1 Mio. hectares (ha) of land area is needed to meet the EU 2020 biofuel target depending on the biofuel portfolio when substitution effects are neglected. The utilization of the bioethanol side products distiller′s dried grain and solubles (DDGS) and pressed beet slices may save up to 0.7 Mio. ha of maize cultivation area in the EU. The substitution effect due to the utilization of biodiesel side products (oil cakes of rape, palm and soy) as animal feed may account for up to 7.1 Mio. ha of soy cultivation area in Brazil. The results show that the substitution of land area due to use of side products might ease the pressures on land area requirement considerably and should therefore not be neglected in assessing the impacts of biofuel provision worldwide. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A study was performed on 20 Class-8 trucks paired by make, model, mileage, and drive cycles. Ten trucks were operated using #2 Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel and 10 using a 20% soy methyl ester blend (B20). All trucks were equipped with data collection units that monitored engine information including fuel consumption, idle time, truck speed, engine load, and engine speed. Data collection occurred over a continuous span of 12 months. In addition to operating data, laboratory-based fuel and engine oil testing was performed to quantify the analytical differences between the two fuel types. Cetane number, energy content, density, kinematic viscosity, and lubricity was measured for both fuels and at every oil service interval engine oil samples were evaluated based on fuel dilution, soot content, wear metals, contaminant metals, viscosity, oxidation, and acid/base number. Operational and maintenance issues such as cold start reliability, fuel filter service intervals, and general engine maintenance was also analyzed for each fleet. Statistical analysis was performed to determine significant differences in the performance of engines on these #2ULSD and B20 fuels. At the conclusion of the study minimal differences were found with most comparisons, the exceptions primarily found in differences between the engine oil samples based on the two fuel types used in the study. These differences included viscosity, acid/base number, oxidation, and lead wear which indicated slightly higher oil degradation levels with B20 use. © 2009 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Multi-parameter flow cytometry was used to monitor cell intrinsic light scatter, viability, and lipid content of Chlorella protothecoides cells grown in shake flasks. Changes in the right angle light scatter (RALS) and forward angle light scatter (FALS) were detected during the microalgal growth, which were attributed to the different microalgal cell cycle stages. The proportion of cells not stained with PI (cells with intact cytoplasmic membrane) was high (> 90%) during the microalgal growth, even in the latter stationary phase, suggesting that the microalgal cells built-up storage materials which allowed them to survive under nutrient starvation, maintaining their cytoplasmic membranes intact. A high correlation between the Nile Red fluorescence intensity measured by flow cytometry and total lipid content assayed by the traditional lipid extraction method was found for this microalga, making this method a suitable and quick technique for the screening of microalgal strains for lipid production, optimization of biofuel production bioprocesses, and scale-up studies. The highest oil content (∼28% w/w dry cell weight, estimated by flow cytometry) was observed in the latter stationary phase. In addition, C. protothecoides oil also depicted the adequate fatty acid methyl ester composition for biodiesel purposes at this growth phase, suggesting that the microalgal oil produced during the latter stationary phase could be an adequate substitute for diesel fuel. Medium growth optimization for enhancement of microalgal oil production is now in progress, using the multi-parameter approach. © The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg GmbH 2009.

AB  - This article is a literature review on alternative and ecological fuels, and its production, combustion, performance and emissions. The study is based on the reports of many researchers who published their results between 1999 and 2008. As the conventional fuels and oils are depleting day by day there is a need to find out an alternative fuels and oils to fulfill the energy demand of the world. Biodiesel, methanol, ethanol, hydrogen are the best available sources to fulfill the energy demand. The scientists and researchers conducted tests by using different sources to alternative fuels production and their blends with conventional fuels. Most of the scientists reported that short-term engine tests using different kind of vegetable oils were very promising, but the long-term test results showed higher carbon build up and lubricating oil contamination resulting in engine failure. It was reported that the combustion characteristics of alternative fuels like biofuels are similar as conventional fuels and blends were found to have shorter ignition delay, higher ignition temperature, and higher ignition temperature and peak heat release. The engine power output was found to be equivalent to that of conventional diesel fuel and it observed that the base catalysts in biodiesel production schemes are more effective than acid catalysts and enzymes. This review discussed also some of the processes that are being developed as an alternative to present-day hydrodesulphurisation processes that are based on heterogeneous catalysis. The technologies applied in these alternatives range from adsorption, oxidation to simple physical separation methods - non-destructive adsorption, extraction.

AB  - Backfround: Raw glycerol fractions as the waste material from biodiesel production were investigated for its antioxidant and anticorrosive properties. For comparison raw glycerol fractions and biodiesel fuels together with different oil feedstocks (as an input material for the transesterification process) were measured by means of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Additionally glycerol fractions were subjected to corrosivity testing (Herbert method). Results: 1,2,3-Propanetriol-containing fractions exhibited high free radical scavenging properties, in comparison with biodiesel and oil material. Additionally, the Herbert test proved the anticorrosive ability of the crude glycerol fractions investigated. Radical scavenging (antioxidant) properties obtained from EPR spectroscopy paralleled the anticorrosive investigations, with samples having the highest quenching abilities giving the best results in the Herbert tests. Conclusion: The anticorrosive activity of glycerol fractions examined in this paper generates a new application in lubricant manufacturing.The results show new ways of utilising raw glycerol fraction without very costly and time-consuming purification. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Computational science is paramount to the understanding of underlying processes in internal combustion engines of the future that will utilize non-petroleum-based alternative fuels, including carbon-neutral biofuels, and burn in new combustion regimes that will attain high efficiency while minimizing emissions of particulates and nitrogen oxides. Next-generation engines will likely operate at higher pressures, with greater amounts of dilution and utilize alternative fuels that exhibit a wide range of chemical and physical properties. Therefore, there is a significant role for high-fidelity simulations, direct numerical simulations (DNS), specifically designed to capture key turbulence-chemistry interactions in these relatively uncharted combustion regimes, and in particular, that can discriminate the effects of differences in fuel properties. In DNS, all of the relevant turbulence and flame scales are resolved numerically using high-order accurate numerical algorithms. As a consequence terascale DNS are computationally intensive, require massive amounts of computing power and generate tens of terabytes of data. Recent results from terascale DNS of turbulent flames are presented here, illustrating its role in elucidating flame stabilization mechanisms in a lifted turbulent hydrogen/air jet flame in a hot air coflow, and the flame structure of a fuel-lean turbulent premixed jet flame. Computing at this scale requires close collaborations between computer and combustion scientists to provide optimized scaleable algorithms and software for terascale simulations, efficient collective parallel I/O, tools for volume visualization of multiscale, multivariate data and automating the combustion workflow. The enabling computer science, applied to combustion science, is also required in many other terascale physics and engineering simulations. In particular, performance monitoring is used to identify the performance of key kernels in the DNS code, S3D and especially memory intensive loops in the code. Through the careful application of loop transformations, data reuse in cache is exploited thereby reducing memory bandwidth needs, and hence, improving S3D's nodal performance. To enhance collective parallel I/O in S3D, an MPI-I/O caching design is used to construct a two-stage write-behind method for improving the performance of write-only operations. The simulations generate tens of terabytes of data requiring analysis. Interactive exploration of the simulation data is enabled by multivariate time-varying volume visualization. The visualization highlights spatial and temporal correlations between multiple reactive scalar fields using an intuitive user interface based on parallel coordinates and time histogram. Finally, an automated combustion workflow is designed using Kepler to manage large-scale data movement, data morphing, and archival and to provide a graphical display of run-time diagnostics. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels offer the potential to substitute for a large proportion of fossil fuels, however it is considered that the utilisation of lignocellulosic biomass, via second-generation biorefining technologies, will be necessary for this to be achieved economically and sustainably. The lignocellulosic matrix is complex and recalcitrant to conversion but research in biorefining is advancing rapidly and commercial facilities are expected in the near-term. These facilities will either employ hydrolytic mechanisms to break apart the structural polysaccharides of the biomass, or thermochemical procedures to dehydrate and volatilise the feedstock. Catalysts serve vital roles in both approaches: acids and enzymes facilitate the hydrolysis of cellulose; while metal and biological catalysts can alter the volatilisation profiles of biomass or reform the gases that are liberated in the thermochemical process. Each potential biorefining technology currently has its own drawbacks and advantages and it is likely that a range of procedures will be needed in order to fully exploit the values of very diverse ranges of lignocellulosic feedstocks. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Production of second-generation biofuels via gasification followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is receiving increased attention due to the high-quality fuels produced. Although this process scheme produces fuel components compatible with conventional fossil fuels, the high-investment cost associated with its commercial application renders this option economically unfeasible. For this reason other process schemes are explored, primarily aiming to lower investment costs. Such options include co-processing liquids from biomass flash pyrolysis in refining processes like fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) or in hydroprocessing. Vegetable oils could also by hydroprocessing with petroleum oils. In this paper small-scale pilot plant results will be presented from the following three process schemes aiming to the production of high-quality biofuels: (i) catalytic pyrolysis of biomass over FCC zeolitic catalysts at moderate temperatures. From this process the effect of catalyst on the yields of coke, gaseous and liquid products will be reported. (ii) Co-processing gas oil mixed with hydrotreated biomass pyrolysis liquids. It will be shown that, depending on the concentration of biomass liquids, this option is technically viable for FCC units. (iii) Co-hydroprocessing vacuum gas oil (VGO) with sunflower oil to produce mid-distillates, mainly gasoline and diesel. For this option catalysts and process conditions will be discussed. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - EPA is announcing an extension of the public comment period for the proposed rule "Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives: Changes to Renewable Fuel Standard Program" (RFS2). EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking, which included a request for comment, in the Federal Register on 5/26/2009. The revised statutory requirements specify the volumes of cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel that must be used in transportation fuel each year, with the volumes increasing over time. The rule proposed regulations designed to ensure that refiners, blenders, and importers of gasoline and diesel would use enough renewable fuel each year so that the four volume requirements of the Energy Independence and Security Act would be met with renewable fuels that also meet the required lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions performance standards. The RFS2 proposed rule describes the standards that would apply to these parties, the lifecycle greenhouse gas modeling, and the renewable fuels that would qualify for compliance. The public comment period was to end on 7/27/2009, 60 days after publication in the Federal Register. The purpose of this document is to extend the comment period an additional 60 days until 9/25/2009. This extension of the comment period is provided to allow the public additional time to provide comment on the proposed rule. The comment period for the proposed rule published on 5/26/2009 (74 FR 24904) is extended.

AB  - Proficiency testing programs (PTPs) play an important role in maintaining the quality of data produced in a laboratory. PTPs are a useful statistical quality assurance (SQA) tools to monitor the strengths and weaknesses of a laboratory's performance. Many laboratory accreditation agencies require laboratory participation in such programs. Two significant PTPs sponsored by American Society for Testing and Materials Committee D02 on Petroleum Products and Lubricants have been the programs on biodiesel and fuel-ethanol that were launched in the past few years. The data obtained from these SQA programs will be presented and analyzed for the lessons learned and the changes that are necessary in these PTP programs and biofuels specifications.

AB  - A substantial opportunity exists to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, as well as dependence on foreign oil, by developing strategies to cleanly and efficiently use biodiesel, a renewable domestically available alternative diesel fuel. However, biodiesel utilization presents several challenges, including decreased fuel energy density and increased emissions of smog-generating nitrogen oxides (NOx). These negative aspects can likely be mitigated via closed-loop combustion control provided the properties of the fuel blend can be estimated accurately, on-vehicle, in real-time. To this end, this paper presents a method to practically estimate the biodiesel content of fuel being used in a diesel engine during steady-state operation. The simple generalizable physically motivated estimation strategy presented utilizes information from a wideband oxygen sensor in the engine's exhaust stream, coupled with knowledge of the air-fuel ratio, to estimate the biodiesel content of the fuel. Experimental validation was performed on a 2007 Cummins 6.7 l ISB series engine. Four fuel blends (0%, 20%, 50%, and 100% biodiesel) were tested at a wide variety of torque-speed conditions. The estimation strategy correctly estimated the biodiesel content of the four fuel blends to within 4.2% of the true biodiesel content. Blends of 0%, 20%, 50%, and 100% were estimated to be 2.5%, 17.1%, 54.2%, and 96.8%, respectively. The results indicate that the estimation strategy presented is capable of accurately estimating the biodiesel content in a diesel engine during steady-state engine operation. This method offers a practical alternative to in-the-fuel type sensors because wideband oxygen sensors are already in widespread production and are in place on some modern diesel vehicles today. © 2009 by ASME.

AB  - The Sunshine Farm, in central Kansas, offers a unique data set detailing all the inputs and outputs of a farming project intended to be based, as much as possible, on solar energy. Such a complete and detailed data set, encompassing more than 1.25 M data points for an 85-ha, 7-year project, has never before been compiled for any farm. The data show that important energy inputs that have thus far been left out of existing farm energy efficiency estimates, with implications for biofuels and other biomass for energy technologies. The SSF achieved energy efficiencies superior to conventional agriculture while maintaining soil health and delivering more nutritious, organic products. A first-ever analysis of the energy efficiency of horse traction shows that horses are significantly less energy efficient and much less labor efficient than tractors, although the horses in the study were clearly underutilized. An analysis of the farm removing all inputs and outputs relevant to the horses shows that without horses the Sunshine Farm would have been competitive with conventional energy efficiencies even taking into account the farm's higher labor inputs and small size.

AB  - This paper presents the regulated emissions in the light of cylinder pressure and heat release rate (HRR) from a 4-stroke direct injection (DI) diesel engine fuelled with neat soybean oil-based biodiesel, commercial diesel and 20% biodicsel-diesel blend. The engine was run using electrical dynamometer at four different engine conditions. The experimental results revealed that brake power (BP) of the engine decreased but brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) increased with biodiesel as compared to diesel. Relative to diesel, the maximum combustion pressure (MCP) was higher; however, HRR curves were not much deeper in the ignition delay (ID) periods and the premixed combustion peaks were lower with biodiesel. Carbon monoxide (CO), total hydrocarbons (HC), smoke opacity, and particulate matter (PM) emissions decreased by 3% to 14%, 32.6% to 46%, 56.5% to 83%, and 71% to 87.8%, respectively; however, oxides of nitrogen (NOx) increased by 2% to 10% with biodiesel, compared to the commercial diesel. Both smoke and NOx pollutants were greatly influenced by the MCP. CO, HC, and PM emissions were higher at lower load conditions compared to higher load conditions, but NOx and smoke pollutants were higher at higher load conditions relative to lower load conditions.

AB  - Biodiesel is gaining importance as an alternate source of attractive fuel because of depleting fossil fuel resources. It is produced by trans-esterification, in which oil or fat reacts with a monohydric alcohol in presence of a catalyst. In the present work, trans-esterification of sunflower oil with methanol is carried out by using zirconia supported isopoly and heteropoly tungstates (HPAs) as catalysts. Effects of reaction parameters, such as catalyst types and its concentration, molar ratio of sunflower oil to methanol, reaction temperature and time, have been optimized to get higher conversion of sunflower oil and the product distribution of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) in the trans-esterfication reaction.

AB  - Portable infrared (IR) analyzers were introduced as suitable measurement solutions for biofuels blend quality and wastewater testing. Portable IR analyzers, such as the InfraCal TOG/TPH analyzer allowed for on-site analysis by regulators or industrial pretreatment personnel. The extraction and measurement procedure involved a number of simple steps, permitting an operator to perform the analysis with minimum training. The effluent sample was collected in a container, a solvent, such as a hexane or perchloroethylene was added, and the sample was shaken. The solvent separated carrying dissolved oil with it, while the solvent extract was placed in the analyzer and after a few minutes displayed the results, completing the analysis task within a short period of time.

AB  - Bio-substitutes for conventional oil derived products, which become increasingly popular, pose processing and storage problems. The increased acidity of the biofuels can have an adverse effect on elastomer seals used in process equipment and storage vessels. Various elastomers were subjected to long-term immersion testing over a 12 mo period to assess the effects of biofuel and biodiesel fuel chemistries on elastomers typically used with traditional gasoline and diesel. The 12-mo ethanol and biodiesel immersion tests showed that conventional NBR elastomers can be used within their normal operating parameters for both conventional gasoline and gasoline/ethanol blends. However, they suffer from significant swelling with biodiesel. Bisphenol-cured FKM elastomers should be replaced with peroxide-cured FKM for biofuel and biodiesel applications. The rate of swelling varies depending on the immersion conditions, e.g., aged fatty acid methyl ester is more aggressive than fresh fatty acid methyl ester.

AB  - Can. J. Plant Sci. 89: 791-810. This paper summarizes biological information on three cruciferous weed species: Camelina alyssum, C. microcarpa and C. sativa. Camelina sativa, which had been gathered or cultivated as an oil seed for many centuries in Europe, was the first to reach North America as a weed, towards the mid-19th century, gradually spreading across the prairies, mainly in crops, to British Columbia and the Northwest Territory. The most common of the three species in North America, C. microcarpa, arrived in the late 19th century, and subsequently appeared at numerous crop and uncultivated sites across the country, probably in cargo as the railways expanded. Camelina alyssum appeared in the early 20th century at restricted sites on the prairies, mostly in Saskatchewan. All three species have diminished in importance as crop weeds in western Canada over the past few decades. This reduction could be related to increased weed control by herbicides. Herbicide-resistant biotypes have recently been reported in C. microcarpa. Camelina sativa has attracted renewed interest as an oil crop, because of an adaptation to various climatic conditions, low nutrient requirements and resistance to disease and pests. In Europe, where it is now widely grown, it has shown considerable potential in the food, animal feed, nutraceutical, paint, dye, cosmetic and biofuel industries. In North America, it is being grown on a trial basis mainly for its potential as a biofuel in Alberta, Saskatchewan, the Maritime Provinces, and the northern United States of America.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. (Euphorbiaceae) has the potential to become a key biofuel crop. Manual pruning (MP) is one of the major management practices in commercial plantations of this crop, resulting in production of more branches and thus increased potential for more inflorescences leading to a higher seed yield. However, this method is time-consuming, labour-intensive and expensive. This study was conducted to determine the potential of different plant growth regulators (PGRs) to increase the number of lateral branches of J. curcas. A single foliar application of N 6-benzyladenine (BA) at 12 mM significantly increased branches in both the pot (4.0) and field (13.2) trials compared to MP (1.8 and 5.7, respectively) and control (no new branches) plants. In the field, a single foliar application of 1.0 mM 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) resulted in a significant increment in the number of branches (15.9) after 7 months. Of all the PGRs examined, 2,3:4,6-di-O-isopropylidene-2-keto-l- gluconic acid (dikegulac; DK) at 2.0 mM produced the maximum number of branches (18.0) in the field 7 months after application. Concentrations of 2.0 and 3.0 mM of 1,2-dihydro-3,6-pyridazinedione (maleic hydrazide; MH) significantly increased the number of branches, 4 and 7 months after spraying in both the pot trial in the shade house and field, respectively. Under field conditions, J. curcas plants responded better to all the PGRs (DK &lt; TIBA &lt; BA &lt; MH) when treated once, with insignificant variations in other growth parameters. This study indicates that a single foliar application of PGRs under field conditions can be an alternative method to MP for increasing the number of lateral branches of J. curcas. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Microalgae offer great promise to contribute a significant portion of the renewable fuels that will be required by the Renewable Fuels Standard described in the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act of the United States. Algal biofuels would be based mainly on the high lipid content of the algal cell and thus would be an ideal feedstock for high energy density transportation fuels, such as biodiesel as well as green diesel, green jet fuel and green gasoline. A comprehensive research and development program for the development of algal biofuels was initiated by the US Department of Energy (DoE) more than 30 years ago, and although great progress was made, the program was discontinued in 1996, because of decreasing federal budgets and low petroleum costs. Interest in algal biofuels has been growing recently due to increased concern over peak oil, energy security, greenhouse gas emissions, and the potential for other biofuel feedstocks to compete for limited agricultural resources. The high productivity of algae suggests that much of the US transportation fuel needs can be met by algal biofuels at a production cost competitive with the cost of petroleum seen during the early part of 2008. Development of algal biomass production technology, however, remains in its infancy. This perspective provides a brief overview of past algal research sponsored by the DoE, the potential of microalgal biofuels and a discussion of the technical and economic barriers that need to be overcome before production of microalgal-derived diesel-fuel substitutes can become a large-scale commercial reality. © Published in 2009 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A two-step method is proposed to obtain high selectivity and high conversion rate for producing additive triacetylglycerol of biofuel from its byproduct glycerol. The esterification of glycerol with acetic acid was carried out over resin and zeolites. Amberlyst-35 was found to be an excellent catalyst. The reaction conditions were optimized by testing catalysts, temperatures, feedstock ratios as well as loads of catalysts. The optimal conditions are temperature of 105 °C and an acetic acid to glycerol molar ratio of 9:1 with 0.5 g catalyst. After the 4 hour reaction of the optimal condition, the selectivity of triacetylglycerol reaches almost 100% in 15 min by adding thereto acid anhydride. Recycling experiments indicate that no significant deactivation of Amerlyst-35 occurred during the reaction. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biomass is a renewable energy source and its importance will increase as national energy policy and strategy focuses more heavily on renewable sources and conservation. Biomass is considered the renewable energy source with the highest potential to contribute to the energy needs of modern society for both the industrialized and developing countries worldwide. The most important biomass energy sources are wood and wood wastes, agricultural crops and their waste byproducts, municipal solid waste, animal wastes, waste from food processing, and aquatic plants and algae. Biomass is one potential source of renewable energy and the conversion of plant material into a suitable form of energy, usually electricity or as a fuel for an internal combustion engine, can be achieved using a number of different routes, each with specific pros and cons. Currently, much research has been focused on sustainable and environmental friendly energy from biomass to replace conventional fossil fuels. The main objective of the present study is to investigate global potential and use of biomass energy and its contribution to the sustainable energy development by presenting its historical development. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Farm support in higher income countries is a testament to the fundamental social and economic importance of agriculture, yet domestic efforts to support this sector can arouse multilateral discord in a world of global food markets. In this paper, we argue that the advent of biofuels offers a new opportunity for agriculture to contribute to society, and to do so in a way that reduces trade rivalry and improves energy security. Holding current agricultural production constant, we find that the EU has the potential to reduce oil imports between 6% and 28% by converting eligible agricultural crops into biofuels under two differing conversion scenarios. Further, 33% of food support could be removed with no net farm revenue loss, using the biofuel premia (compared with food value) of corn and rapeseed to compensate for subsidy reductions. These results can help overcome the current impasse in global trade negotiations by reconciling the needs of EU farmers with those who would gain from more liberal international trade. © 2009.

AB  - An economic feasibility study on four batch processes for the production of biodiesel ranging from 1452 tonnes/year (5000 l/day) to 14,520 tonnes/year (50,000 l/day) is conducted. The four processes assessed are the (1) KOH-W process, characterized by a homogeneous KOH catalyst and hot water purification process; (2) KOH-D process, characterized by a homogeneous KOH catalyst and vacuum FAME distillation process; (3) CaO-W process, characterized by a heterogeneous CaO catalyst and hot water purification process; and (4) CaO-D process, characterized by a heterogeneous CaO catalyst and vacuum FAME distillation process. The costs of the waste cooking oil, fixed costs, and manufacturing costs for producing 7260 tonnes/year (25,000 l/day) of biodiesel by means of the four processes are estimated to be $248-256, $194-232, and $584-641 per tonne of biodiesel, respectively. Among the four processes, the manufacturing costs involved in the CaO-W process are the lowest, in the range from 1452 tonnes/year to 14,520 tonnes/year. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative fuel consisting of alkyl esters of fatty acids from vegetable oils or animal fats. The properties of biodiesel depend on the type of vegetable oil used for the transesterification process. The objective of the present work is to theoretically predict the iodine value and the saponification value of different biodiesels from their fatty acid methyl ester composition. The fatty acid ester compositions and the above values of different biodiesels were taken from the available published data. A multiple linear regression model was developed to predict the iodine value and saponification value of different biodiesels. The predicted results showed that the prediction errors were less than 3.4% compared to the available published data. The predicted values were also verified by substituting in the available published model which was developed to predict the higher heating values of biodiesel fuels from their iodine value and the saponification value. The resulting heating values of biodiesels were then compared with the published heating values and reported. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An integrated, clean, facile and ecologically friendly approach of biodiesel production from Eruca Sativa Gars (ESG) vegetable oil focused on lab scaling up was reported in this study. Transesterification of ESG oil was heterogeneously catalyzed by Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 heteropolyacid salt. The properties of biodiesel from ESG were comparable to conventional diesel fuel and comply with the US Standard for Biodiesel (ASTM 6751). Using ESG biodiesel instead of conventional diesel fuel reduces emissions. The results illustrate that the Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 is an environmentally benign solid acid catalyst and ESG biodiesel is a kind of nontoxic and biodegradable renewable alternative fuel. © 2008.

AB  - Background: As a potential source of biomass, Jerusalem artichoke has been studied for bioethanol production; however, thus far it has not been investigated for the production of other liquid biofuels, such as biodiesel. This work aims to develop a novel approach for biodiesel production from Jerusalemartichoke tuber using heterotrophic microalgae. Results: In this study, Chlorella protothecoides utilized hydrolysate of Jerusalem artichoke tuber as carbon source and accumulated lipid in vivo, with lipid content as high as 44% by drymass, and a carbon source to lipid conversion ratio of about 25% in a 4-day scale cultivation. The lipidswere extracted and then converted into biodiesel by transesterification. Cetane acid methyl ester, linoleic acidmethyl ester and oleic acid methyl ester were the dominating components of the biodiesel produced. Unsaturated fatty acidsmethyl ester constituted over 82% of the total biodiesel content. Conclusion: This work suggests the feasibility of an alternative method of producing biodiesel from Jerusalem artichoke tuber using microalgae cultivation, and a cost reduction of carbon source feed in algal oil production can be expected. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - The conversion of methyl octanoate on an H-ZSM5 zeolite catalyst has been investigated as a model reaction for the production of hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals from biodiesel. The reactivity of methyl octanoate on H-ZSM5 is higher than that observed with a linear alkane of the same chain length as the ester, n-octane. The enhanced activity may be due to the strong adsorption of the ester group on the zeolite sites. The deoxygenation of methyl octanoate yielded a variety of hydrocarbons (C1-C7), with significant amounts of aromatics. Octanoic acid and heavy products, particularly 8-pentadecanone, were formed as primary products from methyl octanoate via acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and condensation, respectively. Both octanoic acid and the condensation products undergo further reaction, producing aromatics. The comparison conducted with n-octane as a feed indicates that aromatics can be formed through a series of reactions, namely cracking, oligomerization, and cyclization. A small amount of ethylbenzene and o-xylene at low conversion of methyl octanoate indicates that direct dehydrocyclization may also take place, but this path was not evident when the feed was n-octane. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Year 2008 has been a challenging one for the European refining industry, particularly because of the drastic fluctuations of world oil prices. After peaking at nearly $150/bbl in July 2008, oil prices have fallen to a current level of $60-70/bbl. Now falling margins for fuel producers, high operating costs, falling demand, and a supply glut in new capacity are major problems. According to Mike Wilcox, head of global downstream oil consulting at Wood Mackenzie Ltd, the recession coincided with a surge of capacity on the market. So, with demand falling, it is believed that will be a global mismatch of around 7 million bpd of demand and refining capacity over the next 2-3 yr, and how the market will react will vary by region. In light of the global recession and the tightening of credit availability, a string of upgrades and conversion projects were postponed or canceled. Italy's Eni SPA would seek buyers for its 84,000 bpd Livorno refinery on the Tuscan coast of northern Italy because of diminishing global oil demand, increasing energy efficiency, and the growth of biofuels. Petroplus Holdings AG would like to dispose of its 117,000 bpd Teesside, UK, refinery, or perhaps convert it by yearend into an import terminal, which it may then sell. In addition, Shell wants to divest its 93,000 bpd Hamburg and 83,000 bpd Heide refineries in Germany as part of its portfolio management.

AB  - Brazil remains committed to developing biofuels despite the discovery of giant oil reserves in the presalt area of the Santos basin in 2008, according Dilma Rousseff, the country's presidential chief-of-staff. Rousseff believes that Brazil will continue being the leader in ethanol production and technology development. He denied that sugarcane crops would take land from food's rural farmers, adding that technology has allowed Brazilian rural farmers to harvest more sugarcane in the same area. Rousseff also highlighted the government's use of ethanol as a substitute for diesel oil to generate electricity in isolated communities in the Amazon region.

AB  - The methyl ester of vegetable oils, known as biodiesel are becoming increasingly popular because of their low environmental impact and potential as a green alternative fuel for diesel engine. In this study, different kinds of methyl ester of vegetable oil are derived by transesterification process. Experimental investigations have been carried out to examine properties, performance, combustion and emission characteristics of five different methyl ester of biofuels namely thevetia peruviana seed oil, jatropha oil, pungamia oil, mahua oil and neem oil at blend ratio of 20/80, in a standard, fully instrumented, four stroke, direct injection, Kirloskar 'TV1' diesel engine. The series of tests are conducted using each of the above fuel blends, with the engine working at a speed of 1500 rpm. The performance, combustion and emission parameters like, brake thermal efficiency, bsfc, volumetric efficiency, air-fuel ratio, P-θ curves, instantaneous heat release, cumulative heat release, exhaust gas temperatures, CO, HC, NOx, CO2, and smoke are measured and analyzed. It is observed that methyl ester of thevetia peruviana seed oil has comparable engine performance with less emission compared to other blends. Hence, it is suggested that 20% of methyl ester of thevetia peruviana seed oil blended with diesel can be substituted as an alternate fuel for the diesel engine without any engine modification.

AB  - Biofuel development and eventual production will play a major role in the US quest for energy independence amid environmental concerns. As the technology and the demands change, exactly what sources and processes will end up as the best solution is open to many alternatives, some now only on the fringe of development. The advantages and disadvantages of the current generation of biofuels, e.g., bioethanol, for the transportation industry are presented. Major advantages range from domestic production and keeping the cash in the US, continuous production without worry of depleting a believed fixed resource, and improvement in the environment. Even though the biofuels release CO2 on combustion, it is considered that no new CO2 is being released because the raw materials for the fuel come from crops. The disadvantages include the use of ethanol as a gasoline additive because corn, a major food source, is the feedstock for the fuel. Many believe the demand for ethanol for fuel has increased food costs because of higher corn prices while hurting ethanol's cause as a fuel additive. At the same time, tight credit markets have hurt plant and production expansion. Besides the economic problems with ethanol, it has also many technical problems, e.g., how much can be used in engines before hurting the machine; transportation, now limited to truck or railcar; efficiency as a motor fuel, and does it really help the environment. Thus, ethanol as a renewable fuel is marginal or even negative. The biofuels used to replace diesel or as an additive are much more practical and efficient but the problem is supply. For these reasons, a new generation of biofuels is in constant research and production.

AB  - The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed a document seeking public comments for the National Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) program for 2010. The document has 241 pages, including more than 500 requests for special comments, and recognizes specific volume standards for conventional biofuel, advanced biofuel, biomass based diesel, and cellulosic biofuel. The regulatory requirements for RFS will be applicable to domestic and foreign producers and importers of renewable fuel. Various industrial sectors would like to offer comments and documentation in a coordinated way but those failing to do so cannot expect equal regulatory field. The main features of the proposed EPA plan consists of definitions of the four renewable fuels, new definitions of Renewable Identification Numbers (RIN), modeled compliance to GHG, and a forecast of fuel volumes for 2010. The EPA expects all major commercial technologies to meet the standards except advanced biofuel and vegetable-oil-based biodiesel.

AB  - Pongamia pinnata, commercially important tree species used to produce biofuels, is known for its multipurpose benefits and its role in agro-forestry. Present study examines the amenability of vegetative propagation and effect of maturation in candidate plus tree P. pinnata through rooting of stem cuttings treated with varying concentrations and combinations of auxins. The performance of the cuttings was evaluated using SAS GLM software and the data were analyzed as a one-way classified data with and without sub sampling for inferring auxin concentration that can be included in programmes aimed at genetic improvement of the tree species. All auxin treatments promoted sprouting and at lower concentrations triggered/enhanced rooting of cuttings. The effectiveness was in the order of IBA > NAA > IAA when applied singly. IBA at 4.92 mM was found to be most effective where rooting percentage and number of roots were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than in control. However higher concentrations of auxins above 7 mM in general inhibited the rooting of cuttings. The interaction among auxins was found to be effective in root induction and differentiation and the most stimulating effects were observed in three-component mixture. The effect of other cutting characteristics such as juvenility and cutting position on rooting is also discussed. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Energy crises, global warming, and climatic changes call for technological and commercial advances in manufacturing high-quality transportation fuels from unconventional feedstocks. Microalgae is one of the most promising sources of biofuels due to the high yields attained per unit area and because it does not displace food crops. Neochloris oleabundans (Neo) microalga is an important promising microbial source of single-cell oil (SCO). Different experimental growth and lipid production conditions were evaluated and compared by using optical density (540 nm), dry-weight determination, and flow cytometry (FC). Best Neo average biomass productivity was obtained at 30°C under conditions of nitrogen-sufficiency and CO2 supplementation (N+/30°C/CO 2), with an average doubling time of 1.4 days. The second and third highest productivities occurred with N-sufficient cultures without CO 2 supplementation at 26°C (N+/26°C) and at 30°C (N+/30°C), with doubling times of 1.7 and 2.2 days, respectively. Microbial lipid production was monitored by flow cytometry using Nile red (NR), a lipophilic fluorochrome that possesses several advantageous characteristics for in situ screening near real time (at line). Results showed maximum lipid content (56%) after 6 days of nitrogen depletion under nitrogen starvation without CO2 supplementation (N-/30°C), followed by N-/30°C/CO 2 and N-/26°C conditions with 52% lipid content, after 5 and 6 days of N starvation, respectively. The adequate fatty acid profile and iodine value of Neo lipids reinforced this microalga as a good source of SCO, in particular for use as biodiesel. © 2009 Society for Industrial Microbiology.

AB  - The catalytic activity of Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts modified with noble metals (Pt, Ir, Pd and Ru) was investigated for the steam reform of ethanol and glycerol. The catalysts were characterized by the following techniques: Energy-dispersive X-ray, BET, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). The results showed that the formation of inactive nickel aluminate was prevented by the presence of CeO2 dispersed on alumina. The promoting effect of noble metals included a decrease in the reduction temperatures of NiO species interacting with the support, due to the hydrogen spillover effect. It was seen that the addition of noble metal stabilized the Ni sites in the reduced state along the reforming reaction, increasing the ethanol and glycerol conversions and decreasing the coke formation. The higher catalytic performance for the ethanol steam reforming at 600 °C and glycerol steam reforming was obtained for the NiPd and NiPt catalysts, respectively, which presented an effluent gaseous mixture with the highest H2 yield with reasonably low amounts of CO. © 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

AB  - A variety of forces aligned at the turn of the last century to make ethyl alcohol " what is today known as ethanol " inefficient and uneconomical as a fuel alternative. Rather than a case of inevitable technological unfolding, the transition from King Coal to Big Oil was a sociologically contingent event. As a controversy study, this paper seeks to avoid the reductionist tendencies of past historical analyses of fuel. The author also seeks to redress a fundamental gap within the STS literature on the subject of automobile/fuel socio-technical systems, where the story of ethyl alcohol remains conspicuously absent. Among studies that examine how/why the automobile became locked in, little is said about ethyl alcohol, even though, as this paper details, it remained part of the fuel landscape well into the 20th century. The paper begins with an overview of the landscape developments of fuel during the later decades of the 19th century. Attention then turns to examining the various factors that went into shaping the automobile/fuel socio-technical system within the US during the first half of the 20th century. © SSS and SAGE Publications.

AB  - The use of biodiesel is under evaluation as a possible fuel alternative to fossil fuels. Despite the literature available concerning the effect of biodiesel on engine performance and emissions under steady operation, there are not many research studies which cope with the effect of biodiesel during transient operation. Moreover, it is interesting to study the repercussions that the use of biodiesel has on complete vehicle performance and emissions. In this sense, the part 1 of the present paper deals with a preliminary analysis where the test facilities and procedures are explained, and the effects of the physicochemical properties of biodiesel on fuel injection are studied. To cope with the repercussion of the use of biodiesel in engine emissions during the MVEG-A cycle in this part of the paper a deep analysis of the pollutant emissions obtained during tests is done. Based on this analysis the paper also presents an approach to improve the engine control calibration to take advantage of utilising biodiesel. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present work consists of introducing the tests and facilities used to perform a comparative analysis of a diesel engine working with different blends of biodiesel fuel during the New European Driving Cycle. Furthermore, as a preliminary study, it was interesting to know the effects of biodiesel fuel on a common-rail high pressure injection system, those more useful in modern light duty diesel engines, as a consequence of its different physicochemical properties compared with conventional diesel fuel. As the real goal of the study is to compare fairly performance and emissions from the engine, it was essential to know any injection effects owed to fuel's own characteristics that finally would affect those parameters that will be evaluated. A complete fuel characterization for diesel and biodiesel fuels, as the EN 590 and the EN 14214 standard specifications, was performed in order to quantify the differences between both fuels. A priori, it could be thought that viscosity and density values will be the most significant parameters capable of altering the injection rate. As positive results, it was obtained that the common-rail high pressure injection system was totally blind in the injection rate measurements, even the significant differences between both fuels, taking into account the counterbalancing effects generated by two parameters mentioned before. The second part of the study deals with engine performance and pollutant emissions on an unmodified common-rail turbocharged diesel engine running with biodiesel fuel blends during the New European Driving Cycle. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) the fossil energy benefits and avoided global warming emissions have been evaluated for the EU Biofuels goals in Spain. The Biofuels considered are cereal ethanol, biodiesel from residual oils, and from palm, sunflower, soybeans and rapeseed vegetable oils. Our findings are that the source of the cereal and vegetable oil influences the efficacy of the Biofuels and that results greatly depend on whether or not electricity has been produced as co-product in bioethanol plants and that without CHP the energy balance of ethanol is negative with few greenhouse gas offsets. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The deoxygenation of methyl octanoate and methyl stearate over alumina-supported Pt was studied in both the vapor phase in a flow reactor and in the liquid phase in a semibatch reactor. The conversion of both methyl esters resulted in hydrocarbons with one carbon less than the fatty acid of the corresponding ester as the dominant products. In the vapor phase, acid and other oxygenates were observed in low concentrations, but they were not detected when the reaction was conducted in the liquid phase. Under He, condensation products (from esterification and ketonization) were observed. By contrast, under H 2, mostly paraffins were obtained. These results show promise to directly produce standard diesel components from biodiesel. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Experiments were conducted on a 4-cylinder direct-injection diesel engine using ultralow sulfur diesel blended with biodiesel and ethanol to investigate the gaseous emissions of the engine under five engine loads at the maximum torque engine speed of 1800 rev min-1. Four biodiesel blended fuels and four ethanol blended fuels with oxygen concentrations of 2%, 4%, 6% and 8% were used. With the increase of oxygen content in the blended fuels, the brake thermal efficiency improves slightly. For the diesel-biodiesel fuels, the brake specific HC and CO emissions decrease while the brake specific NOx and NO2 emissions increase. The emissions of formaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, toluene, xylene and overall BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene) in general decrease, however, acetaldehyde and benzene emissions increase. For the diesel-ethanol fuels, the brake specific HC and CO emissions increase significantly at low engine load, NOx emission decreases at low engine load but increases at high engine load. The emissions of benzene and BTX vary with engine load and ethanol content. Similar to the biodiesel-diesel fuels, the formaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, toluene and xylene emissions decrease while the acetaldehyde and NO2 emissions increase. Despite having the same oxygen contents in the blended fuels, there are significant differences in the gaseous emissions between the biodiesel-diesel blends and the ethanol-diesel blends. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas has gained popularity as a potential biofuel crop but the major constraint for improvement of the crop for yield and seed quality traits is the narrow genetic base of the germplasm. Genetic background of 72 J. curcas accessions representing 13 countries has been elucidated using molecular analysis and biochemical traits. Seed kernel protein, oil content, ash content and phorbol esters revealed variation with accessions from Mexico containing low levels of phorbol esters. Molecular characterization disclosed polymorphism of 61.8 and 35.5% with RAPD and ISSR primers, respectively and Mantel test revealed positive correlation between the two marker systems. Dendrogram based on pairwise genetic similarities and three-dimensional principal coordinate analysis using data from RAPD and ISSR marker systems showed close clustering of accessions from all countries and grouped the Mexican accessions separately in clusters III, IV, V and VI. Presence of the toxic phorbol esters is a major concern and analysis of 28 Mexican accessions resulted in identification of molecular markers associated with high and low phorbol ester content. The identified RAPD and ISSR markers were converted to SCARs for increasing the reliability and use in marker assisted programmes aimed at development of accessions with reduced toxicity. Twelve microsatellite primers differentiated the non-toxic Mexican accessions and disclosed novel alleles in Mexican germplasm. Amplification with primers specific to the curcin coding sequence and promoter region of ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) revealed polymorphism with one primer specific to RIP promoter region specifically in accessions with low phorbol ester levels. Narrow genetic variation among accessions from different regions of the world and rich diversity among Mexican genotypes in terms of phorbol ester content and distinct molecular profiles indicates the need for exploitation of germplasm from Mexico in J. curcas breeding programmes. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Synthesis of surrogate molecules is particularly useful for generating in sight of structural-activity relationships, understanding processes and improving the performance. In order to improve upon the physico-chemical properties of biodiesel, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl and n-butyl esters of β-branched fatty acid have been synthesized, initiating from β-branched alcohols. β-Branched alcohols upon oxidation gave corresponding acids, which were converted to their esters. The synthesized esters have substantially better oxidative stability, exhibited by Rancimat oxidation induction period of more than 24 h. The cloud point of synthesized esters is <-36 °C, pour point is <-42 °C and CFPP is <-21 °C, which is substantially better than fatty acid methyl esters. Besides achieving the objective of better oxidative stability and improved low temperature properties, the synthesized surrogate esters have viscosity in the range of 4.2-4.6 cSt at 40 °C, meeting the international diesel and biodiesel standards. The cetane number of synthesized esters is 62-69, which is much better than diesel and biodiesel. The blends of the synthesized esters in diesel at 5% and 10% meet Indian standards of diesel. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hydrocracking of vacuum gas oil (VGO) - vegetable oil mixtures is a prominent process for the production of biofuels. In this work both pre-hydrotreated and non-hydrotreated VGO are assessed whether they are suitable fossil components in a VGO-vegetable oil mixture as feed-stocks to a hydrocracking process. This assessment indicates the necessity of a VGO pre-hydrotreated step prior to hydrocracking the VGO-vegetable oil mixture. Moreover, the comparison of two different mixing ratios suggests that higher vegetable oil content favors hydrocracking product yields and qualities. Three commercial catalysts of different activity are utilized in order to identify a range of products that can be produced via a hydrocracking route. Finally, the effect of temperature on hydrocracking VGO-vegetable oil mixtures is studied in terms of conversion and selectivity to diesel, jet/kerosene and naphtha. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Waste eggshell was investigated in triglyceride transesterification with a view to determine its viability as a solid catalyst for use in biodiesel synthesis. Effect of calcination temperature on structure and activity of eggshell catalysts was investigated. Reusability of eggshell catalysts was also examined. It was found that high active, reusable solid catalyst was obtained by just calcining eggshell. Utilization of eggshell as a catalyst for biodiesel production not only provides a cost-effective and environmental friendly way of recycling this solid eggshell waste, significantly reducing its environmental effects, but also reduces the price of biodiesel to make biodiesel competitive with petroleum diesel. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A diesel-like fuel, pyrodiesel (PD), was synthesized by a pyrolysis method using soybean oil as starting material. Some physical properties of the material were studied, both neat and in blends with high-sulfur (HSD) and low-sulfur (LSD) diesel fuels, and compared with blends of biodiesel (BD) in fossil fuels. It was observed using different methods that the lubricity of biobased fuels obtained after the transesterification or pyrolysis of soybean oil is superior to LSD and HSD and also that the lubricity of diesel fuels are enhanced when either BD or PD are added. Based on the results reported herein, PD is a viable alternative to BD for use in compression-ignition engines.

AB  - Combustion characteristics of n-heptane, a surrogate for hydrocarbon diesel, methyl decanoate, a surrogate for biodiesel, and dimethyl ether, a fuel that can be derived from bio-feedstocks, are investigated with a homogeneous constant-pressure reactor model and a homogeneous-charge compression-ignition engine thermodynamic simulation model, with focus on two variables: ignition delay and NO formation, under conditions of varying oxygen concentration. Negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior is observed for the three fuels. Reducing oxygen concentration increases ignition delay for all fuels. The results and conclusions with the two models differ because it is necessary to vary initial conditions in the engine model to optimize combustion phasing and maximize indicated efficiency. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The need to decrease the consumption of materials and energy and to promote the use of renewable resources, such as biofuels, stress the importance of evaluating the performance of engines based on the second law of thermodynamics. This paper suggests the use of exergy analysis (as an environmental assessment tool to account wastes and determine the exergy efficiency) combined with gas emissions analysis to optimize the performance of a compression ignition (CI) engine using biofuels such as cottonseed and palm oils, pure or blended with diesel for different engine loads. The results show that the combination of exergy and gas emissions analyses is a very effective tool for evaluating the optimal loads that can be supplied by CI engines. Taking into account technical constraints of engines, a tradeoff zone of engine loads (60% and 70% of the maximum load) was established between the gas emissions (NO and CO2) and the exergy efficiency for optimal performance of the CI engine. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, the cylinder head, exhaust, and inlet valves of a diesel engine were coated with the ceramic material MgO-ZrO2 by the plasma spray method, while the piston surface was coated with ZrO2. Thus, a thermal barrier was provided for the elements of the combustion chamber with these coatings. Using identical coated and uncoated engines, the effects of canola methyl ester produced by the transesterification method, and ASTM No. 2D fuel on engine performance and exhaust emissions were studied. Tests were performed on the uncoated engine, and then repeated on the coated engine and the results were compared. An increase in engine power and decrease in specific fuel consumption, as well as significant improvements in exhaust gas emissions and smoke density, were observed for all test fuels used in the coated engine compared with that of the uncoated engine. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper investigates the scope of utilizing biodiesel developed from both through the methyl as well as ethyl alcohol route (methyl and ethyl ester) from Karanja oil as an alternative diesel fuel. The major problem of using neat Karanja oil as a fuel in a compression ignition engine arises due to its very high viscosity. Transesterification with alcohols reduces the viscosity of the oil and other properties have been evaluated to be comparable with those of diesel. In the present work, methyl and ethyl esters of Karanja oil were prepared by transesterification using both methanol and ethanol. The physical and chemical properties of ethyl esters were comparable with that of methyl esters. However, viscosity of ethyl esters was slightly higher than that of methyl esters. Cold flow properties of ethyl esters were better than those of methyl esters. Performance and exhaust emission characteristics of the engine were determined using petrodiesel as the baseline fuel and several blends of diesel and biodiesel as test fuels. Results show that methyl esters produced slightly higher power than ethyl esters. Exhaust emissions of both esters were almost identical. These studies show that both methyl and ethyl esters of Karanja oil can be used as a fuel in compression ignition engine without any engine modification. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Under the Clean Air Act, as amended by Sections 201, 202, and 210 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, EPA is required to promulgate regulations implementing changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard program. The revised statutory requirements specify the volumes of cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel that must be used in transportation fuel each year, with the volumes increasing over time. The revised statutory requirements also include new definitions and criteria for both renewable fuels and the feedstocks used to produce them, including new greenhouse gas emission thresholds for renewable fuels. For the first time in a regulatory program, an assessment of greenhouse gas emission performance is being utilized to establish those fuels that qualify for the four different renewable fuel standards. The greenhouse gas emission assessments must evaluate the full lifecycle emission impacts of fuel production including both direct and indirect emissions, including significant emissions from land use changes. The proposed program is expected to reduce US dependence on foreign sources of petroleum by increasing domestic sources of energy. The expanded use of renewable fuels would provide significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions such as CO2 that affect climate change. The increased use of renewable fuels would also impact criteria pollutant emissions, with some pollutants, e.g., VOC, and NOx, expected to increase and other pollutants, e.g., CO and benzene, expected to decrease. The production of feedstocks used to produce renewable fuels is also expected to impact water quality. Comments must be received on or before 7/27/2009, 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.

AB  - Fuels derived from the lipid fraction of biomass have recently received much attention for carbon neutral substitution of fossil fuels for transport use. In this article we review the current routes to catalytic upgrading of the biomass derived lipid fractions. The history and motivation for biofuels are discussed, including the link to current market trends amongst fuel prices. The sources of lipids and their chemical composition are considered. We review the current literature detailing the use of trans-esterification reactions (heterogeneous and homogeneous) which lead to oxygenated "Biodiesel", and also decarboxylation, which leads to deoxygenated "Green Diesel". Traditional methods are covered, as well as more recent novel research aiming to produce commercially viable fuels. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2009.

AB  - Though a considerable number of publications about biodiesel can be found in literature, several problems remain unsolved, encompassing economical, social, and technical issues. Thus, the biodiesel industry has come under attack by some environmental associations, and subsidies for biofuel production have been condemned by some governments. Yet, biodiesel may represent a truly competitive alternative to diesel fuel, for which fuel tax exemption and subsidies to energetic crops are needed. Biodiesel must increase its popularity among social movements and governments to constitute a valid alternative of energy source. In this sense, the use of nonedible oils to produce biodiesel is proposed in the present review. Moreover, the compromise of noninterference between land for energetic and food purposes must be addressed. Concerning technical issues, it is important to consider a transesterification optimization, which is missing or incomplete for too many vegetable oils already tested. In most cases, a common recipe to produce biodiesel from any raw material has been adopted, which may not represent the best approach. Such strategy may fit multifeedstock biodiesel plant needs but cannot be accepted for oils converted individually into biodiesel, because biodiesel yield will most likely fail, increasing costs. Transesterification optimization results depend on the chemical composition of vegetable oils and fats. Considering "sustainable" vegetable oils, biodiesel from Calophyllum inophyllum, Azadirachta indica, Terminalia catappa, Madhuca indica, Pongamia pinnata, and Jatropha curcas oils fits both current biodiesel standards: European EN 14214 and US ASTM D 6751 02. However, none of them can be considered to be the "ideal" alternative that matches all the main important fuel properties that ensure the best diesel engine behavior. In search of the ideal biodiesel composition, high presence of monounsaturated fatty acids (as oleic and palmitoleic acids), reduced presence of polyunsaturated acids, and controlled saturated acids content are recommended. In this sense, C18:l and C16:l are the best-fitting acids in terms of oxidative stability and cold weather behavior, among many other properties. Furthermore, genetic engineering is an invaluable tool to design oils presenting the most suitable fatty acid profile to provide high quality biodiesel. Finally, most published research related to engine performance and emissions fails in using a standard methodology, which should be implemented to allow the comparison between tests and biofuels from different origin. In conclusion, a compromise between social, economical, and technical agents must be reached. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

AB  - According to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, the use of ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) has been mandated for all on-highway transportation diesels since 2006. To comply with the EPA regulations, biodiesel must meet the same ULSD standard for total sulfur which is set at a maximum of 15 ppm. Generally, biodiesel contains lower sulfur than fossil diesel. However, due to the diversity of biodiesel feedstocks, questions have been raised about their sulfur content and the sulfur content of the biodiesel made from them. The objective of this research was to gain basic knowledge about how the sulfur content in biodiesel is affected by the sulfur content of different feedstocks. Sulfur in oilseeds, seed meals, oils and fats, and biodiesel were investigated according to ASTM D5453. Samples of different feedstocks for biodiesel production were investigated. Results showed that sulfur content varies greatly from one source to another. The highest sulfur in seeds and meals was found in rapeseed and mustard, at the level of 9,000 and 15,000 ppm, respectively. Oils from mechanical expeller presses contained very low levels of sulfur, although some were still higher than 15 ppm. Animal fats and waste vegetable oils contained relatively higher sulfur levels and were frequently above 15 ppm. It was observed that sulfur was significantly reduced when the oils and fats were processed into biodiesel. Results showed that most of the biodiesel samples investigated in this study contained less than 15-ppm sulfur. Feedstocks which contain a high percentage of free fatty acids (FFA) must be treated with sulfuric acid to reduce the FFA level before transesterification. In these cases, care is needed during phase separation to exclude sulfur from the fuel layer. © 2009 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Fourteen mature technology biomass refining scenarios - involving both biological and thermochemical processing with production of fuels, power, and/or animal feed protein - are compared with respect to process efficiency, environmental impact - including petroleum use, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and water use-and economic profitability. The emissions analysis does not account for carbon sinks (e.g., soil carbon sequestration) or sources (e.g., forest conversion) resulting from land-use considerations. Sensitivity of the scenarios to fuel and electricity price, feedstock cost, and capital structure is also evaluated. The thermochemical scenario producing only power achieves a process efficiency of 49% (energy out as power as a percentage of feedstock energy in), 1359 kg CO2 equivalent avoided GHG emissions per Mg feedstock (current power mix basis) and a cost of $0.0575/kWh ($16/GJ), at a scale of 4535 dry Mg feedstock /day, 12% internal rate of return, 35% debt fraction, and 7% loan rate. Thermochemical scenarios producing fuels and power realize efficiencies between 55 and 64%, avoided GHG emissions between 1000 and 1179 kg/dry Mg, and costs between $0.36 and $0.57 per liter gasoline equivalent ($1.37 - $2.16 per gallon) at the same scale and financial structure. Scenarios involving biological production of ethanol with thermochemical production of fuels and/or power result in efficiencies ranging from 61 to 80%, avoided GHG emissions from 965 to 1,258 kg/dry Mg, and costs from $0.25 to $0.33 per liter gasoline equivalent ($0.96 to $1.24/gallon). Most of the biofuel scenarios offer comparable, if not lower, costs and much reduced GHG emissions (&gt;90%) compared to petroleum-derived fuels. Scenarios producing biofuels result in GHG displacements that are comparable to those dedicated to power production (e.g., &amp;gt;825 kg CO2 equivalent/dry Mg biomass), especially when a future power mix less dependent upon fossil fuel is assumed. Scenarios integrating biological and thermochemical processing enable waste heat from the thermochemical process to power the biological process, resulting in higher overall process efficiencies than would otherwise be realized - efficiencies on par with petroleum-based fuels in several cases. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The Role of Biomass in America's Energy Future (RBAEF) project, initiated during the first half of 2003, has sought to identify and evaluate paths by which biomass can make a large contribution to energy services and determine means to accelerate biomass energy use. In addressing these issues, the study has focused on future, mature, technologies rather than today's technology. This perspective - the first of eight papers that comprise this issue - introduces the project, providing an operative definition of and method for estimating mature technology, a rationale for choosing the model feedstock, a list of the conversion technologies considered, and as a point of reference, a brief overview of the energy flows through a typical petroleum refinery.

AB  - Recent increases in fuel costs, concerns for global warming, and limited supplies of fossil fuels have prompted wide spread research on renewable liquid biofuels produced domestically from agricultural feedstock. In this study, two types of biodiesels and vegetable oil (VO) are investigated as potential fuels for gas turbines to generate power. Biodiesels produced from VO and animal fat were considered in this study. The problems of high viscosity and poor volatility of VO (soybean oil) were addressed by using diesel-VO blends with up to 30% VO by volume. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, thermogravimetric analysis, and density, kinematic viscosity, surface tension, and water content measurements were used to characterize the fuel properties. The combustion performance of different fuels was compared experimentally in an atmospheric pressure burner with an air-assist injector and swirling primary air around it. For different fuels, the effect of the atomizing airflow rate on Sauter mean diameter was determined from a correlation for air-assist atomizers. Profiles of nitric oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions were obtained for different atomizing airflow rates, while the total airflow rate was kept constant. The results show that despite the compositional differences, the physical properties and emissions of the two biodiesel fuels are similar. Diesel-VO fuel blends resulted in slightly higher CO emissions compared with diesel, while the NOx emissions correlated well with the flame temperature. The results show that the CO and NOx emissions are determined mainly by fuel atomization and fuel/air mixing processes, and that the fuel composition effects are of secondary importance for fuels and operating conditions of the present study. © 2009 by ASME.

AB  - Experimental investigation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by a turbocharged direct injection compression ignition (DI-CI) engine, alternatively fuelled with biodiesel and its 20% blend with diesel, revealed dominancy of diesel and biodiesel in aromatic hydrocarbons, esters other oxides, respectively, in total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs). The overall brake specific emission of VOCs increased at rated speed compared to maximum torque speed. The VOCs exhibited their maxima at low load, and minima at medium load for diesel and B100. Engines with a speed of 2300 r/min and 100% load showed a reduction in BTX emissions from B20 and B100, as compared to diesel. The sum of VOC-components of B20 and B100 reduced as compared to that of the diesel, for all the engine conditions. The mean BSE of BTX-components taken from all the engine conditions decreased with B20 and B100, relative to fossil diesel.

AB  - The Congress has modified the transportation bill, which includes various tax credits to the transportation industry for mixing alternative energy sources with carbon-based taxable fuels like diesel and gasoline. The bill is aimed to encourage the use of ethanol and other biofuels to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels. The modification now covers non-transportation industries including the pulp and paper segment. It now states that a 50-cent-per-gallon credit is to be offered to those who blend 'renewable' fuel with conventional petroleum-based fuels. The US pulp producers now need to mix at least 0.1% of diesel fuel with black liquor to avail the federal tax benefits. International Paper has claimed refund of $558 million for the period of November 14, 2008, to March 31, 2009, based on actual production and received $145 million as refund.

AB  - Despite the fact that polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) can fairly easily be converted into a compound that looks a lot like biodiesel, no one had tested its biofuel capabilities before. This conversion process involves heating the PHA with sulfuric acid and methanol, which breaks the polymer up into its various component monomers, including 3- hydroxybutyrate and 3-hydroxyvalerate, and then transforms them into methyl esters (3HAME). To test the capabilities of 3HAME as a biofuel, a team led by Guo-Qiang Chen at Tsinghua University, Beijing, investigated the amount of energy they release as heat during combustion. At 30 KJ/g, their heat of combustion is less than diesel (50 KJ/g) and gasoline (52 KJ/g) but more than ethanol. Adding 3HAME to ethanol also increased its heat of combustion by ≤ 30%. The results suggest that although 3HAME could well form an effective fuel additive, either on their own or mixed with ethanol.

AB  - Some significant factors associated with the growth of the European refining industry and about its future are discussed. During 2004 to 2008, the refining industry experienced a higher margins, which allowed operations to earn an acceptable returns on capital. Demand for gasoline and heavy fuel oil declined between 2-3% annually, but demand for kerosene and diesel increased significantly. The EU also emphasized on 10% mandate of biofuels to be used in transportation fuels by 2020. The Renewable Energy Directive was introduced as an obligation on renewable fuel suppliers to reduce the GHG emissions including the production, transportation, and use. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) was developed to implement EU's obligation under the Kyoto protocol to reduce emissions. The combined impacts of the current demand downturn and new capacity affected the refinery utilization.

AB  - This study investigated the emissions of carbonyl compounds (CBCs) and regulated harmful matters (traditional pollutants) from an HDDE (heavy-duty diesel engine) at one low load steady-state condition, 24.5% of the max load (40 km h-1), using five test fuels: premium diesel fuel (D100), P100 (100% palm-biodiesel), P20 (20% palm-biodiesel + 80% premium diesel fuel), PF80P20 (80% paraffinic fuel + 20% palm-biodiesel), and PF95P05 (95% paraffinic fuel + 5% palm-biodiesel). Experimental results indicate that formaldehyde was the major carbonyl in the exhaust, accounting for 70.3-75.4% of total CBC concentrations for all test fuels. Using P100 and P20 instead of D100 in the HDDE increased CBC concentrations by 9.74% and 2.89%, respectively. However, using PF80P20 and PF95P05 as alternative fuels significantly reduced CBC concentrations by 30.3% and 24.2%, respectively. Using PF95P05 instead of D100 decreased CBCs by 30.3%, PM by 11.1%, THC by 39.0%, CO by 34.0%, NOx by 24.3%, and CO2 by 7.60%. The wide usage of paraffinic-palmbiodiesel blends as alternative fuels could protect the environment. However, it should be noted that only one engine operated at one low load steady-state condition was investigated. Crown Copyright © 2009.

AB  - With an outlook for higher global energy prices and concomitant increase of agricultural resources for the pursuit of fuel, consumers are expected to seek more fuel-economic transportation alternatives. This paper examines factors that influence the importance consumers place on fuel economy, with attention given to differences between American and European consumers. In a survey conducted simultaneously in the United States (U.S.) and Belgium in the fall of 2006, respondents in both countries ranked fuel economy high among characteristics considered when purchasing a new vehicle. Overall, respondents in the U.S. placed greater emphasis on fuel economy as a new-vehicle characteristic. Respondents' budgetary concerns carried a large weight when purchasing a new vehicle as reflected in their consideration of a fuel's relative price (e.g. gasoline vs. diesel vs. biofuel) and associated car repair and maintenance costs. On the other hand, high-income Americans displayed a lack of concern over fuel economy. Concern over the environment also played a role since consumers who felt empowered to affect the environment with their purchasing decisions (buying low and clean emission technology and fuels) placed greater importance on fuel economy. No statistically significant effects on fuel economy rankings were found related to vehicle performance, socio-demographic parameters of age, gender or education. Importantly, the tradeoff between using agricultural inputs for energy rather than for food, feed and fiber had no impact on concerns over fuel economy. Finally, contrary to expectations, U.S. respondents who valued domestically produced renewable fuels did not tend to value fuel economy.

AB  - This study consists of the development and optimisation of the potassium hydroxide-catalysed synthesis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from waste cooking oil. A factorial design of experiments and a central composite design have been used. The variables chosen were fatty acid concentration in the waste cooking oil, temperature and initial catalyst concentration by weight of waste cooking oil, while the responses were FAME purity and yield. The initial catalyst concentration is the most important factor, having a positive influence on FAME purity, but a negative one on FAME yield due to the positive influences of the yield losses (triglyceride saponification and methyl ester dissolution in glycerol). Fatty acid concentration in the waste cooking oil is the second factor of importance, having negative influences in FAME purity and yield. Temperature has an insignificant effect on FAME purity, but it has a significant negative influence on FAME yield due to the positive effect of temperature on the yield losses. Second-order models were obtained to predict the responses analysed as a function of these variables. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To explore the effect of biodiesel and sulfur content on PM2.5 emissions, engine dynamometer tests were performed on a Euro II engine to compare the PM2.5 emissions from four fuels: two petroleum diesel fuels with sulfur contents of 50 and 100 ppm respectively, and two B20 fuels in which soy methyl ester (SME) biodiesel was added to each of the above mentioned petroleum diesel fuels (v/v: 80%/20% for petroleum diesel and SME respectively). Gaseous pollutants and PM2.5 emissions were sampled with an AVL AMA4000 and Model 130 High-Flow Impactor (MSP Corp). Measurements were made of the PM2.5 mass, organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC) and the water-soluble ion distribution. The results showed that PM2.5 emissions decreased with lower sulfur content or blending with SME biodiesel, and the decrease would be more by applying both two methods together. Particles of approximately 0.13 μm contributed 48-83% of PM2.5 emissions. The impact of sulfur content on this percentage was different for low and high engine speed. The majority of PM2.5 was comprised of OC and EC, and the carbon emission rate had the same trend as PM2.5. Since the EC abatement of B20 was larger than OC, the OC/EC ratio of B20 was always larger than that of petroleum diesel. For petroleum diesel, the OC/EC increased with sulfur content, which was not the case for B20. The SO42- had highest emission rate in the water-soluble ions of PM. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present work investigates the influence of the support surface on the loading and the enzymatic activity of the immobilized Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase. Different porous materials, polypropylene (Accurel), polymethacrylate (Sepabeads EC-EP), silica (SBA-15 and surface modified SBA-15), and an organosilicate (MSE), were used as supports. The immobilized biocatalysts were compared towards sunflower oil ethanolysis for the sustainable production of biodiesel. Since the supports have very different structural (ordered hexagonal and disordered) and textural features (surface area, pore size, and total pore volume), in order to consider only the effect of the support surface, experiments were performed at low surface coverage. The different functional groups occurring on the support surface allowed either physical (Accurel, MSE, and SBA-15) or chemical adsorption (Sepabeads EC-EP and SBA-15-R-CHO). The surface-modified SBA-15 (SBA-15-R-CHO) allowed the highest loading. The lipase immobilized on the MSE was the most active biocatalyst. However, in terms of catalytic efficiency (activity/loading) the lipase immobilized on the SBA-15, the support that allowed the lowest loading, was the most efficient. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, the regulated and unregulated emissions profile and fuel consumption of an automotive diesel and biodiesel blends, prepared from two different biodiesels, were investigated. The biodiesels were a rapeseed methyl ester (RME) and a palm-based methyl ester (PME). The tests were performed on a chassis dynamometer with constant volume sampling (CVS) over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the non-legislated Athens Driving Cycle (ADC), using a Euro 2 compliant passenger vehicle. The objectives were to evaluate the impact of biodiesel chemical structure on the emissions, as well as the influence of the applied driving cycle on the formation of exhaust emissions and fuel consumption. The results showed that NOx emissions were influenced by certain biodiesel properties, such as those of cetane number and iodine number. NOx emissions followed a decreasing trend over both cycles, where the most beneficial reduction was obtained with the application of the more saturated biodiesel. PM emissions were decreased with the palm-based biodiesel blends over both cycles, with the exception of the 20% blend which was higher compared to diesel fuel. PME blends led to increases in PM emissions over the ADC. The majority of the biodiesel blends showed a tendency for lower CO and HC emissions. The differences in CO2 emissions were not statistically significant. Fuel consumption presented an increase with both biodiesels. Total PAH and nitro-PAH emission levels were decreased with the use of biodiesel independently of the source material. Lower molecular weight PAHs were predominant in both gaseous and particulate phases. Both biodiesels had a negative impact on certain carbonyl emissions. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were the dominant aldehydes emitted from both fuels. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The alkaline extractable lignins have then been isolated to investigate lignin separation efficiency and lignin structure and to evaluate their potential for producing value-added products, such as biodiesel components or chemicals, in terms of the purity, molecular size, functional groups, β-O-4′ inter-unit linkage content, and degradability in a subsequent processing treatment. The mechanism of lignin modification and possible improvements to the steam explosion pre-treatment process are discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The peanut (Arachis hypogea L.) seed oil was extracted from the seeds of the peanut that grows in SE Anatolia of Turkey. Oil was obtained in 50 wt/wt.%, by solvent extraction. Peanut (A. hypogea L.) seed oil was investigated as an alternative feedstock for the production of a biodiesel fuel. Biodiesel was prepared from peanut by transesterification of the crude oil with methanol in the presence of NaOH as catalyst. A maximum oil to ester conversion was 89%. The viscosity of biodiesel oil is nearer to that of petroleum diesel and the calorific value is about 6% less than that of diesel. Peanut seed oil have about 8.3% less heating value than that of diesel oil due to the oxygen content in their molecules. The quality of biodiesel is most important for engine part of view and various standards have been specified to check the quality. The important properties of peanut oil and its methyl ester (biodiesel) such as density, kinematic viscosity, flash point, iodine number, neutralization number, pour point, cloud point, cetane number are found out and compared to those of no. 2 petroleum diesel, ASTM and EN biodiesel standards. The comparison shows that the methyl ester has relatively closer fuel properties to diesel than that of raw peanut seed oil. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper shows the research and the scientific experience cumulated by the author in the frame of an international project done at T. U. Munchen, Germany, in which we have obtained the receipt to manufacture an alternative fuel -biodiesel - from animal fats with high FFA content (waste fats). In the past year, with the financial support of the Romanian government - CEEX programme - and RO-B.EN.A. we have succeeded to construct an experimental installation for fats and waste fats transesterification. The research was extended to a comparative study (using CALROADS software) diesel - biodiesel in two hypotheses: one when all compression engine vehicles use diesel fuel (real scenario), the other, when all compression engine vehicles use biodiesel fuel (prognosed scenario). The simulation scenarios are conducted to 5 major cross-roads in the city of Timisoara.

AB  - The predicted shortage of fossil fuels and related environmental concerns have recently attracted significant attention to scientific and technological issues concerning the conversion of biomass into fuels. First-generation biodiesel, obtained from vegetable oils and animal fats by transesterification, relies on commercial technology and rich scientific background, though continuous progress in this field offers opportunities for improvement. This Review focuses on new catalytic systems for the transesterification of oils to the corresponding ethyl/methyl esters of fatty acids. It also addresses some innovative/emerging technologies for the production of biodiesel, such as the catalytic hydrocracking of vegetable oils to hydrocarbons. The special role of the catalyst as a key to efficient technology is outlined, together with the other important factors that affect the yield and quality of the product, including feedstock-related properties and various system conditions. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Combustion behavior of various oxygenated fuels has been studied in a DAF heavy-duty (HD) directinjection (DI) diesel engine. From these fuels, it is well-known that they lead to lower particle (PM) emissions; however, for a given fuel oxygen mass fraction, there are significant differences in PM reduction. Although this can be traced back to the specific molecular structure of the oxygenate in question, no consensus can be found in the literature as to the explanation hereof. In this study, the sooting tendency (smoke number) of three oxygenates [viz., tripropylene glycol methyl ether (TP), dibutyl maleate (DB), and cyclohexanone (X1)] was compared to that of commercial diesel fuel (EN590, D). The results suggest that the cetane number (CN) (i.e., fuel reactivity) may play an important role. More specifically, the low reactive oxygenate X1, with its cyclic carbon chain, was found to perform exceptionally well compared to the more reactive linear and branched oxygenates DB and TP, respectively. Cyclic oxygenates are abundant in nature. Cellulose, the most common organic compound on earth, is the best-known example. Although it is not trivial, liquid cyclic oxygenates can be made from lignocellulosic biomass. Particularly, the production of C6 oxygenates (e.g., guaiacol, cyclohexanone, phenol, etc.), which can be derived from lignin, is the subject of current investigation. Fuels produced from such biomass (e.g., plant waste or the nonedible part of plants) are referred to as secondgeneration biofuels and are expected to play a pivotal role in the near future. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Three decades after the pioneering development of sugarcane ethanol in Brazil, the arrival of the new century has seen a worldwide boom in the automotive biofuel industry. Although fire safety of biofuels has not been perceived so far as a potential barrier to sustainability of their development, very limited scientific work can be found on the matter. This paper is a first contribution to the discussion of these issues within the fire safety community. It aims at identifying research needs from an initial overview based on existing safety data pertaining to currently available biofuels for transport. The paper comprises a first analysis of fire risk typology presented by such biofuel technologies, including first lessons from recent accidents. At first sight, when considering aspects of fire safety from a technical point of view, it seems a simple problem, but analysis shows that from the point of view of safety of biofuels, it is not correct to summarize the regulatory position by simply saying that fuel ethanol is a flammable product, whereas biodiesel is not. Clearly, a more in-depth analysis of fire safety issues is needed that will also have to consider significant changes in biofuel technologies in the future. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Continuous energy crises and increasing demand for conventional fuels has resulted in the need for biofuels on a commercial scale. Transesterification of oils to yield biodiesel - one of the principal biofuels currently produced in large-scale operations - is coupled with significant production of a glycerol-rich water (so-called "crude" or "raw" glycerol), as an important side-product of the process. The increasing demand for biodiesel leads to abundant quantities of this glycerol-rich material on the market. Therefore, glycerol valorization has much to offer in the cost reduction of biodiesel production. To this end, various chemical or biotechnological strategies have been developed to obtain added-value products using crude glycerol as substrate. This review combines an account of our attempts to achieve a biotechnological valorization of raw glycerol with a review of appropriate literature. © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Diesel soot aggregates emitted from a model dynamometer and 11 on-road vehicles were segregated by a micro-orifice uniform deposit impactor (MOUDI). The elemental contents and morphological parameters of the aggregates were then examined by scanning electron microscopy coupled with an energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS), and combined with a fractional Brownian motion (fBm) processor. Two mode-size distributions of aggregates collected from diesel vehicles were confirmed. Mean mass concentration of 339 mg/m3 (dC/dlogdp) existed in the dominant mode (180-320 nm). A relatively high proportion of these aggregates appeared in PM1, accentuating the relevance regarding adverse health effects. Furthermore, the fBm processor directly parameterized the SEM images of fractal like aggregates and successfully quantified surface texture to extract Hurst coefficients (H) of the aggregates. For aggregates from vehicles equipped with a universal cylinder number, the H value was independent of engine operational conditions. A small H value existed in emitted aggregates from vehicles with a large number of cylinders. This study found that aggregate fractal dimension related to H was in the range of 1.641-1.775, which is in agreement with values reported by previous TEM-based experiments. According to EDS analysis, carbon content ranged in a high level of 30%-50% by weight for diesel soot aggregates. The presence of Na and Mg elements in these sampled aggregates indicated the likelihood that some engine enhancers composed of biofuel or surfactants were commonly used in on-road vehicles in Taiwan. In particular, the morphological H combined with carbon content detection can be useful for characterizing chain-like or cluster diesel soot aggregates in the atmosphere. © 2009 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The growing demand for biofuels is promoting the expansion of a number of agricultural commodities, including oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). Oil-palm plantations cover over 13 million ha, primarily in Southeast Asia, where they have directly or indirectly replaced tropical rainforest. We explored the impact of the spread of oil-palm plantations on greenhouse gas emission and biodiversity. We assessed changes in carbon stocks with changing land use and compared this with the amount of fossil-fuel carbon emission avoided through its replacement by biofuel carbon. We estimated it would take between 75 and 93 years for the carbon emissions saved through use of biofuel to compensate for the carbon lost through forest conversion, depending on how the forest was cleared. If the original habitat was peatland, carbon balance would take more than 600 years. Conversely, planting oil palms on degraded grassland would lead to a net removal of carbon within 10 years. These estimates have associated uncertainty, but their magnitude and relative proportions seem credible. We carried out a meta-analysis of published faunal studies that compared forest with oil palm. We found that plantations supported species-poor communities containing few forest species. Because no published data on flora were available, we present results from our sampling of plants in oil palm and forest plots in Indonesia. Although the species richness of pteridophytes was higher in plantations, they held few forest species. Trees, lianas, epiphytic orchids, and indigenous palms were wholly absent from oil-palm plantations. The majority of individual plants and animals in oil-palm plantations belonged to a small number of generalist species of low conservation concern. As countries strive to meet obligations to reduce carbon emissions under one international agreement (Kyoto Protocol), they may not only fail to meet their obligations under another (Convention on Biological Diversity) but may actually hasten global climate change. Reducing deforestation is likely to represent a more effective climate-change mitigation strategy than converting forest for biofuel production, and it may help nations meet their international commitments to reduce biodiversity loss. © 2008 Society for Conservation Biology.

AB  - Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC) have a substantial biomass production and export potential. The objective of this study is to assess whether the market for biofuels and trade can be profitable enough to realize a supply of biofuels from the CEEC to the European market and to estimate the cost performance of the energy carriers delivered. Five NUTS-2 (Nomenclature d'Unités Territoriales Statistiques) regions with high biomass production potentials in Poland, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic were analysed for biofuel export options. From these regions pellets from willow can be provided to destination areas in Western European countries (WEC) at costs of 105.2-219.8 € t-1. Ethanol can be provided at 11.95-20.89 € per GJ if the biomass conversion is performed at the destination areas in the WEC or at 14.84-17.83 € GJ-1J if the biomass to ethanol conversion takes place (at small scale) at the CEEC region where the biomass is produced. Short sea shipping shows most cost advantages for longer distance international transport compared to inland waterway shipping and railway. Another reason for lower biofuel supply costs are shorter distances between the regions of biomass production and the destination areas. Therefore the Szczecin region in Poland, closely located to the Baltic Sea, shows a better economic performance for long distance trade of biomass production than the selected region in Hungary ('land-locked'). It is concluded that in future key CEEC regions can supply (pre-treated) biomass and biofuels to the European market at cost levels, which are sound and attractive to current and expected diesel and gasoline prices. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable fuel comprised of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) derived from vegetable oils or animal fats. Comparisons between biodiesel and petroleum-based diesel have shown biodiesel to be effective in reducing exhaust emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide. While there are advantages of biodiesel over the traditional petroleum based diesel, biodiesel commercialization is limited by production cost that is dominated by the price of the feedstock (soybean oil). Yellow grease has the potential to be an effective feedstock with lower cost, but the chemical composition of these oils is variable depending on the source of collection and differs from that of virgin oil due to the presence of free fatty acids (FFA). Esterification has been previously demonstrated to reduce the FFA levels of YG; however, large quantities of methanol were required to drive the reaction to high yield. Methanol usage for processing and FFA content are the main factors affecting the economics of FAME production from YG. In this study, the relationship between composition and process variables was systematically studied. The effect of FFA ranging from 2% to 32% (w/w) was studied at three different molar ratios of methanol to FFA (4.5:1, 9:1, 18:1) and was found to have a non-linear relationship. Data obtained from this full factorial screening was used to develop a predictive statistical model to forecast the conversion based on initial FFA level and proportion of alcohol applied for esterification. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We calculated carbon and energy balances and costs of 14 different Fischer-Tropsch (FT) fuel production plants in 17 complete well-to-wheel (WTW) chains. The FT plants can use natural gas, coal, biomass or mixtures as feedstock. Technical data, and technological and economic assumptions for developments for 2020 were derived from the literature, recalculating to 2005 euros for (capital) costs. Our best-guess WTW estimates indicate BTL production costs break even when oil prices rise above $75/bbl, CTL above $60/bbl and GTL at $36/bbl. CTL, and GTL without carbon capture and storage (CCS), will emit more CO2 than diesel from conventional oil. Driving on fuel from GTL with CCS may reduce GHG emissions to around 123 g CO2/km. Driving on BTL may cause emissions of 32-63 g CO2/km and these can be made negative by application of CCS. It is possible to have net climate neutral driving by combining fuels produced from fossil resources with around 50% BTL with CCS, if biomass gasification and CCS can be made to work on an industrial scale and the feedstock is obtained in a climate-neutral manner. However, the uncertainties in these numbers are in the order of tens of percents, due to uncertainty in the data for component costs, variability in prices of feedstocks and by-products, and the GHG impact of producing biomass. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The world tendency in last years is to restrict the use of fossil fuels and replace them partially or totally by renewable fuels. Accordingly, biodiesel is being studied as one of the main alternatives and the production and consumption of this pure biofuel and its binary blends with fossil diesel have been markedly grown. Thus, the present work evaluated the influence of biodiesel concentration on such blends when mixed to diesel in 5, 15, 25 and 50 volume percentages. For each blend, both methanol and ethanol biodiesels were investigated. The biodiesel samples were physicochemically characterized. Their rheological behavior was analyzed. It was observed that the biodiesel enrichment leads to an acceptable increase in the viscosity and to a decrease in the volatilization of the binary blends. The viscosity was also shown to be temperature-dependent, as well as the fatty acids chain length and unsaturation. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present work the synthesis from bioethanol and Brassica carinata, as alternative vegetable oil, using KOH as catalyst, has been developed and optimized by application of the factorial design and response surface methodology (RSM). Temperature and catalyst concentration were found to have significant influence on conversion. A second-order model was obtained to predict conversions as a function of temperature and catalyst concentration. The maximum yield of ester (98.04%) was obtained working with an initial concentration of catalyst (1.5%) and an operation temperature of (35 °C). Results show that the acid value, peroxide value, and viscosity, increased while the iodine value decreased with increasing storage time of the biodiesel sample. Fatty acid ethyl esters (biodiesel) from B. carinata oil were very stable because they did not demonstrate rapid increase in peroxide value, acid value, and viscosity with increasing storage time to a period of 12 months. © 2008.

AB  - The transesterification of palm oil to methyl esters (biodiesel) was studied using KOH loaded on Al2O3 and NaY zeolite supports as heterogeneous catalysts. Reaction parameters such as reaction time, wt% KOH loading, molar ratio of oil to methanol, and amount of catalyst were optimized for the production of biodiesel. The 25 wt% KOH/Al2O3 and 10 wt% KOH/NaY catalysts are suggested here to be the best formula due to their biodiesel yield of 91.07% at temperatures below 70 °C within 2-3 h at a 1:15 molar ratio of palm oil to methanol and a catalyst amount of 3-6 wt%. The leaching of potassium species in both spent catalysts was observed. The amount of leached potassium species of the KOH/Al2O3 was somewhat higher compared to that of the KOH/NaY catalyst. The prepared catalysts were characterized by using several techniques such as XRD, BET, TPD, and XRF. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to meet the energy requirements, there has been growing interest in alternative fuels like biodiesels, methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, biogas, hydrogen and producer gas to provide a suitable diesel oil substitute for internal combustion engines. Biomass is basically composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. A proximate analysis of biomass indicates the volatile matter to be between 60-80% and 20-25% carbon and the rest, ash. The first part of sub-stoichiometric oxidation leads to the loss of volatiles from biomass and is exothermic; it results in peak temperatures of 1400-1500 K and generation of gaseous products like carbon monoxide, hydrogen in some proportions and carbon dioxide and water vapor, which in turn are reduced in part to carbon monoxide and hydrogen by the hot bed of charcoal generated during the process of gasification. Therefore, solid biomass can be converted into a mixture of combustible gases, and subsequently utilized for combustion in a CI engine. Producer gas, if used in dual fuel mode, is an excellent substitute for reducing the amount of diesel consumed by the CI engine. Downdraft moving bed gasifiers coupled with an IC engine are a good choice for moderate quantities of available biomass, up to 500 kW of electric power. Vegetable oils present a very promising alternative to diesel oil since they are renewable and have similar properties. Vegetable oils offer almost the same power output with slightly lower thermal efficiency when used in diesel engines [1-7]. Research in this direction with edible oils have yielded encouraging results, but their use as fuel for diesel engines has limited applications due to higher domestic requirement [8-10]. In view of this, Honge oil (Pongamia Pinnata Linn) is selected and its viscosity is reduced by the transesterification process to obtain Honge oil methyl ester (HOME). Since vegetable oils produce higher smoke emissions, dual fuel operation could be adopted in order to improve their performance. A gas carburetor was suitably designed to maximize the engine performance in dual fuel mode with Honge oil-producer gas and HOME-producer gas respectively. Thus bio-derived gas and vegetable oil, when used in a dual fuel mode with carburetor, resulted in better performance with reduced emissions. Crown Copyright © 2008.

AB  - This paper investigates the effects of turbocharger on the performance of a diesel engine using diesel fuel and biodiesel in terms of brake power, torque, brake specific consumption and thermal efficiency, as well as CO and NOx emissions. For this aim, a naturally aspirated four-stroke direct injection diesel engine was tested with diesel fuel and neat biodiesel, which is rapeseed oil methyl ester, at full load conditions at the speeds between 1200 and 2400 rpm with intervals of 200 rpm. Then, a turbocharger system was installed on the engine and the tests were repeated for both fuel cases. The evaluation of experimental data showed that the brake thermal efficiency of biodiesel was slightly higher than that of diesel fuel in both naturally aspirated and turbocharged conditions, while biodiesel yielded slightly lower brake power and torque along with higher fuel consumption values. It was also observed that emissions of CO in the operations with biodiesel were lower than those in the operations with diesel fuel, whereas NOx emission in biodiesel operation was higher. This study reveals that the use of biodiesel improves the performance parameters and decreases CO emissions of the turbocharged engine compared to diesel fuel. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The dependence of carbonaceous aerosol properties, like radiation absorption and hygroscopicity, on the emission source of origin motivate this work. The influence of emission categories, including crop residue and forest burning, biofuel combustion, brick kilns, thermal power plants, diesel transport and "other industry", is estimated on organic matter (OM) surface concentrations in the Indian ocean region. The approach uses general circulation model predicted OM surface concentrations during a ship cruise, identifies probable source regions for high concentration episodes using the potential source contribution function, and estimates collocated OM emissions resolved by category. Distinct source regions identified, are the Indo-Gangetic Plain during 20-30th January, 1999, and central/south India during 1-11th March, 1999. Contributing emission categories are primarily biofuel combustion (18 Gg) during 20-30Ü1 January, but a combination of forest burning (8 Gg), biofuel combustion (7 Gg) and crop residue (5 Gg) during 1 -11th March. The magnitude of emission flux rather than spatial extent of an emission category, was seen to increase its influence on the receptor. This approach can be used to investigate seasonal and inter-annual variability in emission category influence on atmospheric pollutants. Copyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.

AB  - This article discusses the use of biodiesel as an additive for diesohol - a mixture of regular diesel and ethanol. Physical and chemical properties of the diesohol blends were obtained and compared with those of regular diesel. The results showed that, in general, the fuel properties of diesohol with biodiesel as an emulsifier satisfy the requirement of regular diesel, although there is a tendency that increasing fraction of biodiesel results in more carbon residue. Engine performance and emissions of a selected blend (5% vol. biodiesel in the 95:5 diesel:ethanol mixture) were tested on a light-duty truck with a 2.5 L inter-cooled direct injection diesel engine. The results showed that biodiesel-emulsified diesohol produced less maximum power output than regular diesel. No significant difference in the emissions of CO2, CO, and NOx between diesohol and regular diesel was observed. But the use of diesohol resulted in a reduction of particulate matter.

AB  - The term biofuel is referred to as liquid fuels for the transport sector that are predominantly produced from biomass. Biofuels are important because they replace petroleum fuels. There are many benefits for the environment, economy, and consumers in using biofuels. The advantages of biofuels such as biodiesel, vegetable oil, bioethanol, biomethanol, and biomass pyrolysis oil as engine fuel are liquid nature-portability, ready availability, renewability, higher combustion efficiency, lower sulfur and aromatic content, and biodegradability. The biggest difference between biofuels and petroleum feedstocks is oxygen content. Biofuels have oxygen levels from 10-45% while petroleum has essentially none making the chemical properties of biofuels very different from petroleum. Oxygenates are just pre-used hydrocarbons having structure that provide a reasonable antiknock value. Also, as they contain oxygen, fuel combustion is more efficient, reducing hydrocarbons in exhaust gases. The only disadvantage is that oxygenated fuel has less energy content.

AB  - As a result of decreasing petroleum supplies, new fuel sources, such as transesterified biofeedstock based oils and their blends with petroleum diesel fuels, have emerged with potential to partially replace conventional diesel and gasoline fuels. Although these fuels have shown some promising results in engine studies, their basic combustion properties have not been well documented. Also, research is underway to develop new fuels from other sources or by altering their molecular structure to be fungible with conventional fuels. Thus, there is a need for tests to characterize the combustion and emission properties of these new liquids, which are available only in small quantities at the research and development stage. This paper deals with a technique that meets those goals. The fuel was prevaporized and mixed with air and burnt in a tubular burner (9.5 mm inner diameter) at atmospheric pressure under laminar conditions. A pilot methane/air flame was used as the ignition source. The test conditions were so chosen that the measured properties could be attributed primarily to the fuel chemical structure. Several liquid fuels were tested, including commercially available petroleum-based No. 2 diesel fuel, canola methyl ester (CME B100) biodiesel, kerosene, methanol, toluene, and selected alkanes. The radiative heat flux from the flames was measured using a wide-angle pyrheliometer; the emissions from the flames were sampled to measure the concentration of CO, CO 2, and NO. The measured radiant heat fraction values and the emission indices of NO and CO of both petroleum-derived and biofuels agreed well with those found in literature; thus, the feasibility of this method to rapidly characterize the combustion and emission properties of new liquids, such as biofuels, is demonstrated.

AB  - A facility is being constructed by BioFields in Mexico for volume production of ethanol made from algae grown in seawater based on 18 month demonstration in Florida in two swimming pool size test ponds both of which are one foot deep. The US Department of Energy (DOE) has announced it will provide $200 million funding to support bio fuel development now including algae based fuel. Bio diesel fuel is the initial targeted product and has consistently met all ASTM standards throughout the 18 month trial period, according to the developer, Aurora Biofuels, Inc., headquartered in Alameda, California. Aurora's new CEO, Robert Walsh, a recent high level Shell Oil Company production executive, is focused on developing plans for a first commercial scale 50 acre Aurora technology pond system that will produce 300,000 gal/yr bio diesel by 2012.

AB  - Comparison of the optimum conditions for biodiesel production from pure palm cooking oil (PPCO) and waste palm cooking oil (WPCO) through transesterification process using alkaline catalysts was studied. Some important variables such as volumetric ratio and types of reactants, catalytic activities were selected to obtain a high quality biodiesel fuel that comply with the specification of standard methods (ASTM D 6751 and EN 14214). The highest yield of approximately 99% was acquired under optimum conditions of 1:6 volumetric oil-to-methanol molar ratio, 1% KOH catalyst, 40°C reaction temperature, and 320 rpm stirring speed. Results showed that the production of biodiesel from PPCO and WPCO was exhibited no considerable differences. The research demonstrated that biodiesel obtained under optimum conditions from PPCO and WPCO was of good quality and could be used as a diesel fuel. Waste cooking palm oil after frying could be used as recycled material for waste management to produce renewable energy.

AB  - The monoalkylesters of fatty acids derived from vegetable oils or animal fats are considered an attractive alternative fuel for diesel engines. This interest is based on a number of properties of biodiesel, including the fact that it is produced from a renewable resource and its potential to reduce exhaust emissions. Although several studies have been performed on biodiesel emissions, the results have been contradictory, with some studies reporting a reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions while others report an increase. Adjusting engine parameters like exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), retarding injection timing, and using multiple injection strategies has reduced NOx to some extent. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect on exhaust gas emissions of blending biodiesel and ethanol into conventional diesel fuel. Ethanol could be added to diesel in limited quantities along with biodiesel since biodiesel stabilizes the ternary system by acting as an amphiphile. This article illustrates the emission characteristics of diesel-biodiesel-ethanol (DBE) fuel blends on one used engine and two new engines. DBE is a new form of oxygenated diesel fuel blend and has the potential to reduce NOx emissions and to serve as an alternative to diesel fuel. The blend ratios (diesel:biodiesel: ethanol) by volume used in this study were 70:25:5, 70:20:10, and 70:15:15. The results with DBE showed a significant reduction in NOx emissions in new engines with increased ethanol concentration, whereas with the old engine under similar conditions, an increased NOx emissions profile was observed. CO emission increased with increasing ethanol proportion in the blends in both new and old engines. © 2009 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - The global development of biofuel has been accelerating in the last few years. However, with the expansion of first generation biofuel (grain based), its impacts on food price, food security and environment start to loom, and have drawed many debates. This paper reviewed the current development of biodiesel, targets, and incentive policies in major biodiesel production countries. Based on the current feedstock demand and processing technologies of biodiesel, the paper analyzed its potential impacts on the prices of agricultural products and environment. The results indicate that the expansion of biodiesel production at a global level will still continue in the foreseeable future, and this will bring mounting pressure on the prices of agricultural products, especially on the prices of oil crops. The development of biodiesel will also have substantial impacts on environment and greenhouse gas emission, but the magnitude of its impacts will highly depend on production mode and the land use changes due to biodiesel development. To reduce the potential negative impacts of biodiesel development, China should focus on forest based biodiesel, particularly the Jatropha-seed based biodiesel, and formulate regulatory and incentive polices to promote the sustainable development of biodiesel industry in China.

AB  - The US Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for transportation fuels sets minimum levels of renewable fuels that must be blended into gasoline and other transportation fuels from 2006 to 2022. Specific requirements for blending advanced biofuels,1 including cellulosic biofuels and biomass-based diesel, begin at 0.6 billion gallons per year in 2009 and rise to 21 billion gallons in 2022. The RFS levels for advanced biofuels production will drive the creation of a major new industry, creating a foundation for future technology development and commercial growth. To estimate the economic implications of the emergence of this industry, Bio-Era conducted a meta-analysis of nearly two dozen studies of economic impacts of biofuels production, developed a model to analyze economic output and job creation, and applied this model to analyze the economic impact of increasing US advanced biofuel production to 21 billion gallons per year by 2022. This analysis yielded the following conclusions: Direct job creation from US advanced biofuels production could reach 29,000 jobs by 2012, rising to 94,000 by 2016, and 190,000 by 2022.: Total job creation, accounting for economic multiplier effects, could reach 123,000 jobs in 2012, 383,000 in 2016, and 807,000 by 2022.: Investments in advanced biofuels processing plants alone could reach $3.2 billion in 2012, rising to $8.5 billion in 2016, and $12.2 billion by 2022.: Cumulative investment in new processing facilities between 2009 and 2022 could total more than $95 billion.: Direct economic output from the advanced biofuels industry, including capital investment, research and development, technology royalties, processing operations, feedstock production, and biofuels distribution, is estimated to rise to $5.5 billion in 2012, $17.4 billion in 2016, and $37 billion by 2022.: Taking into consideration the indirect and induced economic effects resulting from direct expenditures in advanced biofuels production, the total economic output effect for the US economy is estimated to be $20.2 billion in 2012, $64.2 billion in 2016, and $148.7 billion in 2022.: Advanced biofuels production under the RFS scenario could reduce US petroleum imports by approximately $5.5 billion in 2012, $23 billion in 2016, and nearly $70 billion by 2022. The cumulative total of avoided petroleum imports over the period 2010-2022 would exceed $350 billion. The Bio-Era model was also used to assess the economic implications of a scenario in which total US biofuels production grows to 60 billion gallons by 2030, with 15 billion gallons of conventional biofuels production and 45 billion gallons of advanced biofuels production. This analysis concludes that: Approximately 400,000 jobs would be directly created in the advanced biofuels industry, with total employment creation in the US economy totaling 1.9 million jobs.: Direct economic output from advanced biofuels production would rise to $113 billion by 2030. The total economic output effect would be $300 billion.: Biomass feedstocks in this scenario could be provided by a mix of agricultural and forest wastes and dedicated energy crops, providing a total of 470 million dry tons of biomass by 2030 using existing crop and forest land.: The average cost of advanced biofuel production at the plantgate in 2030 would be $1.88/gallon, including all operating costs, overhead, and capital recovery.

AB  - This article develops a broad sociological understanding of why biofuels lost out to leaded gasoline as the fuel par excellence of the twentieth century, while drawing comparisons with biofuels today. It begins by briefly discussing the fuel-scape in the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, examining the farm chemurgic movement, New Deal agricultural policies, mechanization trends within agriculture, and, finally, the invention of leaded gasoline. The second half of the article applies insights from that historical analysis to the biofuel craze currently under way. By employing a political-economy interpretation of the socioeconomic context combined with a path-dependency-informed analysis of the technological trajectories, the article reveals the social forces that structured the trends and outcomes in biofuel innovations across the two eras.

AB  - Of all the first generation biofuels (biofuels that are derived from food crops), sugar cane ethanol, produced by conventional fermentation and distillation processes, is one of the most attractive in terms of both productivity (litres of ethanol per hectare) and carbon footprint. However, these properties could be greatly enhanced and its environmental credentials could be improved by developing sugar biorefineries that incorporate microchannel reactors to support a Fischer-Tropsch-based biomass to liquid (BTL) process to co-produce sugar cane ethanol along with second generation liquid biofuels, such as diesel, from biomass residues. In addition, the excess heat generated from the BTL process could be used to drive the ethanol distillation, avoiding the need to burn other fuels or biomass residues.

AB  - Background, aim and scope: Regional specificities are a key factor when analyzing the environmental impact of a biofuel pathway through a life cycle assessment (LCA). Due to different energy mixes, transport distances, agricultural practices and land use changes, results can significantly vary from one country to another. The Republic of Argentina is the first exporter of soybean oil and meal and the third largest soybean producer in the world, and therefore, soybean-based biodiesel production is expected to significantly increase in the near future, mostly for exportation. Moreover, Argentinean biodiesel producers will need to evaluate the environmental performances of their product in order to comply with sustainability criteria being developed. However, because of regional specificities, the environmental performances of this biofuel pathway can be expected to be different from those obtained for other countries and feedstocks previously studied. This work aims at analyzing the environmental impact of soybean-based biodiesel production in Argentina for export. The relevant impact categories account for the primary non-renewable energy consumption (CED), the global warming potential (GWP), the eutrophication potential (EP), the acidification potential (AP), the terrestrial ecotoxicity (TE), the aquatic ecotoxicity (AE), the human toxicity (HT) and land use competition (LU). The paper tackles the feedstock and country specificities in biodiesel production by comparing the results of soybean-based biodiesel in Argentina with other reference cases. Emphasis is put on explaining the factors that contribute most to the final results and the regional specificities that lead to different results for each biodiesel pathway. Materials and methods: The Argentinean (AR) biodiesel pathway was modelled through an LCA and was compared with reference cases available in the ecoinvent® 2.01 database, namely, soybean-based biodiesel production in Brazil (BR) and the United States (US), rapeseed-based biodiesel production in the European Union (EU) and Switzerland (CH) and palm-oil-based biodiesel production in Malaysia (MY). In all cases, the systems were modelled from feedstock production to biodiesel use as B100 in a 28 t truck in CH. Furthermore, biodiesel pathways were compared with fossil low-sulphur diesel produced and used in CH. The LCA was performed according to the ISO standards. The life cycle inventory and the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) were performed in Excel spreadsheets using the ecoinvent® 2.01 database. The cumulative energy demand (CED) and the GWP were estimated through the CED for fossil and nuclear energy and the IPCC 2001 (climate change) LCIA methods, respectively. Other impact categories were assessed according to CML 2001, as implemented in ecoinvent. As the product is a fuel for transportation (service), the system was defined for one vehicle kilometre (functional unit) and was divided into seven unit processes, namely, agricultural phase, soybean oil extraction and refining, transesterification, transport to port, transport to the destination country border, distribution and utilisation. Results: The Argentinean pathway results in the highest GWP, CED, AE and HT compared with the reference biofuel pathways. Compared with the fossil reference, all impact categories are higher for the AR case, except for the CED. The most significant factor that contributes to the environmental impact in the Argentinean case varies depending on the evaluated category. Land provision through deforestation for soybean cultivation is the most impacting factor of the AR biodiesel pathway for the GWP, the CED and the HT categories. Whilst nitrogen oxide emissions during the fuel use are the main cause of acidification, nitrate leaching during soybean cultivation is the main factor of eutrophication. LU is almost totally affected by arable land occupation for soybean cultivation. Cypermethrin used as pesticide in feedstock production accounts for almost the total impact on TE and AE. Discussion: The sensitivity analysis shows that an increase of 10% in the soybean yield, whilst keeping the same inputs, will reduce the total impact of the system. Avoiding deforestation is the main challenge to improve the environmental performances of soybean-based biodiesel production in AR. If the soybean expansion can be done on marginal and set-aside agricultural land, the negative impact of the system will be significantly reduced. Further implementation of crops' successions, soybean inoculation, reduced tillage and less toxic pesticides will also improve the environmental performances. Using ethanol as alcohol in the transesterification process could significantly improve the energy balance of the Argentinean pathway. Conclusions: The main explaining factors depend on regional specificities of the system that lead to different results from those obtained in the reference cases. Significantly different results can be obtained depending on the level of detail of the input data, the use of punctual or average data and the assumptions made to build up the LCA inventory. Further improvement of the AR biodiesel pathways should be done in order to comply with international sustainability criteria on biofuel production. Recommendations and perspectives: Due to the influence of land use changes in the final results, more efforts should be made to account for land use changes others than deforestation. More data are needed to determine the part of deforestation attributable to soybean cultivation. More efforts should be done to improve modelling of interaction between variables and previous crops in the agricultural phase, future transesterification technologies and market prices evolution. In order to assess more accurately the environmental impact of soybean-based biodiesel production in Argentina, further considerations should be made to account for indirect land use changes, domestic biodiesel consumption and exportation to other regions, production scale and regional georeferenced differentiation of production systems. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - An increasing number of countries have introduced or plan to introduce policies to increase the proportion of biofuels within their energy portfolio. One impact is that biofuel production has been abruptly increasing for more than 5 years, leading to increasing number of production sites world-wide and also to diversification of processes and approaches to produce biofuel. There is today a large range of technologies currently available for producing so-called first-generation of biofuels and reasonably advanced processes that are dramatically expected for the production of biofuels that would use biomass that does not enter in competition with food and feed use. However, only very limited consideration has so far been given to safety issues. Nevertheless, risks exist throughout the biofuel life cycle. Although these safety issues do not actually represent a potential barrier on biofuel development, they deserve serious consideration. In this paper, we propose to rank the risks pertaining to biofuel chains by implementing a decision-making tool, BIOSAFUEL®. From easily accessible input data, BIOSAFUEL® allows the user to build up a pre-diagnosis of the risks implicit to the whole life cycle of a given biofuel chain. We applied BIOSAFUEL® to first-generation bioethanol chains as a first case study. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work two genus of the Jatropha family: the Jatropha gossypiifolia (JG) and Jatropha curcas L. (JC) were studied in order to delimitate their potential as raw material for biodiesel production. The oil content in wild seeds and some physical-chemical properties of the oils and the biodiesel obtained from them were evaluated. The studied physical-chemical properties of the JC and JG biodiesel are in acceptable range for use as biodiesel in diesel engines, showing a promising economic exploitation of these raw materials in semi-arid regions. However, further agronomic studies are needed in order to improve the seed production and the crude oil properties. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative fuel made from vegetable oils or animal fats. The fatty acid composition of the feedstock, which varies among and within species, is the main determinant of biodiesel quality. In this work we analyze the variability in biodiesel quality (density, kinematic viscosity, heating value, cetane number and iodine value) obtained from sunflower oil, by means of a validated crop model that predicts the fatty acid composition of one high-oleic, and three traditional (high-linoleic) sunflower hybrids. The model was run with a 10-year average weather data from 56 weather stations in Argentina, and simulation results were compared to the biodiesel standards of Argentina, USA and Europe. We show that biodiesel produced from sunflower oil does not have one fixed quality, but different qualities depending on weather conditions and agricultural practices, and that intraspecific variation in biodiesel quality can be larger than interspecific differences. Our results suggest that (a) sunflower oil from high-oleic hybrids is suitable for biodiesel production (within limits of all analyzed standards), regardless of growing conditions and (b) sunflower oil from traditional hybrids is suitable for biodiesel production under the standards of Argentina and USA, while only certain hybrids grown in warm regions (e.g., Northern Argentina, Southern USA, China, India, Pakistan) are suitable for biodiesel production according to the European standard. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The feasibility of producing biodiesel from Idesia polycarpa var. vestita fruit oil was studied. A methyl ester biodiesel was prepared from refined I. polycarpa fruit oil using methanol and potassium hydroxide (KOH) in an alkali-catalyzed transesterification process. The experimental variables investigated in this study were catalyst concentration (0.5-2.0 wt.% of oil), methanol/oil molar ratio (4.5:1 to 6.5:1), temperature (20-60 °C) and reaction time (20-60 min). A maximum yield of over 99% of methyl esters in I. polycarpa fruit oil biodiesel was achieved using a 6:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil, 1.0% KOH (% oil) and reaction time for 40 min at 30 °C. The properties of I. polycarpa fruit oil methyl esters produced under optimum conditions were also analyzed for specifications for biodiesel as fuel in diesel engines according to China Biofuel Systems Standards. The fuel properties of the I. polycarpa fruit oil biodiesel obtained are similar to the No. 0 light diesel fuel and most of the parameters comply with the limits established by specifications for biodiesel. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Wide variability in oil content was observed in 75 germplasm accessions of Pongamia pinnata (L.) Pierre collected from Telengana region of Andhra Pradesh, India. Out of these, fatty acid profiles of 21 accessions with varying seed oil content were examined. Large variation was observed in stearic, oleic and linoleic fatty acid composition i.e. 1.83-11.50%, 46.66-65.35% and 12.02-32.58% respectively while less variation i.e. 9.25-12.87% was found with palmitic acid content. Saponification number (SN), iodine value (IV) and cetane number (CN) of fatty acid methyl esters of oils varied from 183.3 to 200.91, 74.78 to 100.98 and 50.85 to 59.11 respectively. Fatty acid composition, IV and CN were used to predict the quality of fatty acid methyl esters of oil for use as biodiesel. Fatty acid methyl esters of oils of P. pinnata accessions DORPP 49, 72 and 83 were found most suitable (CN more than 56.6) for use as biodiesel and they meet the major specification of biodiesel standards of USA, Germany and European Standard Organization. The range of variability found for various biodiesel standards in accessions of P. pinnata can be utilized for the establishment of plantations of promising genotypes through clonal means for increased productivity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The demand for diesel fuel far exceeds the current and future biodiesel production capabilities of the vegetable oil and animal fat industries. New oilseed crops that do not compete with traditional food crop are needed to meet existing energy demands. Hybrid hazelnut oil is just such an attractive raw material for production of biodiesel. Hazelnut oil was extracted from hybrid hazelnuts and the crude oil was refined. Hazelnut oil-based biodiesel was prepared via the transesterification of the refined hazelnut oil with excess methanol using an alkaline catalyst. The effects of reaction temperature, time and catalyst concentration on the yield of diesel were examined, and selected physical and chemical properties of the biodiesel were evaluated. The biodiesel yield increased with increasing temperature from 25 to 65 °C and with increasing catalyst concentration from 0.1 to 0.7 wt%. The increase in yield with reaction time was nonlinear and characterized by an initial faster rate, followed by a slow rate. Hazelnut oil-based biodiesel had an average viscosity of 8.82 cP at 25 °C, which was slightly higher than that of the commercial soy-based diesel (7.92 cP at 25 °C). An approximate 12 °C higher onset oxidative temperature and a 10 °C lower cloud point of hazelnut oil biodiesel than those of its commercial soy counterpart indicated a better oxidative stability and flowability at low temperature. The average heat of combustion of hazelnut oil biodiesel was 40.23 kJ/g, and accounted for approximately 88% of energy content of diesel fuel. The fatty acid composition of hazelnut oil-based biodiesel was the same as the nature oil. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - As an alternative and renewable fuel, biodiesel can effectively reduce diesel engine emissions, especially particulate matter and dry soot. However, the biodiesel effects on emissions may vary as the source fuel changes. In this paper, the performance of five methyl esters with different sources was studied: cottonseed methyl ester (CME), soybean methyl ester (SME), rapeseed methyl ester (RME), palm oil methyl ester (PME) and waste cooking oil methyl ester (WME). Total particulate matter (PM), dry soot (DS), non-soot fraction (NSF), nitrogen oxide (NOx), unburned hydrocarbon (HC), and carbon monoxide (CO) were investigated on a Cummins ISBe6 Euro III diesel engine and compared with a baseline diesel fuel. Results show that using different methyl esters results in large PM reductions ranging from 53% to 69%, which include the DS reduction ranging from 79% to 83%. Both oxygen content and viscosity could influence the DS emission. Higher oxygen content leads to less DS at high load while lower viscosity results in less DS at low load. NSF decreases consistently as cetane number increases except for PME. The cetane number could be responsible for the large NSF difference between different methyl esters. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article presents the bench testing results of a four stroke, four cylinder, direct injection, unmodified, diesel engine operating on pure rapeseed oil (RO) and its 2.5 vol%, 5 vol%, 7.5 vol% and 10 vol% blends with ethanol (ERO), petrol (PRO) and both improving agents applied in equal proportions as 50:50 vol% (EPRO). The purpose of the research is to examine the effect of ethanol and petrol addition into RO on the biofuel kinematical viscosity, brake mean effective pressure (bmep), brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) of a diesel engine and its brake thermal efficiency (bte). Addition into RO from 2.5 to 7.5 vol% of ethanol and petrol its viscosity at ambient temperature of 20 °C diminishes by 9.2-28.3% and 14.1-31.7%, respectively. Heating up to the temperature of 60 °C the viscosity of pure RO, blends ERO2.5-7.5 and PRO2.5-10 further diminishes 4.2, 3.9-3.8 and 3.9-3.6 times. At 1800 min-1 speed, the maximum brake mean effective pressure (bmep) higher up to 1.6% comparing with that of pure RO (0.77 MPa) ensure three agent blends EPRO5-7.5, whereas at rated 2200 min-1 speed, the bmep higher by 5.6% can be obtained when fuelling the engine with blend PRO2.5. Brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) at maximum torque (240.2 g/kWh) and rated power (234.0 g/kWh) is correspondingly lower by 3.4% and 5.5% in comparison with pure RO when biofuel blends EPRO5 and PRO2.5 are used. The biggest brake thermal efficiency at maximum torque (0.40-0.41) and rated power (0.42-0.43) relative to that of RO (0.39) suggest blends PRO2.5 and EPRO5-7.5, respectively. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The preparation of a novel biofuel denoted as Ecodiesel-100 from the partial 1,3-regiospecific alcoholysis of sunflower oil is reported. Pig pancreatic lipase (PPL) was employed in the reaction as both free and immobilised enzyme on sepiolite. The resulting biofuel is composed of fatty acid ethyl esters and monoglycerides (FAEE/MG) blended in a molar relation 2/1. The novel biofuel has similar physico-chemical properties compared to those of conventional biodiesel and/or petrodiesel, avoiding the production of glycerine as by-product. The biocatalyst was found to be strongly fixed to the inorganic support (87.5%). Nevertheless, the efficiency of the immobilised enzyme was reduced to less than half (42%) compared to that of the free PPL. Quantitative conversions of triglycerides and high yields to FAEE were obtained under mild reaction conditions (20-80 °C, oil/alcohol 2/1 v:v ratio and PPL 0.01-0.1% w/w of total substrate). The immobilised enzyme showed a remarkable stability as well as a great reusability (more than 11 successive reuses) without a significant loss of its initial catalytic activity. Both immobilised and free enzyme exhibited the same reaction mechanism, according to the coincidental results in the Arrhenius parameters (Ln A and Ea). The immobilised PPL was found to be very suitable for the continuous production of biofuel due to its facile recyclability from the reaction mixture. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Defective coffee press cake, a residue from coffee oil biodiesel production, was evaluated as raw material for production of an adsorbent for removal of methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solution. Batch adsorption tests were performed at 25 °C and the effects of particle size, contact time, adsorbent dosage and pH were investigated. Preliminary adsorption tests indicated that thermal treatment is necessary in order to improve adsorption capacity. Adsorption kinetics was determined by fitting first and second-order kinetic models to the experimental data, with the second-order model providing the best description of MB adsorption onto the prepared adsorbent. The experimental adsorption equilibrium data were fitted to Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin adsorption models, with the last two providing the best fits. The experimental data obtained in the present study indicated that this type of waste material is a suitable candidate for use in the production of adsorbents for removal of cationic dyes, thus contributing for the implementation of sustainable development in both the coffee and biodiesel production chains. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, the non-catalytic supercritical method has been studied in utilizing dimethyl carbonate. It was demonstrated that, the supercritical dimethyl carbonate process without any catalysts applied, converted triglycerides to fatty acid methyl esters with glycerol carbonate and citramalic acid as by-products, while free fatty acids were converted to fatty acid methyl esters with glyoxal. After 12 min of reaction at 350 °C/20 MPa, rapeseed oil treated with supercritical dimethyl carbonate reached 94% (w/w) yield of fatty acid methyl ester. The by-products from this process which are glycerol carbonate and citramalic acid are much higher in value than glycerol produced by the conventional process. In addition, the yield of the fatty acid methyl esters as biodiesel was almost at par with supercritical methanol method. Therefore, supercritical dimethyl carbonate process can be a good candidate as an alternative biodiesel production process. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative diesel fuel which can be obtained from the transesterification of vegetable oils with simple alcohols. This process decreases the viscosity, density and flash point of the raw material. The biodiesel molecular structure, consisting of linear esters, allows similar physical-chemical properties compared to mineral diesel oil. Some important properties of the oil, such as viscosity, melting point, thermal stability and cetane index can be directly related to the chemical composition of the biomass source that was used. It is therefore possible to anticipate which property values will be obtained for each biodiesel produced from a specific vegetable oil, relating them to the chemical nature of the starting vegetable oil. The objective of this study is to evaluate the properties of biodiesel oils obtained from different biomass sources (castor, soybean, cotton, and canola) and their binary blends prepared in concentration ranges between 20 and 80%vol. Each sample was analyzed for viscosity, specific gravity and iodine index. The proper formulation to meet the European specifications for biodiesel (DIN - 14214) using those sources of biomass is presented and discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, both edible (coconut oil, palm oil, groundnut oil, and rice bran oil) and non-edible oils (pongamia, neem and cotton seed oil) were used to optimize the biodiesel production process variables like catalyst concentration, amount of methanol required for reaction, reaction time and reaction temperature. The fuel properties like specific gravity, moisture content, refractive index, acid value, iodine number, saponification value and peroxide value were estimated. Based on the cetane number and iodine value, the methyl esters obtained from palm and coconut oils were not suitable to use as biodiesel in cold weather conditions, but for hot climate condition biodiesel obtained from the remaining oil sources is suitable. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The use of biodiesel as a diesel fuel extender and lubricity improver is rapidly increasing. While most of the properties of biodiesel are comparable to petroleum based diesel fuel, improvement of its low temperature flow characteristic still remains one of the major challenges when using biodiesel as an alternative fuel for diesel engines. The biodiesel fuels derived from fats or oils with significant amounts of saturated fatty compounds will display higher cloud points and pour points. This paper is aimed to investigate the cold flow properties of 100% biodiesel fuel obtained from Madhuca indica, one of the important species in the Indian context. In this paper, the cold flow properties of biodiesel were evaluated with and without pour point depressants towards the objectives of identifying the pumping and injecting of these biodiesel in CI engines under cold climates. Effect of ethanol, kerosene and commercial additive on cold flow behavior of this biodiesel was studied. A considerable reduction in pour point has been noticed by using these cold flow improvers. The performance and emission with ethanol blended Mahua biodiesel fuel and ethanol-diesel blended Mahua biodiesel fuel have also been studied. A considerable reduction in emission was obtained. Ethanol blended biodiesel is totally a renewable, viable alternative fuel for improved cold flow behavior and better emission characteristics without affecting the engine performance. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Concern with climate change and energy security has generated interest in both cogeneration and biofuels. This experimental study examines the performance of a residential microcogeneration system based on a Stirling engine fueled by diesel and biodiesel. Run on diesel, the system achieves a power efficiency of 11.7% and a heat efficiency of 78.7%. The corresponding efficiencies for the system, when run on biodiesel, are slightly lower at 11.5% and 77.5%, respectively. Particulate emissions for biodiesel are 69.2 mg/kWh, an order of magnitude higher than that of diesel (2.3 mg/kWh). The total unburned hydrocarbon emissions for biodiesel are higher than those of diesel. Emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, methane, acetylene, ethylene, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde are comparable between diesel and biodiesel, but nitric oxide emissions for diesel are observed to be higher at 151 ppm compared to those for biodiesel (117 ppm). The difference in the performance of the system is generally attributed to higher boiling range compounds in biodiesel that affect the flame stability, the fuel evaporation, and the complete burnout of the fuel. The system achieves energy efficiencies comparable to those of internal-combustion-engine-based and fuel-cell-based cogeneration systems. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory has been engaged in a research program to develop sensor-based technologies to perform rapid automated fuel-quality surveillance. This approach is based on the development of quantitative models from the partial least-squares (PLS) regression of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic measurements of a representative calibration set of petroleum-derived fuels. As fuels from nonpetroleum sources become available it will be necessary to extend these chemometric models to accommodate Fischer-Tropsch(FT) synthetic fuels and biofuels. This extension is complicated by the fact that these new fuels will be initially introduced as blending components with petroleum-derived fuels. Chemometric modeling methodologies have been developed to identify and estimate the content of FT and biofuel present; then this information is used to estimate the bulk properties of the blends. With this approach, biodiesel content can be predicted, with respect to absolute error, to within 1.7% of its true value 95% of the time with a lower limit of detection of 1.5% using a single PLS model. The diesel fuel PLS property prediction models are applicable to diesel fuels blended with biodiesel fuel once that particular biodiesel fuel is incorporated in said models. The FT content in blends with petroleum fuels can be predicted, with respect to absolute error, to within 6.9% of its true value 95% of the time with a lower limit of detection of 15% using a series of paired PLS models for identification and quantification. In the presence of FT fuel, the PLS property models can be used after applying a correction factor that is derived from the identity and concentration of the FT fuel present. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), used as biodiesel, degrade over time, mainly influenced by temperature, presence of light, metal, nature of the container and oxygen. Peroxide value and viscosity increases withincreasing storage time of FAME samples. Use of antioxidants [3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole (BHA), 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl-phenol (BHT) and propyl gallate (PrG)] could significantly improve stability of FAME. Storage (1 y) period can be regarded as a more than realistic time span for commercial life of biodiesel.

AB  - Bio-diesel tree species were selected and evaluated. The conclusion was that rare tree species, tree species with high-quality dried fruit, tree species with few seeds, tree species with high-quality edible oil materials, and the tree species which have difficulties for afforestation in large area should not be selected as bio-diesel tree species. Xanthoceras sorbifolia, Zanthoxylum bungeanum, Pistacia chinensis, Sapium sebiferum, Vernicia fordii, Swida wilsoniana, Jatropha curcas, Euphorbia tirucalli, Cocos nucifera, Elaeis guineensis were initially selected as bio-diesel tree species. The survey and evaluation on the morphological characteristics, ecological habits, nurturing seedlings, planting methods, pests and diseases, natural distribution , seed production, the term of utilization, the current application of tree species above-mentioned, oil content and natural comparison between bio-diesel extracted from plants and of petrochemical diesel fuel were done. The factors restricting the development of the tree species such as Eurytoma plotniko of Pistacia chinensis, low rate of fruit of Xanthoceras sorbifolia, the toxic substances in Jatropha curcas and others were discussed. Taking Zanthoxylum bungeanum as an example, economic benefits of bio-diesel forest were assessed as well.

AB  - In this study, we used Argonne National Laboratory's Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) model to assess the life-cycle energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission impacts of four soybean- derived fuels: biodiesel fuel produced via transesterification, two renewable diesel fuels (I and II) produced from different hydrogenation processes, and renewable gasoline produced from catalytic cracking. Five approaches were employed to allocate the coproducts: a displacement approach; two allocation approaches, one based on the energy value and the other based on the market value; and two hybrid approaches that integrated the displacement and allocation methods. The relative rankings of soybean-based fuels in terms of energy and environmental impacts were different under the different approaches, and the reasons were analyzed. Results from the five allocation approaches showed that although the production and combustion of soybean-based fuels might increase total energy use, they could have significant benefits in reducing fossil energy use (>52%), petroleum use (>88%), and GHG emissions (>57%) relative to petroleum fuels. This study emphasized the importance of the methods used to deal with coproduct issues and provided a comprehensive solution for conducting a life-cycle assessment of fuel pathways with multiple coproducts. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biofuels demand is unquestionable in order to reduce gaseous emissions (fossil CO2, nitrogen and sulfur oxides) and their purported greenhouse, climatic changes and global warming effects, to face the frequent oil supply crises, as a way to help non-fossil fuel producer countries to reduce energy dependence, contributing to security of supply, promoting environmental sustainability and meeting the EU target of at least of 10% biofuels in the transport sector by 2020. Biodiesel is usually produced from oleaginous crops, such as rapeseed, soybean, sunflower and palm. However, the use of microalgae can be a suitable alternative feedstock for next generation biofuels because certain species contain high amounts of oil, which could be extracted, processed and refined into transportation fuels, using currently available technology; they have fast growth rate, permit the use of non-arable land and non-potable water, use far less water and do not displace food crops cultures; their production is not seasonal and they can be harvested daily. The screening of microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris, Spirulina maxima, Nannochloropsis sp., Neochloris oleabundans, Scenedesmus obliquus and Dunaliella tertiolecta) was done in order to choose the best one(s), in terms of quantity and quality as oil source for biofuel production. Neochloris oleabundans (fresh water microalga) and Nannochloropsis sp. (marine microalga) proved to be suitable as raw materials for biofuel production, due to their high oil content (29.0 and 28.7%, respectively). Both microalgae, when grown under nitrogen shortage, show a great increase (~50%) in oil quantity. If the purpose is to produce biodiesel only from one species, Scenedesmus obliquus presents the most adequate fatty acid profile, namely in terms of linolenic and other polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, the microalgae Neochloris oleabundans, Nannochloropsis sp. and Dunaliella tertiolecta can also be used if associated with other microalgal oils and/or vegetable oils. © Society for Industrial Microbiology 2008.

AB  - Michelia champaca and Garcinia indica seeds yielded 45.0% and 45.5% of oil. The fatty acid profiles of both the seed oils were examined. The saponification value (SV), iodine value (IV) and cetane number (CN) of fatty acid methyl esters of both the seed oils were empirically determined. The saponification value (SV) and iodine value (IV) are in good agreement with the experimentally observed values. The fatty acid compositions, iodine value and cetane number were used to predict the quality of fatty acid methyl esters of oil for use as biodiesel. Thus, the fatty acid methyl esters of seed oils of M. champaca and G. indica were found to be the most suitable biodiesel and they meet the major specification of biodiesel standards. The selected plants M. champaca and G. indica have great potential for biodiesel. M. champaca and G. indica seed oils were found to contain keto fatty acids along with the other normal fatty acids, respectively. These fatty acids have been detected and characterized by UV, FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MS, GC techniques and chemical transformations. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We implemented a program in which emission characterization is enabled through collaborations between academic, US and international non-governmental entities that focus on evaluation, dissemination, and in-use testing, of improved cookstoves. This effort resulted in a study of field and laboratory emissions from traditional and improved biofuel cookstoves. We found that field measured particulate emissions of actual cooking average three times those measured during simulated cooking in the laboratory. Emission factors are highly dependent on the care and skill of the operator and the resulting combustion; these do not appear to be accurately reproduced in laboratory settings. The single scattering albedo (SSA) of the emissions was very low in both lab and field measurements, averaging about 0.3 for lab tests and around 0.5 for field tests, indicating that the primary particles are climate warming. Over the course of three summers in Honduras, we measured field emissions from traditional cookstoves, relatively new improved cookstoves, and "broken-in" improved cookstoves. We found that well-designed improved cookstoves can significantly reduce PM and CO emission factors below traditional cookstoves. For improved stoves, the presence of a chimney generally resulted in lower emission factors but left the SSA unaffected. Traditional cookstoves had an average PM emission factor of 8.2 g kg-1 - significantly larger than previous studies. Particulate emission factors for improved cookstoves without and with chimneys averaged about 6.6 g kg-1 and 4.5 g kg-1, respectively. The elemental carbon (EC) fraction of PM varied significantly between individual tests, but averaged about 25% for each of the categories. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rapid growth of road vehicles, private vehicles in particular, has resulted in continuing growth in China's oil demand and imports, which has been widely accepted as a major factor effecting future oil availability and prices, and a major contributor to China's GHG emission increase. This paper is intended to analyze the future trends of energy demand and GHG emissions in China's road transport sector and to assess the effectiveness of possible reduction measures. A detailed model has been developed to derive a reliable historical trend of energy demand and GHG emissions in China's road transport sector between 2000 and 2005 and to project future trends. Two scenarios have been designed to describe the future strategies relating to the development of China's road transport sector. The 'Business as Usual' scenario is used as a baseline reference scenario, in which the government is assumed to do nothing to influence the long-term trends of road transport energy demand. The 'Best Case' scenario is considered to be the most optimized case where a series of available reduction measures such as private vehicle control, fuel economy regulation, promoting diesel and gas vehicles, fuel tax and biofuel promotion, are assumed to be implemented. Energy demand and GHG emissions in China's road transport sector up to 2030 are estimated in these two scenarios. The total reduction potentials in the 'Best Case' scenario and the relative reduction potentials of each measure have been estimated. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Transesterification of soybean oil catalyzed by combusted oyster shell, which is waste material from shellfish farms, was examined. Powdered oyster shell combusted at a temperature above 700 °C, at which point the calcium carbonate of oyster shell transformed to calcium oxide, acted as a catalyst in the transesterification of soybean oil. On the basis of factorial design, the reaction conditions of catalyst concentration and reaction time were optimized in terms of the fatty acid methyl ester concentration expressed as biodiesel purity. Under the optimized reaction conditions of a catalyst concentration and reaction time of 25wt.%. and 5 h, respectively, the biodiesel yield, expressed relative to the amount of soybean oil poured into the reaction vial, was more than 70% with high biodiesel purity. These results indicate oyster shell waste combusted at high temperature can be reused in biodiesel production as a catalyst. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The potential of using municipal wastewater sludges as a lipid feedstock for biodiesel production was investigated. Primary and secondary sludge samples obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Tuscaloosa, AL were freeze-dried and subjected to an acid-catalyzed in situ transesterification process. Experiments were conducted to determine the effects of temperature, sulfuric acid concentration, and mass ratio of methanol to sludge on the yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). Results indicated a significant interactive effect between temperature, acid concentration, and methanol to sludge mass ratio on the FAME yield for the in situ transesterification of primary sludge, while the FAME yield for secondary sludge was significantly affected by the independent effects of the three factors investigated. The maximum FAME yields were obtained at 75 °C, 5% (v/v) H2SO4, and 12:1 methanol to sludge mass ratio and were 14.5% and 2.5% for primary and secondary sludge, respectively. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis of the FAMEs revealed a similar fatty acid composition for both primary and secondary sludge. An economic analysis estimated the cost of $3.23/gallon for a neat biodiesel obtained from this process at an assumed yield of 10% FAMEs/dry weight of sludge. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the suitability of Desert date (Balanites aegyptiaca L. Delile) as an oil crop in arid lands for large-scale sustainable industrial biodiesel production. Characterization of the Desert date plant material showed that using proper cultivation practices with emphasis on low quality irrigation water trees can be extremely well developed in hyper-arid conditions of the Israeli Arava desert and yield oil-rich fruits. Best selected trees can yield date fruits up to 52 kg/trees. Desert date kernels oil content may reach up to 46.7% (based on dry weight). The oil is consisted on four major fatty acids: palmitic (16:0), stearic (18:0), oleic (18:1), and linoleic (18:2), constituting 98-100% of the total fatty acids in the oil of all tested genotypes. Linoleic acid was the most prevalent fatty acid, ranging from 31% to 51% of the fatty acids profile, very similar to soybean oil profile. In situ biodiesel production directly from oil-enriched powder was successfully developed. Yield efficiency for both conventional and in situ biodiesel production was about 90%. The qualities of the produced biodiesel well meet the international biodiesel standards. The present study clearly demonstrated Desert date as a model for the utilization of bioresources in the Israeli Arava desert and potentially other similar areas for cost-effective biodiesel production. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodegradation experiments for diesel/biodiesel blends in liquid cultures by-petroleum degrading microbial consortium showed that for low amendments of biodiesel (10%) the overall biodegradation efficiency of the mixture after seven days was lower than for petroleum diesel fuel. Preferential usage of methyl esters in the broad biodiesel concentration range and diminished biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons for 10% biodiesel blend was confirmed. Rhamnolipids improved biodegradation efficiency only for blends with low content of biodiesel. Emulsion formation experiments showed that biodiesel amendments significantly affected dispersion of fuel mixtures in water. The presence of rhamnolipids biosurfactant affected stability of such emulsions and altered cell surface properties of tested consortium. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The rapidly growing world population and rising consumption of biofuels intensify demands for both food and biofuels. This exaggerates food and fuel shortages. The use of food crops such as corn grain to produce ethanol raises major nutritional and ethical concerns. Nearly 60% of humans in the world are currently malnourished, so the need for grains and other basic foods is critical. Growing crops for fuel squanders land, water and energy resources vital for the production of food for human consumption. Using corn for ethanol increases the price of US beef, chicken, pork, eggs, breads, cereals, and milk more than 10% to 30%. In addition, Jacques Diouf, Director General of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, reports that using food grains to produce biofuels is already causing food shortages for the poor of the world. Growing crops for biofuel not only ignores the need to reduce fossil energy and land use, but exacerbates the problem of malnourishment worldwide. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

AB  - This paper highlights the results of scientific research on the possibility of increasing the biofuel concentration in the fuel used in diesel engines by introducing bioethanol in multicomponent diesel fuel mixtures containing fossil diesel fuel (D), rapeseed oil methyl esters (RME), and ethanol (E). In the initial stage of the research, we performed an analysis of the physicochemical parameters of fuel and comparative tests of a diesel engine running on pure fossil diesel fuel, rapeseed oil methyl esters (RME), and RME-E mixtures. In engine tests, it has been shown that increasing the ethanol amount in biodiesel fuel up to 40% leads to an increase in indicator index ηi of the tested diesel engine 1A41 by 2.5%. CO and NOx emissions decreased up to 10-12% for every 10% increase of ethanol amount in blend with rapeseed oil methyl esters. The influence of different levels of ethanol on CO and NOx emissions from fuel and on experimentally defined dynamics of the indicator process can show alternative improvements of the performance characteristics of the diesel engine while working on fuel mixtures. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, we analyze the impact of fertilizer- and manure-induced N2O emissions due to energy crop production on the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when conventional transportation fuels are replaced by first-generation biofuels (also taking account of other GHG emissions during the entire life cycle). We calculate the nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions by applying a statistical model that uses spatial data on climate and soil. For the land use that is assumed to be replaced by energy crop production (the 'reference land-use system'), we explore a variety of options, the most important of which are cropland for food production, grassland, and natural vegetation. Calculations are also done in the case that emissions due to energy crop production are fully additional and thus no reference is considered. The results are combined with data on other emissions due to biofuels production that are derived from existing studies, resulting in total GHG emission reduction potentials for major biofuels compared with conventional fuels. The results show that N2O emissions can have an important impact on the overall GHG balance of biofuels, though there are large uncertainties. The most important ones are those in the statistical model and the GHG emissions not related to land use. Ethanol produced from sugar cane and sugar beet are relatively robust GHG savers: these biofuels change the GHG emissions by -103% to -60% (sugar cane) and -58% to -17% (sugar beet), compared with conventional transportation fuels and depending on the reference land-use system that is considered. The use of diesel from palm fruit also results in a relatively constant and substantial change of the GHG emissions by -75% to -39%. For corn and wheat ethanol, the figures are -38% to 11% and -107% to 53%, respectively. Rapeseed diesel changes the GHG emissions by -81% to 72% and soybean diesel by -111% to 44%. Optimized crop management, which involves the use of state-of-the-art agricultural technologies combined with an optimized fertilization regime and the use of nitrification inhibitors, can reduce N2O emissions substantially and change the GHG emissions by up to -135 percent points (pp) compared with conventional management. However, the uncertainties in the statistical N2O emission model and in the data on non-land-use GHG emissions due to biofuels production are large; they can change the GHG emission reduction by between -152 and 87 pp. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.

AB  - Total hydrogenation of vegetable oils to yield hydrocarbons is an emerging process for production of biofuels. Tristearate was chosen as a model compound to represent vegetable oils in the calculations. As its thermodynamic data were not available in literature, their values were estimated by using the Joback's contribution method. Based on the comparison to a relevant known system (butyl stearate) it was concluded that the chosen method is suitable for the assessment of thermodynamic data of triglycerides. A basic thermodynamic analysis of the reaction system was performed and the predictions of the derived thermodynamic model were compared to the experimental observations of rape-seed oil total hydrogenation into hydrocarbons. The model predictions were found to be in good agreement with experimental data. The estimations suggested that the reaction was limited by hydrogen diffusivity through the liquid film on catalyst particles. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Transesterification of Jatropha oil was carried out in t-butanol solvent using immobilized lipase from Enterobacter aerogenes. The presence of t-butanol significantly reduced the negative effects caused by both methanol and glycerol. The effects of various reaction parameters on transesterification of Jatropha oil were studied. Results: The maximum yield of biodiesel was 94% (of which 68% conversion was achieved with respect to methyl oleate) with an oil:methanol molar ratio of 1:4, 50 U of immobilized lipase/g of oil, and a t-butanol:oil volume ratio of 0.8:1 at 55°C after 48 h of reaction time. There was negligible loss in lipase activity even after repeated use for seven cycles. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on biodiesel synthesis using immobilized E. aerogenes lipase. © 2009 Kumari et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Avoided GHG emissions due to the substitution of conventional transport fuels with biofuels are then quantified. The studied biofuels are bioethanol from cereal crops and biodiesel from crude vegetable oil and waste vegetable oil. Several blends of these biofuels with gasoline and diesel are also studied. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of these fuels is carried out. The stakeholders were involved early in the process, setting the scope of the analysis and providing the relevant data. The results shown are GHG emissions in the production and distribution of these fuels. The benefits, in terms of GHG savings, of the adoption of the biofuel introduction objectives at the national and European levels are also quantified. © 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - A mini plant for transforming vegetable oils into biofuel, on a small scale, was developed by the Universidade de Brasília (UnB), associated to the Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (Embrapa). The technological route used was pyrolysis, that compared to the transesterification process, presented advantages of not required alcohol as reagent or sodium or potassium hydroxide as catalyst. The feedstock used for all tests was refined soybean oil. The main objective was to describe and to evaluate the mini plant instalation and operation, as well as the precautions and safety steps for its operation and maintenance. The mini plant underwent several physical changes and some aspects were optimized. The source for the heat system was changed, a new sealing system was developed to controlthe leakage on the distillation tower, a vegetable oil pre-heater was added to the process and solutions to minimize the volatile emissions in the environment were incorporated. For the mini plant safe operation and maintenance, individual protection equipments (IPEs) were listed and required. The mini plant is still being improved and after each new modification, the biofuel samples collected are getting closer to the technical specification, as well as the mini plant whole operation has been optimized. The biofuel viscosity is still out of specification of the Agência Nacional de Petróleo (ANP) for diesel fuel and new changes are being incorporated to the process to overcome this non-conformity.

AB  - Various government agencies around the world have proposed vegetable oils and their conversion to biodiesel as a renewable alternative to fossil fuels. Due to its adaptability to marginal soils and environments, the cultivation of Jatropha curcas is frequently mentioned as the best option for producing biodiesel. In the present work the current situation of proven and potential reserves of fossil fuel, and the production and consumption model for the same are analyzed, in order to later review the sustainability of the production process which begins with the cultivation of J. curcas, and culminates with the consumption of biodiesel. A review of the following topics is proposed in order to improve the sustainability of the process: areas destined for cultivation, use of external (chemical) inputs in cultivation, processes for converting the vegetable oil to biodiesel, and, above all, the location for ultimate consumption of the biofuel. © 2009 by the authors.

AB  - This paper reviews the progress and present status of biomass energy in Japan and introduces the newest research concerning bio-fuels. In addition, the reduction of carbon dioxide is briefly discussed. Japan is obliged under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to about 14 percent below 1990 levels by 2012. The Japanese gpverment's "Biomass Nippon" ("Nippon" means Japan in Japanese) was established in 2002. The target of this plan is to achieve a sustainable society through general biomass utilization based on market-based efforts. In August 2003, the law for "a warranty on volatile oil" was enacted in Japan. This law permits petrol to contain up to 3% ethanol and in March 2007, B5 (5% BDF blends in diesel oil) was permitted by the revision of this law. Because of the limited experience with ethanol blends and BDF blends in our country, research and experiment under various conditions will be necessary for the future acceptance of these fuels. It will also be necessary to provide information to fuel distributors and retainers, who have not had any experience with these blends.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to verify the hypothesis that to reduce income disparity among people in different regions and different income classes in a developing country, it is more effective to develop industries with links to the agricultural and industrial sectors than to pursue industry sophistication. In this paper, we selected as a case study Thailand, where industries have become highly sophisticated and automotive fuels are changing from fossil fuels to biofuels. We focus mainly on the biofuel industry, and showcase agricultural product processing and food processing, the petroleum products industry, and the textile and automobile industries. In order to verify the above hypothesis, we used multipliers of a SAMI-O linked model developed based on the year 2000 version of an input-output table to demonstrate how disparity among people in different regions and different income brackets may change the current social and economic structures of Thailand if these six industries equally expanded their exports. This model is made up of an 89×89 SAM dimension with the following two features: separation of production and household factors into two regions as they are segmented, and the separation of the oil refining sector of production activities into automotive fuels and other fuels, and further separation of automotive fuels into gasoline, ethanol, diesel and biodiesel. We obtained the following test results through inter-industry comparison of these six industries. First, spillover effects were found to be exerted on overall sectors including production activities, labor, capital and households to a larger extent by the biofuel, agrotechnical, and food processing industries, which are related to the agricultural sector, than by manufacturing industries such as textile, automobiles and petroleum products. This test result revealed that it is more effective to process agricultural products into industrial products and export them than to export industrial products such as textile products, automobiles and petroleum products. Next, the results for regional disparity demonstrated that industries related to the agricultural sector and the petroleum products industry reduce regional disparity, whereas the textile and automobile industries increase it. The biofuel industry has a greater effect on reducing regional disparity than any other industry in both the labor and capital sectors. Finally, the results covering disparity among people in different income brackets showed that the petroleum product industry exerts little impact on disparity among people in different income brackets, whereas the biofuel industry reduces disparity. However, this effect is no more than 1/2 or 1/3 of the effect exerted by the agrotechnical or food processing industries. Meanwhile, the textile and automobile industries widen this disparity. These findings verify the hypothesis that it is effective to develop industries with links to agricultural and industrial sectors to reduce income disparity in a developing country. As described, the industrialization model, which developing countries have adopted to achieve economic development, have not reduced disparity among people in different regions or in difference income brackets, rather the disparities have widened. In addition, the results demonstrate that disparity among people in different regions and different income brackets can be reduced more by export of biofuels, processed upland field crops and processed agribusiness products than export of products from the manufacturing sectors. © 2009, JAPAN SECTION OF THE REGIONAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL.

AB  - Bio-diesel is one of the most promising alternatives for diesel needs. Use of edible oil may create shortage of oil seeds for daily food, which necessitates identification of new kinds of non-edible vegetable oil. With this objective, the present work has focused on the performance of castor non-edible vegetable oil and its blend with diesel on a single cylinder, 4 stroke, naturally aspirated, direct injection, water cooled, eddy current dynamometer Kirloskar Diesel Engine at 1500 rpm for variable loads. Initially, castor neat oil and their blends were chosen. The physical and chemical properties of Castor oil were determined. In general, viscosity of neat vegetable oil is high, which can be reduced through blending with diesel and heating them. The heating temperature of the blends increases with the increase in the percentage of neat oils with diesel ranging from 70°C to 120°C before entering into the combustion chamber. The suitability of neat Castor oil and their blends are evaluated through experimentation. The performance and emission characteristics of engine are determined using Castor neat oil and their blends with diesel. These results are compared to those of pure diesel. These results are again compared to the other results of neat oils and their blends available in the literature for validation. By analyzing the graphs, it was observed that the performance characteristics are reduced and emission characteristics are increased at the rated load compared to those of diesel. This is mainly due to lower calorific value, high viscosity and delayed combustion process. From the critical analysis of graphs, it can be observed that 25% of neat Castor oil mixed with 75% of diesel is the best suited blend for Diesel engine without heating and without any engine modifications. It is concluded that castor non-edible oil can be used as an alternate to diesel, which is of low cost. This usage of neat bio-diesel has a great impact in reducing the dependency of India on oil imports. © Indian Society for Education and Environment (iSee).

AB  - The GERIPA project aimed at generating renewable energy integrated with food production has led to a beneficial option for producing ethanol and electricity. Ethanol has economic, social and environmental potential. Considering just the first one, Brazil consumes 39 billion litres per year-LD/yr of diesel oil, 18% of it being imported. The Federal Government has a recovery programme for the soybean agribusiness aimed at soybean biodiesel (SBD) production in which a 10% addition to diesel has been proposed. This 10% involves producing 10.7 million LSBD/d. Soybean bio-diesel production is not self-sustainable and such proposal could require an annual subsidy of up to US$1.33 billion. Soybean plantations would need about 10 to 12 times more land than is necessary for sugarcane plantations to produce the same equivalent thermal energy (ETE). Sixty-seven GERIPA projects (GP) producing 80,000 litres of ethanol per day (GP80) could be set up with the sum of US$1.33 billion; this would substitute current Brazilian biodiesel demand by 4.28%, adding the same value for each new subsidiary. Considering ETE, e-thanol-GP cost would be 37% to 50% below that for a litre of SBD on account of its raw material (RM) and region. The diesel cycle's thermal efficiency (η†) yield is around 50% and that of the Otto cycle engine η† is around 37%. The cost per km driven (CKD) by substituting SBD for ethanol-GP80 would thus indicate an 18% minimum and 59% maximum cost reduction for vehicle engines. © 2010.

AB  - The operation of vehicles causes damage to the environment through combusting fuels. Increasing motorisation and traffic results in an increased environmental impact, and the caused effects can be experienced locally and globally. The only solution that decreases environmental load without restricting mobility is the application of new environment friendly energy sources, which can be used and stored safely and which can be produced and applied in an environment friendly way. While trying to adapt to the changes caused by environment pollution the society and the people, who participate in transport need to modify their approach. The development of an environment conscious lifestyle in order to preserve the living-space of future generations is a common interest of all of us. The aim of this paper is the upper estimation of the environmental impact deriving from fossil and biofuel consumption in the case of diesel oil and gasoline driven motor vehicles. © Periodica Polytechnica 2009.

AB  - This paper presents the initial results of an experimental investigation of regulated and unregulated emissions of a boiler fueled with biodiesel and heating oil. In particular CO, SO2, NOx, particulate matter (PM), Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) and aldehydes emissions were examined. When using biodiesel, a strong reduction in CO and PM emissions was recorded with respect to home heating oil. The PAHs contained in the PM in the case of biodiesel were nearly 13 times less toxic than in the oil case; the formaldehyde, on the contrary, is nearly double for biodiesel. The VOCs were very low for both fuels. The results indicate there may be benefits to using biodiesel in home heating or in industrial processes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biomass derived vegetable oils are quite promising alternative fuels for agricultural diesel engines. Use of vegetable oils in diesel engines leads to slightly inferior performance and higher smoke emissions due to their high viscosity. The performance of vegetable oils can be improved by modifying them through the Transesterification process. In this present work, the performance of single cylinder water-cooled diesel engine using methyl-ester of Jatropha oil as the fuel was evaluated for its performance and exhaust emissions. The fuel properties of biodiesel such as kinematic viscosity, calorific value, flash point, carbon residue and specific gravity were found. Results indicated that B25 have closer performance to diesel and B100 had lower brake thermal efficiency mainly due to its high viscosity compared to diesel. The brake thermal efficiency for biodiesel and its blends was found to be slightly higher than that of diesel fuel at tested load conditions and there was no difference between the biodiesel and its blended fuels efficiencies. For Jatropha biodiesel and its blended fuels, the exhaust gas temperature increased with increase in power and amount of biodiesel. However, its diesel blends showed reasonable efficiencies, lower smoke, CO2, CO and HC.

AB  - Lipid fraction of biomass has been identified as carbon neutral substitution to fuels from fossil sources in the transportation sector. Although, the diesel engine, invented by Rudolph Diesel over a century ago first ran on peanut oil, the current combustion engines are designed to run on hydrocarbon fuels derived from petroleum. Therefore, a substitute for diesel fuel from renewable source will need to have identical or closely similar properties. The most popular of the existing technology for processing vegetable or animal oils is based on the conversion of the triglycerides constituents to fatty acids methyl esters (FAME). FAME technology does not produce diesel fuel with identical properties as petro-diesel. Other alternative processing routes are dilution of the vegetable oils, emulsification, pyrolysis and hydrotreating. These routes are discussed in this paper. Appropriate technologies for small scale production of diesel range hydrocarbon fuel from vegetable oil without the need for co-reactants such methanol or hydrogen as part of the feedstock is emphased. Also alternative catalyst systems in place of the expensive precious metal supported catalysts are suggested.

AB  - To address the constantly deteriorating situation of energy supply, the environment, and energy security, biodiesel is considered to be the most important biofuel of the future. However, the high cost of biodiesel inhibits it to become a viable alternative of petroleum-based fuel. As global demand for food is expected to double in next 50 years, food-based biodiesel appears to be an unwise choice. Therefore, biodiesel from lignocellulosic biowastes seems to be an attractive and promising alternative to crude oil because of its superior environmental benefits, economical competitiveness, and resource sustainability. More attention should be paid to microbial oil technology, as it needs virtually no additional farmland to convert agricultural residues and other lignocellulosic biomass into lipids.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative fuel produced by the transesterification of triglycerides from natural oils with an alcohol. This review discusses the basic requirements for diesel fuels and how biodiesel meets these requirements. This information is correlated to the chemistry of biodiesel production including reactants, products, and contaminants and the techno-economic tradeoffs between process variables. Finally, this review examines the ecological significance of biodiesel and how ecological, economic, and ideological considerations will affect the future of biodiesel production in the United States and Europe.

AB  - To minimize use of biodiesels synthesized from edible oils like Palm due to raising food versus fuel issue, Palm biodiesel (PBD) was blended with biodiesels derived from tree borne non-edible oil seeds Jatropha, and Pongamia to examine the effect on cloud point (CP) and pour point (PP) of PBD. Dependence of CP and PP on esters of fatty acid composition was also examined. Good correlations between CP and palmitic acid methyl ester (PAME) and between PP and PAME were obtained. A correlation between CP and total unsaturated fatty acid methyl ester (X) was also obtained and correlation between PP and X was also determined. Using these four correlations, cloud and pour points of different biodiesel blends can be determined. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The condition of finite and not renewable resource of fossil fuels, added to high atmospheric contamination in big populated centers, for the automotive park that participates in high proportion in the total consumption of primary energy have been unchaining factors for the promotion and study in the country of new energy or biofuels, starting from organic resources (vegetables or animals). Colombia is a vulnerable country in hydrocarbons in front of exploration programs limitations due to absence of new important discoveries and to decrease of its reserves. Consecuently, the country is "ad portas" of losing its oil self-sufficiency in the short term (2015 horizon) surround by an unfavorable conjuncture of high prices. Everything added to bad quality by the high content of sulphur, particularly in diessel, which overcomes widely the established international levels. To diversify energy sources, to avoid degraded climatic change and to draw social rejection to polluting energy, become important challenges so that science and technology contribute to a sustainable development, well-known and supported by the citizens.

AB  - High-altitude populations using biofuels for household energy may be at health risk due to a combination of altitudinal stress and indoor exposures to biomass smoke. In this article, the authors measure indoor and outdoor breathing level concentrations of PM2.5 and CO during periods of meal preparation in a convenience sample of homes above 3000 m in Cusco, Peru. From July 10 to 21, 2005, 237 measurements were taken during a pilot study at 41 residences. Results show the highest levels of PM2.5 and CO occurred during the early morning in the kitchen when dung and wood were used. Additionally, findings suggest that residential biomass fuel combustion in Cusco results in elevated indoor PM2.5 and CO exposure levels that are of potential human health concern, an issue that may be exacerbated by the physiological impact of living in a high-altitude environment. © 2009 Heldref Publications.

AB  - The expansion of production and the use of biofuels are determined by the legal acts of the European Commission and National legal acts encouraging such production and usage. It would be meaningful to use the mixtures of butanol and petrol in Otto engines. It was determined the possibility of producing biobutanol as a biofuel of the second generation from lignocellulose hydrolyzed to C5/C6 carbohydrates. If the 20-30% potential of lignocellulose biomass in Lithuania is used, it would be possible to produce 200-300 thousand t of biobutanol per year. The amount of carbon monoxide CO decreases by more than 80% when the engine works using the mixtures of petrol and butanol if compared to the CO amount of the engine working with petrol. When the engine works using the mixture of 30% butanol and petrol, the amount of carbon dioxide CO2 decreases by 4% on average, and in case it works with the mixture of 50% butanol and petrol - by 14% if compared to the CO 2 amount of the engine working using petrol. When the engine works using the mixture of 30% butanol and petrol, the amount of hydrocarbons HC decreases by 26% on average, and if it works with the mixture of 50% butanol and petrol, the amount increases by some 4% if compared to the HC amount of the engine working using petrol. To generalize the results of the performed experiment, it is possible to state that the optimal mixture would consist of 70% petrol and 30% biobutanol.

AB  - Using microturbine generator systems for distributed power generation has become the recent trend. To face the impact of the global energy crisis, one of the options is to use biofuels including biodiesel. To this end, this program is aimed to perform study on biodiesel microturbine testing and analysis. A 150kW microturbine generator set with twin rotating disk regenerators was used. Designed as a vehicular microturbine engine, the twin rotating ceramic disk regenerators dramatically improve fuel consumption by transferring heat energy from the exhaust gas stream to compressor discharge. This paper involved testing of the microturbine generator set at different load conditions using 10%∼30% biodiesel fuel. A software program was used to predict the performance of the microturbine generator set at different operating conditions in order to compare with the test results. Both biodiesel and petrodiesel fuels were used on the microturbine generator system in this study. The results showed that the predictions agreed very well with the experimental results. © Freund Publishing House Ltd.

AB  - In this research waste cooking oil from restaurants was used to produce pure biodiesel through transesterification, and this converted biodiesel was then used to prepare biodiesel/diesel blends. Experiments were performed on a four strokes, six cylinder, direct injection, and naturally aspirated diesel engine operating on 5%, 10%, 20% and 30% blends with Diesel fuel. The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of waste oil biodiesel inclusion in diesel fuel on the brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) of a higli speed diesel engine, its brake thermal efficiency, emission concentrations changes and temperature of the exhausts. At a higher speed of 1800 rpm, the bsfc of the fully loaded engine for the B20 blend is nearly the same as that for diesel fuel, whereas B30 suggests that bsfc is higher by 11.65%. The bsfc of blend B5 appeared to be nearly the same as that of blend B10, both of them having lower bsfc by 2.9% relative to Diesel fuel. The brake thermal efficiency depends actually on both the biodiesel inclusion percent in the diesel fuel and the engine performance conditions. The results indicate that higher than 10 vol % of biodiesel in diesel fuel lowers the fuel energy conversion efficiency for the biofuel. Emissions of NOx appear to increase with increasing biodiesel concentration in the blend, and at the highest load point, the biggest CO emission of 0.08 % vol was measured for diesel fuel, and the lowest of 0.05 % vol was obtained for blend B30, indicating more complete combustion with increasing biodiesel concentration in the blend due to its oxygenated nature. © Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University, Egypt.

AB  - atural abundance radiocarbon analysis facilitates distinct source apportionment between contemporary biomass/biofuel (14C "alive") versus fossil fuel (14C "dead") combustion. Here, the first compound-specific radiocarbon analysis (CSRA) of atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was demonstrated for a set of samples collected in Lycksele, Sweden a small town with frequent episodes of severe atmospheric pollution in the winter. Renewed interest in using residential wood combustion (RWC) means that this type of seasonal pollution is of increasing concern in many areas. Five individual/paired PAH isolates from three pooled fortnight-long filter collections were analyzed by CSRA: phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo[b+k]fluoranthene and indeno[cd]pyrene plus benzo[ghi]perylene; phenanthrene was the only compound also analyzed in the gas phase. The measured δ14C for PAHs spanned from-138.3‰ to 58.0‰. A simple isotopic mass balance model was applied to estimate the fractionbiomass (fbiomass) contribution, which was constrained to 71-87% for the individual PAHs. Indeno[cd]pyrene plus benzo[ghi]perylene had an fbiomass of 71%, while fluoranthene and phenanthrene (gas phase) had the highest biomass contribution at 87%. The total organic carbon (TOC, de-fined as carbon remaining after removal of inorganic carbon) fbiomass was estimated to be 77%, which falls within the range for PAHs. This CSRA data of atmospheric PAHs established that RWC is the dominating source of atmospheric PAHs to this region of the boreal zone with some variations among RWC contributions to specific PAHs.

AB  - Day- and nighttime aerosol samples were collected at an urban site in New Delhi, India, in winter 2006-2007. They were studied for low molecular weight dicarboxylic acids and related compounds, as well as total water-soluble organic carbon (TWSOC). High concentrations of diacids (up to 6.03 μg m -3), TWSOC, and OC were obtained, which are substantially higher than those previously observed at other urban sites in Asia. Daytime TWSOC/OC ratio (37%) was on average higher than that in nighttime (25%). In particular, more water-soluble OC (M-WSOC) to TWSOC ratio in daytime (50%) was twice higher than in nighttime (27%), suggesting that aerosols in New Delhi are photochemieally more processed in daytime to result in more water-soluble organic compounds. Oxalic acid (C2) was found as the most abundant dicarboxylic acid, followed by succinic (C4) and malonic (C3) acids. Contributions of C2 to M-WSOC were greater (av. 8%) in nighttime than daytime (av. 3%). Positive correlations of C2 with malic acid (hC4), glyoxylic acid (ωC2, and relative humidity suggest that secondary production of C2 probably in aqueous phase is important in nighttime via the oxidation of both longer-chain diacids and ωC2. C2 also showed a positive correlation with potassium (K+) in nighttime, suggesting that the enhanced C 2 concentrations are associated with biomass/biofuel burning. More tight, positive correlation between less water-soluble OC (L-WSOC) and K + was found in both day- and nighttime, suggesting that L-WSOC, characterized by longer chain and/or higher molecular weight compounds, is significantly influenced by primary emissions from biomass/biofuel burning.Copyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.

AB  - The thermal cracking and the thermal catalytic cracking of soybean oil were evaluated for the production of biofuels as an alternative to fossil fuels. The catalyst proposed for the cracking reaction was bauxite, a high-acidity and low-cost catalyst. The chromatographic profile of the biofuels obtained by cracking showed hydrocarbon compounds such as alkanes, alkenes and aromatics, as well as some oxygenated compounds such as carboxylic acids, ketones and alcohols. The products generated by the thermal catalytic cracking process showed better results than the thermal cracking products because of the low quantity of acids present. The catalyst used was thus shown to act in the secondary cracking process, in which the fatty acids decompose and generate hydrocarbons. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Concerns about climate change effects have prompted many countries to search for solutions to reduce fossil fuel consumption. In the last few years biodiesel production has gained world attention, as it is seen as a sustainable and renewable energy source. Biodiesel is a natural substitute for diesel oil, and can be obtained from different oleaginous plants. However, there are worries about devastation of forests and biodiversity-rich areas to produce biodiesel. Even considering biodiesel as a promising solution, the impacts of its production must be carefully evaluated. This work examines the Brazilian scenario for biodiesel production and use as an automotive fuel. Native and adapted oleaginous in many Brazilian regions and their potentiality for biodiesel production are presented. Experimental results of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from a diesel power generator fuelled by blends of diesel oil and castor oil or soybean biodiesel are also presented. © 2009 WIT Press.

AB  - To develop an advanced pyrolysis process for various biomass-derived feedstocks and improve product quality and yield, in-depth investigations into the reaction mechanisms are needed. This paper reports on pyrolysis experiments (Py-GC/MSD and FID) with model compounds including the sodium salts of stearic (C18), oleic (C18:1), and linoleic (C18:2) acids principally obtained from alkaline hydrolysis of vegetable oils. Of the parameters studied - temperature (450-750 °C), time (20 s and 80 s), and the degree of unsaturation (i.e., saturated and mono- and dienoic C18-hydrocarbon chains) - the latter had the most significant effect on the formation of volatile compounds detected in pyrolysates. The results indicated that in the case of sodium stearate, a homologous series of alkenes and alkanes was formed, whereas the pyrolysis of sodium oleate resulted mainly in aromatics, alkenes, and alkanes. In contrast, the most abundant liquefiable volatile products obtained from sodium linolate were aromatics and oxygen-containing compounds. In each case, an increase in temperature and time generally increased the quantity of products formed. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The important motivations for exploring alternative fuel resources are energy security, air pollution, and climate change; problems that are collectively calling into question the fundamental sustainability of the current energy system. Natural gas and bio fuels are seen as the most important short-term options for meeting these goals, whereas in the long run, a substantial contribution is expected to be delivered by hydrogen which would facilitate the transition from limited non-renewable stocks of fossil fuels to unlimited flows of renewable sources. Hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines with near-zero emissions and efficiencies exceeding today's port-fuel-injected (PFI) engines are a potential near-term option and a bridge to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles where fuel cell undergoes development to make it economically viable. The unique combustion properties of hydrogen make it an ideal choice for its use in compression ignition engines. The present work attempts to explore the performance and emission characteristics of an existing single cylinder four-stroke compression ignition engine operated in dual fuel mode with hydrogen as an alternative fuel. The hydrogen was premixed with the incoming air and inducted during the duration of intake valve opening by an indigenously developed electro-mechanical means of solenoid actuation The performance and emission characteristics with hydrogen-diesel blend and neat diesel are compared. In this experiment hydrogen flow rate was kept constant at 0.15 kg/hr. The brake thermal efficiency with hydrogen-diesel blend is about 15.7% greater than that of neat diesel operation at 40% rated load. CO, CO 2, HC and smoke emissions were significantly less with hydrogen-diesel blend. Smoke level was 41.6% lower than that of neat diesel operation at 80% load, whereas emission of CO2, CO, and HC levels were lower by 40.5%, 44.3% and 53.2% respectively for hydrogen enrichment at 80% load. In our present work EGR technique was examined in reducing NOx concentration. The NOx level decreased from 1211 ppm to 710 for hydrogen enrichment (0.15kg/hr) at 80% of the rated load. © 2009 WIT Press.

AB  - Biofuels have been recognised as one option for mitigating climate change. However, in order to show the sustainability of biomass-based fuels, an assessment of the savings in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions compared to fossil fuels needs to be clearly shown. There are two ways to measure the greenhouse impact of an activity. It can be done statically or dynamically, by using Global Warming Potential (GWP) or Radiative Forcing (RF) respectively. This article compares these two methods for assessing the greenhouse impact and introduces two more rarely discussed and lesser-known raw materials for biodiesel production, forest residues in Finland and jatropha in India, as well as their greenhouse impact compared to fossil fuel from a life cycle perspective. The analyses made with GWP and RF show some differences. Using a time horizon of 100 and 300 years, the magnitude of the greenhouse impact of jatropha biodiesel assessed with GWP and RF differs by only a few percent. When the greenhouse impact of forest residue-based Fischer-Tropsch (FT) diesel was assessed, the difference between the GWP and RF assessment was larger, up to 10%. This is also a reflection of the more accurate calculation possibility of the greenhouse impact with RF in which the exponential and time dependent decay of forest residues can be taken into account. Compared to fossil diesel, the greenhouse impact of jatropha and forest residue-based biodiesel was approximately one-third less, irrespective of the assessment method. This, however, may not be enough to fulfil the requirements of the European Union (EU) on the sustainability of biofuels. Copyright © 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - For conversion purposes, biomass can be classified into three main categories: homogeneous biomass (ex.: corn grains), quasi-homogeneous biomass (ex.: forest residues, straws and plantations in marginal lands) and non-homogeneous biomass (ex.: mixed forest residues, MSW, etc.). In North America homogeneous biomass costs (FOB plant) are over 100 $US/tonne in 2009 (anhydrous basis; 1 tonne = 18 GJ), therefore its conversion to biofuels requires subsidies. As well, alternate and added value uses (food and fibre) compete for such category of feedstock. Quasi-homogeneous biomass, whose cost (FOB plant) 30 - 60 $US/tonne in 2009 (anhydrous basis) for forest residues and straws and estimated between 80 and 100 $US/tonne for plantation biomass (i.e. willows, switchgrass, etc.), is suitable for bio-refineries aiming at co-products biofuels, green chemicals and fibres. However, the availability of large quantities of quasi-homogeneous residual biomass is strongly linked to the existing biomass industrial sector since mills processing sugar cane, corn, wheat and wood also have access to such biomass category whose competing use is the generation of bioenergy (process heat and, in some cases, power). It is however possible to integrate a pre-treatment (a better term is "fractionation") of the quasi-homogeneous biomass to produce useful fractions for biofuels, green chemicals and fibres while using the residual fractions for bioenergy. Non-homogeneous biomass is available in all urban centers of the planet and constitutes a major opportunity for biofuels and green chemicals since its cost is negative (i.e. it is a disposal cost paid by municipalities to landfills or incineration facilities) and a sustainable society ought to aim at zero residues. Non-homogeneous biomass can be prepared and converted into a homogeneous and clean syngas intermediate. The latter contains typically two thirds of the carbon in the feedstock and technologies to convert it into biofuels and green chemicals are being developed. © 2009 WIT Press.

AB  - It is believed that funding and backing of the clean development mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol could facilitate the biofuel industry to reach maturity and form a sustainable part of the world energy landscape. At present complete biofuels production systems are not eligible to receive financial support through the CDM. This is primarily due to the phenomenon of double counting, whereby more than one entity can claim credits for the same greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. Historically, CDM projects for some of the embedded projects in biodiesel production were assessed, but a comprehensive approach was not followed. It is envisaged that overcoming double counting in biofuel projects will in time evolve to a credible auditing system. With the possibility of double counting minimized comprehensive biodiesel, and biofuels, registered CDM projects will certainly increase. Six typical embedded CDM projects were identified in the complete biodiesel production assessment. The methodological frameworks were investigated. Approved methodologies exist for some of these embedded projects to claim emission reductions as certified emission reductions (CERs). Other embedded projects need new methodologies or the current applicability methodologies must be broadened. A comprehensive CDM approach to biodiesel production is subsequently proposed. Thereby a broader consolidation of all methodologies applicable to the production of biofuel/biodiesel may be achieved. This broader consolidation will lead to more complete CDM eligible biodiesel projects. © 2009 WIT Press.

AB  - Among all the various air pollution issues, greenhouse gases are the key environmental and global concern that the world is facing today. The European Union's project on Carbon Measurement Toolkit was developed to determine the greenhouse gas (GHG) intensities of products. This kind of evaluation is important for fast growing industrial nations, especially in assessing sources of alternative energy. Life cycle assessment or LCA is used to model the following fuels delivered to Singapore: foreign conventional fuel production; biofuels from palm oil grown in neighbouring countries (with 'worst' and 'best' cases of direct land use change); and biodiesel produced from used cooking oil in Thailand. The life cycle approach used in this article is similar to the method developed by the European Union's Carbon Measurement Toolkit. The case studies involve raw material production/plantation, processing and final delivery by long-distance transportation. The investigation highlights that despite being labelled as a "green" or "carbon neutral" source of renewable energy, the actual ability of biofuels (especially those made from crops) to reduce GHGs hangs delicately on several crucial factors, namely, direct land use change. © 2009 WIT Press.

AB  - The emissions of seventeen 2,3,7,8 substituted Polychlorinated Dibenzo-p-Dioxins, Polychlorinated Dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and sixteen Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) [14] in the exhaust pipes of spark ignition light duty vehicles considered toxic to human health were investigated. The formations of these compounds were evaluated under the influence of variations of fuels and fuel additives. Standard tests in a gasohol (gasohol is pure gasoline plus 20% to 25% of anhydrous ethyl alcohol fuel (AEAF)) vehicle and in an ethanol vehicle were performed with variations in the quality of fuels. The sampling of the PCDD/Fs followed the recommendations of a modified 23 method and the analysis basically followed the 8290 method. The recommendations of the TO-13 method were followed for the PAH analysis, with the necessary modifications for a vehicular emission laboratory. The emission factors of the total PCDD/Fs varied between undetected and 0.157 pg I-TEQ/km. The emission factors of the total PAH varied from 0.01 μg TEQ/km to 4.61 μg TEQ/km. Significant and positive correlations were observed between the emissions of naphthalene, acenaphthylene, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene and fluoranthene and significant and negative correlations were observed between the emissions of CO2 and fluoranthene in the gasohol vehicle. Significant and positive correlations between carbon monoxide and phenanthrene and between acenaphthylene, fluorene and fluoranthene in the alcohol vehicle were also observed, apart from significant and negative correlations between NOx and phenanthrene. In general way, significant correlations between PAH and PCDD/Fs were not observed, except in the ethanol vehicle considering phenanthrene. © 2009 WIT Press.

AB  - Biosolids contain nutrients, organic matters and micro-organisms that can provide soil benefits. In this study, toluene and naphthalene-contaminated soils were used to investigate the effect of applying biosolids on the enhancement of the biodegradation rate. The oxygen uptake rate (OUR) was determined with a respirometer and was used to calculate the oxygen uptake percentage of substrate in biosolids (αvalue) using a two-phase respirogram. Experimental result showed that the application of biosolids had positive effect on the enhancement of the biodegradation rate of toluene and naphthalene in the contaminated soils. The biodegradation rates of toluene and naphthalene were 15% and 20% in soils without applying biosolids, respectively. With the biosolids, its biodegradation rate for the two contaminants was about 4-fold higher in relative to control and the maximum value occurred in a soil to biosolids ratio as 1:0.5. The αvalue for toluene and naphthalene was in the levels of 10-20% which revealed that the biosolids used in this study was mainly composed by microorganism. © Triveni Enterprises.

AB  - A sustainable energy system includes energy efficiency, energy reliability, energy flexibility, fuel poverty, and environmental impacts. A sustainable biofuel has two favorable properties which are availability from renewable raw material, and its lower negative environmental impact than that of fossil fuels. Charcoal is produced by slow heating wood (carbonization) in airtight ovens or retorts, in chambers with various gases, or in kilns supplied with limited and controlled amounts of air. The charcoal yield decreased gradually from 42.6 to 30.7% for the hazelnut shell and from 35.6 to 22.7% for the beech wood with an increase of temperature from 550 to 1,150 K while the charcoal yield from the lignin content decreased sharply from 42.5 to 21.7% until it was at 850 K during the carbonization procedures. The charcoal yield decreases as the temperature increases. The ignition temperature of charcoal increases as the carbonization temperature increases. The charcoal briquettes that are sold on the commercial market are typically made from a binder and filler.

The four major constituent groups of gasoline are olefins, aromatics, paraffins, and napthenes. The main alternative fuels include alcohol, liquefied petroleum gas, compressed natural gas, hydrogen, and electricity for operation gasoline-type vehicles. Ethanol and methanol are biofuels that provide alternatives to gasoline. Bioethanol is a fuel produced by processing familiar and renewable crops such as cereals, sugar beet, and maize using natural fermentation. Blended with petrol at 10%, bioethanol can be used in vehicles without the need to change fuel or engine specifications.

AB  - Biofuels are liquid fuels which can be produced from agricultural biomass. Agriculture-based biofuels include bioethanol, biodiesel, biomethanol, methane, and bio-oil components. Various agricultural residues, such as grain dust, crop residues, and fruit tree residues, are available as the sources of agricultural energy. Bio-energy from biomass, both residues and energy crops, can be converted into modern energy carriers. Bioethanol is derived from renewable sources feedstock, which are typically plants such as wheat, sugar beet, corn, straw, and wood. Biodiesel is a non-fossil fuel alternative to petrodiesel which can be obtained from vegetable oil and animal fats by transesterification. Bio-oils are liquid or gaseous fuels made from biomass materials, such as agricultural crops, municipal wastes, and agricultural and forestry by-products via biochemical or thermochemical processes.

AB  - Global food and feed demands have been projected to double in the 21st century, which will further increase the pressure on the use of land, water and nutrients. At the same time, the political decisions to support renewable energy sources are accelerating the use of biomass, including grain, sugar, oilseed, and lignocellulosic crops for biofuel and power generation. Government directives - incited by climate change, high oil prices and geo-political tensions - promote partial replacement of fossil fuel by biofuels. Prices and availability of commodities used as staple food and feed are becoming already affected by the growing demand for bioenergy. Many implications of this demand for biofuel on the resource base (land, water, biodiversity), environment, rural economy, food prices and social impacts are unknown. The present study reviews and discusses the opportunities and limits of crops and resources for food, feed and biofuel production. There are gaps in our knowledge regarding the global capacity for sustainable plant-based bioenergy production, while maintaining food security; commercial biomass production will compete with food crops for arable land and scarce fresh water resources. The rapidly growing demand for food, feed and fuel will require a combination of further increases in crop yields (ca. 2% per annum) and a doubling or tripling of resource-use efficiencies, especially of nitrogen-use efficiency and water productivity in production systems with high external inputs, over the next 20 to 30 years. Adaptation of cropping systems to climate change and a better tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses by genetic improvement and by managing diverse cropping systems in a sustainable way will be of key importance. An integrated assessment of resource-use efficiencies, ecological services and economic profitability may guide the choice of crop species and cultivars to be grown in a target environment and region, depending on the added value for specific purposes: food, feed or fuel. To avoid negative impacts on food security, governments should give high priority to 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation technologies for bioenergy.

AB  - Soaring global food prices are threatening to push more poor people back below the poverty line; this will probably become aggravated by the serious challenge that increasing population and climate changes are posing for food security. There is growing evidence that human activities involving fossil fuel consumption and land use are contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and consequently changing the climate worldwide. The finite nature of fossil fuel reserves is causing concern about energy security and there is a growing interest in the use of renewable energy sources such as biofuels. There is growing concern regarding the fact that biofuels are currently produced from food crops, thereby leading to an undesirable competition for their use as food and feed. Nevertheless, biofuels can be produced from other feedstocks such as lingo-cellulose from perennial grasses, forestry and vegetable waste. Biofuel energy content should not be exceeded by that of the fossil fuel invested in its production to ensure that it is energetically sustainable; however, biofuels must also be economically competitive and environmentally acceptable. Climate change and biofuels are challenging FAO efforts aimed at eradicating hunger worldwide by the next decade. Given that current crops used in biofuel production have not been domesticated for this purpose, transgenic technology can offer an enormous contribution towards improving biofuel crops' environmental and economic performance. The present paper critically presents some relevant relationships between biofuels, food security and transgenic plant technology.

AB  - The article presents the technological aspects of the problems aimed at using alcohol biofuel mixtures in diesel engines kept in operation in Lithuania concerning a gradual replacement of fuel oils with biofuels. It is shown that three-component fuels such as D-RME-E possess the motor characteristics close to mineral diesel fuel. The use of the EC standardized rapeseed oil methyl esters RME as a solvent allows compensating the unfavorable motor characteristics of ethanol E and increasing the number of biocomponents in the fuel at the same time. The key aspects of research on the indicator process and the operating characteristics of diesel engines running on alcohol biofuel mixtures are substantiated.

AB  - Vehicles are burning fuels inefficiently. Nowadays, there is a strong correlation between CO2 emission and climate change. The article estimates a theoretical environmental impact of biofuel mixtures on the transport sector. A high ratio of road transportation in CO2 emission caused by humanity made necessary to research the estimation of the environmental impact of biofuel mixtures. We have to clarify the emission of the transport sector in order to get information about the role of the impact that is a further step to a sustainable society. Sustainable development is a kind of development where the pace of technical development, the satiation of increasing supply and the raw materials and resources of the Earth are poised so that the rate of living and the opportunities of the future generations should not decline. One of the major goals of transport policy of the European Union is sustainable mobility. For this reason, transportation systems must be developed and standardized and the effectiveness of transportation service must be increased while environmental pollution must be decreased or prevented. There is a justifiable demand put forward by the society to moderate the environmental impacts caused by road transportation. This article deals with modelling the environmental impact of ethanol-gasoline mixtures and diesel oil-ethanol-biodiesel mixtures.

AB  - This paper is drawn from a 2-year study of integrated pulpmill biorefineries based on black liquor (the lignin-rich byproduct of fiber extraction from wood) and wood residue gasification at a large kraft mill representative of those in the Southeast United States. The study included detailed mass-energy balance simulations, financial analyses, and energy and environmental benefits estimates for seven pulpmill biorefinery process configurations. All seven configurations include an oxygen-blown, high-temperature black liquor gasifier, syngas cooling, clean-up by a Rectisol (methanol) system, and a catalytic gas-to-liquid process; six of them also include a fluidized-bed, oxygen-blown biomass gasifier and a gas turbine combined cycle fully integrated with the gasification and syngas cooling section. Three biofuels were examined: dimethyl ether (DME), Fischer-Tropsch liquids, and ethanol-rich mixed-alcohols. For the integrated biorefineries analyzed here, the ratio of useful energy outputs (steam, electricity and fuels) to total energy inputs (black liquor, wood residuals and fuel oil) ranges from 66 to 74%; these values compare with about 57% for conventional systems based on Tomlinson boilers and 65% for gasification combined cycles that produce only electricity. Because of the integration of the biorefinery with the pulp and paper mill, the adjusted liquid fuel yield per unit of biomass - a measure of the effectiveness of biomass conversion to liquids - is far higher than for "stand-alone" gasification-based biorefineries or for ethanol production via biochemical conversion (based on enzymatic hydrolysis). Besides better energy performance, the integration between the biorefinery and the pulp mill effectively limits the specific capital investment associated with liquid fuels production to a surprisingly modest $60,000-150,000 per barrel of diesel equivalent per day-specific capital costs comparable to those for much larger coal-to-liquids facilities. Gasification-based pulp mill biorefinery technologies, once fully commercialized, offer the potential for attractive investment returns and, if implemented widely, significant energy and environmental benefits to the United States. © 2009 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable, biodegradable, environmentally benign, energy efficient, substitution fuel which can fulfill energy security needs without sacrificing engine's operational performance. Thus it provides a feasible solution to the twin crises of fossil fuel depletion and environmental degradation. The properties of the various individual fatty esters that comprise biodiesel determine the overall properties of the biodiesel fuel. In turn, the properties of the various fatty esters are determined by the structural features of the fatty acid and the alcohol moieties that comprise a fatty ester. Better understanding of the structure-physical property relationships in fatty acid esters is of particular importance when choosing vegetable oils that will give the desired biodiesel quality. By having accurate knowledge of the influence of the molecular structure on the properties determined, the composition of the oils and the alcohol used can both be selected to give the optimal performance. In this paper the relationship between the chemical structure and physical properties of vegetable oil esters is reviewed and engineering fatty acid profiles to optimize biodiesel fuel characteristics is highlighted. © IRSEN, CEERS, IAU.

AB  - Nb2O5/HX (X = HSO4-, H2PO4-, NO3-) compounds were obtained from the treatment of niobium acid (Nb2O5•xH2O) with sulfuric, phosphoric, and nitric acids as well as Nb2O5 and Nb2O5•xH2O have been investigated as catalysts for the transesterification, esterification and pyrolysis of vegetable oils. The compounds were characterized by thermal analysis (DTA-TGA), spectroscopy (DRX, FT-IR and FT-Raman), surface area (BET) and the acidity (Ho) determined by n-butylamine titration using the Hammet́s indicator method. It was observed that after the acid treatment both the surface area and the acidity decreased as compared to the starting Nb2O5•xH2O. The only exception was a higher acidity verified when nitric acid was used. Among the catalyst investigated, the Nb2O5/H3PO4 presented the highest activity in the alcoholysis of soybean oil with different mono-alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, n-butanol). All tested solids seemed to stabilize the carboxylic acids formed during the pyrolysis, yielding higher acid numbers for the obtained products. Finally, the use of Nb2O5/H3PO4 and Nb2O5/H2SO4 as catalysts for the esterification showed better activity than Nb2O5•xH2O and Nb2O5. © 2009 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.

AB  - According to proposed National Mission on biodiesel in India, we have undertaken studies on stability of biodiesel from tree borne non-edible oil seeds Jatropha. European biodiesel standard EN-14214 calls for determining oxidation stability at 110 °C with a minimum induction time of 6 h by the Rancimat method (EN-14112). Neat Jatropha biodiesel (JBD) exhibited oxidation stability of 3.95 h and research was conducted to investigate influence of presence of transition metals, likely to be present in the metallurgy of storage tanks and barrels, on oxidation stability of Jatropha methyl ester. It was found that influence of metal was detrimental to oxidation stability and catalytic. Even small concentrations of metal contaminants showed nearly same influence on oxidation stability as large amounts. Copper showed strongest detrimental and catalytic effect. The dependence of the oxidation stability on the type of metal showed that long-term storage tests in different types of metal containers for examining the influence of container material on oxidation stability of biodiesel may be replaced by significantly faster Rancimat test serving as an accelerated storage test. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The production of bio-oil via the slow pyrolysis of dissolved air flotation (DAF) skimmings from poultry processing is described. The raw DAF skimmings were characterized for physicochemical properties and for thermal behavior (TGA). The bio-oil was produced in a batch pyrolysis system at varying temperatures between 400 and 700 °C to study the effect of temperature on product yield. The fatty acids in the bio-oil produced displayed a high degree of saturation that caused the bio-oil to have poor cold flow properties (high cloud point and viscosity) so a solvent extraction scheme was devised to extract a bio-oil fraction rich in unsaturated fatty acids that could be further esterified into a bio-diesel and fatty nitriles that could be further processed into surfactants. This ethyl acetate-soluble fraction demonstrated much improved cold flow properties as well as lower water content and a higher HHV. The esterification of this soluble fraction was performed using methanol and sulfuric acid as an acid catalyst and the formation of fatty acid methyl esters was verified using GC/MS and FT-IR. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The dependence of the Hungarian economy on energy imports has already reached that degree, which is forecast in the EU for the average of the community by 2020.The total quantity of the biomass in Hungary is 350 - 360 mtons, out of which 105 - 110 mtons reproduces itself annualy. The energy content of the yearly produced biomass is as high as 1185 PJ, which is 5% more than the annual energy consumption. The renewable energies which are produced by agriculture could cover 10% of the energy demand of Hungary for a short term.At our College Faculty in Mezotúr we have been dealing with the application issues of vegetable oil derivates as fuels since 1990.

AB  - Periodically during petroleum shortage, fatty acids and their derivatives have been used as alternative fuels to those derived from petroleum. Different approaches have been proposed, including the use of neat fats and oils or their derivatives. Indeed, the utilization of biodiesel produced by alcoholysis of triacilglycerides or esterification of fatty acids, or hydrocarbons obtained from cracking of fatty materials were studied and used in several countries. Increasing concerns about energy security and climate changes have lead several countries, including Brazil, to start up biofuels programs. Different technologies are currently being developed in order to produce biofuels with economical feasibility. In this work are discussed alternative fatty raw-materials and processing technologies that are currently being studied in order to produce fuels suitable to sustainable substitute diesel fuel.

AB  - This paper presents a novel multi-time-stage input-output-based modeling framework for simulating the dynamics of bioenergy supply chains. One of the key assumptions used in the model is that the production level at the next time-stage of each segment of the energy supply chain adjusts to the output surplus or deficit relative to targets at the current time period. Furthermore, unlike conventional input-output models, the technology matrix in this approach need not be square, and thus can include coefficients denoting flows of environmental goods, such as natural resources or pollutants. Introducing a feedback control term enables the system to regulate the dynamics, thus extending the model further. This is an important feature since the uncontrolled dynamic model exhibits oscillatory or unstable behavior under some conditions; in principle, the control term allows such undesirable characteristics to be suppressed. Numerical simulations of a simple, two-sector case study are given to illustrate dynamic behavior under different scenarios. Although the case study uses only a hypothetical system, preliminary comparisons are made between the simulation results and some broad trends seen in real bioenergy systems. Finally, some of the main policy implications of the model are discussed based on the general dynamic characteristics seen in the case study. In particular, insights from control theory can be used to develop policy interventions to impart desirable dynamic characteristics to nascent or emerging biofuel supply chains. These interventions can be used to guide the growth of bioenergy supplies along final demand trajectories with minimal fluctuation and no instability. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The on-going climate change concerns have stimulated heavy interest in biofuels, and supporters of biofuels hail that they are considered naturally carbon-neutral. Critiques on the other hand cry that the large-scale production of biofuels can not only strain agricultural resources, but also threaten future food security. People who live in the drylands of India are often faced with challenges and constraints of poverty. Foremost among the challenges are the marginal environmental conditions for agriculture, often influenced by low and erratic rainfall, frequent droughts, poor soil condition, unreliable irrigation water supply, and rural migration to urban areas in search of work. In this paper, we have analyzed a case study of community lift irrigation practiced in India and its impact in boosting agricultural productivity and enhancing local food security. The lift-irrigation model practiced in the drylands of India to grow food crops can be adopted for the expansion of biofuel crops that has the potential to eradicate poverty among farming communities if appropriate sustainable development measures are carefully implemented. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the current status of biofuel development and estimates the potential of un-used land for biofuel development. The potential of crops including cassava, sweet potato, sweet sorghum, sugarcane, sugar beet and Jerusalem artichoke were assessed and discussed for different regions considering the geographical conditions and features of agricultural production. If reserved land resources are explored together with substitute planting implemented and unit area yield improved, potential production of ethanol fuel will be 22 million ton in 2020. The study also recommends the use of winter idle lands for rapeseed plantation for biofuel production. The potential for production of biodiesel by rapeseed and cottonseed can reach to 3.59 million ton. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents life-cycle-analysis (LCA) energy consumption (EC) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of China's current six biofuel pathways, which are: corn-derived ethanol (CE); cassava-derived ethanol (KE); sweet sorghum-derived ethanol (SE); soybean-derived bio-diesel (SB); jatropha fruit-derived bio-diesel (JB); and used cooking oil (UCO)-derived bio-diesel (UB). The tool utilized here is the WTW (Well-to-Wheels) module of Tsinghua-CA3EM model covering the entire lifecycle including: raw materials cultivation (or feedstock collection); fuel production; transportation and distribution; and application in automobile engines, compared with Conventional Petroleum-based gasoline and diesel Pathways (CPP). The results indicate: (1) the fossil energy inputs are about 1.0-1.5 times the energy contained in the fuel for the CE, SE and SB pathways, but 0.5-0.9 times for the KE, UB and JB pathways; (2) compared with CPP, the JB, KE and UB pathways can reduce both fossil fuel consumption and GHG emissions; the CE and SB pathways can only reduce fossil fuel consumption, but increase GHG emission; the SE pathway increases not only fossil fuel consumption but also GHG emission; and (3) the main factors inducing high EC and GHG emission levels include: high EC levels during the fuel production stage and high fertilizer application rates during the planting of raw feedstocks. Conclusions are that of the aforementioned biofuel pathways in China: (1) only the JB, KE and UB pathways have energy-saving merits as indicated by the LCA energy inputs and outputs; (2) compared with CPP, all but the SE pathway reduces fossil fuel consumption. However, the SB and CE pathway increase GHG emission; (3) all six displace petroleum by utilizing more coal; and (4) feedstock productivity levels must be increased, and there must be a reduction in fertilizer utilization and EC consumption during the cultivation and transportation stages in order to achieve the goals of energy balance and GHG emission reduction. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - India is expected to at least double its fuel consumption in the transportation sector by 2030. To contribute to the fuel supply, renewable energies such as jatropha appear to be an attractive resource for biodiesel production in India as it can be grown on waste land and does not need intensive water supply. In order to produce biodiesel at a competitive cost, the biodiesel supply chain - from biomass harvesting to biodiesel delivery to the consumers - is analyzed. A mixed integer linear programming model is used in order to determine the optimal number and geographic locations of biodiesel plants. The optimization is based on minimization of the costs of the supply chain with respect to the biomass, production and transportation costs. Three biodiesel blends are considered, B2, B5 and B10. For each blend, 13 scenarios are considered where yield, biomass cost, cake price, glycerol price, transport cost and investment costs are studied. A sensitivity analysis is carried out on both those parameters and the resulting locations of the plants. The emissions of the supply chain are also considered. The results state that the biomass cost has most influence on the biodiesel cost (an increase of feedstock cost increases the biodiesel cost by about 40%) and to a lower effect, the investment cost and the glycerol price. Moreover, choosing the right set of production plant locations highly depends on the scenarios that have the highest probability to occur, for which the production plant locations still produce a competitive biodiesel cost and emissions from the transportation are minimum. In this study, one set of plant locations happened to meet these two requirements. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study reviews the biofuel valorization facilities as well as the future importance of biorefineries. Biomass can be converted into useful biofuels and bio-chemicals via biomass upgrading and biorefinery technologies. A biorefinery is a facility that integrates biomass conversion processes to produce fuels, power, and chemicals from biomass. Biomass upgrading processes include fractionation, liquefaction, pyrolysis, hydrolysis, fermentation, and gasification. Upgraded bio-oil from biomass pyrolysis can be used in vehicle engines as fuel. The benefits of an integrated biorefinery are numerous because of the diversification in feedstocks and products. There are currently several different levels of integration in biorefineries which adds to their sustainability, both economically and environmentally. Economic and production advantages increase with the level of integration in the biorefinery. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel from palm oil has been considered for partial substitution of diesel fuel for transportation in Thailand. The Thai government recently has set up a production target of 8.5 million liters per day of palm oil-based biodiesel by 2011. The aim of this study is to investigate the energy consumption of palm methyl ester (PME) production in Thailand using a life cycle approach compared to other possible oil crops for biodiesel production including jatropha and coconut. The main contributors to the energy use are cultivation, oil production, transesterification and transportation. Taking into account only fossil fuel or petroleum inputs in the production cycle, the energy analysis provides results in favour of PME in Thailand. The net energy balance (NEB) and net energy ratio (NER) of PME and co-products are 100.84 GJ/ha and 3.58, respectively. The NER of PME without co-products is 2.42, which is still higher than one indicating a favourable result. The results are important in selecting an appropriate feedstock for biodiesel production and this study will support policy makers in the energy sector to make informed decisions vis-à-vis promotion of oil palm plantation for biodiesel. This will also support the Thai government in its policy to promote the use of indigenous and renewable sources for transportation fuels. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Current energy policies address environmental issues including environmentally friendly technologies to increase energy supplies and encourage cleaner, more efficient energy use, and address air pollution, greenhouse effect, global warming, and climate change. The biofuel policy aims to promote the use in transport of fuels made from biomass, as well as other renewable fuels. Biofuels provide the prospect of new economic opportunities for people in rural areas in oil importer and developing countries. The central policy of biofuel concerns job creation, greater efficiency in the general business environment, and protection of the environment. Projections are important tools for long-term planning and policy settings. Renewable energy sources that use indigenous resources have the potential to provide energy services with zero or almost zero emissions of both air pollutants and greenhouse gases. Biofuels are expected to reduce dependence on imported petroleum with associated political and economic vulnerability, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants, and revitalize the economy by increasing demand and prices for agricultural products. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - About 72 million households in rural India do not have access to electricity and rely primarily on traditional biofuels. This research investigates how rural electrification could be achieved in India using different energy sources and what the effects for climate change mitigation could be. We use the Regional Energy Model (REM) to develop scenarios for rural electrification for the period 2005-2030 and to assess the effects on greenhouse gas emissions, primary energy use and costs. We compare the business-as-usual scenario (BAU) with different electrification scenarios based on electricity from renewable energy, diesel and the grid. Our results indicate that diesel systems tend to have the highest CO2 emissions, followed by grid systems. Rural electrification with primarily renewable energy-based end-uses could save up to 99% of total CO2 emissions and 35% of primary energy use in 2030 compared to BAU. Our research indicates that electrification with decentralised diesel systems is likely to be the most expensive option. Rural electrification with renewable energy tends to be the most cost-effective option when end-uses are predominantly based on renewable energy, but turns out to be more costly than grid extensions when electric end-use devices are predominantly used. This research therefore elaborates whether renewable energy is a viable option for rural electrification and climate change mitigation in rural India and gives policy recommendations. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Looming concerns on rising food prices and food security has slowed down the impetus in biofuel production. The development of the sub-sector, however, remains an important agenda among developing countries like those of the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) that have abundant labour and natural resources but have limited supply of fossil fuels which continues to serve as a constraint to economic growth. Five crops have been selected to be further developed and use for biofuel production in the GMS, namely sugarcane, cassava, oil palm, sweet sorghum and Jathropa curcas. The expanded use of sugarcane, cassava, and oil palm for biofuel production can cause problems in the food sector. The other two crops, sweet sorghum and J. curcas, are non-food crops but could still compete with the food crops in terms of resource use for production. In all cases, the GMS needs to formulate a sustainable strategy for the biofuel development that will not compete with the food sector but will rather help achieve energy security, promote rural development and protect the environment. Except for People's Republic of China (PRC) and Thailand that already have fairly developed biofuel sub-sector, the other GMS countries are either poised to start (Lao PDR and Cambodia) or ready to enhance existing initiatives on biofuel production (Myanmar and Vietnam), with support from their respective governments. Biofuel development in these countries has to be strongly integrated with smallholder producers in order to have an impact on improving livelihood. At this initial stage, the sub-sector does not need to compete on a price basis but should rather aim to put up small-scale biofuel processing plants in remote rural areas that can offer an alternative to high-priced diesel and kerosene for local electricity grids serving homes and small enterprises. The social and economic multiplier effects are expected to be high when farmers that produce the energy crops also produce the biofuels to generate affordable and reliable energy. To make this happen, there is a need for conscious effort and investment support from development agencies and the government working in partnership with the private sector, research institutions and the farmers. © 2009.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to provide a broad overview of the social and environmental costs and benefits of biofuels in Asia. The major factors that will determine the impacts of biofuels are: (1) their contribution to land-use change, (2) the feedstocks used, and (3) issues of technology and scale. Biofuels offer economic benefits, and in the right circumstances can reduce emissions and make a small contribution to energy security. Feedstocks that involve the conversion of agricultural land will affect food security and cause indirect land-use change, while those that replace forests, wetlands or natural grasslands will increase emissions and damage biodiversity. Biofuels from cellulose, algae or waste will avoid some of these problems, but come with their own set of uncertainties and risks. In order to ensure net societal benefits of biofuel production, governments, researchers, and companies will need to work together to carry out comprehensive assessments, map suitable and unsuitable areas, and define and apply standards relevant to the different circumstances of each country. The greatest benefits may come from feedstocks produced on a modest scale as co-products of smart technologies developed for phytoremediation, waste disposal and emissions reduction. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The feed back experience of using straight vegetable oil (SVO) as a fuel in the existing diesel engines evidences the need for fitting several physical properties, among them the fuel viscosity. An empirical modelling is proposed in order to interpolate viscosity to any kind of diesel oil/SVO blend. This model is fitted on an experimental viscosity database on blends, varying the SVO mass proportion in the blend, the blend temperature between cloud point and 353 K, and including six vegetable oils varying the fatty acids composition. Extrusion rheology was also checked by varying the pressure drop. Measurements show that blends behave Newtonian. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The European production of Vegetable Oil Methyl Esters (VOMEs), a biofuel used for diesel engines, is booming. Together with that expansion, there is an increase in the available amounts of glycerol, which is the main by-product of that biofuel. Against that background, the SIMP (Syndicat interdé partemental pour lassainissement de l'agglomération parisienne) has conducted experiments on both laboratory (reactor tests) and industrial (tests at the Seine Centre wastewater treatment plant - 800,000 equivalent inhabitants] scales in order to determine whether that compound could be used as a carbon source in the wastewater denitrification step. These R&D works revealed that the purification performance achieved with that substrate is similar to that resulting from methanol, which is currently used in the wastewater plants. On the other hand, the industrial tests demonstrated that injecting glycerol into the biofiltration units results in an excessive clogging of the filter masses, which is detrimental to a good working order of the structures. That clogging is related to the colonization of the filter masses by a dense and cohesive network of mycelian filaments, particularly of Geotrichum candidum and Mucor hiemalis fungus species. The operational issues raised by these filamentous organisms happen to be definitely harmful and it seems they preclude the use of glycerol as a carbon source in the denitrification units involving a biofiltration step.

AB  - Residue of methanolic extract of Egyptian Jatropha curcas contains bioactive substances such as phenolic compounds, which succeeded to be used as natural antioxidants for the protection of oils and their corresponding biodiesel against oxidative deterioration. In the present work, the residue of Jatropha roots were extracted with methanol and resulting residues, were investigated regarding their content of total phenolic compounds by folin-Cioalteau assay. Further, the antioxidant activities of the extracts were characterized by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical method and proved remarkable results. Oxidation stability of Jatropha oil, used fried oil and olive oil and their corresponding biodiesel obtained by conventional transesterification were tested using thermal oxidation. Natural antioxidants such as (α-trocopherol), synthetic antioxidants as butylated hydroxytoluene and natural Jatropha root extract were used in the present study in comparison to investigate their addition effect on the oxidative stability of oils and their corresponding biodiesel. In the rapied thermal treatment test, results showed that addition of butylated hydroxytoluene 0.25 % was able to stabilize Jatropha oil 6 h, but poorly stabiliz biodiesel. Addition of 0.25 % αa-trocopherol to Jatropha oil showed less oxidation stability after 2 h thermal treatment. Crude root extract addition at 0.25% to Jatropha oil showed good stability up to 4 h thermal treatment while addition of root extract at 0.25 % to biodiesel showed better stability up to 6 h thermal treatment. Besides addition of 220 ppm crude root extract to biodiesel was enough sufficient to occure oxidative stabilization. Also Jatropha root residue addition at 400 ppm was effective antioxidant for fresh Jatropha oil. © IRSEN, CEERS, IAU.

AB  - The rapid upward shift in ethanol demand has raised concerns about ethanol's impact on the price level and volatility of agricultural commodities. The popular press attributes much of this volatility in commodity prices to a price bubble in ethanol fuel and recent deflation. Market economics predicts not only a softening of demand to high commodity prices but also a positive supply response. This volatility in ethanol and commodity prices are investigated using cointegration, vector error corrections (VECM), and multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedascity (MGARCH) models. In terms of derived demand theory, results support ethanol and oil demands as derived demands from vehicle-fuel production. Gasoline prices directly influence the prices of ethanol and oil. However, of greater significance for the fuel versus food security issue, results support the effect of agricultural commodity prices as market signals which restore commodity markets to their equilibriums after a demand or supply event (shock). Such shocks may in the short-run increase agricultural commodity prices, but decentralized freely operating markets will mitigate the persistence of these shocks. Results indicate in recent years there are no long-run relations among fuel (ethanol, oil and gasoline) prices and agricultural commodity (corn and soybean) prices. © 2009 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The influences of different blending percentages of biodiesel on the size distributions of particulate matter (PM) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are not well known. In this study, commercial pure petroleum-based diesel (D100) and three biodiesel blends of 20% (B20), 60% (B60), and 100% (B100) were tested in an engine operated on a dynamometer following the US transient-cycle test procedure. PM size distributions were measured with micro-orifice uniform deposit impactor (MOUDI) and Nano-MOUDI of 0.01-10 m aerodynamic diameter. The collected samples were extracted then analyzed for PAHs by GC/MS. The results revealed that PM emissions decrease apparently as the blending percentages of biodiesel increase. For D100, B20, B60 and B100, PAH emission factors were 3704, 2720, 1709 and 1514 μg/Hph (horsepower per hour), respectively. Increasing the biodiesel blending percentage reduces the emission of both PAHs and PM. As the blending fractions of biodiesel increased, the PM emissions for the four size ranges decreased. The reductions were significant especially for ultrafine (41.3%) and fine (44.8%) PM. The PAH mass was 32.5%, 32.6%, 34.5%, 30.0% in the ultra-fine size range and 23.8%, 24.3%, 29.2%, 34.5% in the nano size range for D100, B20, B60 and B100, respectively. The addition of biodiesel would cause higher percentages of ultra-fine and nano particulates in exhaust gas. For most biodiesel blending mixtures in the four size ranges, the percentages of PAH emission reduction were higher than those of PM emission. The reduction percentages reached 45.1% and 63.7% for B60, 66.5% and 68.3% for B100, respectively in ultrafine and fine size ranges. The BaPeq emission factors for B100 were 27.2, 49.5, 74.2 and 13.0 (xg/Hph in nano, ultrafine, fine and coarse size ranges. Biodiesel can reduce both PAH emission factors and the PAH corresponding carcinogenic potency in the full size ranges.

AB  - Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines are amenable to a large variety of fuels as long as the fuel can be fully vaporized, mixed with air, and receive sufficient heat during the compression stroke to reach the autoignition conditions. This study investigates an HCCI engine fueled with ethanol-in-water mixtures, or "wet ethanol". The motivation for using wet ethanol fuel is that significant energy is required for distillation and dehydration of fermented ethanol (from biosources, not from petroleum), thus direct use of wet ethanol could improve the associated energy balance. Recent modeling studies have predicted that an HCCI engine can operate using fuel containing as little as 35% ethanol-in-water with surprisingly good performance and emissions. With the previous modeling study suggesting feasibility of wet ethanol use in HCCI engines, this paper focuses on experimental operation of a 4-cylinder 1.9-L engine running in HCCI mode fueled with wet ethanol. This paper investigates the effect of the ethanol-water fraction on the engine's operating limits, intake temperatures, heat release rates, and exhaust emissions for the engine operating with 100%, 90%, 80%, 60%, and 40% ethanol-in-water mixtures. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Even after biodiesel meets ASTM D6751 specifications, biodiesels from different feedstocks may have different properties. Biodiesel blend level influences the fuel properties, such as cloud point and emissions. Therefore, whether for performance reasons or other reasons, it is often required to detect the biodiesel percentage in a diesel-biodiesel blend. This research used a spectrophotometer to scan the blends of U.S. No. 2 diesel and biodiesel from three different feedstocks (rapeseed, soybean. and mustard oil) in the visible wavelength range of 380-530 nm. It was found that the shape of the absorption curve varied according to biodiesel feedstock; however, relative absorbance was proportional to the blend level. If the absorbance of the parent biodiesel can be measured, such as in a blending facility, then a single wavelength between 470 and 490 nm could be used to measure the biodiesel blend level with ±1.85% standard error at 95% confidence interval. A neural network was trained to measure the blend level when the parent biodiesel spectrum was unknown. It was concluded that even if the absorption spectrum of the parent biodiesel is not known, the absorption spectrum of the blend from 380-530 nm can be used along with a neural network to detect the biodiesel feedstock and for rough blend level estimation. © 2009 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - This paper proposes a methodology for thermodynamic model analysis of Jatropha biodiesel engine in combination with Taguchi's optimization approach to determine the optimum engine design and operating parameters. A thermodynamic model based on two-zone Weibe's heat release function has been employed to simulate the Jatropha biodiesel engine performance. Among the important engine design and operating parameters 10 critical parameters were selected assuming interactions between the pair of parameters. Using linear graph theory and Taguchi method an L16 orthogonal array has been utilized to determine the engine test trials layout. In order to maximize the performance of Jatropha biodiesel engine the signal to noise ratio (SNR) related to higher-the-better (HTB) quality characteristics has been used. The present methodology correctly predicted the compression ratio, Weibe's heat release constants and combustion zone duration as the critical parameters that affect the performance of the engine compared to other parameters. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this article is to analyze the Brazilian Biodiesel Policy (PNPB) and to identify the social and environmental aspects of sustainability that are present or absent within it. Biofuels, namely alcohol and biodiesel, have been increasing in popularity on a global scale due to their potential as alternative and renewable energy sources. Brazil, a vast country blessed with abundant natural resources and agricultural land, has emerged as a global leader in the production of biofuels. This article includes a brief analysis of the concept of sustainable development, which served as a basis to evaluate the Policy documents. Although PNPB's implementation, which began in 2004, is still within its initial stage, it was possible to identify and elaborate on the environmental and social aspects of the Policy, namely: the social inclusion of family farmers; regional development; food security; influencing the carbon and energy balance of biodiesel; promoting sustainable agricultural practices and a diversity of feedstock. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pure Vegetable Oil (PVO) is a 100% renewable fuel obtained from oil crops. PVO can be produced in a distributed manner in rural areas and commercial technologies almost exist for energy and transports, making possible to develop small scale chains, suitable for both industrialised as well as developing countries. The aim of the research work is to investigate over a three-year period the complete PVO chain under Italian conditions, i.e., crop selection, plantation and harvesting, seed drying and storage, oil extraction, cake (coproduct) valorisation and PVO use in small generators, cogenerators,micro gas turbines and greenhouse/school heating systems, supporting experimental work with environmental and socio-economic studies. The aim of the present paper is to present the results obtained at the end of the first year, as regards oil production in both cold decentralised systems and industrial systems, as well testing of the oil in a modified tractor. The PVO produced in the cold press met the current DIN specifications for PVO in engines and the performance of the tractor was very similar to standard tractors. © 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The support of sustainable energy innovations has become a dominant topic on the political agenda of many countries. Providing this support remains difficult, since the processes constituting such innovation trajectories are poorly understood. To increase insight in such processes, this paper takes the historical development of biofuels in the Netherlands as the topic of study. Special attention is paid to the simultaneous development of two technology generations within the field: a first generation (1G) and a second generation (2G) of biofuels. A critical question asked is whether deployment programmes for a 1G technology may have positive effects on the development of later generations. Two archetypical support strategies are identified: one is to keep investing in R&D concerning 2G technology, where the expected outcome is a fast move from one technology generation to the other. The other strategy is to focus on learning-by-doing in the 1G technology. In that way progress can be made in 1G technologies but the effects on 2G technologies are uncertain. We apply a Technological Innovation System perspective to analyse the strategies followed and their effects. From the results we draw lessons of relevance for practitioners who aspire to understand and influence emerging energy technologies. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Seed morphological characters, oil content in fruit, physical and chemical properties and fatty acid composition and relative content of seed oil of Pistacia chinensis Bunge from ten provenances were studied. The results show that there are significant differences in seed morphological characters among different provenances (P <0. 05). The 1 000-seed weight is 29. 22-39. 90 g. The length and width of seed are 4.47-5. 17 mm and 4. 15-4. 92 mm with a length-width ratio of 1. 02 - 1. 13. There are extremely significant differences in oil content of different parts of fruit among the ten provenances (P < 0.01), and average oil content of fruit, flesh and kernel is 29. 61% - 38. 61% , 40.38%-64. 54% and 44. 81%-55. 97% , respectively. Oil content in fruit from Pengze of Jiangxi, Shangluo of Shaanxi and Shilin of Yunnan is higher. The physical and chemical properties of seed oil have extremely significant differences (P <0.01) among different provenances, and the refractive index is 1.469 6 - 1.475 1, iodine value 748-924 g · kg-1, acid value 9. 7-79. 7 mg · g-1 and water content 0. 12% - 1. 40% . Seven fatty acids are detected from the seed oil of P. chinensis, including palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid and arachidic acid, in which the total relative content of unsaturated fatty acids is up to 73.97%-87.41%. The result of comprehensive analysis indicates that P. chinensis seeds from Pengze of Jiangxi are big and plump and can be used as good seed resources of biofuel materials. Otherwise, with high unsaturated fatty acid content, seeds from Shilin of Yunnan, Chuzhou of Anhui and Shangluo of Shaanxi are suitable seed resources of edible oil materials.

AB  - Ethanol production from cellulosic sources such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) requires the use of natural resources, fossil fuels, electricity, and human-derived goods and services. We used emergy accounting to integrate the ultimate amount of environmental, fossil fuel, and human-derived energy required to produce ethanol from switchgrass. Emergy is the total amount of energy of one form required directly and indirectly to make another form of energy. Forty-four percent of required emergy came from the environment either directly or embodied in purchased goods, 30% came from fossil fuels either directly or embodied in purchased goods, and 25% came from human-derived services indirectly. Ethanol production per petroleum use (emergy/emergy) was 4.0-to-1 under our Baseline Scenario, but dropped to 0.5-to-1 under a scenario that assumed higher input prices, lower conversion efficiencies and less waste recycling. At least 75% of total emergy was from non-renewable sources. Energy 'hidden' in indirect paths such as goods and services was 65% of the total. Cellulosic-ethanol is not a primary fuel source that substitutes for petroleum because its production relies heavily on non-renewable energy and purchased inputs. It is a means for converting natural resources to liquid fuel. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, a substitute fuel for diesel engines was produced from inedible animal tallow and its usability was investigated as pure biodiesel and its blends with petroleum diesel fuel in a diesel engine. Tallow methyl ester as biodiesel fuel was prepared by base-catalyzed transesterification of the fat with methanol in the presence of NaOH as catalyst. Fuel properties of methyl ester, diesel fuel and blends of them (5%, 20% and 50% by volume) were determined. Viscosity and density of fatty acid methyl ester have been found to meet ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 specifications. Viscosity and density of tallow methyl esters are found to be very close to that of diesel. The calorific value of biodiesel is found to be slightly lower than that of diesel. An experimental study was carried out in order to investigate of its usability as alternative fuel of tallow methyl ester in a direct injection diesel engine. It was observed that the addition of biodiesel to the diesel fuel decreases the effective efficiency of engine and increases the specific fuel consumption. This is due to the lower heating value of biodiesel compared to diesel fuel. However, the effective engine power was comparable by biodiesel compared with diesel fuel. Emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and smoke opacity were reduced around 15%, 38.5%, 72.7% and 56.8%, respectively, in case of tallow methyl esters (B100) compared to diesel fuel. Besides, the lowest CO, NOx emissions and the highest exhaust temperature were obtained for B20 among all other fuels. The reductions in exhaust emissions made tallow methyl esters and its blends, especially B20 a suitable alternative fuel for diesel and thus could help in controlling air pollution. Based on this study, animal tallow methyl esters and its blends with petroleum diesel fuel can be used a substitute for diesel in direct injection diesel engines without any engine modification. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Despite, that ethanol is intended to be used especially in the spark ignition engines; there is a possibility to be used even in the compression ignition engines after specific modification. The biggest problem during the using ethanol in the compression ignition engines is posed by its low combustibility (cetane number 8). For this reason the engine and fuel must be modified to get required fuel ignition. The possibilities of how to use ethanol in the compression ignition engines can divide in several groups. Mostly use possibility is a motor modification and special fuel additivation increasing its cetane number. The other possibility is to use dual-fuel system, where the ethanol is transported separately and ignition is made by diesel injection. The simplest possibility is addition ethanol right into the diesel. This possibility has a problem with difficult miscibility ethanol with diesel. Over this difficulty, the results of the test reflect positive contribution of addition ethanol into the naphtha.

AB  - Ignition studies of two C5 esters were performed using a rapid compression facility. Methyl butanoate and ethyl propanoate were chosen to have matching molecular weights and C:H:O ratios while varying the length of the constituent alkyl chains. The effect of functional group size on ignition delay time was investigated using pressure time-histories and high-speed digital imaging. Low-temperature, moderate-pressure conditions were selected for study due to the relevance to low temperature combustion strategies and internal combustion engine conditions. The experiments covered a range of conditions: T=935-1117 K, P = 4.7-19.6 atm, and Φ = 0.3-0.4. The experimental data are compared to previous high temperature studies and chemical modeling. A new mechanism for methyl butanoate and ethyl propanoate ignition is presented. The modeling and experimental data are in excellent agreement for methyl butanaote and yield good agreement for ethyl propanoate. © 2009 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Biofuels are attractive alternatives to petroleum derived transportation fuels. n-Butanol, or biobutanol, is one alternative biofuel that can replace gasoline and diesel in transportation applications. Similar to ethanol, n-butanol can be produced via the fermentation of sugars, starches, and lignocelluloses obtained from agricultural feedstocks. n-Butanol has several advantages over ethanol, but the detailed combustion characteristics are not well understood. This paper studies the oxidation of n-butanol in a jet stirred reactor at 10 atm and a range of equivalence ratios. The profiles for CO, CO2, H2O, H2, C1-C4 hydrocarbons, and C1-C4 oxygenated compounds are presented herein. High levels of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water, hydrogen, methane, formaldehyde, ethylene, and propene are detected. The experimental data are used to validate a novel detailed chemical kinetic mechanism for n-butanol oxidation. The proposed mechanism well predicts the concentration of major product species at all temperatures and equivalence ratios studied. Insights into the prediction of other species are presented herein. The proposed mechanism indicates that n-butanol consumption is dominated by H-atom abstraction from the α, β, and γ carbon atoms. A sensitivity analysis is also presented to show the effects of reaction kinetics on the concentration of several poorly predicted species. © 2009 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Efforts are under way to reduce diesel engine emissions (DEE) and their content of carcinogenic and mutagenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Previously, we observed reduced PAH emissions and DEE mutagenicity caused by reformulated or newly developed fuels. The use of rapeseed oil as diesel engine fuel is growing in German transportation businesses and agriculture. We now compared the mutagenic effects of DEE from rapeseed oil (RSO), rapeseed methyl ester (RME, biodiesel), natural gas-derived synthetic fuel (gas-to-liquid, GTL), and a reference petrodiesel fuel (DF) generated by a heavy-duty truck diesel engine using the European Stationary Cycle. Mutagenicity of the particle extracts and the condensates was tested using the Salmonella typhimurium mammalian microsome assay with strains TA98 and TA100. The RSO particle extracts increased the mutagenic effects by factors of 9.7 up to 17 in strain TA98 and of 5.4 up to 6.4 in strain TA100 compared with the reference DF. The RSO condensates caused up to three times stronger mutagenicity than the reference fuel. RME extracts had a moderate but significantly higher mutagenic response in assays of TA98 with metabolic activation and TA100 without metabolic activation. GTL samples did not differ significantly from DF. Regulated emissions (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter) remained below the limits except for an increase in NOx exhaust emissions of up to 15% from the tested biofuels.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the operation of a commercially manufactured research-scale downdraft gasifier, the Renewable Fuel Gas Generator, Community Power Corporation, Littleton, Colorado. An experimental study of hardwood chip gasification was run under various operating conditions to determine the effects on the syn-gas (synthesis gas) produced in the process. The resulting syn-gas had an average LHV (low heating value) of 5.79 ±0.52 MJ Nm -3 (Nm 3 stands for normal cubic meter, i.e., volume of a gas measured at standard temperature and pressure), tar concentration of 14.06 ±8.54 mg Nm -3, and particulate concentration of 3.05 ±1.79 mg Nm -3. Syn-gas at this level of quality is acceptable for use as a fuel for internal combustion engines and also for other purposes. The process was also very efficient, with a hardwood conversion rate of 2.37 ±0.24 Nm 3 kg -1 and a carbon conversion rate of 98.01% ±0.53%. The gasifier's grate temperature had no evident effects on syn-gas quality and conversion rate within a range of 740°C to 817°C. The particulate contents in pre-filter syn-gas significantly increased when the gas flow rate changed from 36 to 56 Nm 3 h -1, but no other syn-gas attributes were significantly affected by gas flow rate. When the moisture content of hardwood chips increased, tar content of post-filter syn-gas significantly increased and CO content significantly decreased, but no other attributes were affected. Overall the system, which has extensive electronic controls based on temperatures and pressures at numerous locations, produced a remarkably consistent high-quality syn-gas regardless of input parameters. © 2009 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - A key barrier limiting extended utilization of biodiesel is higher NOx emissions compared to petrodiesel fuels. The reason for this effect is unclear, but various researchers have attributed this phenomena to the higher liquid bulk modulus associated with biodiesel and the additional heat released during the breaking of C-C double bonds in the methyl ester groups. In this study, water was incorporated into neat biodiesel (B100) as an emulsion in an attempt to lower NOx and particulate matter (PM) emissions. A biodiesel emulsion containing 10wt% water was formulated and evaluated against an ultra-low-sulfur petroleum diesel (ULSD) and neat biodiesel (B100) in a light-duty diesel engine operated at 1500 rpm and at loads of 68 and 102 Nm (50 and 75 ft-lbs). The influence of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) was also examined. The incorporation of water was found to significantly lower the NOx emissions of B100 while maintaining fuel efficiency when operating at 0% and 27% EGR; however, NOx emissions were observed to increase slightly for the emulsified fuel when the engine load was raised to 102 Nm (75 ft-lbs). The soot fraction of the particulates (as determined using an opacity meter) was much lower for the B100 and B100-water emulsion compared to the ULSD. In contrast, total PM mass (for the three fuel types) was unchanged for the 0% EGR condition but was significantly lower for the B100 and B100-emulsion during the 27% EGR condition compared to the ULSD. Analysis of the emissions and heat release data indicate that water enhances air-fuel premixing to maintain fuel economy and lower soot formation. The exhaust chemistry of the biodiesel base fuels (B100 and water-emulsified B100) was found to be unique in that they contained measurable levels of methyl alkenoates, which were not found for the ULSD. These compounds were formed by the partial cracking of the methyl ester groups during combustion.

AB  - The significance of this study is the complete replacement of diesel fuel with bio-fuels. For this purpose; bio-fuels, namely, methyl ester of paradise oil and eucalyptus oil were chosen and used as fuel in the form of blends. Various proportions of paradise oil and eucalyptus oil are prepared on a volume basis and used as fuels in a single cylinder, four-stroke DI diesel engine, to study the performance and emission characteristics of these fuels. In the present investigation a methyl ester derived from paradise oil is considered as an ignition improver. The results show a 49% reduction in smoke, 34.5% reduction in HC emissions and a 37% reduction in CO emissions for the Me50-Eu50 blend with a 2.7% increase in NOx emission at full load. There was a 2.4% increase in brake thermal efficiency for the Me50-Eu50 blend at full load. The combustion characteristics of Me50-Eu50 blend are comparable with those of diesel. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This research reported on the successfully production of biodiesel by transesterification of crude rice bran oil (RBO). The process included three-steps. Firstly, the acid value of RBO was reduced to below 1 mg KOH/g by two-steps pretreatment process in the presence of sulfuric acid catalyst. Secondly, the product prepared from the first process was carried out esterification with an alkaline catalyst. The influence of four variables on conversion efficiency to methyl ester, i.e., methanol/RBO molar ratio, catalyst amount, reaction temperature and reaction time, was studied at this stage. The content of methyl ester was analyzed by chromatographic analysis. Through orthogonal analysis of parameters in a four-factor and three-level test, the optimum reaction conditions for the transesterification were obtained: methanol/RBO molar ratio 6:1, usage amount of KOH 0.9% w/w, reaction temperature 60 °C and reaction time 60 min. In the third step, methyl ester prepared from the second processing step was refined to become biodiesel. Fuel properties of RBO biodiesel were studied and compared according to ASTM D6751-02 and DIN V51606 standards for biodiesel. Most fuel properties complied with the limits prescribed in the aforementioned standards. The consequent engine test showed a similar power output compared with regular diesel but consumption rate was slightly higher. Emission tests showed a marked decrease in CO, HC and PM, however, with a slight increase in NOX. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to experimentally analyse the performance and the pollutant emissions of a four-stroke SI engine operating on ethanol-gasoline blends of 0%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% with the aid of artificial neural network (ANN). The properties of bioethanol were measured based on American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards. The experimental results revealed that using ethanol-gasoline blended fuels increased the power and torque output of the engine marginally. For ethanol blends it was found that the brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) was decreased while the brake thermal efficiency (ηb.th.) and the volumetric efficiency (ηv) were increased. The concentration of CO and HC emissions in the exhaust pipe were measured and found to be decreased when ethanol blends were introduced. This was due to the high oxygen percentage in the ethanol. In contrast, the concentration of CO2 and NOx was found to be increased when ethanol is introduced. An ANN model was developed to predict a correlation between brake power, torque, brake specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency, volumetric efficiency and emission components using different gasoline-ethanol blends and speeds as inputs data. About 70% of the total experimental data were used for training purposes, while the 30% were used for testing. A standard Back-Propagation algorithm for the engine was used in this model. A multi layer perception network (MLP) was used for nonlinear mapping between the input and the output parameters. It was observed that the ANN model can predict engine performance and exhaust emissions with correlation coefficient (R) in the range of 0.97-1. Mean relative errors (MRE) values were in the range of 0.46-5.57%, while root mean square errors (RMSE) were found to be very low. This study demonstrates that ANN approach can be used to accurately predict the SI engine performance and emissions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of bio-fuels is proving to be a controversial subject as the value of any real environmental benefits is debated. However, these fuels are being introduced in various parts of the world and they are likely to remain as a vehicle fuel source. A number of publications have discussed potential elastomer material selection for use with these bio-fuels, but experience of actual working conditions has demonstrated that serious failures may occur if important operational factors are not considered in the final material selection. This feature article compares the results of standard tests for bio-diesel and an ethanol gasoline blends with results from simulations of actual service conditions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel started to be widely produced in the early 1990s and since then production has been increasing steadily. The global biodiesel industry is among the fastest-growing markets the chemical industry has ever seen. World capacity, production, and consumption of biodiesel grew on average by 32% per year during 2000-2005, and the industry looks set for even faster growth rates115% per year for capacity, and 101% per year for demandin the years to 2008 and beyond. Germany, the largest biodiesel market, has excluded biofuels from taxation altogether. The main characteristic of Germany is to market 100% pure biodiesel, which is on sale in Germany at over 1,500 public filling stations.

AB  - A community-scale process of biodiesel production from animal fats was reported together with an economic analysis and wastewater treatment process. The biodiesel product whose qualification met Thai biodiesel standards for agricultural engines could be used directly in agricultural engines, such as water pumps, cultivator engines, trailer-mounted engines, dump trucks and farm vehicles with single-cylinder, 4-stroke diesel engines without operational problems. This study was an illustration for producing inexpensive and renewable energy from domestic sources to reduce dependence on foreign sources of petroleum. The treatment of wastewater from the biodiesel production process was necessary because the water contained high levels of COD (approximately 138,000 mg L-1) and oils/fats, which may hinder the biological mechanism. By adding aluminum sulfate of an appropriate amount followed by an adjustment of pH, alkalinity and nitrogen levels, the water could be further treated by an anaerobic process. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Several factors, including economical, environmental, and social factors, are involved in selection of the best fuel-based vehicles for road transportation. This leads to a multi-criteria selection problem for multi-alternatives. In this study, a multi-criteria assessment model was developed to rank different road transportation fuel-based vehicles (both renewable and non-renewable) using a method called Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment and Evaluations (PROMETHEE). This method combines qualitative and quantitative criteria to rank various alternatives. In this study, vehicles based on gasoline, gasoline-electric (hybrid), E85 ethanol, diesel, B100 biodiesel, and compressed natural gas (CNG) were considered as alternatives. These alternatives were ranked based on five criteria: vehicle cost, fuel cost, distance between refueling stations, number of vehicle options available to the consumer, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit distance traveled. In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed to study the impact of changes in various parameters on final ranking. Two base cases and several alternative scenarios were evaluated. In the base case scenario with higher weight on economical parameters, gasoline-based vehicle was ranked higher than other vehicles. In the base case scenario with higher weight on environmental parameters, hybrid vehicle was ranked first followed by biodiesel-based vehicle. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to growing concerns about NOx and particulate matter (PM) emissions from diesel engines, stricter regulations are being introduced requiring advanced emission control technology. In response the diesel industry has begun testing various emission control technologies and applying them. To assess vehicle renewal policies of bus companies, two exhaust after-treatment technologies are compared: the combination of a diesel particulate filter and an exhaust gas re-circulation system and the combination of a selective catalytic reduction and urea. On-board emission measurements were conducted under real-world driving conditions on a specific bus route in the city of Madrid. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, the acceptance of fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel) as a substitute to petroleum diesel has rapidly grown in Greece. The raw materials for biodiesel production in this country mainly include traditional seed oils (cotton seed oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil and rapeseed oil) and used frying oils. In the search for new low-cost alternative feedstocks for biodiesel production, this study emphasizes the evaluation of pumpkin seed oil. The experimental results showed that the oil content of pumpkin seeds was remarkably high (45%). The fatty acid profile of the oil showed that is composed primarily of linoleic, oleic, palmitic and stearic acids. The oil was chemically converted via an alkaline transesterification reaction with methanol to methyl esters, with a yield nearly 97.5 wt%. All of the measured properties of the produced biodiesel met the current quality requirements according to EN 14214. Although this study showed that pumpkin oil could be a promising feedstock for biodiesel production within the EU, it is rather difficult for this production to be achieved on a large scale. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The study endeavor to utilize esters of Balanites aegyptiaca (L.) Del(Balanites) as a fuel for diesel engine. Ester developed from balanites oil by the transesterification process is investigated for its properties and the engine performance. A single stage alkali-catalyzed esterification process by using 1.25% KOH, methyl alcohol 8:1 molar ratio with respect to balanites oil, gives the maximum ester yield of 95%. The performance and emission characteristics of the engine are analyzed using balanites oil methyl esters and diesel as fuel. The viscosity of balanites oil is found to be decreased by 89% after esterification, and the calorific value of balanites oil methyl esters is nearly 94% of the diesel fuel. The engine performance with balanites oil methyl ester as a fuel resembles to that of conventional diesel fuel, while the exhaust gas emissions are reduced with the use of balanites oil methyl esters. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Methyl and ethyl esters as biodiesel fuels were prepared from linseed oil with transesterification reaction in non-catalytic supercritical fluids conditions. Biodiesel fuel is a renewable substitute fuel for petroleum diesel fuel made from vegetable or animal fats. Biodiesel fuel has better properties than that of petroleum diesel fuel such as renewable, biodegradable, non-toxic, and essentially free of sulfur and aromatics. The purpose of the transesterification process is to lower the viscosity of the oil. The viscosity values of linseed oil methyl and ethyl esters highly decreases after transesterification process. The viscosity values of vegetable oils vary between 27.2 and 53.6 mm2 s-1, whereas those of vegetable oil methyl esters between 3.59 and 4.63 mm2 s-1. Compared with no. 2 diesel fuel, all of the vegetable oil methyl esters were slightly viscous. The flash point values of vegetable oil methyl esters are highly lower than those of vegetable oils. The transesterification of linseed oil in supercritical fluids such as methanol and ethanol has proved to be the most promising process. Methanol is the commonly used alcohol in this process, due in part to its low cost. Methyl esters of vegetable oils have several outstanding advantages among other new-renewable and clean engine fuel alternatives. The most important variables affecting the methyl ester yield during the transesterification reaction are molar ratio of alcohol to vegetable oil and reaction temperature. Biodiesel has become more attractive recently because of its environmental benefits. Biodiesel is an environmentally friendly fuel that can be used in any diesel engine without modification. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The poplar bioenergy system has been analysed applying life cycle assessment (LCA) to compare its environmental performance to: Ethiopian mustard bioenergy system and natural gas. The life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) shows that the use of fertilizers is the highest impact in four of the 10 environmental categories, representing between 39% and 67% of the impact in them. The diesel used in transport vehicles and agricultural tractors also has a significant impact in another five of the 10 analysed categories 40-85%. The poplar bioenergy system contributes to global warming with 1.90-1.98 g CO2 eq MJ-1 biomass produced. The production and transport as far as the thermoelectric plant of the poplar biomass consumes 0.02 MJ of primary energy per 1 MJ of biomass stored. In comparison with Ethiopian mustard and natural gas, it reduces primary energy consumption by 83% and 89% and the greenhouse gas emission by 84% and 89%, respectively. The results of the analysis support that the poplar bioenergy system is viable from an energy balance and environmental perspective for producing energy in southern Europe, as long as it is cultivated in areas where water is available. This latter point and the better environmental performance of both crops in comparison to natural gas allows us to affirm that the combination of several crops adapted to the local agro-climatic conditions of the territory will be the most suitable strategy in Mediterranean areas that wish to reach the global energy production targets in terms of biomass established by the European Union (EU). © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although Argentina came late to the biofuels revolution, a series of measures taken recently at federal and provincial government level have created new opportunities. New federal laws on biofuels promotion have sparked an investment boom. The main activity has been in the biodiesel sector-partly because diesel is the dominant fuel sector in Argentina, and partly because the country had already engineered a soy revolution over the past 15 years, becoming the world's largest exporter of soy oil and soy meal. Biodiesel allows this revolution to be extended-from soy as foodstuff to soy as fuelstock. The biodiesel revolution now underway promises to extend Argentina's latecomer advantages by combining greater scale and lower costs with introduced technical innovations such as genetically modified crops and no-till farming. In this way, Argentina can be seen to be demonstrating the superiority of biofuel production in countries of the South over the conditions obtaining in countries of the North-including superior resources availability, superior energetics and lower costs. Whereas Brazil has demonstrated its superiority in sugarcane-based ethanol, Argentina is about to demonstrate its superiority in soy-based biodiesel. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Experiments were conducted on a 4-cylinder direct-injection diesel engine using ultra-low sulfur diesel, bi oesel and their blends, to investigate the regulated and unregulated emissions of the engine under five engine loads at an engine speed of 1800 rev/min. Blended fuels containing 19.6%, 39.4%, 59.4% and 79.6% by volume of biodiesel, corresponding to 2%, 4%, 6% and 8% by mass of oxygen in the blended fuel, were used. Biodiesel used in this study was converted from waste cooking oil. The following results are obtained with an increase of biodiesel in the fuel. The brake specific fuel consumption and the brake thermal efficiency increase. The HC and CO emissions decrease while NOx and NO2 emissions increase. The smoke opacity and particulate mass concentrations reduce significantly at high engine load. In addition, for submicron particles, the geometry mean diameter of the particles becomes smaller while the total number concentration increases. For the unregulated gaseous emissions, generally, the emissions of formaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, toluene, xylene decrease, however, acetaldehyde and benzene emissions increase. The results indicate that the combination of ultra-low sulfur diesel and biodiesel from waste cooking oil gives similar results to those in the literature using higher sulfur diesel fuels and biodiesel from other sources. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Combustion processes have inherent characteristics that lead to the release in the environment of both gaseous and particulate pollutants that have primary and secondary impacts on air quality, human health, and climate. The emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels and biofuels and their atmospheric impacts are reviewed here with attention given to the emissions of the currently regulated pollutant gasses, primary aerosols, and secondary aerosol precursors as well as the emissions of non-regulated pollutants. Fuels ranging from coal, petroleum, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas, as well as the biofuels; ethanol, methanol, methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tertiary-butyl ether (ETBE), and biodiesel, are discussed in terms of the known air quality and climate impacts of the currently regulated pollutants. The potential importance of the non-regulated emissions of both gasses and aerosols in air quality issues and climate is also discussed with principal focus on aldehydes and other oxygenated organics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and nitrated organics. The connection between air quality and climate change is also addressed with attention given to ozone and aerosols as potentially important greenhouse species. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It is now well understood that air pollution produces significant adverse health effects in the general public and over the past 60 years, there have been on-going efforts to reduce the emitted pollutants and their resulting health effects. There are now shifting patterns of industrialization with many heavily polluting industries moving from developed countries with increasingly stringent air quality standards to the developing world. However, even in decreasing concentrations of pollutants, health effects remain important possibly as a result of changes in the nature of the pollutants as new chemicals are produced and as other causes of mortality and morbidity are reduced. In addition, there is now the potential for deliberate introduction of toxic air pollutants by local armed conflicts and terrorists. Thus, there are new challenges to understand the role of the atmospheric environment on public health in this time of changing economic and demographic conditions overlaid with the willingness to indirectly attack governments and other established entities through direct attacks on the general public. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The key feature of the process is its ability to operate continuously with a high reaction rate, potentially requiring less post reaction cleaning and product/reactant separation than currently established processes. This was achieved by atomising the heated oil/fat and then spraying it into a reaction chamber filled with methanol vapor in a counter current flow arrangement. This allows the continuous separation of product and the excess methanol stream in the reactor. The overall conversion based on a single cycle of this process has been between 50% and 96% of the feed stock materials. Conversions of 94-96% were achieved while operating with 5-7 g of sodium methoxide/L of methanol at methanol flow rate of 17.2 L/h and oil flow rate of 10 L/h. Additional variations in the reactant stoichiometry (i.e. reactant flow rates), catalyst type/concentration, and reaction temperature on the overall product conversion were investigated. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This research was aimed at studying the acceleration of the catalytic activity of calcium oxide (CaO) for developing an effective heterogeneous catalyst for biodiesel production by the transesterification of plant oil with methanol. CaO was activated by pretreatment with methanol and was used for the transesterification reaction. The activation and transesterification reaction conditions were examined. The obtained optimal reaction conditions were 0.1-g CaO, 3.9-g methanol, 15-g rapeseed oil, and 1.5-h activation time at room temperature that provided methyl ester in approximately 90% yield within a reaction time of 3 h at 60 °C. The activation mechanism was also investigated, and the proposed mechanism is as follows. By pretreatment with methanol, a small amount of CaO gets converted into Ca(OCH3)2 that acts as an initiating reagent for the transesterification reaction and produces glycerin as a by-product. Subsequently, a calcium-glycerin complex, formed due to the reaction of CaO with glycerin, functions as the main catalyst and accelerates the transesterification reaction. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Diesterol is a new specific term which denotes a mixture of fossil diesel fuel (D), vegetable oil methyl ester called biodiesel (B) and plant derived ethanol (E). In the context of the present paper, this term refers specifically to the combination of diesel fuel, bioethanol produced from potato waste, dehydrated in a vapor phase using 3A Zeolite, and sunflower methyl ester produced through transesterification. The mixture of DBE, i.e. diesterol, was patented under the Iranian patent No. 39407, dated 12-3-2007. The main purpose of this research work was to reduce engine exhaust NOx, CO, HC and smoke emissions due to application of biofuel and the increase of fuel oxygen content. It was needed to prepare suitable low cost and renewable additives. The diesterol properties such as pour point, viscosity, flash point, copper strip corrosion, ash content, sulfur content and cetane number were determined experimentally. The optimum ratio of bioethanol and biodiesel was found to be 40/60 considering fuel oxygen content, fuel price and mixture properties. Bioethanol was added to enhance the oxygenated component in the fuel, while the sunflower methyl ester was added to maintain the fuel stability at low temperatures. The parameters considered for investigation are the engine power, torque, specific fuel consumption and exhaust emissions for various mixture proportions. The experimental results showed that bioethanol plays an important role in determining the flash point of the blends. By adding 3% bioethanol to diesel and sunflower methyl ester, the flash point was reduced by 16 °C. The viscosity of the blend was also reduced by increasing the amount of bioethanol. The sulfur content of bioethanol and sunflower methyl ester is very low compared to diesel fuel. The sulfur content of diesel is 500 ppm whereas that of bioethanol and sunflower methyl ester is 0 and 15 ppm, respectively. This lower sulfur content is another factor enhancing the use of fuel blends in diesel engines. The bioethanol and sunflower methyl ester combination has sulfur content less than 20 ppm. The maximum power and torque using diesel fuel were 17.75 kW and 64.2 Nm at 3600 and 2400 rpm, respectively. Adding oxygenated compounds to the new blend seems to slightly reduce the engine power and torque and increased the average sfc for various speeds. The experimental measurement and observation of smoke concentration, NOx, CO and HC concentration indicated that both of these pollutants reduced by increasing the biofuel composition of diesterol throughout the engine operating range. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass derived fuels are preferred as alternate fuels for I.C Engines due to their abundant availability and renewable nature. Fuels such as methanol and ethanol have proved to be suitable alternate fuels in the transport sector. In the present work the performance, emission and combustion characteristics of a single cylinder, constant speed, direct injection diesel engine using orange oil as an alternate fuel were studied and the results are compared with the standard diesel fuel operation. Results indicated that the brake thermal efficiency was higher compared to diesel throughout the load spectra. Carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions were lower and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) were higher compared to diesel operation. Peak pressure and heat release rate were found to be higher for orange oil compared to diesel fuel operation. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The search for alternative sources of energy has been driven by the increased cost and depletion of supply of fossil fuels. The alternatives are mainly vegetable oils. Putranjiva roxburghii, a non-edible vegetable oil can be used in diesel engine for its fuel properties which are comparable with diesel. Blends (10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% v/v) of pure Putranjiva oil and diesel are used in Ricardo Variable Compression Diesel Engine to study the performance and emission characteristics at various brake power. Putranjiva oil blends yield better performance at 45° CA bTDC injection timing in comparison to 40° CA bTDC timing for diesel. Maximum 30% blend of Putranjiva oil with diesel can be used as an alternative fuel in diesel engine for it differs very little from diesel in performance and is better than diesel with regard to emissions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An automated on-line approach based on determination of free and bound glycerol was here proposed to monitor biodiesel production. The method was based on liquid-liquid extraction of glycerol from the biodiesel to an aqueous ethanolic phase in which glycerol is oxidized to formaldehyde with meta periodate with subsequent reaction with acetylacetone. The reaction product was photometrically measured at 410 nm. Free and bound glycerol were differentiated by glycerides hydrolysis with potassium ethylate. The experimental set-up consisted of a flow-injection manifold for liquid-liquid extraction without phase separation and iterative change of the flow direction that enabled: (a) filling the flow manifold with a meta periodate-acetylacetone acceptor phase; (b) sampling of small amounts (μl) from the reactor; (c) determination of free glycerol by extraction from biodiesel to the aqueous phase with simultaneous oxidation-reaction with acetylacetone in the acceptor phase; (d) continuous monitoring of the aqueous phase by passage through a photometric detector; (e) filling the flow manifold with a potassium ethylate-meta periodate-acetylacetone new acceptor phase; (d) repetition of steps b-to-d to determine total glycerol after saponification of the bound glycerol by potassium ethylate; and (f) determination of bound glycerol by difference between the second and first analyses. The results showed that the proposed automated on-line method is a suitable option in routine analysis during biodiesel production. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A low-intensity ultrasonic measurement system was used to monitor the products of transesterification of soybean oil in methanol to FAME (biodiesel). The byproducts of the transesterification reaction are methyl esters, glycerol and other products. During the transesterification reaction, the glycerol, having a higher density than the methyl ester, settles at the bottom of the reaction vessel. The aim of this study was to measure the glycerol deposition rate during transesterification and to assess the reaction rate and end time. Soybean oil was converted into biodiesel at four temperature levels. The amount of catalyst (KOH) used in the transesterification reactions was determined by titration. The ultrasonic waveforms captured during the reaction were recorded and analyzed automatically. The ultrasonic system monitored the effects of reaction temperatures on the glycerol settling rate and the reaction end times. The ultrasonic measurement of glycerol settling would be a useful non-destructive method for evaluating the effects of parameters such as catalyst amount, mixing time and temperature on transesterification reactions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In an effort to optimize the reaction conditions of biodiesel production from lard, response surface methodology was applied, and the effects of five-level-three-factors and their reciprocal interactions were assessed. A total of 20 individual experiments were conducted, and were designed to study reaction temperature, catalyst amount, and oil-to-methanol molar ratio. A statistical model predicted that the highest conversion yield of lard biodiesel would be 98.6%, at the following optimized reaction conditions: a reaction temperature of 65 °C, a catalyst amount of 1.26%, and an oil-to-methanol molar ratio of 7.5:1, with a 20-min reaction time. Using these optimal factor values under experimental conditions in three independent replicates, an average content of 97.8 ± 0.6% was achieved, and this value was well within the range predicted by the model. The quality of biodiesel produced from lard at the optimum reaction conditions satisfied the relevant quality standards, with the exception of cold filter plugging point. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this work was the study of the influence of the raw material composition on biodiesel quality, using a transesterification reaction. Thus, ten refined vegetable oils were transesterificated using potassium methoxide as catalyst and standard reaction conditions (reaction time, 1 h; weight of catalyst, 1 wt.% of initial oil weight; molar ratio methanol/oil, 6/1; reaction temperature, 60 °C). Biodiesel quality was tested according to the standard [UNE-EN 14214, 2003. Automotive fuels. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) for diesel engines. Requirements and test methods]. Some critical parameters like oxidation stability, cetane number, iodine value and cold filter plugging point were correlated with the methyl ester composition of each biodiesel, according to two parameters: degree of unsaturation and long chain saturated factor. Finally, a triangular graph based on the composition in monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and saturated methyl esters was built in order to predict the critical parameters of European standard for whatever biodiesel, known its composition. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The production of energy from renewable and waste materials is an attractive alternative to the conventional agricultural feed stocks such as corn and soybean. This paper describes an approach to extract oil from spent coffee grounds and to further transesterify the processed oil to convert it into biodiesel. This process yields 10-15% oil depending on the coffee species (Arabica or Robusta). The biodiesel derived from the coffee grounds (100% conversion of oil to biodiesel) was found to be stable for more than 1 month under ambient conditions. It is projected that 340 million gallons of biodiesel can be produced from the waste coffee grounds around the world. The coffee grounds after oil extraction are ideal materials for garden fertilizer, feedstock for ethanol, and as fuel pellets. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Analysts in the US energy industry believe that the economic recession will slow the growth of alternative fuels, especially ethanol, as it can be viewed as an expensive luxury by the government and consumers. It is contemplated that the government support of biofuels in the US is likely to expand under the Obama Administration. Aventine Renewable Energy Holdings, Pekin, IL, has planned to suspend construction of its Aurora, NE ethanol refinery for six months to preserve liquidity. Analysts have stated that energy security becomes even more of a concern when oil prices fall as funding for projects such as ultra-deepwater and oil sands development are put on hold. Dow Chemical plan seeks to extend the expiration date of incentives to 2016,which include $1/gal for producing biodiesel, $1/gal for producing diesel from biomass, and 50 cts/gal for producing diesel through a mixture biomass and petroleum.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the temperature variation and blending ratios on fuel properties of biodiesel and biodiesel blended with ethanol fuel. Adding the ethanol to biodiesel fuel can be improved the disadvantage of cold-starting of biodiesel fuel. Furthermore, properties which depend on the change of fuel temperature affect the spray behavior, combustion and emission characteristics in combustion chamber. The kinematic viscosity and density were obtained by the measured dynamic viscosity and specific gravity, respectively. In this study, it was revealed that the specific gravity and density decreased linearly when the fuel temperature and the ethanol blending ratio increased. Empirical equation can be derived from the measured values and it is the function of the second order of blending ratio and the first order of fuel temperature. On the other side, the dynamic and kinematic viscosity decreased exponentially as rising of the fuel temperature. Based on the measured value of viscosities, the empirical equation which is the function of fuel temperature can be derived at each ethanol blending fuels.

AB  - Biofuels are an important way of progress for limiting greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality and finding new energetic resources. For diesel engines, FAE (Fatty Acid Ester), coming from transesterification of vegetable oils, have shown their potentials as fuel substitutes. Nevertheless, this transesterification induces the production of glycerin (or glycerol) as fatal co-product. Finding an outlet to this glycerol is fundamental for the FAE network. In the same time, oxygenated compounds have been shown to have great potential for the reduction of diesel particulate emissions. Transforming glycerol into new oxygenated compounds, which could be formulated with diesel fuel, would be a very promising way. Different oxygenates derived from glycerol, such as acetals, ethers and carbonates, have been synthesized and evaluated as blending components for Diesel fuel. Our objective was to evaluate their potential, compared with RME (Rapseed Methyl Ester) blends in term of pollutant emissions with different new engine technologies and to select the most promising of them. GTBE (Glycerol Ter Butyl Ether) was the most interesting compound and it was formulated with biodiesel with the respect of the physicochemical criteria required by EN14214 standard. This new biofuel (92.5% RME + 7.5% GTBE + 1000 ppm pro cetane) was incorporated in diesel fuel (5% vol.) and compared with a mixture containing 5% RME. After various tests carried out on vehicle and engine, focusing on pollutant emissions and possible fouling problems, it is possible to conclude that this new biodiesel does not present any technical disadvantage. The decision to use this glycerol derivatives in diesel fuel formulation will thus be controlled by economical criteria. Copyright © 2008, Institut français du pétrole.

AB  - In this work, attention is paid on initiation and HCCI combustion control through fuel formulation. This article shows the effect of olefin addition (and in particular 1-octene and octa-1,7-diene addition) in a Diesel base fuel. Tests are made with a jet-stirred reactor and an engine bench. The current Diesel fuel cetane numbers are not really adapted for a perfect control of HCCI combustion. In HCCI conditions, the autoignition of a Diesel fuel occurs too early in the cycle. This study shows that, with the jet-stirred reactor, 1-octene addition allows decreasing the advancement of the cool flame reaction of n-octane. Engine bench experiments show that, at 1500 rpm, 1-octene and octa-1,7-diene addition decrease the physical delay and increase the chemical auto-ignition delay of the Diesel base fuel. These results can be explained by olefin chemistry: olefin double bonds imply reactions (with radicals) that are in competition with the cool flame reactions. There is also the fact that the intermediate species are stabilised by mesomery. About pollutants, olefin addition decreases HC emissions of the Diesel base fuel. Adding light olefins in a Diesel base fuel could improving the HCCI combustion. Copyright © 2008, Institut français du pétrole.

AB  - Based on strong governmental incentives, biodiesel from transesterification of Fatty Acids (FAE) production is rapidly increasing mainly in Europe and is starting to expand worldwide. A closer look at the complex European incentives scheme and an update of the planned FAE capacity expansion helps to explain the key economic factors in this sharp raise in FAE activity. Based on this economic background, key factors for FAE technology selection will be explored to demonstrate alternatives for biofuels production. Increasing biodiesel consumption in a sustainable way requires optimizing production processes compatible with high production capacities, high yields and low environmental impact, especially regarding wastes streams. This paper highlights a commercially proven technology available for meeting these challenges, focusing on a new continuous FAE production process where the transesterification reaction is promoted by a heterogeneous catalyst. This process employs methanolysis of vegetable oils by passing the reactants through two consecutive fixed-bed reactors followed by methanol and glycerin separation stages. The Axens process requires neither catalyst recovery nor aqueous treatment. It achieves very high methyl esters yields with a high purity glycerin byproduct. At least 98% purity glycerin is directly recovered in the total absence of any mineral (salts) contaminants thereby offering an alternative for a real "Green Process".

AB  - The report presents an outlook for alternative motor fuels and new vehicles. The time period covered extends up to 2030. The International Energy Agency and the U.S. Energy Information Administration predict that the world energy demand will increase by over 50% from now to 2030, if policies remain unchanged. Most of the growth in demand for energy in general, as well as for transport fuels, will take place in non-OECD countries. Gasoline and diesel are projected to remain the dominant automotive fuels until 2030. Vehicle technology and high quality fuels will eventually solve the problem of harmful exhaust emissions. However, the problem with CO2 still remains, and much attention will be given to increase efficiency. Hybrid technology is one option to reduce fuel consumption. Diesel engines are fuel efficient, but have high emissions compared with advanced gasoline engines. New combustion systems combining the best qualities of gasoline and diesel engines promise low emissions as well as high efficiency. The scenarios for alternative fuels vary a lot. By 2030, alternative fuels could represent a 10-30% share of transport fuels, depending on policies. Ambitious goals for biofuels in transport have been set. As advanced biofuels are still in their infancy, it seems probable that traditional biofuels will also be used in 2030. Ethanol is the fastest growing biofuel. Currently the sustainability of biofuels is discussed extensively. Synthetic fuels promise excellent end-use properties, reduced emissions, and if produced from biomass, also reduced CO2 emissions. The report presents an analysis of technology options to meet the requirements for energy security, reduced CO2emissions, reduced local emissions as well as sustainability in general in the long run. In the short term, energy savings will be the main measure for CO2 reductions in transport, fuel switches will have a secondary role. Copyright © VTT 2008.

AB  - A new non-edible oil source to obtain biodiesel from in-situ transesterification reaction of Thespesia poulnea seeds of kernels has been studied. The seeds are found to contain non-edible oil in the range of 73% In this paper the aim is to produce biodiesel directly from seeds by in-situ transesterification reaction. One can demonstrate the cost effective new source of energy by single step reaction, i.e. production of oil by combining extraction and reaction of extract with the mixture of alcohols to obtain oil as one of the best in-situ transesterification.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable alternative fuel that can be used as substitute for mineral diesel. The use of biodiesel in diesel engines reduces all of the exhaust emissions expect NOx. The higher temperature in the combustion chamber increases the NOx emis-sions. The recirculation of a small percentage of cooled exhaust gases into the combustion chamber through the intake manifold reduces the in-cylinder temperature. Moreover, the cooling of exhaust gases before mixing with fresh air introduced to the engine does not affect its volumetric efficiency but it absorbs the heat of combustion. This leads to a reduction in NOx emissions and improves the engine brake thermal efficiency. This paper describes the investigation of the performance and emission characteristics of a biodiesel-fueled, naturally aspirated, single cylinder diesel engine with cooled exhaust gas recirculation. © 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

AB  - Biofuels are the main substitute to fossil fuels. These fuels are less polluting in comparison to fossil fuels and can be produced from agricultural material residues for use in diesel engines. In this research work bioethanol was produced from potato waste. It was dehydrated in a vapor phase using 3A zeolite and was used in combination with sunflower methyl ester oil and diesel fuel blending which was evaluated thereafter. The sunflower methyl ester was also produced using a transesterification method. Considering the laboratory conditions and fuel stability limits to be used, the suitable blending proportion of bioethanol and diesel fuel was determined to be 12 to 88 and then, for maintaining fuel stability at temperatures lower than 15°C, the sunflower methyl ester was added to the mixture. The pour point of the fuel and different fuel blends, the viscosity, cetane number, flash point, amount of fuel ash, sulfur content and copper corrosion were determined in the laboratory. Experiments show that ethanol plays an important role on the flash point of the blends. With the addition of 3% bioethanol to diesel and sunflower methyl ester, the flash point was reduced to 16°C. The viscosity of the blends was reduced with the increase in the amount of ethanol. The sulfur content of bioethanol and sunflower methyl ester is very low compared with that of diesel fuel. The sulfur content of diesel is 500 ppm whereas that for ethanol and sunflower methyl ester is 0 and 15 ppm, respectively. The lower amount of sulfur content facilitates the use of fuel blends in diesel engines. For the ethanol and sunflower methyl ester combination, this amount is less than 20 ppm.

AB  - As a source of alternative fuels, ligneous biomass offers two significant advantages: trees can grow on low-yield land unsuited for food production and supply the energy required for producing derived fuels. Technologies for its conversion into substitutes for gasoline and especially for diesel fuel are complex and expensive. Harnessing and applying them will however be pushed forward by the double challenge of oil resource depletion and global warming. Ample sunlight and high rainfall suggest that the tropics may be the preferred areas where plantation forests dedicated to lignocellulose fuel production (or lignofuels as distinct from agrofuels) could be established. At petroleum prices 10 to 20% above 2007 levels, the authors conclude that a "bioethanol outlet" for tropical forest plantations on deforested idle lands and humid savannahs is viable. To meet the very rapid expected growth in demand for biomass, such projects should thus be initiated now. Key issues to be covered in related feasibility studies are discussed herein.

AB  - There is an increasing interest in every country, to search for suitable alternative fuels that are environment friendly. This led to the choice of Mahua Oil (MO) as one of the main alternative fuels in India. In the present work, an attempt has been made to use biodiesel as a substitute for kerosene in wick stove. In this investigation, Mahua Oil Methyl Ester (MOME) was prepared by transesterfication using potassium hydroxide as catalyst and important fuel properties were determined based on ASTM procedure. From the analysis, it was observed that the properties of MEMO are close to kerosene.To evaluate the MOME as a substitute for kerosene, it was used as a fuel in wick stove. From the experimental results, it was observed that the MOME result in performance close to kerosene and lower soot emission.

AB  - Fuel prices continue to soar throughout the United States. And as a collective outcry emanates from American consumers, vehicle owners have little choice but to gobble up the gas upon which the nation runs. A method has been developed, called the Thermal Depolymerisation Process (TDP), of taking the by-products of the typical holiday meal and converting it into biofuel. Changing World Technologies (CWT) has been working on this idea since it was founded back in 1997. The technique works by producing renewable diesel, high-quality fertilisers and valuable specialty products by putting turkey guts, feathers, fats, bones, cartilage, and other wastes under pressure in the Thermal Conversion Process (TCP).

AB  - Microalgae can accumulate fatty acids up to 80% of their dry weight (Chisti 2007). As a consequence the yield per hectare could be higher by a factor of 30 compared to terrestrial oleaginous species. Biodiversity of microalgae is enormous. It is estimated that there are between 200 000 and several million species. Such diversity is an unexplored potential for research and industry. In comparison to terrestrial oleaginous species, microalgae have many characteristics addressing environmental problems with a drastically enhanced oil production. Microalgae are currently generating mediatic enthusiasm, and many start-ups are investing this niche. Nevertheless there are still locks to undo via upstream search, before the expected returns and costs are met and before these technologies can be developed at a large scale. © 2008 Société de Biologie.

AB  - In the present energy context, there is a growing interest for the fuel production from biomass. While the first generation of biofuels has shown its limits, a second generation appears that is based on the valorisation of the unused resources of lignocellulosic biomass. This could significantly increase the biofuels potential in France. Up to 40 % of the total needs of transport fuel could be covered. Among the processes under development, the Biomass to Liquid (BtL) process seems as an interesting route, able to be shortly implemented at an industrial scale. This process consists in producing liquid fuel (such as Diesel Fischer-Trospch) through a synthetic gas obtained by biomass gasification However R&D work is still needed to solve the remaining key issues of the process. These studies are performed in several laboratories in Europe, especially in Germany and in the Nordic countries, and also more recently in France, notably in the Commissariat à l'Inergie Atomique. © 2008 Société de Biologie.

AB  - A Cummins 6 CTA 8.3G1-1 turbocharged DI diesel engine was fueled with blends of esters of Mahua oil and the performance and emissions were compared with diesel. The neat biodiesel, 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and base fuel were tested at constant load (28% of rated load) and at constant speed of 1500 rpm. This experiment is conducted on D.G Set, used to supply power to mining equipments in MSPL Iron Ore Company Hospet. Dist. Bellary. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of various blends of biodiesel on engine performance and emissions. Neat Mahua oil poses some problems when subjected to prolonged usage in CI engine. These problems can be reduced to minimum by subjecting the Mahua oil to the process of transesterification. Various properties of the biodiesel thus developed are evaluated and compared in relation to that of conventional diesel oil. Copyright © Enviromedia.

AB  - Jatropha curcas belonging to family Euphorbiaceae, a perennial plant produces seed with 31-37 percent of oil, which can be combusted as fuel without being refined. This fuel known as the process of transesterification. can produce bio-diesel. Jatropha plant is grown in marginal and poor soil with minimum cultural practices or in wastelands with low fertility, rockiness, and shallowness of soil. Besides higher cetane number, oil reduces emission of carbon monoxide by 44 percent, sulphates by 100 percent and ozone forming potential by less than 50 percent. Through Jatropha cultivation, not only bio-diesel can be obtained but also a tremendous opportunity will be there for employment generation in an agricultural country like India. This paper provides some inputs to show the importance of bio-fuel to combat pollution problems and solve fuel crisis. © Enviromedia Printed in India. All rights reserved.

AB  - Diesel fuel was sold in the United States with a sulfur level of 5000 ppm until October 1993. At that time, the EPA mandated that all diesel fuel sold in the United States contain 500 ppm or less sulfur. The EPA reduced the sulfur standard to 15 ppm for diesel fuel again on 1 June 2006. Each time the level of sulfur has been lowered, the lubricity of the diesel fuel has dropped. Fifty-five gallons of No. 2, 15-ppm sulfur diesel fuel were obtained and blended with biodiesel on a volume basis at the 0.5%, 1%, and 2% levels of biodiesel. Similarly, No. 1 diesel fuel (15 ppm or lower) was blended with biodiesel on volume basis at the 1% and 2% levels. An independent laboratory conducted SLBOCLE tests to determine the lubricity of each blend. The number two fuel, when blended at the rate of 1% and 2% exceeded lubricity standards currently proposed for diesel fuel used in Europe. The number one fuel blended at the rate of 1% and 2% biodiesel failed to meet lubricity standards currently proposed for diesel fuel used in Europe. © 2008 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Environmental context. The dwindling fossil fuel sources have led to a major interest in expanding the use of bioenergy. While biodiesel is moving towards the mainstream as an alternative source of energy, a thorough understanding of the potential impact and risk posed by spills of biodiesel and biodiesel fuel mixtures should be obtained. We present new data here that will allow the prediction of biodiesel behaviour and the extent of contamination in soils and groundwater in the event of such a spill. Abstract. Partition coefficients of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) between biodiesel fuel mixtures (i.e. B1, B5, and B20) and water were determined by the frequently applied estimation method of Raoult's law. The experimental partition coefficients were compared with calculation by polyparameter linear free energy relationship (PP-LFER) approaches. Deviations from poor recovery of PAHs from the aqueous phase in partition experiments and parameters in the PP-LFER equation are discussed. The results suggest that the extent of deviation from ideal behaviour for biodieselwater partitioning is relatively small (i.e. errors remain within a factor of two). The concentrations of PAHs in water in equilibrium with these biodiesel fuel mixtures, estimated from the model presented, may be considered as a reasonable approximation for most field-scale applications. © CSIRO 2008.

AB  - One of the more promising sources for second-generation biofuels is microalgae , which make oil naturally, as much as 75% (dry weight) in some especially high-yielding species. Cells can be harvested and then processed to make biocrude, which can be further refined to make (bio)diesel, jet fuel, and gasoline. Alternatively, algal strains that produce more carbohydrates and less oil can be processed and fermented to produce ethanol, and the residual proteins can be used for animal feed. A discussion covers growing algae in open-air raceway ponds; photobioreactor, a closed tubular system for cultivating microalgae; Solazyme?s process of growing algae; future algal biofuels; companies exploring algae as a fuel source; and the future of algal biofuels.

AB  - Researchers are looking forward to use algae as an alternative feedstock to produce biofuels. The fat and lipids of algae can produce biodiesel, while sugars of an algae can be transformed into ethanol. The US government is encouraging the research on algae to develop algae-based biofuels. Algae can be produced by using waste or sea water and can help to reduce carbon dioxide and greenhouse emission. Shell made a joint venture with HR Biopetroleum and started a pilot plant for producing algae on commercial level. Algae is a suitable feedstock that can be used to produce diesel-type fuels with low carbon dioxide emission. Aurantia in association GreenFuel is planning to develop a 100ha greenhouse for producing 25,000 tonnes of algae biomass per years. LiveFuels and Sandia National Laboratories are jointly making efforts for commercial biodiesel production.

AB  - Biodiesel is popularly discussed in many countries due to increased environmental awareness and the limited supply of petroleum. One of the main factors impacting general replacement of diesel by biodiesel is NOx (nitrogen oxides) emissions. Previous studies have shown higher NOx emissions relative to petroleum diesel in traditional direct-injection (DI) diesel engines. In this study, effects of injection timing and different biodiesel blends are studied for low load [2 bar IMEP (indicated mean effective pressure)] conditions. The results show that maximum heat release rate can be reduced by retarding fuel injection. Ignition and peak heat release rate are both delayed for fuels containing more biodiesel. Retarding the injection to post-TDC (top dead center) lowers the peak heat release and flattens the heat release curve. It is observed that low-temperature combustion effectively reduces NOx emissions because less thermal NOx is formed. Although biodiesel combustion produces more NOx for both conventional and late-injection strategies, with the latter leading to a low-temperature combustion mode, the levels of NOx of B20 (20 vol % soy biodiesel and 80 vol % European low-sulfur diesel), B50, and B100 all with post-TDC injection are 68.1%, 66.7%, and 64.4%, respectively, lower than pure European low-sulfur diesel in the conventional injection scenario. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biomass fuel combustion for residential energy significantly influences both emissions and the atmospheric burden of aerosols in world regions, i.e., east and south Asia. This study reports measurements of climate-relevant properties of particles emitted from biomass fuels widely used for cooking in south Asia, in laboratory experiments simulating actual cooking in the region. Fuel burn rates of 1-2 kg h-1 for wood species, and 1.5-2 kg h -1 for crop residues and dried cattle dung, influenced PM 2.5 emission factors which were 1.7-2 g kg-1 at low burn rates but 5-9 gkg-1 at higher burn rates. Total carbon accounted for 45-55% and ions and trace elements for 2-12% of PM2.5 mass. The elemental carbon (EC) content was variable and highest (22-35%) in particles emitted from low burn rate combustion (wood and jute stalks) but significantly lower (2-4%) from high burn rate combustion (dried cattle dung and rice straw). The mass absorption cross-section (MAC, m2 g-1) correlated with EC content for strongly absorbing particles. Weakly absorbing particles, from straw and dung combustion, showed absorption that could not be explained by EC content alone. On average, the MAC of biofuel emission particles was significantly higher than reported measurements from forest fires but somewhat lower than those from diesel engines, indicating potential to significantly influence atmospheric absorption. Both for a given fuel and across different fuels, increased burn rates result in higher emission rates of PM2.5, larger organic carbon (OC) content larger average particle sizes, and lower MAC. Larger mean particle size (0.42-1.31 μm MMAD) and organic carbon content, than in emissions from combustion sources like diesels, have potential implications for hygroscopic growth and cloud nucleation behavior of these aerosols. These measurements can be used to refine regional emission inventories and derive optical parametrizations, for climate modeling, representative of regions dominated by primary particles from biomass fuel combustion. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Microalgal lipids are the oils of future for sustainable biodiesel production. However, relatively high production costs due to low lipid productivity have been one of the major obstacles impeding their commercial production. We studied the effects of nitrogen sources and their concentrations on cell growth and lipid accumulation of Neochloris oleoabundans, one of the most promising oil-rich microalgal species. While the highest lipid cell content of 0.40 g/g was obtained at the lowest sodium nitrate concentration (3 mM), a remarkable lipid productivity of 0.133 g l-1 day-1 was achieved at 5 mM with a lipid cell content of 0.34 g/g and a biomass productivity of 0.40 g l-1 day-1. The highest biomass productivity was obtained at 10 mM sodium nitrate, with a biomass concentration of 3.2 g/l and a biomass productivity of 0.63 g l-1 day-1. It was observed that cell growth continued after the exhaustion of external nitrogen pool, hypothetically supported by the consumption of intracellular nitrogen pools such as chlorophyll molecules. The relationship among nitrate depletion, cell growth, lipid cell content, and cell chlorophyll content are discussed. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Twenty-seven types of plants found to contain more than 25% of oil (w/w) were selectively examined from 44 species. Saponification number (SN), iodine value (IV), cetane number (CN) and viscosity (η) of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) of oils were empirically determined, and they varied from 182 to 262, 3.60 to 142.70, 39.32 to 65.80 and 2.29 to 3.95, respectively. Fatty acid compositions, IV, CN and η were used to predict the quality of FAMEs for use as biodiesel. FAMEs of plant oils of 15 species were found to be most suitable for use as biodiesel by meeting the major specification of biodiesel standards of Thailand, USA and European Standard Organization. The oils from these 15 species were further investigated for the conversion efficiency of biodiesel in lipase-catalyzed transesterification reaction with Novozyme 435 and Lipozyme RM IM. Oils of four species, palm (Elaeis guineensis), physic nut (Jatropha curcas), papaya (Carica papaya) and rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum), can be highly converted to biodiesel by transesterification using Novozyme 435- or Lipozyme RM IM-immobilized lipase as catalyst. Therefore, these selected plants would be economically considered as the feedstock for biodiesel production by biocatalyst. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study analyses the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of crude palm oil (CPO) and palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) production in northern Borneo (Malaysia), their transport to the Netherlands and their co-firing with natural gas for electricity production. In the case of CPO, conversion to biodiesel and the associated GHG emissions are also studied. This study follows the methodology suggested by the Dutch Commission on Sustainable Biomass (Cramer Commission). The results demonstrate that land use change is the most decisive factor in overall GHG emissions and that palm oil energy chains based on land that was previously natural rainforest or peatland have such large emissions that they cannot meet the 50-70% GHG emission reduction target set by the Cramer Commission. However, if CPO production takes place on degraded land, management of CPO production is improved, or if the by-product PFAD is used for electricity production, the emission reduction criteria can be met, and palm-oil-based electricity can be considered sustainable from a GHG emission point of view. Even though the biodiesel base case on logged-over forest meets the Cramer Commission's emission reduction target for biofuels of 30%, other cases, such as oil palm plantations on degraded land and improved management, can achieve emissions reductions of more than 150%, turning oil palm plantations into carbon sinks. In order for bioenergy to be sustainably produced from palm oil and its derivatives, degraded land should be used for palm oil production and management should be improved. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents experimental test results of a diesel engine using additive-added palm biodiesel (it is also known as palmdiesel) obtained from palm oil. The test results obtained are brake power, specific fuel consumption (SFC), exhaust emissions and anti-wear characteristics of fuel's contaminated lubricants. A computer-controlled dynamometer-engine test bed was used to measure engine brake power and SFC at half throttle condition with a speed range of 1000-4000 rpm. The emission test was done with a dynamometer fixed load of 50 Nm and constant engine speed of 2250 rpm. A total of three fuels, such as 100% diesel fuel (B0); 20% palm diesel and 80% B0 (B20); and B20 with X% additive (B20X), were selected for this investigation. The B20X is the additive-added biodiesel, where X is the parentage (in this investigation X=1% of B20) of additive in B20 fuel. Anti-wear characteristics in terms of coefficient of friction, wear scar diameter (WSD) and flash temperature parameter (FTP) of fuel's contaminated lubricants were measured using a tribometer test. It was found that B20X fuel shows better overall performance such as improved brake power, reduced exhaust emissions and shows better lube oil quality as compared to other tested fuels. This is mainly due to the effect of fuel additive in the blended fuel of B20. The specific objective of this investigation is to develop the performance of B20 fuel by using an in-house-formulated fuel additive. Detailed results have been presented with discussions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present work, a novel method for immobilization of lipase within hydrophilic polyurethane foams using polyglutaraldehyde was developed for the immobilization of Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase to produce biodiesel with canola oil and methanol. The enzyme optimum conditions were not affected by immobilization and the optimum pH for free and immobilized enzyme were 6, resulting in 80% immobilization yield. Using the immobilized lipase T. lanuginosus, the effects of enzyme loading, oil/alcohol molar ratio, water concentration, and temperature in the transesterification reaction were investigated. The optimal conditions for processing 20 g of refined canola oil were: 430 μg lipase, 1:6 oil/methanol molar ratio, 0.1 g water and 40 °C for the reactions with methanol. Maximum methyl esters yield was 90% of which enzymatic activity remained after 10 batches, when tert-butanol was adopted to remove by-product glycerol during repeated use of the lipase. The immobilized lipase proved to be stable and lost little activity when was subjected to repeated uses. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examines the effect of unsaturation on the combustion of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). New experimental results were obtained for the oxidation of methyl (E)-2-butenoate (MC, unsaturated C4 FAME) and methyl butanoate (MB, saturated C4 FAME) in a jet-stirred reactor (JSR) at atmospheric pressure under dilute conditions over the temperature range 850-1400 K, and two equivalence ratios (Φ = 0.375, 0.75) with a residence time of 0.07 s. The results consist of concentration profiles of the reactants, stable intermediates, and final products, measured by probe sampling followed by on-line and off-line gas chromatography analyses. The oxidation of MC and MB in the JSR and under counterflow diffusion flame conditions was modeled using a new detailed chemical kinetic reaction mechanism (301 species and 1516 reactions) derived from previous schemes proposed in the literature. The laminar counterflow flame and JSR (for φ{symbol} = 1.13) experimental results used were from a previous study on the comparison of the combustion of both compounds. Sensitivity analyses and reaction path analyses, based on rates of reaction, were used to interpret the results. The data and the model show that MC has reaction pathways analogous to that of MB under the present conditions. The model of MC oxidation provides a better understanding of the effect of the ester function on combustion, and the effect of unsaturation on the combustion of fatty acid methyl ester compounds typically found in biodiesel. © 2008 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - This paper expands the consideration of the factors affecting the nanostructure and oxidative reactivity of diesel soot to include the impact of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Past work showed that soot derived from oxygenated fuels such as biodiesel carries some surface oxygen functionality and thereby possesses higher reactivity than soot from conventional diesel fuel. In this work, results show that EGR exerts a strong influence on the physical properties of the soot which leads to enhanced oxidation rate. HRTEM images showed a dramatic difference between the burning modes of the soot generated under 0 and 20% EGR. The soot produced under 0% EGR strictly followed an external burning mode with no evidence of internal burning. In contrast, soot generated under 20% EGR exhibited dual burning modes: slow external burning and rapid internal burning. The results demonstrate clearly that highly reactive soot can be achieved by manipulating the physical properties of the soot via EGR. © 2008 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - The Thai government plans to wean Thai consumers from hydrocarbon-based fuels. By 2011, 10.3% of the country's total energy mix will come from renewable energy, of which 2.5% will be biofuel. By 2030, consumption of conventional diesel fuel will be reduced from the current 66% of the transportation fuel mix to 45%; conventional gasoline from the current 28 to 16%. The balance will come from alternative fuels, including natural gas, biogas, ethanol, and biodiesel. In certain parts of Thailand, a bioenergy complex is being set up for the smallholder farm system, ranging in size from 500 to 4000 L/day. Thailand has two biodiesel standards, i.e., based on the EU standard and a less-stringent, simple standard for industrial use. The feedstocks being used at these biodiesel plants is mostly the solid part of palm oil or stearin, a by-product of pal oil, which is very unhealthy for human consumption so it is better to use it as feedstock. By 2011, Thailand's biodiesel production is expected to increase to 3 million L/day.

AB  - Three kinetic models of the transesterification of palm oil fatty acids to ethanol using an immobilized lipase were developed. The models differ from one another with respect to the rate-limiting step and the point at which the ethanol molecule becomes involved in the reaction. The kinetic parameters were estimated by fitting experimental data of the transesterification of palm oil with various ethanol concentrations. The models are able to account for the effects of substrates and products involved in the transesterification throughout the entire reaction. There was a good agreement between experimental results and those predicted by the proposed model equations in which ethanol was assumed to be involved directly in an alcoholysis reaction with palm oil. Furthermore, the calculated results show that the rate constants for alcoholysis of palm oil with ethanol are much higher than those for the hydrolysis reaction. From the proposed model equations, the effects of ethanol concentration on the initial production rates and yields of fatty acid ethyl ester and free fatty acids were simulated. The simulation results show that increasing the initial ethanol concentration produces an increase in the initial production rate and yield of fatty acid ethyl ester and lowers the final concentration of free fatty acid whereas lower ethanol concentration led to a higher final concentration of free fatty acid. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A new method which coupled the two-phase solvent extraction (TSE) with the synthesis of biodiesel was studied. Investigations were carried out on transesterification of methanol with oil-hexane solution coming from TSE process in the presence of sodium hydroxide as the catalyst. Biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters) were the products of transesterification. The influential factors of transesterification, such as reaction time, catalyst concentration, mole ratio of methanol to oil and reaction temperature were optimized. The results showed that the optimal reaction parameters were sodium hydroxide concentration 1.1% by weight of rapeseed oil, mole ratio of methanol to oil 9:1, reaction time 120 min, and reaction temperature 55-60 °C. Under these conditions, the TG conversion would rise up to 98.2%. Based on the new method, biodiesel production process could be simplified and the biodiesel cost could be reduced. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A technique to produce biodiesel from crude Zanthoxylum bungeanum seed oil (ZSO) with high free fatty acids (FFA) was developed. The acid value of ZSO was reduced to 1.16 mg KOH/g from 45.51 mg KOH/g by only one-step acid-catalyzed esterification with methanol-to-oil molar ratio 24:1, H2SO4 2%, temperature 60 °C and reaction time 80 min, which was selected as optimum for the acid-catalyzed esterification. During the acid-catalyzed esterification, FFA was converted into fatty acid methyl esters, which was confirmed by 1H NMR spectrum. Compared with the other two-step pretreatment procedure, this one-step pretreatment can reduce the production cost of ZSO biodiesel. Alkaline-catalyzed transesterification converted the pretreated ZSO into ZSO biodiesel. The yield of ZSO biodiesel was above 98% determined by 1H NMR spectrum. This study supports the use of crude ZSO as a viable and valuable raw feedstock for biodiesel production. Crown Copyright © 2008.

AB  - The production of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) by direct in situ alkaline-catalyzed transesterification of the triglycerides (TG) in cottonseeds was examined. The experimental results showed that the amount of cottonseed oil dissolved in methanol was approximately 99% of the total oil and the conversion of this oil could achieve 98% under the following conditions: less than 2% moisture content in cottonseed flours, 0.3-0.335 mm particle size, 0.1 mol/L NaOH concentration in methanol, 135:1 methanol/oil mole ratio, 40 °C reaction temperature and 3 h reaction time. Further, the effects of co-solvent petroleum ether and methanol recycling on the cottonseed oil extraction and conversion were also investigated. The use of alkaline methanol as extraction and reaction solvent, which would be useful for extraction oil and gossypol, would reduce the gossypol content in the cottonseed meal. The free and total gossypol contents in the cottonseed meal obtained from in situ alkaline transesterification were far below the FAO standard. And the nontoxic cottonseed meal could be used as animal protein feed resources. Crown Copyright © 2008.

AB  - Rapid changes in upland farming systems in Southeast Asia generated predominantly by increased population pressure and 'market forces' have resulted in widespread land degradation that has been well documented at the plot scale. Yet, the links between agricultural activities in the uplands and downstream off-site effects remain largely unknown because of the difficulties in transferring results from plots to a larger scale. Many authors have thus pointed out the need for long-term catchment studies. The objective of this paper is to summarize the results obtained by the Management of Soil Erosion Consortium (MSEC) over the last 5 years from 27 catchments in five countries (Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam). The purpose of the study was to assess the impacts of cultivation practices on annual runoff and erosion rates. Initial surveys in each catchment included topography, soils and land use. Monitoring included climatic, hydrologic and erosion (total sediment yield including bed load and suspended sediment load) data, land use and crop yields, and farmers' income. In addition, new land management options were introduced through consultations with farmers and evaluated in terms of runoff and erosion. These included tree plantations, fruit trees, improved fallow with legumes, maize intercropped with legumes, planted fodder, native grass strips and agro-ecological practices (direct sowing and mulch-based conservation agriculture). Regressions analyses showed that runoff during the rainy season, and normalized runoff flow coefficient based on erosive rainfall during the rainy season (rainfall with intensity exceeding 25 mm h-1) increase with the percentage of the catchment covered by maize. Both variables decrease with increasing soil depth, standard deviation of catchment slope (that reflects terrain roughness), and the percentages of the catchment covered by fallow (regular and improved), tree plantations and planted fodder. The best predictors of sediment yield were the surface percentages of maize, Job's tears, cassava and footpaths. The main conclusions generated from this study were: (i) soil erosion is predominantly influenced by land use rather than environmental characteristics not only at the plot scale but also at the catchment scale; (ii) slash-and-burn shifting cultivation with sufficiently long rotations (1 year of cultivation, 8 years of fallow) is too often unjustly blamed for degradation; (iii) in its place, continuous cropping of maize and cassava promotes high rates of soil erosion at the catchment scale; (iv) conservation technologies are efficient in reducing runoff and total sediment yield at the catchment scale; (v) the adoption of improved soil management technologies by upland farmers is not a function of the degree of intensification of their farming system and/or of their incomes. The results suggest that if expansion of maize and cassava into already degraded upland systems were to occur due to increased demand for biofuels, there is a risk of higher runoff and sediment generation. A failure to adopt appropriate land use management strategies will result in further rapid resource degradation with negative impacts to downstream communities. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, commercially available two different diesel fuels were blended with the biodiesels produced from six different vegetable oils (sunflower, canola, soybean, cottonseed, corn oils and waste palm oil). The blends (B2, B5, B10, B20, B50 and B75) were prepared on a volume basis. The key fuel properties such as density and viscosities of the blends were measured by following ASTM test methods. Generalized equations for predicting the density and viscosities for the blends were given and a mixing equation, originally proposed by Arrhenius and described by Grunberg and Nissan, was used to predict the viscosities of the blends. For all blends, it was found that there is an excellent agreement between the measured and estimated values of the density and viscosities. According to the results, the density and viscosities of the blends increased with the increase of biodiesel concentration in the fuel blend. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The spark for this paper about biofuel and bioplastics was stimulated by a newspaper article from January 2007. The news said: prices of corn on the Chicago stock exchange have reached their record level, and the corn stocks fell to their lowest level in the last ten years. The reason for the growing prices of corn and the falling stocks was the decision made by President G. W. Bush that 10 % of fuel is to be insured on the basis of ethanol. This was just the finalisation idea of one of the most important trends in the past several decades, to transform agricultural products instead into food for living beings to food for machinery, biofuel. And put the prices of food for living beings as high as possible, with the argumentation that this has a positive influence on the effect of greenhouse gases. According to big producers of polymers, agricultural products should also be used for the production of plastics via biorefining, but in much smaller amount. This is part of the trend to make all from nature, but this is not the truth. Agricultural products are not a product of nature, they are the result of human knowledge and efforts. Pure natural products are: natural gas, crude or mineral oil or natural rubber from plants in the rainforest of Amazonia. We analysed the concept "everything from the grown matter" using our self-developed culturological analysis, containing technical, economical, and social criterions but no influence of ideologies. We asked the question how to reduce the generation of greenhouse gases, especially CO2, and how to utilise this gas. We got some answers from papers of G. Menges. Two concepts of production of plastics from growing matter, the DuPont concept of sustainability and sustainable polymers of GE Plastics (now Sabic) are described in detail. The conclusion is: any waste, such as waste biomass, needs to be processed in all available ways. At the same time, the concept to produce everything from grown matter: plastics, fuel, textile, leather, etc., is socially absolutely unacceptable.

AB  - The pursuit of so-called "green jobs" - employment that contributes to protecting the environment and reducing humanity's carbon foot-print - will be a key economic driver of the 21st century. "Climate-proofing" the global economy will involve large-scale investments in new technologies, equipment, buildings, and infrastructure, which will provide a major stimulus for much-needed new employment and an opportunity for retaining and transforming existing jobs. The number of green jobs is on the rise. The renewable energy sector has seen rapid expansion in recent years, with current employment in renewables and supplier industries estimated at a conservative 2.3 million worldwide. The wind power industry employs some 300,000 people, the solar photovoltaics (PV) sector an estimated 170,000, and the solar thermal industry more than 600,000. More than I million jobs are found in the biofuels industry growing and processing a variety of feedstocks into ethanol and biodiesel. Construction jobs can be greened by ensuring that new buildings meet high performance standards. And retrofitting existing buildings to make them more energy-efficient has huge job potential for construction workers, architects, energy auditors, engineers, and others. The weatherization of some 200,000 apartments in Germany created 25,000 new jobs and helped retain 116,000 existing jobs in 2002-04. The transportation industry is a cornerstone of modern economics, but it also has the fastest-rising carbon emissions of any sector. Relatively green auto manufacturing jobs - those in manufacturing the most-efficient cars currently available - today number no more than about 250,000 out of roughly 8 million in the auto sector worldwide. Modern rail and urban transit systems offer a greener alternative, but they need fresh commitment and investments to reverse the job erosion of recent decades. In growing numbers of cities, good jobs are being generated by the emergence of bus rapid transit systems. There are also substantial green employment opportunities in retrofitting old diesel buses to reduce air pollutants and in replacing old equipment with cleaner compressed natural gas (CNG) or hybrid-electric buses. In New Delhi, the introduction of 6,100 CNG buses by 2009 is expected to create 18,000 new jobs. The steel, aluminum, cement, and paper industries are highly energy-intensive and polluting. But increasing scrap use, greater energy efficiency, and reliance on alternative energy sources may at least render them a pale shade of green. Worldwide, more than 40 percent of steel output and one-quarter of aluminum production is based on recycled scrap, possibly employing more than a quarter million people. Recycling and remanufacturing jobs worldwide number many millions, but incompatible definitions and a lack of data gathering make a global tally impossible. China alone is thought to have some 10 million jobs in this sector, and the United States has more than 1 million. In developing countries, recycling is often done by informal networks of scavengers. Brazil, which boasts a high rate of aluminum recycling, relies on some 500,000 scrap collectors. Cairo's 70,000 Zabaleen recycle as much as 85 percent of the materials they collect. Agriculture and forestry often still account for the bulk of employment and livelihoods in many developing countries. Small farms are more labor- and knowledge-intensive than agroindustrial farms are, and they use fewer energy and chemical inputs. But relatively sustainable forms of smallholder agriculture are being squeezed hard by energy- and pesticide-intensive farms and by global supply chains. Organic farming is still limited. But because it is more labor-intensive than industrialized agriculture, it can be a source of growing green employment. Afforestation and reforestation efforts, as well as better stewardship of critical ecosystems more generally, could support livelihoods among the more than 1 billion people who depend on forests, often through non-timber forest products. Planting trees creates large numbers of jobs, although these are often seasonal and low paid. Agroforestry, which combines tree planting with traditional farming, offers significant environmental benefits in degraded areas - including carbon sequestration. Some 1.2 billion people already depend on it to some extent. There is additional job potential in efforts to adapt to, and cope with, climate change. Building flood barriers, terracing land, and rehabilitating wetlands is labor-intensive work. Efforts to protect croplands from environmental degradation and to adapt farming to climate change by raising water efficiency, preventing erosion, planting trees, using conservation tillage, and rehabilitating degraded crop and pastureland can also support rural livelihoods. The potential for green jobs is immense. But much of it will not materialize without massive and sustained investments in the public and private sectors. Governments need to establish a firm framework for greening all aspects of the economy, with the help of targets and mandates, business incentives, and reformed tax and subsidy policies. It will also be critical to develop innovative forms of technology transfer to spread green methods around the world at the scale and speed required to avoid full-fledged climate change. Cooperative technology development and technology-sharing programs could help expedite the process of replicating best practices. To provide as many workers as possible with the qualifications they will increasingly need, an expansion of green education, training, and skill-building programs in a broad range of occupations is crucial. Resource extraction and energy-intensive industries are likely to feel the greatest impact in transitioning to a low-carbon future, and regions and communities highly dependent on them will need assistance in diversifying their economic base, creating alternative jobs and livelihoods, and acquiring new skills. This is known as a "just transition." Green jobs need to be decent jobs - offering good wages and income security, safe working conditions, dignity at work, and adequate workers' rights. Sadly, this is not always the case today. Recycling work is sometimes precarious, involving serious occupational health hazards and often generating less than living wages and incomes. Growing crops at biofuels plantations in countries like Brazil, Colombia, Malaysia, and Indonesia often involves excessive workloads, poor pay, exposure to pesticides, and oppression of workers. These cautionary aspects highlight the need for sustainable employment to be good not only for the environment but also for the people holding the jobs. Still, an economy that reconciles human aspirations with the planet's limits is eminently possible.

AB  - Despite a heightened focus on sustainable transport and the increased use of biofuels, few studies have assessed the effects of such changes on a wider range of parameters. The aim of this study was to assess sugar beet transport in Scania, Sweden to determine how a switch to improved European vehicle standards and biodiesel impacts not only CO2 releases, but also the parameters of regional land use and air pollutants. The study estimated lorry travel distances by using a GIS-based proximity analysis. It then calculated fuel use and air emissions from standard diesel fuel for 2003 and for the vehicle standard improvements or biodiesel alternatives. Proximity analysis results revealed that roughly 4.2M km were travelled in moving beets to sugar processing facilities, resulting in the use of 2200 m3 of diesel and release of 5700 tons CO2. The shift to newer vehicle types improved fuel use efficiency and emissions. The switch to the biodiesel alternatives resulted in general decreases in air emissions, but increased fuel use and NOX emissions. The regional land needed to grow the biodiesel feedstock for beet transport ranged from 270 to 2700 ha, which can be considered an important obstacle when a switch is made by the greater road transport system. © The Authors.

AB  - Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector may be the most difficult aspect of climate change mitigation. We suggest that carbon neutral hydrocarbons CNHCs) offer an alternative pathway for deep emission cuts that complement the use of decarbonized energy carriers. Such fuels are synthesized from atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon neutral hydrogen. The result is a liquid fuel compatible with the existing transportation infrastructure and therefore capable of a gradual deployment with minimum supply disruption. Capturing the atmospheric CO 2 can be accomplished using biomass or industrial methods referred to as air capture. The viability of biomass fuels is strongly dependent on the environmental impacts of biomass production. Strong constraints on land use may favour the use of air capture. We conclude that CNHCs may be a viable alternative to hydrogen or conventional biofuels and warrant a comparable level of research effort and support. © 2008 The Royal Society.

AB  - In Europe, Biofuels like Rapeseed Oil or RME are commonly used to replace diesel fuel. Other Biofuels gain attraction worldwide, for example palm oil seems to be a good alternate fuel regarding the quantity of oil per hectare. Especially this fuel is prone to be used in stationary engines. On the other hand, these fuels need to be treated in the right way to use them without harm to the engine. Storage, chemical and physical properties differ from diesel fuel, and for durability reasons, raw fuels are not acceptable for engine use. The fuels have to be refined, purified or treated in another way to be burned in an engine. In case of palm oil, the fuel system of the engine is similar to an HFO-engine due to the high viscosity of the fuel. In addition to that, the engine has to be applicated to the given biofuel to reach best efficiency and emission values. Nevertheless, more nozzle coking and ash deposits are observed compared to diesel fuel. Furthermore, oil monitoring is necessary as coagulation of engine oil with fuel may happen, resulting at least in an engine damage.

AB  - Creating a clean and safe environment has always been a challenge for researchers throughout the world. The use of fossil fuel has been a deterrent in attaining this objective. Therefore, attention has been focused on biofuels to suit this objective. In recent years, efforts have been directed towards environmentally friendly sources of alternate fuels for diesel engines. This paper compares the performance and emission characteristics of biofuels with mineral no. 2 diesel oil. A direct injection diesel engine coupled with an eddy current dynamometer is used for this investigation. Rice bran oil and neem oil are considered as biofuels for this work since they are renewable in nature. Rice bran oil is extracted from rice bran, which is a by-product of the rice milling process. Neem oil is derived from neem seed, which are abundantly available in India. In addition to these oils, their blends with diesel are also used to test their ability for reducing emissions. This study indicated that, among the two bio- fuels, the rice bran oil and its blend shows better results with respect to emissions than the neem oil and its blend. The results for the rice bran oil and its blend are slightly better than those of diesel and superior to pure neem oil and its blend. The unburned hydrocarbon (UBHC) emissions of biofuels and their blends are lower when compared with diesel. Biofuels show lower nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions when com- pared with diesel and biofuel blends. It was observed that the smoke intensities of all the fuels tested are similar up to 50% loads. At higher loads, biofuels and their blends showed slightly higher smoke intensities than diesel. © 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - For the comparison of emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from diesel, biodiesel and its 20% blend with diesel, and their carcinogenic potencies, an experimental study has been conducted on a turbocharged, intercooled and direct injection diesel engine. Total PAHs (solid and gas) from diesel, B20 and B100 at low load were more than those at high loads. Total PAH emissions from the test fuels at the rated speed were more than those at maximum torque speed. Benzo[a] pyrene (BaP) brake specific emission of biodiesel is less than that of diesel. LMW-PAH emissions for the test fuels are all higher than those of MMW and HMW PAH. Biodiesel and B20 reduce both the total Benzo[a]pyrene equivalent concentration (BaPeq) and the total mean-PAHs as compared to commercial diesel fuel. BSFC of the engine increased but its brake power decreased in the cases of B20 and biodiesel.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable fuel mostly derived from vegetable oils, which has gained greater importance as an alternative source to petroleum derivatives due to its vital role in producing a cleaner environment. While most of the biodiesel-based research has focused on edible and non-edible vegetable oils, very little time has been devoted to the investigation of the use of rice bran oil, especially in its crude form with high levels of free fatty acids (FFA). Since crude rice bran oil (CRBO) with high FFA is not used as edible oil, it can be considered as a potential source of non-edible vegetable oil for utilization as a feedstock for biodiesel production. In the present investigation, high FFA CRBO was subjected to esterification and transesterification processes and the crude rice bran oil methyl ester (CRBME) obtained was tested in a compression ignition (CI) engine to determine its ability to replace petroleum diesel and lead to a reduction in pollutants. A 4.4 kW, four-stroke, direct-injection, air-cooled, stationary diesel engine was used in this investigation. CRBME has less emission of unburned hydrocarbon (UBHC), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and smoke density with a marginal increase in carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, when compared with diesel. It was also observed that the brake thermal efficiency of the engine was not affected when the engine was fueled with CRBME. From the experimental results, it is concluded that CRBO with high FFA has better emission characteristics than diesel without any associated loss of power. Hence CRBO with high FFA can be effectively used as a biofuel for the generation of a cleaner environment. © 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Technology and equipment are developed for the production of biodiesel fuel from agricultural raw material based on using heterogeneous catalysts for re-eterification and hydrorefining. The physicochemical and chemotopological properties of specimens of biodiesel fuels with a different content of fatty acid methyl esters are evaluated. The results obtained make it possible to conclude that biodiesel fuels with a fatty acid methyl ester content up to 20% (wt.) satisfy the standards according to the GOST, but with a content of more than 20% (wt.) they do not correspond to the GOST and may not be used in contemporary diesel engines not adapted for biofuel. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - Due to changes in carbon stock of soil and biomass, indirect land-use change (ILUC) has consequences on greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of a biofuel that are not presently considered in evaluation of environmental merits of biofuels. Significant changes in land-use are expected to occur in biofuel producing countries and their consequences may affect global markets. This paper aims to: 1) Review state-of-art of accounting for indirect effects in biofuels production and their influence on GHG balance of a biofuel pathway; 2) Present a model to estimate and optimize GHG emissions from LUC; and 3) Estimate potential GHG emissions for the case of soybean-based biodiesel production. ILUC concepts and a classification of ILUC sources are proposed. Then a methodological framework to quantify GHG emissions is discussed and applied to the case study. Different scenarios to achieve demand are proposed and their implications related to ILUC are determined. Using a system-wide approach and a non-linear programming (NLP) model, GHG emissions are evaluated in terms of carbon pay back time and optimized based on soybean supply strategy to produce biodiesel.

AB  - This paper presents results of a multi-cylinder diesel engine operated on blends of ordinary coconut oil (COCO; 10%, 20%,30%,40%,50%) with ordinary diesel oil (OD). Methyl esters from cooking oil are less encouraging to be used as biofuel. because this affects food-fuel crisis. However, biofuel obtained from waste cooking oil is more appreciated due to energy savings and environmental issues. Test results indicated that COCO blended fuels (10-30 %) produced similar brake power and net heat release rate as OD. Increasing coconut oil in blend decreases exhaust emissions. Carbon deposited on injector nozzles was observed where no hard carbon was found on injector tip when engine run on COCO blends.

AB  - Whereas microbial fermentation processes for producing ethanol and related alcohol biofuels are well established, biodiesel (methyl esters of fatty acids) is exclusively derived from plant oils. Slow cycle times for engineering oilseed metabolism and the excessive accumulation of glycerol as a byproduct are two major drawbacks of deriving biodiesel from plants. Although most bacteria produce fatty acids as cell envelope precursors, the biosynthesis of fatty acids is tightly regulated at multiple levels. By introducing four distinct genetic changes into the E. coli genome, we have engineered an efficient producer of fatty acids. Under fed-batch, defined media fermentation conditions, 2.5 g/L fatty acids were produced by this metabolically engineered E. coli strain, with a specific productivity of 0.024 g/h/g dry cell mass and a peak conversion efficiency of 4.8% of the carbon source into fatty acid products. At least 50% of the fatty acids produced were present in the free acid form. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The world sugar industry is predominantly focused on supplying two end markets, sweeteners and ethanol. Virent Energy System's BioForming process provides new market opportunities to the sugar industry by enabling the conversion of sugar-based feedstocks into conventional liquid fuels and chemicals. The renewable gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel produced using Virent's BioForming technology match petroleum fuels in composition, functionality, and performance. They can be stand-alone products, used at high blends with petroleum fuels, or blended with ethanol. A key component of the process is Virent's patented aqueous phase reforming (APR) technology that converts sugars into hydrogen and chemical intermediates that can be further processed into gasoline, diesel, or jet fuel components. The ability to produce multiple products from a single feedstock makes possible a true biorefinery in which the production of fuels or chemicals can be varied based on current market conditions. The BioForming process offers distinct advantages to conventional ethanol production. The process uses minimal energy to convert a broad range of conventional and non-food feedstocks into an array of energy-dense fuels that are compatible with today's engine and pipeline infrastructure, in addition, the BioForming process has the ability to process C5 sugars, derived from the hemicellulose fraction of bagasse, increasing the fuel product yields per acre by more than 30 percent versus processing sucrose alone. The BioForming technology significantly expands the options available to sugar producers for adding value to their primary sugar crops and for addressing new markets. Preliminary economic analysis suggests that converting sugars to conventional liquid fuels using Virent's BioForming process can economically compete with petroleum fuels at crude oil prices greater than $60/bbl.

AB  - Biomass and bio-fuels have gained a growing interest as sustainable and renewable energy. In this paper, we perform a citation network analysis of scientific publications to know the current structure of biomass and bio-fuel research. By clustering and visualizing the network, we revealed their taxonomic structure. Emerging technologies are detected by analyzing the average publication year of clusters. According to the results, bio-diesel and hydrogen production are the most rapidly developing domains among biomass bio-fuel researches. We also analyzed the position of each cluster in the global structure of research. By using citation counts within and out of the cluster, we categorized each cluster into the following four categories: (I) topic specific; (II) domain specific; (III) global link; and (IV) specific & global. For research domains of category (III) or (IV), it is difficult that single technology overcomes the current limitation of bio-energy productions. Research on lignocellulose feedstock is a typical case where knowledge from other scientific disciplines is necessary. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Among the existing environmental assessments of bioethanol, the studies suggesting an environmental benefit of bioethanol all ignore the constraints on the availability of biomass resources and the implications competition for biomass has on the assessment. We show that toward 2030, regardless of whether a global or European perspective is applied, the amount of biomass, which can become available for bioethanol or other energy uses, will be physically and economically constrained. This implies that use of biomass or land for bioethanol production will most likely happen at the expense of alternative uses. In this perspective, we show that for the case of a new advanced bioethanol technology, in terms of reducing greenhouse emissions and fossil fuel dependency, more is lost than gained when prioritizing biomass or land for bioethanol. Technology pathways involving heat and power production and/or biogas, natural gas or electricity for transport are advantageous. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

AB  - As the need for alternative transportation fuels increases, it is important to understand the many effects of introducing fuels based upon feedstocks other than petroleum. Water intensity in "gallons of water per mile traveled" is one method to measure these effects on the consumer level. In this paper we investigate the water intensity for light duty vehicle (LDV) travel using selected fuels based upon petroleum, natural gas, unconventional fossil fuels, hydrogen, electricity, and two biofuels (ethanol from corn and biodiesel from soy). Fuels more directly derived from fossil fuels are less water intensive than those derived either indirectly from fossil fuels (e.g., through electricity generation) or directly from biomass. The lowest water consumptive (&lt;0.15 gal H2O/mile) and withdrawal (&lt;1 gal H 2O/mile) rates are for LDVs using conventional petroleum-based gasoline and diesel, nonirrigated biofuels, hydrogen derived from methane or electrolysis via nonthermal renewable electricity, and electricity derived from nonthermal renewable sources. LDVs running on electricity and hydrogen derived from the aggregate U.S. grid (heavily based upon fossil fuel and nuclear steam-electric power generation) withdraw 5-20 times and consume nearly 2-5 times more water than by using petroleum gasoline. The water intensities (gal H2O/mile) of LDVs operating on biofuels derived from crops irrigated in the United States at average rates is 28 and 36 for corn ethanol (E85) for consumption and withdrawal, respectively. For soy-derived biodiesel the average consumption and withdrawal rates are 8 and 10 gal H2O/mile. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Owing to concerns about energy security and because of increased environmental awareness, the biofuel industry is expanding worldwide. It is therefore extremely important to be able to quantify the sustainability of biofuels in order to determine their benefits over using conventional fossil fuel derived transport fuels. This study investigates the total energy requirement and global warming potential (GWP) of the production of biodiesel from oilseed rape in the UK, using life cycle analyses. Large- and small-scale productions are compared and the sensitivity of these environmental impacts to production variables investigated. Possible changes to the processes are considered, with a view to reduce the energy requirement and global warming potential. This research shows that the scale of the production of biodiesel from oilseed rape in the UK, and the transport involved in the various stages of manufacture, has little effect on its global warming potential. It is also shown that if the rape meal and glycerol were combusted in combined heat and power plants, and the rate of application of nitrogenous fertiliser were reduced from 211 kg/ha to 100 kg/ha, the energy requirement and global warming potential savings from using biodiesel rather than ultra low sulphur diesel would increase dramatically, to 170% and 120%, respectively, on a basis of equivalent net energy content. © 2008 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Biodiesel is emerging as a renewable fuel, hence becoming a promising alternative to fossil fuels. Biodiesel can form blends with diesel in any ratio, and thus could replace partially, or even totally, diesel fuel in diesel engines what would bring a number of environmental, economical and social advantages. Although a number of studies are available on regulated substances, there is a gap of studies on unregulated substances, such as carbonyl compounds, emitted during the combustion of biodiesel, biodiesel-diesel and/or ethanol-biodiesel-diesel blends. CC is a class of hazardous pollutants known to be participating in photochemical smog formation. In this work a comparison was carried out between the two most widely used CC collection methods: C18 cartridges coated with an acid solution of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (2,4-DNPH) and impinger bottles filled in 2,4-DNPH solution. Sampling optimization was performed using a 22 factorial design tool. Samples were collected from the exhaust emissions of a diesel engine with biodiesel and operated by a steady-state dynamometer. In the central body of factorial design, the average of the sum of CC concentrations collected using impingers was 33.2 ppmV but it was only 6.5 ppmV for C18 cartridges. In addition, the relative standard deviation (RSD) was 4% for impingers and 37% for C18 cartridges. Clearly, the impinger system is able to collect CC more efficiently, with lower error than the C18 cartridge system. Furthermore, propionaldehyde was nearly not sampled by C18 system at all. For these reasons, the impinger system was chosen in our study. The optimized sampling conditions applied throughout this study were: two serially connected impingers each containing 10 mL of 2,4-DNPH solution at a flow rate of 0.2 L min-1 during 5 min. A profile study of the C1-C4 vapor-phase carbonyl compound emissions was obtained from exhaust of pure diesel (B0), pure biodiesel (B100) and biodiesel-diesel mixtures (B2, B5, B10, B20, B50, B75). The ΣCC of the emission concentrations were 20.5 ppmV for B0 and 15.7 ppmV for B100. When considering fuel blends, the measured ΣCC were 21.4 ppmV, 22.5 ppmV, 20.4 ppmV, 14.2 ppmV, 11.4 ppmV and 14.7 ppmV, respectively, for B2, B5, B10, B20, B50 and B75. Among the target CC, both formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were the major contributors to the observed total CC levels. Except for acrolein and formaldehyde, all CC showed a clear trend of reduction in the emissions from B2 to B100 (40% reduction, on average). Both individual and total CC emission factors (pg g-1 of fuel burnt) were calculated for all tested biodiesel-diesel blends. The lowest total CC emission factor (2271 pg g-1) was found when B50 was used; the individual emission factors determined (pg g-1) were: 539.7 (formaldehyde), 1411 (acetaldehyde), 30.83 (acrolein), and 310.7 (propionaldehyde). © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - High-purity fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) was produced from different lipids, such as soybean oil, canola oil, a hydrogenated palm oil/palm oil blend, yellow grease, and brown grease, combined with methanol using a continuous membrane reactor. The membrane reactor combines reaction and separation in a single unit, provides continuous mixing of raw materials, and maintains a high molar ratio of methanol to lipid in the reaction loop while maintaining two phases during the reaction. It was demonstrated that the membrane reactor can be operated using a very broad range of feedstocks at highly similar operating conditions to produce FAME. The total glycerine and free glycerine contents of the FAME produced were below the ASTM D6751 standard after a single reaction step. Under essentially the same reaction conditions, a conventional batch reaction was not able to achieve the same degree of FAME purity. The effect of the fatty acid composition of the lipid feedstocks on the FAME purity was also shown. It was demonstrated that, due to the fatty acid composition, FAME from virgin soybean oil and virgin canola oil was produced in the membrane reactor within ASTM specifications even without a water washing step. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - 1-Butanol (or bio-butanol) was recently proposed to be used with gasoline, and engine tests were performed. However, only few studies concern the oxidation/combustion of 1-butanol and they do not provide directly usable data for kinetic modeling. Thus the oxidation of butanol-gasoline surrogate mixtures (85-15 vol.%) was studied using a jet-stirred reactor. One representative of the chemical classes constituting this fuel was selected. These constituents were iso-octane, toluene, 1-hexene and 1-butanol. The experiments were carried out in the temperature range 770-1220 K, at 10 atm, with an initial fuel concentration of 0.1% in mole. Four equivalence ratios were considered: 0.3, 0.6, 1, and 2. Concentration profiles of reactants, stable intermediates, and final products were measured via sonic probe sampling followed by FTIR and gas chromatography analyses. A detailed chemical kinetic scheme (251 species, 1990 reversible reactions) resulting from the merging of validated kinetic schemes for the oxidation of the pure components of the present butanol-gasoline surrogate was used to simulate the present experiments. Good agreement between the experimental results and the computations was observed under the present JSR conditions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative to petroleum-based conventional diesel fuel and is defined as the mono-alkyl esters of vegetable oils and animal fats. Biodiesel has been prepared from numerous vegetable oils, such as canola (rapeseed), cottonseed, palm, peanut, soybean and sunflower oils as well as a variety of less common oils. In this work, Moringa oleifera oil is evaluated for the first time as potential feedstock for biodiesel. After acid pre-treatment to reduce the acid value of the M. oleifera oil, biodiesel was obtained by a standard transesterification procedure with methanol and an alkali catalyst at 60 °C and alcohol/oil ratio of 6:1. M. oleifera oil has a high content of oleic acid (&gt;70%) with saturated fatty acids comprising most of the remaining fatty acid profile. As a result, the methyl esters (biodiesel) obtained from this oil exhibit a high cetane number of approximately 67, one of the highest found for a biodiesel fuel. Other fuel properties of biodiesel derived from M. oleifera such as cloud point, kinematic viscosity and oxidative stability were also determined and are discussed in light of biodiesel standards such as ASTM D6751 and EN 14214. The 1H NMR spectrum of M. oleifera methyl esters is reported. Overall, M. oleifera oil appears to be an acceptable feedstock for biodiesel.

AB  - Effects of medium components and culture conditions on biomass and lipid production of Trichosporon fermentans were studied. The optimal nitrogen source, carbon source and C/N molar ratio were peptone, glucose and 163, respectively. The favorable initial pH of the medium and temperature were 6.5 and 25 °C. Under the optimized conditions, a biomass of 28.1 g/l and a lipid content of 62.4% could be achieved after culture for 7 days, which were much higher than the original values (19.4 g/l and 50.8%) and the results reported by other groups. T. fermentans could grow well in pretreated waste molasses and a lipid yield of 12.8 g/l could be achieved with waste molasses of 15% total sugar concentration (w/v) at pH 6.0, representing the best result with oleaginous microorganisms on agro-industrial residues. Addition of various sugars to the pretreated molasses could efficiently enhance the accumulation of lipid and the lipid content reached as high as above 50%. Similar to vegetable oils, the lipid mainly contains palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid and the unsaturated fatty acids amount to about 64% of the total fatty acids. The microbial oil with an acid value of 5.6 mg KOH/g was transesterified to biodiesel by base catalysis after removal of free fatty acids and a high methyl ester yield of 92% was obtained. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The paper industry is looking forward for using forest-based oils due to increasing diesel fuel prices. The UPM and Stora Enso are making planning to develop their business with the use of biodiesel, while Norske Skog already started its diesel project. The Choren Company started the first biomass plant in Germany in 2008. Finland is planning to increase its use of energy wood up to nine million cubic meters per year according to the Finnish Forest Industries Federation. The Stora Enso and Neste pilot plant is about to start by 2009 in Finland. UPM and Carbona started their Gas Technology Institute's pilot plant in the US. UPM also is making efforts to start production of ethanol from de-inking waste and other commercial and industrial waste, which is scheduled to start by 2011. A recent study reveled that the biofuel market is expected to reach up to 100 billion euros by 2020.

AB  - An analysis by Booz & Co entitled "Refining Trends: The Golden Age or the Eye of the Storm??Part 4. Tough Choices" examines the effect of rising gasoline and diesel demand in Asia and other countries, biofuel mandates, and alternative fuel vehicles on the global refining industry. These factors create opposing forces on worldwide refiners. According to the study, in the long term, through 2025, global demand for transportation fuels will continue to grow, despite the emergence of alternative-fuel vehicle technologies, due to increasing economic growth in Asia. Long-term margin levels will depend on economic growth in developing economies. In terms of demand, the short-term effect of alternative fuel technologies will be limited because it takes so long to replace the vehicle fleet. Refining capacity for 2003-2007 increased by about 3 million-4 million bpd of distillation capacity, and > 9 million bpd in capacity via other processes. New aggressive biofuels mandates enacted in the 2008 US energy bill represent an increase of 600,000-700,000 bpd of biofuels demand by 2012. Although the outlook for global demand is positive for the next 20 yr, refining margins could drop and never recover due to demand destruction and alternative supplies.

AB  - Biodiesel is one of the main alternatives to fossil diesel. It is a non-toxic renewable resource, which leads to lower emissions of polluting gases. In fact, European governments are targeting the incorporation of 20% of biofuels in the fossil fuels until 2020. Chemically, biodiesel is a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters, derived from vegetable oils or animal fats, which is usually produced by a transesterification reaction, where the oils or fats react with an alcohol, in the presence of a catalyst. The European Standard (EN 14214) establishes 25 parameters that have to be analysed to certify biodiesel quality and the analytical methods that should be used to determine those properties. This work reports the use of near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to determine some important biodiesel properties: the iodine value, the cold filter plugging point, the kinematic viscosity at 40 °C and the density at 15 °C. Principal component analysis was used to perform a qualitative analysis of the spectra and partial least squares regression to develop the calibration models between analytical and spectral data. The results support that NIR spectroscopy, in combination with multivariate calibration, is a promising technique applied to biodiesel quality control, in both laboratory and industrial-scale samples. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work presents the determination of Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni and V in diesel and biodiesel samples by ETV-ICP MS using emulsion sample preparation. The emulsion composition was: 1.0 g of the diesel or biodiesel sample, 2.0 mL of a 5% m/v Triton X-100 solution, 0.5 mL of HNO3 and deionized water to a 10 mL final volume. The optimized parameters were mass of carrier/modifier (1.0 μg Pd), RF power (1100 W), carrier gas flow rate (0.95 L min-1) and inner ETV gas flow rate (0.15 L min-1). The determinations were performed against aqueous solutions using 10 μg L-1 Rh as internal standard. The accuracy of the method was verified through the analysis of the NIST 1634c reference residual fuel oil, recovery tests and comparison of the results with those obtained by GF AAS. The results were in agreement according to the t-test at a 95% confidence level. The RSD values were lower than 20%, the recoveries were between 80 and 120% and the LOD values were in the order of ng g-1, showing the good accuracy and sensitivity of the method. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008.

Willie backs the use of biofuels and helped to start the company that produces the alternative fuel named "BioWillie", which is sold mainly in Texas. This is a blended fuel comprising petroleum diesel and biodiesel, which is an organic fuel made from domestic feedstock including soybeans grown by US family farmers. The current standards require that 9 billion gal of biofuels, such as ethanol made from corn, be introduced into the US fuel supply in 2008, and 11.1 billion gal in 2009.

AB  - The southeast of China has experienced a comparatively rapid economic development in recent years compared to the remaining areas of China. Consumption of considerable fossil fuel causes an increasingly serious energy shortage and environmental pollution, which threatens the sustainable development of the southeast of China. Jiangsu province, one of the most fast developing provinces in the southeast of China, is a good case. Jiangsu has a large population, large area of forested land, advanced agriculture and long coastline, which could potentially provide huge amount of feedstock for bioenergy production. In 2006, about 86.73 Mt of manure (livestock + human), 42.22 Mt of crop residues and food-processing byproducts, 1.03 Mt of fuelwood and wood manufacturing residues, 8.51 Mt of municipal waste were generated in Jiangsu Province. 138.40 Mt of the total biomass energy derived from these materials could potentially displace the use of about 21.30 Mt of coal. Meanwhile, energy plants, which will be potentially planted on the massive idle land, saline soil and farmers' yards, could provide 8.60 Mt of feedstock for biofuel production in the future. For better utilizing bioenergy in Jiangsu, several suggestions are given, including making an overall development planning, giving supports on tax, price, technology and funds, and carrying out the research of bioenergy technology. © by PSP 2008.

AB  - This paper will discuss the main challenges and opportunities for sustainable production of bio-diesel fuel in Turkey. Turkey's energy demand has risen rapidly as a result of economic and social development over the past two decades. As in many other countries, Turkey is heavily dependent on fossil fuels to meet its energy requirements. Fossil fuels account for approximately 88% of the country's total primary energy consumption. Turkey imports three major sources of energy, and its dependence on imported fossil fuels is expected to increase even further. At present, Turkey's oil production met only 7% of demand, the rest was imported. In spite of Turkey's heavy dependence on fossil fuels for energy demand, the country has a large potential for development of renewable resources of every type. Bio-fuels can provide an opportunity for Turkey to decrease its dependence on foreign oil, eliminate irregularities in agriculture, create new employment opportunities, decrease rural depopulation, and sustainable energy development. Turkey has a large area of suitable agricultural land for the production of bio-fuel crops. Unfortunately, only about 4-5% of total cultivable area is used for cultivating bio-fuel crops. The vegetable oil sector, which is considered to be one of the strengths of the Turkish agriculture and process industry, could be reformed to meet bio-diesel production demands.

AB  - Bio-diesel oil has attracted much attention as a substitutable energy sources for its renewable and eco-friendly property. However, problems of lead contamination in fuel are also emphasized increasingly at present. So it was of quite significance to determine the contents of lead in bio-diesel oil and its raw material rapeseed oil. An effective method was developed for the rapid determination of lead in rapeseed oil and bio-diesel oil by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) after their stabilization as microemulsions. In this research work, polyethyleneglycol octyl phenyl ether and n-butanol were used for emulsifier and auxiliary emulsifying agent, respectively. For Pb, efficient thermal stabilization was obtained using NH4H2PO4 as matrix modifier. Sample stabilization was necessary because of evident analyze losses that occurred immediately after sampling. Excellent long-term sample stabilization and the influence of the microemulsion composition on the GFAAS response were observed by mixing different organic solvents. The ashing and atomization temperature and ramp rate influenced the sensitivity obtained for Pb. Take this into account, the optimum conditions of the graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometric determination of Pb in rapeseed oil and bio-diesel oil samples were investigated. The results showed that the microemulsion was quite stable when the value of V(20% polyethyleneglycol octyl phenyl ether), V(n-butanol), V(oil) and V(water) was 0.1:8.9:0.5:0.5, without matrix interference effect. The determination limit of the proposed method was 126.2 μg · L-1 for Pb, comfortably below the values found in the analyzed samples. The recoveries were from 81.8% to 109.0%, which performed using the addition of different concentrations of lead to bio-diesel oil, rapeseed oil and petrochemical diesel samples. The relative standard deviation of determination was 5.84%. This work showed the great efficiency of the microemulsion, indicating that it is possible to extract lead from the oil phase. The method was applied to the determination of lead in oil samples with satisfactory results.

AB  - Using bio-fuels, such as bio-ethanol or bio-diesel in transportation, or biomass in power generation reduces CO2 emissions as the carbon is fixed by the plants from the atmosphere and saves the equivalent fossil fuel. The perennial rhizomatous C4 grass Miscanthus has one of the highest energy intensities per hectare of land in Europe. Here we model the future potential of Europe to produce Miscanthus with four different future land use and climate change scenarios and conclude that up to 17% of Europe's current primary energy consumption could be provided by this bio-energy crop by the year 2080 but that inter-annual variation of crop yield can be more than 20%. We conclude that that the highest greenhouse gas mitigation from bio-energy can be achieved by growing a Miscanthus crop on existing fertile and degraded arable land and not on land with a currently undisturbed ecosystem. © 2008 INRA EDP Sciences.

AB  - Due to the fact that petroleum is decreased in nowadays and also the fact that the environment sustains a lot of damage, it is necessary to be replaced by renewable fuels that can be used in the engines and are friendlily to the environment. This paper examines the use of diesel-sun oil mixtures in Diesel four-stroke engine. The mixtures used are the following: diesel-5% soy oil, diesel-10% soy oil, diesel-20% soy oil oil, diesel-30% soy oil, diesel-40% soy oil, diesel-50% soy oil. For those mixtures the gas emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen monoxide (NO) are being measured and the fuel consumption is also examined.

AB  - By using socio-technical scenarios, we investigate how present policy choices may affect the development of alternative transport fuels in Sweden. One important choice for policy lies in the balance between general tax exemptions stimulating the market for alternative fuels, and funding of research and development more directly promoting new technology. The implications of this choice are illustrated with four diverging development paths until 2020. In the market-oriented scenarios, we illustrate consequences of breaking the dominance of entrenched technologies and demonstrating a growing market potential for alternatives, but also the risks with a large focus on first generation renewable fuels. In the technology-oriented scenarios, we point out the value of keeping variety among niches in this stage of the transition. In conclusion, if policy is implemented without taking the dynamic forces within the system into account, there is a risk that any measure leads the system into a dead end. But if policy strives to balance the development in different parts of the technological system while making use of various prevailing forces of change, a multitude of different efforts can contribute to the development of a more sustainable transport system. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The process of biodiesel production from corn oil catalyzed by lipozyme TL IM, an inexpensive 1,3-position specific lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus was optimized by response surface methodology (RSM) and a central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was used to study the effects of enzyme dosage, ratio of t-butanol to oil (v/v) and ratio of methanol to oil (mol/mol) on the methyl esters (ME) yield of the methanolysis. The optimum combinations for the reaction were 25.9 U/goil of enzyme, 0.58 volume ratio of t-butanol to oil and 0.5, 0.5, 2.8 molar equivalent of methanol to oil added at the reaction time of 0, 2, and 4 h, respectively, by which a ME yield of 85.6%, which was very close to the predicted value of 85.0%, could be obtained after reaction for 12 h. Waste oil was found to be more suitable feedstock, and could give 93.7% ME yield under the optimum conditions described above. Adding triethylamine (TEA), an acyl migration enhancer, could efficiently improve the ME yield of the methanolysis of corn oil, giving a ME yield of 92.0%. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Transport vehicles greatly pollute the environment through emissions such as CO, CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt or partially burnt HC and particulate emissions. Fossil fuels are the chief contributors to urban air pollution and major source of green house gases (GHGs) and considered to be the prime cause behind the global climate change. Biofuels are renewable, can supplement fossil fuels, reduce GHGs and mitigate their adverse effects on the climate resulting from global warming. This paper presents the results of performance and emission analyses carried out in an unmodified diesel engine fueled with Pongamia pinnata methyl ester (PPME) and its blends with diesel. Engine tests have been conducted to get the comparative measures of brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) and emissions such as CO, CO2, HC, NOx to evaluate the behaviour of PPME and diesel in varying proportions. The results reveal that blends of PPME with diesel up to 40% by volume (B40) provide better engine performance (BSFC and BSEC) and improved emission characteristics. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Supporting the development and diffusion of sustainable innovations has become a dominant topic on the political agenda of many countries. However, this has proven to be a difficult task. To increase insight in such processes, this paper takes biofuel technologies in the mobility sector as the topic of a comparative case study. Various national governments have supported innovation trajectories around biofuels. We analyse, assess and compare two such trajectories as they have developed so far: one in the Netherlands and one in Sweden. A Technological Innovation System (TIS) approach is applied. A TIS is constituted by actors, networks and institutions, that are to be gradually constructed around a technology. We analyse whether governments and entrepreneurs have succeeded in developing seven key processes, or system functions, necessary for the development and diffusion of biofuel technologies. By analysing the build-up of system functions over time we identify virtuous and vicious forms of cumulative causation. The Dutch and Swedish TISs for biofuels are followed from 1990 to 2005. Our comparison shows that, due to a variety in function fulfilment and the emergence of cumulative causation, the Swedish TIS has reached a market expansion and broad social implementation of biofuels, whereas the Dutch TIS has established considerably less.

AB  - Globally, Jatropha curcas L. (Euphorbiaceae) holds much promise for producing biodiesel; it is cultivated in many tropical countries. In the South China Botanical Garden, a germplasm collection of J. curcas has been assembled on the basis of geographic location. However, this collection has not been characterized using molecular techniques associated with germplasm management and utilization. In this study, the genetic relationships of 58 J. curcas accessions were assessed based on simple sequence repeat (SSR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses. Seventeen microsatellite markers were developed using the FIASCO (Fast Isolation by AFLP of Sequences Containing repeats) protocol; only one SSR primer was polymorphic with two alleles. The seven AFLP primer combinations amplified 70 polymorphic loci in total, 14.3% of which were polymorphic. The clustering of genotypes based on the AFLP markers shows that the genetic diversity of J. curcas in Guizhou was notably different from the other samples. © Crop Science Society of America.

AB  - The summary of IChemE's green paper on energy production, distribution, economic, social, and technical factors, are discussed. The green paper states that the high demand for fuel is expected to remain based on diesel and petrol blended with biodiesel and ethanol. The issues of land availability, water availability, food, and energy requirement need to be resolved for the benefits of biofuel production. Battery technology has emerged as an alternative for vehicles due to zero emission and can be used in hybrid design to store electricity and reduce emissions. Hydroelectricity can be used as renewable energy sources having very few emissions. The green paper also states that there is a need to develop solar energy generation on large scale with quality energy storage, distribution and conversion technologies.

AB  - Biodiesel and ethanol are fuels in clear growth and evidence, basically due to its relation with the greenhouse effect reduction. There are several works regarding regulated pollutants emissions, but there is a lack of reports in non-regulated emissions. In a previous paper (Corrêa and Arbilla, 2006) the emissions of aromatic hydrocarbons were reported and in 2007 another paper was published in 2008 focusing carbonyls emissions (Corrêa and Arbilla, 2008). In this work four mercaptans (methyl, ethyl, n-propyl and n-butyl mercaptans) were evaluated for a heavy-duty diesel engine, fueled with pure diesel (D) and biodiesel blends (v/v) of 2% (B2), 5% (B5), 10% (B10), and 20% (B20). The tests were carried using a six cylinder heavy-duty engine, typical of the Brazilian fleet of urban buses, during a real use across the city. The exhaust gases were diluted near 20 times and the mercaptans were sampled with glass fiber filters impregnated with mercuric acetate. The chemical analyses were performed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection. The results indicated that the mercaptans emissions exhibit a reduction with the increase of biodiesel content, but this reduction is lower as the mercaptan molar mass increases. For B20 results the emission reduction was 18.4% for methyl mercaptan, 18.1% for ethyl mercaptan, 16.3% for n-propyl mercaptan, and 9.6% for n-butyl mercaptan. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesels are promoted as alternatives to fossil fuels and their applications in diesel engine have been studied extensively. However, the size distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and generator particulate material (GPM) emitted from heavy-duty diesel generator fueled with biodiesel blends has seldom been addressed. Seven different biodiesel blends with volume fractions of biodiesel ranging from 0% to 30% were studied. Experimental results indicate that the mean reductions of sum of PAHi/GPM0.056-18 (generator particulate material with aerodynamic diameter 0.056-18 μm) and BaPeqi [=(benzo[a]pyrene equivalent)i]/GPM0.056-18 of B5, B10, B15, B20, B25 and B30 are (-8.21%, -5.72%), (-36.7%, -29.7%), (-1.25%, 2.32%), (16.2%, 18.6%), (33.4%, 35.0%) and (40.5%, 42.4), respectively, compared with B0. Both PAHi/GPMi and BaPeqi/GPMi in stage 1 (0.056 - 0.166 μm) and stage 2 (0.166 - 0.31 μm) of all test fuels are higher than those in the other stages due to higher specific surface area of smaller particles. It is also observed that there are more highly toxic PAHs in stage 2. It should be noticed that the trend of particle-phase PAH contents is different from the trend of particle-phase PAH concentration and opposite to the trend of total GPM0.056-18 emission. The differences are due to a higher number of particles with diameters between 0.056 and 0.31 μm. The above results indicate that fuel blends with less than 15% biodiesel would increase PAH content at particle size between 0.056 and 0.31 μm. Therefore, the blending fraction should be between 15% and 30%. Moreover, particle-size control is needed in future emission regulations which would necessitate further improvements in combustion quality. Besides, researches on health effects of biodiesel blends are needed as well. Crown Copyright © 2008.

AB  - Alternative fuels, specifically biodiesel, biodiesel blends, and E85 fuel, have been gaining a market share over the past few years. With the emergence of these fuels, fire debris analysts should be able to recognize their characteristics since these fuels may be encountered in casework. In this study, pure biodiesel (B100) and a 20% blend of pure biodiesel with petroleum diesel (B20) are examined as liquids and are extracted from debris samples using both passive headspace concentration and solvent extraction. Typical fire debris instrumental conditions are used to analyze these samples. Components of B100 and B20 may be observed in debris samples extracted using the passive headspace concentration method, but the chromatographic patterns are different from the pure liquid samples. When solvent extraction is used as a secondary extraction method on debris samples, the resulting patterns are consistent with the pure liquids of B100 and B20. E85 fuel, a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline, can be extracted using a typical fire debris extraction technique but requires slight modifications to typical fire debris instrumental conditions. E85 is shown at various stages of evaporation to demonstrate the resiliency of the ethanol. Additionally, samples of E85 were placed on carpet, burned and extinguished to demonstrate the effects of the suppression medium on the retention of ethanol.

AB  - Biomass-derived liquid bio-fuels are being promoted as a major feasible fuel alternative in the European Union, in order to reduce Europe's transport dependency on crude oil. In particular, liquid bio-fuels if used in internal combustion engines can substitute a considerable amount of conventional fuels. These bio-fuels include conventional bio-ethanol and bio-diesel, which are derived from agricultural crops as well as second-generation bio-ethanol and synthetic diesel derived from lignocellulosic biomass. There are numerous pathways dealing with the production and use of liquid bio-fuels, depending on biomass feedstock, production technology, by-product usage and final bio-fuel consumption in vehicle power trains. In order to examine this complete chain of bio-fuel production and use, an evaluation study was carried out. This study used data from the Well to Wheels analysis of future automotive fuels and power trains in the European context (WTW report). Bio-fuels are assessed using the Analytic Hierarchy Process, which comprises of a synthesis of evaluation criteria and a sensitivity analysis. The criteria that were analyzed throughout the complete bio-fuel chain are bio-fuel substitution cost over conventional fuels, potential of substitution, total cycle GHG emissions and total cycle energy consumed. © 2008 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Transesterification of waste cooking oil with high acid value and high water contents using heteropolyacid H3PW12O 40·6H2O (PW12) as catalyst was investigated. The hexahydrate form of PW12 was found to be the most promising catalyst which exhibited highest ester yield 87% for transesterification of waste cooking oil and ester yield 97% for esterification of long-chain palmitic acid, respectively. The PW12 acid catalyst shows higher activity under the optimized reaction conditions compared with conventional homogeneous catalyst sulfuric acid, and can easily be separated from the products by distillation of the excess methanol and can be reused more times. The most important feature of this catalyst is that the catalytic activity is not affected by the content of free fatty acids (FFAs) and the content of water in the waste cooking oil and the transesterification can occur at a lower temperature (65°C), a lower methanol oil ratio (70:1) and be finished within a shorter time. The results illustrate that PW12 acid is an excellent water-tolerant and environmentally benign acid catalyst for production of biodiesel from waste cooking oil. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Waste cooking oils (WCO), which contain large amounts of free fatty acids produced in restaurants, are collected by the environmental protection agency in the main cities of China and should be disposed in a suitable way. Biodiesel production from WCO was studied in this paper through experimental investigation of reaction conditions such as methanol/oil molar ratio, alkaline catalyst amount, reaction time and reaction temperature which are deemed to have main impact on reaction conversion efficiency. Experiments have been performed to determine the optimum conditions for this transesterification process by orthogonal analysis of parameters in a four-factor and three-level test. The optimum experimental conditions, which were obtained from the orthogonal test, were methanol/oil molar ratio 9:1, with 1.0 wt.% sodium hydroxide, temperature of 50 °C and 90 min. Verified experiments showed methanol/oil molar ratio 6:1 was more suitable in the process, and under that condition WCO conversion efficiency led to 89.8% and the physical and chemical properties of biodiesel sample satisfied the requirement of relevant international standards. After the analysis main characteristics of biodiese sample, the impact of biodiesel/diesel blend fuels on an YC6M220G turbo-charge diesel engine exhaust emissions was evaluated compared with 0# diesel. The testing results show without any modification to diesel engine, under all conditions dynamical performance kept normal, and the B20, B50 blend fuels (include 20%, 50% crude biodiesel respectively) led to unsatisfactory emissions whilst the B′20 blend fuel (include 20% refined biodiesel) reduced significantly particles, HC and CO etc. emissions. For example CO, HC and particles were reduced by 18.6%, 26.7% and 20.58%, respectively. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is one of the new possible substitutes of regular fuel for engines and is produced from different vegetable oils or animal fats. The main reaction involved is the transesterification of triglycerides into esters. When an acid oil, such as spent or waste oil, is used, the amount of free fatty acids range from 3% to 40%, and another reaction takes place simultaneously with the transesterification, the direct esterification of the free fatty acid. In this work, the direct esterification reaction of triglycerides to biodiesel was studied and the effects of the main variables involved in the process, reaction temperature, amount of catalyst, initial amount of free fatty acid and the molar ratio alcohol/oil, were analyzed. For this investigation, we employed a model acid oil produced by mixing pure oleic acid with refined sunflower oil. Ethanol was used in the experiments instead of methanol since it is less toxic and safer to handle. Sulfuric acid was employed as catalyst because of its advantages compared with conventional homogeneous catalysts (NaOH). It was found that ethanol and sulfuric acid were suitable to perform not only the transesterification reaction but also the direct esterification reaction to increase biodiesel production of the process. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Utilizing whole cell biocatalyst for biodiesel production has some advantages since it can avoid the complex procedures of isolation, purification and immobilization of extracellular lipase. However, during repeated use of Rhizopus oryzae (R. oryzae) IFO4697 whole cell for biodiesel production in solvent-free system, the whole cell exhibited very poor stability; while the whole cell stability has been found to be significantly improved in tert-butanol system compared to that in solvent-free system. The difference in whole cell stability was found to be due to the difference of product accumulation between solvent-free and tert-butanol system. After 144 h reaction, glycerol and methyl ester accumulated in the cell in solvent-free system came up to about 1000 mg/g and 350 mg/g dry biomass, respectively, while in tert-butanol system, glycerol and methyl ester accumulation was kept at a relatively low level, approximately 100 mg/g and 2 mg/g dry biomass, respectively. The accumulated glycerol influenced whole cell stability through mass transfer limitation only, while the accumulated methyl ester influenced whole cell stability through both mass transfer limitation and product inhibition. Further study showed that a slight loss in enzymatic activity in tert-butanol system was caused by protein leakage. © 2008.

AB  - This paper contributes to Strategic Niche Management (SNM), an analytical technique designed to facilitate the introduction and diffusion of radically new sustainable technologies through societal experiments. According to SNM, intensive networking among social actors is a crucial process for the successful incubation of new technologies. However, the manner in which innovation success relates to different characteristics pertaining to the structure and functioning of these actor networks has remained rather unclear. In this paper we open up this 'black box' by bringing in social network analysis (SNA), which allows for a more systematic analysis of this issue. We review theoretical SNA contributions that shed light on the link between actor network attributes and innovation outcomes. Then we elaborate a case study about the emerging biofuels sector in Tanzania. After analysing the case from a conventional SNM perspective, we apply SNA techniques to generate more in-depth insights into the composition and functioning of the actor network and how this affects the innovation performance and development prospects of the sector. Policy implications are also discussed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Four continuous biodiesel processes were designed and simulated in HYSYS. The first two employed traditional homogeneous alkali and acid catalysts. The third and fourth processes used a heterogeneous acid catalyst and a supercritical method to convert a waste vegetable oil feedstock into biodiesel. While all four processes were capable of producing biodiesel at high purity, the heterogeneous and supercritical processes were the least complex and had the smallest number of unit operations. Material and energy flows, as well as sized unit operation blocks, were used to conduct an economic assessment of each process. Total capital investment, total manufacturing cost and after tax rate-of-return were calculated for each process. The heterogeneous acid catalyst process had the lowest total capital investment and manufacturing costs, and had the only positive after tax rate-of-return. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate influences of tall oil biodiesel with Mg and Mo based fuel additives on diesel engine performance and emission. Tall oil resinic acids were reacted with MgO and MoO2 stoichiometrically for the production of metal-based fuel additives (combustion catalysts). The metal-based additives were added into tall oil biodiesel (B60) at the rate of 4 μmol/l, 8 μmol/l and 12 μmol/l for preparing test fuels. In general, both of the metal-based additives improved flash point, pour point and viscosity of the biodiesel fuel, depending on the rate of additives. A single cylinder DI diesel engine was used in the tests. Engine performance values did not change significantly with biodiesel fuels, but exhaust emission profile was improved. CO emissions and smoke opacity decreased by 56.42% and by 30.43%, respectively. In general, low NOx and CO2 emissions were measured with the biodiesel fuels. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to defray the cost of biodiesel production, the ensuing work was to further investigate utilization of the crude glycerol (CG) from oleochemicals industry in the atmospheric autocatalytic organosolv pretreatment (AAOP) to enhance enzymatic hydrolysis. The AAOP-CG enabled wheat straw to achieve with reasonable enzymatic hydrolysis yields, reaching ≥75% for the wet substrate and ≤63% for the dried. Lipophilic compounds from the CG formed pitch deposition on the fiber, which was responsible for low delignification (≤30%) and also troublesome in practical operation. Pitch deposits itself had no significant role on enzymatic hydrolysis. A striking finding of the lignin recondensation and/or lignin-carbohydrate complex helped explain why dried pretreated wheat straw had a low enzymatic hydrolysis yield. The CG was suitable for the AAOP to enhance enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. But it was advisable to remove lipophilic compounds from crude glycerol before utilization. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biomass in the form of agricultural residues is becoming popular among new renewable energy sources, especially given its wide potential and abundant usage. Pyrolysis is the most important process among the thermal conversion processes of biomass. In this study, the various characteristics of bio-oils acquired under different pyrolysis conditions from safflower seed press cake (SPC) were identified. The elemental analyses and calorific values of the bio-oils were determined, and then the chemical compositions of the bio-oils were investigated using chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques such as column chromatography, 1H NMR, FTIR and GC. The fuel properties of the bio-oil such as kinematic viscosity, flash point, density, water content and ASTM distillation were also determined. Chemical compositions of bio-oils showed that some quantities of hydrocarbons were present, while oxygenated and polar fractions dominated. The bio-oils obtained from safflower seed press cake were presented as an environmentally friendly feedstock candidate for biofuels and chemicals. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to investigate the viability of steam reforming the combined glycerol and water by-product streams of a biodiesel plant. A platinum alumina catalyst was used to optimise the operating conditions for glycerol steam reforming and mass spectroscopy was chosen to measure reformer gas yield. The problem is that glycerol steam reforming is relatively untested even with pure glycerol and the by-product quality may be too poor. The strategy was therefore to optimise the process using pure glycerol and compare the performance with by-product glycerol. To test catalyst degradation caused by carbon deposition, a Solid Oxide fuel cell (SOFC) was used as a separate reformer and electrical performance was measured to indicate carbon deposition. This is the first time a SOFC has been run on glycerol. The results showed that thermodynamic theory can be used to predict reformer performance. At high temperatures high gas yield can be reached (almost 100%) and selectivities of 70% (dry basis) obtained. The optimum conditions for glycerol reforming were 860 °C temperature (maximum tested), 0.12 mols/min glycerol flow per kg of catalyst and 2.5 steam/carbon ratio. Reforming catalysts lasted for several days of continuous operation with minimal degradation, 0.4% of feed deposited. By-product glycerol performed slightly worse with a lower yield and more carbon deposition, 2% of feed. The results show that glycerol steam reforming is a viable alternative use for glycerol and potentially a better option than purification. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Safflower (Charthamus tinctorius L.) seed press cake was pyrolysed in a fixed-bed reactor. The effects of pyrolysis temperature, heating rate and sweep gas flow rates on the yields of the products were investigated. Pyrolysis runs were performed using pyrolysis temperatures between 400 and 600 °C with heating rates of 10, 30 and 50 °C min-1. The obtained bio-char, gas and bio-oil yields ranged between 25 and 34 wt%, 19 and 25 wt%, and 28 and 36 wt%, respectively, at different pyrolysis conditions. The highest liquid yield was obtained at 500 °C pyrolysis temperature with a heating rate of 50 °C min-1 under the sweep gas of N2 with a flow rate of 100 cm3 min-1. Employing the higher heating rate of 50 °C min-1 results in maximum bio-oil yield, probably due to the decrease in mass transfer limitations. According to the results obtained under the conditions of this study, the effects of pyrolysis temperature and sweep gas flow rate are more significant than the effect of heating rate on the yields. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The high viscosity of vegetable oils leads to problem in pumping and spray characteristics. The inefficient mixing of vegetable oils with air contributes to incomplete combustion. The best way to use vegetable oils as fuel in compression ignition (CI) engines is to convert it into biodiesel. Biodiesel is a methyl or ethyl ester of fatty acids made from vegetable oils (both edible and non-edible) and animal fat. The main resources for biodiesel production can be non-edible oils obtained from plant species such as Pongamia pinnata (Honge oil), Jatropha curcas (Ratanjyot), Hevea brasiliensis (Rubber) and Calophyllum inophyllum (Nagchampa). Biodiesel can be used in its pure form or can be blended with diesel to form different blends. It can be used in CI engines with very little or no engine modifications. This is because it has properties similar to mineral diesel. This paper presents the results of investigations carried out on a single-cylinder, four-stroke, direct-injection, CI engine operated with methyl esters of Honge oil, Jatropha oil and sesame oil. Comparative measures of brake thermal efficiency, smoke opacity, HC, CO, NOX, ignition delay, combustion duration and heat release rates have been presented and discussed. Engine performance in terms of higher brake thermal efficiency and lower emissions (HC, CO, NOX) with sesame oil methyl ester operation was observed compared to methyl esters of Honge and Jatropha oil operation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In order to meet the energy requirements, there has been growing interest in alternative fuels like biodiesels, methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, biogas, hydrogen and producer gas to provide a suitable diesel oil substitute for internal combustion engines. Vegetable oils present a very promising alternative to diesel oil since they are renewable and have similar properties. Vegetable oils offer almost the same power output with slightly lower thermal efficiency when used in diesel engine [Srivastava A, Prasad R. Triglycerides-based diesel fuels. Renew Sustain Energy Rev 2000;4:111-33. [1]; Vellguth G. Performance of vegetable oils and their monoesters as fuels for diesel engines. SAE 831358, 1983. [2]; Demirbas A. Biodiesel production from vegetable oils via catalytic and non-catalytic supercritical methanol transesterification methods. Int J Prog Energy Combust Sci 2005;31:466-87. [3]; Jajoo BN, Keoti RS. Evaluation of vegetable oils as supplementary fuels for diesel engines. In: Proceedings of the XV national conference on IC engines and combustion, Anna University Chennai, 1997. [4]; Altin R, Cetinkaya S, Yucesu HS. The potential of using vegetable oil fuels as fuel for diesel engines. Int J Energy Convers Manage 2000;42:529-38, 248. [5]; Gajendra Babu MK, Chandan Kumar Das LM. Experimental investigations on a Karanja oil methyl ester fuelled DI diesel engine. SAE 2006-01-0238, 2006. [6]; Agarwal D, Kumar Agarwal A. Performance and emission characteristics of a Jatropha oil (preheated and blends) in a direct injection compression ignition engine. Int J Appl Therm Eng 2007;27:2314-23. [7]]. Research in this direction with edible oils have yielded encouraging results, but their use as fuel for diesel engine has limited applications due to higher domestic requirement [Scholl Kyle W, Sorenson Spencer C. Combustion Analysis of soyabean oil methyl ester in a direct injection diesel engine. SAE 930934, 1993. [8]; Nwafor OMI. Effect of advanced injection timing on the performance of rapeseed oil in diesel engines. Int J Renew Energy 2000;21:433-44. [9]; Nwafor OMI. The effect of elevated fuel inlet temperature on performance of diesel engine running on neat vegetable oil at constant speed conditions. Renew Energy 2003;28:171-81. [10]]. In view of this, Honge oil (Pongamia Pinnata Linn) being non-edible oil could be regarded as an alternative fuel for CI engine applications. The viscosity of Honge oil is reduced by transesterification process to obtain Honge oil methyl ester (HOME). Gasification is a process in which solid biomass is converted into a mixture of combustible gases, which complete their combustion in an IC engine. Hence, producer gas can act as a promising alternative fuel, especially for diesel engines by substituting considerable amount of diesel fuels. Downdraft moving bed gasifiers coupled with IC engine are a good choice for moderate quantities of available biomass, up to 500 kW of electric power. Hence, bioderived gas and vegetable liquids appear more attractive in view of their friendly environmental nature. Since vegetable oils produce higher smoke emissions, dual fuel operation could be adopted for improving their performance. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Partial combustion of biomass in the gasifier generates producer gas that can be used as supplementary or sole fuel for internal combustion engines. Dual fuel mode operation using coir-pith derived producer gas and rubber seed oil as pilot fuel was analyzed for various producer gas-air flow ratios and at different load conditions. The engine is experimentally optimized with respect to maximum pilot fuel savings in the dual fuel mode operation. The performance and emission characteristics of the dual fuel engine are compared with that of diesel engine at different load conditions. Specific energy consumption in the dual-fuel mode of operation with oil-coir-pith operation is found to be in the higher side at all load conditions. Exhaust emission was found to be higher in the case of dual fuel mode of operation as compared to neat diesel/oil operation. Engine performance characteristics are inferior in fully renewable fueled engine operation but it suitable for stationary engine application, particularly power generation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ATOFMS) was used to measure the size-resolved mixing state of particles over the northern Indian Ocean in October and November 2004. This period was chosen to observe the impact of the monsoonal transition on the size, chemistry, sources, and radiative properties of atmospheric aerosols in the region. Overall, elemental carbon with sulfate (EC-sulfate), biomass/biofuel burning, fresh sea salt (SS), aged sea salt, fly ash, and EC mixed with sea salt were the dominant supermicron particle types, whereas EC-sulfate, biomass/biofuel burning, and fly ash were the dominant submicron particle types. Interestingly, particles composed mostly of aged organic carbon and nitrate were virtually absent during the campaign. This is possibly from low ozone formation in the region or selective scavenging during transport. Notably, during long-range transport periods when an aethalometer measured the highest black carbon concentrations, 77% of submicron particles between 0.5 and 2.5 μm and 71% of EC/soot particles contained an intense 39K+ ion (a known tracer for biomass/biofuel combustion). These observations suggest when the air mass originated from India, biofuel combustion represented a significant source of the regional atmospheric brown cloud. The majority (∼80%) of EC and biomass/biofuel burning particles were mixed with significant amounts of sulfate due to extensive secondary processing of these particles during transport. EC mixed with sea salt was also observed suggesting the particles had undergone cloud processing and become internally mixed during transport. These measurements support the use of an internal mixture of sulfate with EC/soot and biomass/biofuel burning in models to accurately calculate radiative forcing by aerosols in this region.

AB  - If the agricultural products market is limited and much of agricultural land is not utilized as is the case in many countries in the world at present, then agriculture should be directed to the production of new alternative products. The land can be used to produce non-food products including biofuels for the domestic energy market to diminish imports. Much research has been conducted on biofuels over the last 20 years. At present, concern about environmental regulations, green house gases and fossil fuel reservartion (including natural) have been the major reasons to look for alternative fuels that come from renewable resources. A significant level in terms of physico-chemical properties of biofuel has been obtained mostly from methyl ester of food based vegetable oils; it is now the issue to be concerned about human food oil versus biofuel production. This paper presents the experimental results carried out to evaluate performance and exhaust emissions of a diesel engine operated on "Envo Diesel" which consists of 5% palm oil and 95% ordinary diesel fuel (as P5). The Envo diesel is a policy of Malaysian government that emphasises on usage of waste palm oil with diesel fuel without esterification. This investigation also includes a benchmarking study with 5% coconut oil with 95% diesel fuel (as C5). However, all the results have been compared with pure diesel fuel (B0). The results show that fuels P5 and C5 reduce brake power 1.2% and 0.7% respectively as compared to B0. However, both the fuels P5 and C5 reduce exhaust emissions such as reduce HC, smoke, CO and NOx concentration. The paper contains the test results, properties of P5 and C5 biofuel and comparison with other biofuels that obtained from various vegetable oils. The results of this investigation will be used to find compatible lubricant/additive for biofuel operated engines.

AB  - The deoxygenation of methyl octanoate over a CsNaX zeolite catalyst has been investigated as a model reaction for the production of de-oxygenated liquid hydrocarbons from biodiesel. Several operating parameters were investigated, such as the type of basic catalyst used, the co-reactant incorporated in the reactor as a solvent of the liquid feed, and the reaction temperature. The CsNaX zeolite used in the study was prepared by ion exchange of NaX with CsNO3/CsOH solution. A significant role of the solvent (co-reactant) was found on the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst. That is, when methanol was co-fed enhanced stability and decarbonylation activity were observed. By contrast, when nonane was used, the catalyst deactivated rapidly and the selectivity to coupling products was enhanced. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of methyl octanoate and methanol, as well as flow catalytic studies suggest that methyl octanoate first decomposes to an octanoate-like species. The decomposition of such species leads to the formation of heptenes and hexenes as major products. Octenes and other hydrogenated products are formed in lower amounts via hydrogenation by hydrogen produced on the surface by methanol decomposition, but not from gas phase H2, followed by dehydration. When the polarizable Cs cation is not present in the catalyst, reduced activity and formation of undesired products, such as aromatics and pentadecanone, occur. Similarly, non-zeolitic basic catalysts, such as MgO, exhibit low activity and low selectivity to de-oxygenated liquid hydrocarbons. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The report presents an outlook for alternative motor fuels and new vehicles. The time period covered extends up to 2030. The International Energy Agency and the U.S. Energy Information Administration predict that the world energy demand will increase by over 50% from now to 2030, if policies remain unchanged. Most of the growth in demand for energy in general, as well as for transport fuels, will take place in nonOECD countries. Gasoline and diesel are projected to remain the dominant automotive fuels until 2030. Vehicle technology and high quality fuels will eventually solve the problem of harmful exhaust emissions. However, the problem with CO2 still remains, and much attention will be given to increase efficiency. Hybrid technology is one option to reduce fuel consumption. Diesel engines are fuel efficient, but have high emissions compared with advanced gasoline engines. New combustion systems combining the best qualities of gasoline and diesel engines promise low emissions as well as high efficiency. The scenarios for alternative fuels vary a lot. By 2030, alternative fuels could represent a 10-30% share of transport fuels, depending on policies. Ambitious goals for biofuels in transport have been set. As advanced biofuels are still in their infancy, it seems probable that traditional biofuels will also be used in 2030. Ethanol is the fastest growing biofuel. Currently the sustainability of biofuels is discussed extensively. Synthetic fuels promise excellent end-use properties, reduced emissions, and if produced from biomass, also reduced CO2 emissions. The report presents an analysis of technology options to meet the requirements for energy security, reduced CO2 emissions, reduced local emissions as well as sustainability in general in the long run. In the short term, energy savings will be the main measure for CO2 reductions in transport, fuel switches will have a secondary role. Copyright © VTT 2008.

AB  - During the past decade or even earlier almost all the EU countries, as well as most transition countries, launched the production of biodiesel fuel. Such a trend will continue in the future as it is indicated in the EU Directive (2003/30/EC) on alternative fuels for road transport and measures for promotion of the use of biodiesel. In Croatia, the production of biodiesel started only in 2005. It is based on raw materials which are available in the domestic environment: rapeseed oil and sunflower oil and waste edible oil. Methyl ester produced from rapeseed oil fully meets the EU standard under EN 14214, i.e., quality requirements for biodiesel fuel and may be used as pure (B100) or blended with mineral diesel fuels. Since methyl ester of sunflower oil and waste edible oil in some parameters do not meet the mentioned requirements, it is recommended to use them either as blended with rapeseed methyl ester or blended with mineral diesel fuel, which conforms to the recommendation of the European Union Strategy for biofuels production COM (2006). © 2008 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

AB  - Oleic acid is one of the most abundant fatty acid components of the triglycerides in many vegetable oils, such as cottonseed oil. As part of a project to develop new and expanded uses of oilseed products and by-products (such as biodiesel, fuel additives, and lubricants), studies were conducted on the synthetic conversion of oleic acid (in ester form) to branched-chain fatty acid esters. In these studies, methyl oleate was bro-minated in the allylic position and subsequently treated with organocuprate reagents to produce novel branched-chain derivatives (ethyl, n-butyl, n-hexyl, phenyl). Details of the syntheses, characterization (GC/MS and NMR), and the properties of the prod-ucts (with emphasis on low-temperature properties) are discussed. Several of the syn-thesized products exhibited significantly lower re-crystallization temperatures in comparison with methyl oleate and may prove useful as additives to biodiesel for use at low temperatures. © 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Composters and wood grinders are now reevaluating diesel-guzzling heavy equipment as the rise of oil and fuel prices continue. Some operators have now switched to more environmentally friendly and cost-efficient biodiesels, and others have swapped their diesel equipment for electric ones. Others have even setup their own electricity utility at the site to power electric equipment. In terms of fuel alternatives, there are new specification fuels like B5 or 5% biodiesel, B6 or 6% biofuel and B20 for 20% biodiesel blends. One operator is Royal Oak Farm, which has used B20 biodiesel for its off-road equipment like windrow turner, screen, shredder and loaders. Another company that uses B20 blends is Santa Cruz Resource Recovery Facility, located in California. On the one hand, some operators have started using electric vehicles, like Variable Frequency Drivers which control the amount of energy supplied to the motor. On-site power generation is also a choice for others. For instance, one provider is Phoenix Energy, which sells and installs gasification systems and generators.

AB  - A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism has been developed and used to study the oxidation of methyl decanoate, a surrogate for biodiesel fuels. This model has been built by following the rules established by Curran and co-workers for the oxidation of n-heptane and it includes all the reactions known to be pertinent to both low and high temperatures. Computed results have been compared with methyl decanoate experiments in an engine and oxidation of rapeseed oil methyl esters in a jet-stirred reactor. An important feature of this mechanism is its ability to reproduce the early formation of carbon dioxide that is unique to biofuels and due to the presence of the ester group in the reactant. The model also predicts ignition delay times and OH profiles very close to observed values in shock tube experiments fueled by n-decane. These model capabilities indicate that large n-alkanes can be good surrogates for large methyl esters and biodiesel fuels to predict overall reactivity, but some kinetic details, including early CO2 production from biodiesel fuels, can be predicted only by a detailed kinetic mechanism for a true methyl ester fuel. The present methyl decanoate mechanism provides a realistic kinetic tool for simulation of biodiesel fuels. © 2008 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - The energy sources have been split into three categories: fossil fuels, renewable sources, and nuclear sources. Energy new and renewable resources will play an important role in the world's future. There are several reasons for biofuels to be considered as relevant technologies by both developing and industrialized countries. They include energy security reasons, environmental concerns, foreign exchange savings, and socioeconomic issues related to the rural sector. The term "modern biomass" is generally used to describe the traditional biomass use through the efficient and clean combustion technologies and sustained supply of biomass resources, environmentally sound and competitive fuels, heat, and electricity using modern conversion technologies. Modern biomass can be used for the generation of electricity and heat. Biofuels as well as green diesel produced from biomass by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis are the most modern biomass-based transportation fuels. Green diesel is a renewable replacement to petroleum-based diesel. Biomass energy conversion facilities are important for obtaining bio-oil by pyrolysis. Pyrolysis is the most important process among the thermal conversion processes of biomass. There are four different ways of modifying vegetable oils and fats for use as diesel fuel, such as pyrolysis, dilution with hydrocarbons (blending), emulsification, and transesterification.

AB  - The term biofuel is referred to liquid, gas and solid fuels predominantly produced from biomass. Biofuels include energy security reasons, environmental concerns, foreign exchange savings, and socioeconomic issues related to the rural sector. Biofuels include bioethanol, biomethanol, vegetable oils, biodiesel, biogas, bio-synthetic gas (bio-syngas), bio-oil, bio-char, Fischer-Tropsch liquids, and biohydrogen. Most traditional biofuels, such as ethanol from corn, wheat, or sugar beets, and biodiesel from oil seeds, are produced from classic agricultural food crops that require high-quality agricultural land for growth. Bioethanol is a petrol additive/substitute. Biomethanol can be produced from biomass using bio-syngas obtained from steam reforming process of biomass. Biomethanol is considerably easier to recover than the bioethanol from biomass. Ethanol forms an azeotrope with water so it is expensive to purify the ethanol during recovery. Methanol recycles easier because it does not form an azeotrope. Biodiesel is an environmentally friendly alternative liquid fuel that can be used in any diesel engine without modification. There has been renewed interest in the use of vegetable oils for making biodiesel due to its less polluting and renewable nature as against the conventional petroleum diesel fuel. Due to its environmental merits, the share of biofuel in the automotive fuel market will grow fast in the next decade. There are several reasons for biofuels to be considered as relevant technologies by both developing and industrialized countries. Biofuels include energy security reasons, environmental concerns, foreign exchange savings, and socioeconomic issues related to the rural sector. The biofuel economy will grow rapidly during the 21st century. Its economy development is based on agricultural production and most people live in the rural areas. In the most biomass-intensive scenario, modernized biomass energy contributes by 2050 about one half of total energy demand in developing countries. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, usage of methyl ester obtained from waste frying oil (WFO) is examined as an experimental material. A reactor was designed and installed for production of methyl ester from this kind of oil. Physical and chemical properties of methyl ester were determined in the laboratory. The methyl ester was tested in a diesel engine with turbocharged, four cylinders and direct injection. Gathered results were compared with No. 2 diesel fuel. Engine tests results obtained with the aim of comparison from the measures of torque, power; specific fuel consumptions are nearly the same. In addition, amount of emission such as CO, CO2, NOx, and smoke darkness of waste frying oils are less than No. 2 diesel fuel. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Freshly harvested Jatropha dried fruit contains about 35-40% shell and 60-65% seed (by weight). The fruits are 2.5 cm long, ovoid, black and have 2-3 halves. It has nearly 400-425 fruits per kg and 1580-1600 seed per kg weight. Weight of 100 seeds is about 63 g. Jatropha shells are available after de-shelling of the Jatropha fruit while Jatropha seed husks are available after decortications of Jatropha seed for oil extraction. Seed contains about 40-42% husk/hull and 58-60% kernels. The kernels have about 50% oil. If the oil is extracted by solvent method the oil recovery is more than 95% but in mechanical expeller the oil recovery is about 85% only. If 100 kg of seed is expelled by expeller it will give about 28-30 kg oil. While lot of emphasis is being given on use of bio-diesel, which is only about 17-18% of the dry fruit, not much attention is being given to utilize other components of fruit for energy purposes. At SPRERI holistic approach has been taken to utilize all components of the Jatropha fruit-shell for combustion, hull/husk for gasification, oil and bio-diesel for running CI engines, cake for production of biogas and spent slurry as manure and it has been found that all components of the Jatropha curcas fruit can be utilized efficiently for energy purposes. This paper gives detailed information on the use of different components of J. curcas fruit for energy purposes. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of vegetable oils as a fuel in diesel engines causes some problems due to their high viscosity compared with conventional diesel fuel. Various techniques and methods are used to solve the problems resulting from high viscosity. One of these techniques is fuel blending. In this study, a blend of 50% sesame oil and 50% diesel fuel was used as an alternative fuel in a direct injection diesel engine. Engine performance and exhaust emissions were investigated and compared with the ordinary diesel fuel in a diesel engine. The experimental results show that the engine power and torque of the mixture of sesame oil-diesel fuel are close to the values obtained from diesel fuel and the amounts of exhaust emissions are lower than those of diesel fuel. Hence, it is seen that blend of sesame oil and diesel fuel can be used as an alternative fuel successfully in a diesel engine without any modification and also it is an environmental friendly fuel in terms of emission parameters. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bio-fuels can be provided as liquids (e.g. Fischer-Tropsch-Diesel, Methanol) but also as gases (e.g. bio-methane, Synthetic-Natural Gas, Bio-SNG). The possibilities and limits of the latter are analysed from a technical point of view. The conversion path from solid biomass to Bio-SNG is a promising option.

AB  - One of the major reasons hindering the use of biodiesel is its filter plugging temperature, which is higher than that of No. 2 diesel. Cloud point (CP) and pour point (PP) temperatures have been shown to be well correlated with filter plugging point, which primarily determines the operability of a diesel engine in cold weather. Many biodiesel cold flow additives are available in the market that claim to reduce pour point. In this study, neat and blended biodiesel fuels from different feedstocks were tested for change in CP and PP with various cold flow additives at 100%, 200%, and 300% of the specified loading (application) rate. The additives in general worked better for ethyl esters than for methyl esters. Average reductions in CP and PP for neat mustard methyl esters were 0.3°C and 7.2°C, respectively, compared to 3°C and 19.4°C for mustard ethyl ester at the recommended loading rate. In general, mustard biodiesel responded to additives better than soybean or used vegetable oil biodiesel for reducing PP. The effect of additives on CP of diesel fuel was not statistically significant, but PP was reduced to ≤ -36°C with all additives at recommended loading. This result is expected as additives are mainly targeted to inhibit the crystal growth not necessarily the onset of crystallization. The additives were found to be more effective in diesel than in biodiesel for reducing PP, and hence the higher the percentage of diesel in a blend, the better the effectiveness was. Most additives reduced the PP of B20 and lower blends to ≤ -36°C at 100% loading, and all additives did that at 200% loading. No added benefit was observed at more than 200% loading. © 2008 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - With the Biofuels Quota Act, which came into effect in January 2007, a growing share of biofuels related to the total fuel sales is legally stipulated. In light of this, a laboratory test program was conducted with the focal points oxidation and storage stability, as well as fuel influence on the quality of engine oils, to broaden the data basis for B10 fuels. Deposit formation at diesel injection nozzles was examined in coking test runs with four B10 fuels and on fossil reference fuel. Vehicle tests were also an element of the study. Changes of the quality of the engine oil primarily depended on the added amount of fuel and to a lesser extent on the respective quality of the fuel (e.g., diesel fuel). Euro5 engines could exhibit a different behavior when run on B5 or B10 because the design of the nozzles and of the engines was changed, and increased ratios of exhaust gas recirculation were used. The vehicle tests showed a significant increase in oil dilution with B10 compared with B0. Thus, operation with B10 could necessitate a shortening of the oil change intervals under certain operating conditions.

AB  - In 2007, global production of biofuels increase by approximately 20% to an estimated 54B liters. The gains accounted for 1.5% of global supply of liquid fuels, up by 0.25% from the previous year. There is an 18% to 46B liters increase in fuel ethanol production while biodiesel has a growth of 33% to 8B liters. Although there is increase in production capacity, the overall investments in biofuels decreased from the record set in 2006 as feedstock prices and socio-environmental concerns soared high.

AB  - Used cooking oil (UCO) is a domestic waste generated daily by food industries, restaurants, and households. It is estimated that in Europe 5 kg of UCO are generated per inhabitant, totalling 2.5 million metric tons per year. Recovering UCO for the production of biodiesel offers a way of minimizing and avoiding this waste and related pollution. An exergy analysis of the integrated waste management (IWM) scheme for UCO is used to evaluate such a possibility by accounting for inputs and outputs in each stage, calculating the exergy loss and the resource input, and quantifying the possible improvements. The IWM includes the collection, pretreatment, and delivery of UCO and the production of biodiesel. The results show that the greatest exergy loss occurs during the transport stages (57%). Such exergy loss can be minimized to 20% by exploiting the full capacity of collecting vans and using biodiesel in the transport stages. Further, the cumulative exergy consumption helps study how the exergy consumption of biodiesel can be further reduced by using methanol obtained from biogas in the transesterification stage. Finally, the paper discusses how increasing the collection of UCO helps minimize uncontrolled used oil disposal and consequently provides a sustainable process for biodiesel production. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The diversification of different types and sources of biofuels has become an important energy issue in recent times. The aim of this work is to evaluate the use of two kinds of renewable feedstocks in order to produce biodiesel. We have analyzed the potential production of oil from two species of macroalgae considered as waste coming out from a lagoon system involved in eutrophication and from sunflower seeds. We have tested oil extraction yields of both feedstock. Furthermore, a comparison has been carried out based on the emergy approach, in order to evaluate the sustainability and environmental performance of both processes. The results show that, under present conditions, considering oil extraction yields, the production of oil from sunflower seeds is feasible, because of the lower value of transformity of the final product with respect to macroalgae. On the other hand, the results demonstrate that with improvements of oil extraction methodology, macroalgae could be considered a good residual biomass usable for biofuel production. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work presents the evaluation of energy balance and GHG emissions in the production and use of fuel ethanol from cane in Brazil for 2005/2006 (for a sample of mills processing up to 100 million tons of sugarcane per year), and for a conservative scenario proposed for 2020. Fossil energy ratio was 9.3 for 2005/2006 and may reach 11.6 in 2020 with technologies already commercial. For anhydrous ethanol production the total GHG emission was 436 kg CO2 eq m-3 ethanol for 2005/2006, decreasing to 345 kg CO2 eq m-3 in the 2020 scenario. Avoided emissions depend on the final use: for E100 use in Brazil they were (in 2005/2006) 2181 kg CO2 eq m-3 ethanol, and for E25 they were 2323 kg CO2 eq m-3 ethanol (anhydrous). Both values would increase about 26% for the conditions assumed for 2020 mostly due to the large increase in sales of electricity surpluses. A sensitivity analysis has been performed (with 2005/2006 values) to investigate the impacts of the huge variation of some important parameters throughout Brazilian mills on the energy and emissions balance. The results have shown the high impact of cane productivity and ethanol yield variation on these balances (and the impacts of average cane transportation distances, level of soil cultivation, and some others) and of bagasse and electricity surpluses on GHG emissions avoidance. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel production has received considerable attention in the recent years as a biodegradable and non polluting fuel. Utilizing soluble lipase biocatalyst presented an alternative approach to lipase-mediated biodiesel production besides the immobilized lipase and whole cell catalysts. The central composite design (CCD) of the response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to evaluate the effects of enzyme concentration, temperature, molar ratio of methanol to oil and stirring rate on the yield of fatty methyl ester in present work. Soluble lipase NS81006 and NS81020, produced by submerged fermentation of genetically modified Aspergillus oryzae/Aspergillus niger microorganism, were proposed here as the catalysts for biodiesel production with acid oil. The results indicated that enzyme concentration, temperature, molar ratio of methanol to oil and stirring rate were the significant factors on the yield of fatty methyl ester and a quadratic polynomial equation was obtained for methyl ester yield by multiple regression analysis. The predicted biodiesel yield was 0.915 (w/w) under the optimal conditions and the subsequent verification experiments with biodiesel yield of 0.887 ± 0.0161 (w/w) confirmed the validity of the predicted model. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ester oils obtained from natural long-chain fatty acids and alcohols are versatile substitutes for many petroleum-based products. Their efficient synthesis with the solvent-free esterification of free fatty acids (FFA) from by-products of biodiesel fabrication and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol with immobilised lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosa was investigated. The immobilisation of the biocatalyst in static emulsion yielded a specific esterification activity that was higher by a factor of 4.9-9.4 than the activity of the native enzyme. Favourable properties of the silicone-based immobilisation matrix in terms of stability and immobilisation yield were observed. In biodiesel by-products, the immobilised lipase catalysed the esterification of FFA as well as the transesterification of residual fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) to the desired ester oils. A conversion of 90% FFA and 35% FAME gave a total yield of 60%. The inactivation coefficients during repeated use in a stirred-tank reactor with intermittent pressure reduction were exceptionally low.

AB  - The use of a heterogeneous catalyst, in the transesterification reaction of refined and acidic cottonseed oil for the production of methyl-esters (biodiesel) has been studied. The basic Mg-Al-CO3 hydrotalcite catalyst used showed a high activity for methanolysis and esterification reactions in a refined and an acidic cottonseed oil as well as in a representative high water content animal fat feed. The experiments were performed in a temperature range between 180 and 210 °C, in a batch reactor. The methanol to vegetable oil molar ratio was 6 to 1, while the catalyst concentration was fixed at 1 wt.% of the oil mass. Non-calcined and calcined forms of the catalyst were tested. The activity of the calcined catalyst was lower than the initial activity of the non-calcined catalytic system but it appeared the same with the reused non-calcined system. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In order to prepare a genuine biodiesel, it is essential to use methanol prepared from biomass but not natural gas for biodiesel production. Thus, we have proposed to use crude bio-methanol produced by wood gasification for biodiesel production. Since such a bio-methanol contains some impurities, an effect of its impurities was studied on the biodiesel production by supercritical method. In general, impurities in crude bio-methanol are reported to include methyl formate, ethanol, 1-butanol, diisopropyl ether, water, etc. Triglycerides and oleic acids were, thus, treated with these impurities under supercritical conditions. As a result, it was found that methyl formate, ethanol and 1-butanol could convert them to fatty acid alkyl esters (BDF), whereas no conversion was achieved with diisopropyl ether. Thus, crude bio-methanol can be used for BDF production as a substitute for methanol from fossil resources. However, due to more efficient reaction, crude bio-methanol can be more applicable to the two-step supercritical methanol process, consisting of hydrolysis of triglycerides and subsequent esterification of fatty acids, compared with the one-step supercritical methanol process, where transesterification of triglycerides is a major reaction. © 2007.

AB  - Biodiesel has become more attractive recently because of its environmental benefits and the fact that it is made from renewable resources. Transesterification of vegetable oils with short-chain alcohol has long been a preferred method for producing biodiesel fuel. A new reactor was developed to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) by blowing bubbles of superheated methanol vapor continuously into vegetable oil without using any catalysts. A kinetic study on the non-catalytic transesterification of palm oil was made in a reactor without stirring at atmospheric pressure. The effects of reaction temperatures (523, 543, and 563 K) on the rate constant, conversion, yield of methyl esters (ME) and composition of the reaction product under semi-batch mode operation are investigated. The activation energy and the frequency factor values of the transesterification reaction obtained in this experiment are 31 kJ/mol and 4.2, respectively. The optimum reaction temperature which gives the highest ME content (95.17% w/w) in the reaction product is 523 K, while the rate constant of the total system increased with reaction temperature. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Vegetable oils are a promising alternative among the different diesel fuel alternatives. However, the high viscosity, poor volatility and cold flow characteristics of vegetable oils can cause some problems such as injector coking, severe engine deposits, filter gumming, piston ring sticking and thickening of lubrication oil from long-term use in diesel engines. These problems can be eliminated or minimized by transesterification of the vegetable oils to form monoesters. These monoesters are known as biodiesel. The important advantages of biodiesel are lower exhaust gas emissions and its biodegradability and renewability compared with petroleum-based diesel fuel. Although the transesterification improves the fuel properties of vegetable oil, the viscosity and volatility of biodiesel are still worse than that of petroleum diesel fuel. The energy of the biodiesel can be released more efficiently with the concept of low heat rejection (LHR) engine. The aim of this study is to apply LHR engine for improving engine performance when biodiesel is used as an alternative fuel. For this purpose, a turbocharged direct injection (DI) diesel engine was converted to a LHR engine and the effects of biodiesel (produced from sunflower oil) usage in the LHR engine on its performance characteristics have been investigated experimentally. The results showed that specific fuel consumption and the brake thermal efficiency were improved and exhaust gas temperature before the turbine inlet was increased for both fuels in the LHR engine. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel was prepared from palm oil by transesterification with methanol in the presence of 1.5%K loaded-calcined Mg-Al hydrotalcite. Fatty acid methyl esters content of 96.9% and methyl ester yield of 86.6% were achieved using a 30:1 methanol to oil molar ratio at 100 °C for 6 h and 7 wt% catalyst. The biodiesel was characterized and its impact on elastomer properties was evaluated. The compatibility of B10 diesel blend (10% biodiesel) with six types of elastomers commonly found in fuel systems (NBR, HNBR, NBR/PVC, acrylic rubber, co-polymer FKM, and terpolymer FKM) were investigated. The physical properties of elastomers after immersion in tested fuels (for 22, 670, and 1008 h at 100 °C) were measured according to American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM). These include swelling (mass change and volume change), hardness, tensile and elongation, as well as the dynamic mechanical property. The results showed that properties of NBR, NBR/PVC and acrylic rubber were affected more than other elastomers. This is due to the absorption and dissolving of biodiesel by rubber in these samples. Co-polymer FKM and terpolymer FKM which are fluoroelastomers show little property change. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present study, waste rapeseed oil with high free fatty acids (FFA) was used as feedstock for producing biodiesel. In the pretreatment step, FFA was reduced by distillation refining method. Then, biodiesel was produced by alkaline-catalyzed transesterification process, which was designed according to the 24 full-factorial central composite design. The response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the conditions for the maximum conversion to biodiesel and understand the significance and interaction of the factors affecting the biodiesel production. The results showed that catalyst concentration and reaction time were the limiting conditions and little variation in their value would alter the conversion. At the same time, there was a significant mutual interaction between catalyst concentration and reaction time. The biodiesel produced in the present experiment was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), which showed that it mainly contained six fatty acid methyl esters. In addition, the diesel indexes analysis showed that most of the fuel properties were in reasonable agreement with the 0# diesel standard of China (GB252-2000) and the biodiesel standard of America (ASTM D6751). © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel has high potential as alternative liquid transportation fuel because it is renewable and CO2 neutral, and has similar properties as diesel fuel. Glycerol is a by-product obtained during the production of biodiesel. Canadian government has planned to produce 500 million litres of biodiesel by 2010. An increase in biodiesel production would decrease the market price of glycerol. The objective of this study is to pyrolyse glycerol for the production of clean fuels such as H2 or a feedstock such as syn gas for additional transportation fuel via Fisher-Tropsch synthesis. The pyrolysis of glycerol was carried out at various flow rates of N2 (30-70 mL/min), temperatures (650-800 °C) and types and sizes of packing material in a tubular reactor at atmospheric pressure. The products were mostly gas, essentially consisting of CO, H2, CO2, CH4 and C2H4. It was observed that temperature, carrier flow rates and particle diameter of packing material had profound effects on the conversion of glycerol as well as product distribution. Composition of product gas ranged between syn gas 70-93 mol%, CH4 3-15 mol% and C2H4 2-12 mol% and heating value ranged from 13 to 22 MJ/m3. This study indicates that the bio-glycerol has potential in making syn gas and medium heating value gases. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hydrocarbon analysis with standard GC-MS is confronted by the limited range of volatile compounds amenable for analysis and by the similarity of electron ionization mass spectra for many compounds which show weak or no molecular ions for heavy hydrocarbons. The use of GC-MS with supersonic molecular beams (Supersonic GC-MS) significantly extends the range of heavy hydrocarbons that can be analyzed, and provides trustworthy enhanced molecular ion to all hydrocarbons. In addition, unique isomer mass spectral features are obtained in the ionization of vibrationally cold hydrocarbons. The availability of molecular ions for all hydrocarbons results in the ability to obtain unique chromatographic isomer distribution patterns that can serve as a new method for fuel characterization and identification. Examples of the applicability and use of this novel isomer abundance analysis (IAA) method to diesel fuel, kerosene and oil analyses are shown. It is suggested that in similarity to the "three ions method" for identification purposes, three isomer abundance patterns can serve for fuel characterization. The applications of the Supersonic GC-MS for engine motor oil analysis and transformer oil analysis are also demonstrated and discussed, including the capability to achieve fast 1-2 s sampling without separation for oil and fuel fingerprinting. The relatively fast analysis of biodiesel is described, demonstrating the provision of molecular ions to heavy triglycerides. Isomer abundance analysis with the Supersonic GC-MS could find broad range of applications including petrochemicals and fuel analysis, arson analysis, environmental oil/fuel spill analysis, fuel adulteration analysis and motor oil analysis. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The recent growing interest in biofuels is due to the continuous increase in crude oil prices, limited resources of fossil energies, and environmental concerns. In what concerns road transportation, biodiesel is being considered a good alternative to conventional diesels. It consists of a blend of fatty acid esters, and its production and formulation needs to be optimized to ensure that the fuel quality complies with the legal standards. Although in various aspects biodiesel is superior to conventional diesel, it also poses some problems such as its poor behavior at low temperatures and higher hygroscopicity than conventional diesel. Up to now, little information is available about the water solubility in fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters and commercial biodiesels. To overcome this lack of data, water solubility measurements were carried out for 11 pure esters and 6 biodiesels in the temperature range 288.15-323.15 K. This new experimental data was successfully modeled with the cubic-plus-association (CPA) equation of state with global average deviations inferior to 7% for the ester systems, and predictions with deviations of 16% for commercial biodiesels were achieved. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the study of supply chain design from the perspective of complex dynamic systems. Unlike extant studies that use formal simulation modelling and associated methodologies rooted in the physical sciences, it adopts a framework rooted in the social sciences, strategic niche management, which provides rich insights into the behavioural aspects of complex innovation dynamics of emerging supply chains. Design/methodology/approach - The use of the framework is illustrated by means of a case study about the development of a new biofuels supply chain in East Africa. Findings - Three key dynamic processes are found to be at the core of new supply chain development: networking, learning and the management of actor expectations. The case analysis suggests the need to actively manage these processes and suggests possible ways of doing so. Researchlimitations/implications - Generalisability is limited since the research is based on one case study. Additional case studies using the same framework would help to validate and extend the results obtained. Practical implications - Implications for strategic managerial decision making include the need to encourage stakeholder networking and shared learning, and managing their expectations. Originality/value - The paper uses an innovative conceptual framework to examine new supply chain development, which yields new insights into how these processes can be actively managed and supported.

AB  - Thermal spray technology has found its way into the automotive industry and is widely used for an expanding range of applications. A variety of thermal spray processes are available for coating applications on parts of the piston group, the clutch, the gearbox and the valve train. More than six years ago a leading European manufacturer of passenger cars has put a thermal spray process into series production, to coat cylinder bore surfaces of aluminium engine blocks from high power diesel engines. The coating, with its particular surface topography, decreases the friction of the piston group significantly, leading to a reduction of fuel consumption of 2-4%. In addition to fuel savings the oil consumption can be reduced by a factor of 2-3 and therefore help to achieve lower emission values. Based on this cylinder bore coating technology Sulzer Metco has developed a range of materials to provide optimum solutions for the different types of engines with their specific requirements. These materials cover the needs for high corrosion resistance in marine engines or engines run on biofuels, abrasion resistance in heavy duty truck engines or very low friction in racing engines. This paper will focus on plasma spray coating of cylinder liners for heavy duty diesel (HDD) truck engines and highlight the technical feasibility for the measure of cost reduction in series production. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Substitution of fossil fuels with fuels that come from part renewable sources has been a subject of many studies and researches in the past decade. Considering the higher cost and limits of production resources, a special attention is focused on raising the energy efficiency of biofuel usage, mainly through optimization of the combustion process. Consequently, in biofuel applications, there is a need for determination of auto-ignition quality expressed by cetane number as a dominant characteristic that influences combustion parameters. The fact that the method for cetane number determination is comparative in nature has led us to try to develop substitute engine method for cetane number determination, by the use of the available laboratory equipment and serial, mono-cylinder engine with direct injection, DMB LDA 450. Description of the method, results of optimization of engine's working parameters for conduction of the test and method's Accuracy estimation are given in the paper. The paper also presents the results of domestic biodiesel fuels cetane number testing with the application of described engine method, developed at the Laboratory for internal combustion engines and fuels and lubricants of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering from Kragujevac, Serbia.

AB  - Ethanol and biodiesel have become mainstream fuels that are increasingly used in combination with gasoline or petroleum diesel in automobiles. These same versatile fuels are starting to be used to power gas turbines. LPP Combustion LLC has developed a fuel preparation and delivery system that converts liquid fuels such as No. 2 fuel oil, biodiesel, ethanol, and coal liquids into substitute natural gas, which existing natural gas hardware can burn while enjoying reduced emission rates similar to those of natural gas. A discussion covers the lean, premixed, prevaporized (LPP) combustion of liquid fuels; financial savings to power plant operators; transition between the use of natural gas and LPP gas; discussions for the first power plant installation; improved fuel burning; features of the LPP System, e.g., the ability it gives plant operators to switch between natural gas and liquid fuels on the fly; and interest in using biofuels in combustion devices to produce renewable energy with no net carbon emissions, e.g., NOx, CO, SOx, and particulate matter.

AB  - A pan-arctic geospatial picture of black carbon (BC) characteristics was obtained from the seven largest arctic rivers by combining with molecular combustion markers (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and radiocarbon (14C) analysis. The results suggested that the contribution from modern biomass burning to BC ranged from low in the Yukon (8%) and Lena (5%) Rivers to high in the Yenisey River (88%). The Mackenzie River contributed almost half of the total arctic fluvial BC export of 202 kton a-1 (kton = 109 g), with the five Russian-Arctic rivers contributing 10-36 kton a-1 each. The 14C-based source estimate of fluvially exported BC to the Arctic Ocean, weighted by the riverine BC fluxes, amount to about 20% from vegetation/biofuel burning and 80% from 14C-extinct sources such as fossil fuel combustion and relict BC in uplifted source rocks. Combining these pan-arctic data with available estimates of BC export from other rivers gave a revised estimate of global riverine BC export flux of 26 × 103 kton a-1. This is twice higher than a single previous estimate and confirms that river export of BC is a more important pathway of BC to the oceans than direct atmospheric deposition.

AB  - PetroSun from Scottsdale, Arizona has come up with the idea of using microalgae to reduce biofuel which is planning to produce about 4.4 million gallons of algal oil and 110 million lbs. of biomass per year. Microalgae has the ability to produce 30 to 100 times the oil yield during oil pressing while its leftover, which is the biomass can be used as a cattle feed and as a protein supplement for the cattle. In addition, the biomass can also be fermented into ethanol. This technology is unique as the biodiesel produced has no sulfur in it and is completely nontoxic for the environment, plus having the advantage of being completely biodegradable. In addition, these biofuels can be used in existing diesel engines while the biodiesel can be mixed with conventional petroleum diesel and can be used in the current distribution infrastructure.

AB  - Worldwatch, an international research institute based in Washington DC, disclosed that global ethanol annual output of ethanol, led by Brazil and the US, climbed to 47 billion liters in 2007, up from 36.5 billion liters in 2005. Biodiesel spurred by EU production, surpassed approximately 6 billion liters in 2007, up from 4 billion liters in 2005. The EU has set a directive to obtain 5.75% of transportation fuel needs from biofuels by 2010. The UK has announced the Renewable Transport Fuels obligation (RFTO) requiring forecourts to offer a minimum of B5 diesel by 2010. Japan, China, and India are all taking steps to increase biofuel production. Ethanol and biodiesel remained niche fuels. Global annual output of ethanol was approximately 500,000 bpd, and biodiesel 40,000 bpd. Biofuel production received a tremendous boost in 2005, when the US Congress enacted the EPACT energy bill. The legislation contained a Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) mandate that guarantees a US market of 7.5 billion gallons.

AB  - This paper summarizes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions measurements obtained during several recent studies conducted by Environment Canada, Emissions Research and Measurement Division (ERMD). A variety of heavy-duty vehicles and engines operating on a range of different fuels including diesel, biodiesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), hythane (20% hydrogen, 80% CNG), and liquefied natural gas (LNG), and with different advanced aftertreatment technologies were studied by chassis dynamometer testing, engine dynamometer testing or on-road testing. Distance-based emission rates of CO2, CH4, and N2O are reported. Fuel consumption calculated by carbon balance from measured emissions is also reported. The measurement results show, for heavy-duty diesel vehicles without aftertreatment, that while CO2 emissions dominate, CH4 emissions account for between 0% and 0.11% and N2O emissions account for between 0.16% and 0.27% of the CO2-equivalent GHG emissions. Both of the aftertreatment technologies (diesel oxidation catalyst and active regeneration diesel particle filter) studied increased N2O emissions compared to engine out emissions while CH4 emissions remain essentially unchanged. No effect on tailpipe GHG emissions was found with the use of up to 20% biodiesel when the engine was equipped with an oxidation catalyst. Biodiesel use did show some reductions in tailpipe GHG emissions as compared to ULSD without aftertreatment and with the use of a diesel particle filter. Natural gas and hythane also offer decreased GHG emissions (10-20%) at the tailpipe when compared with diesel. Emission factors (g L-1 fuel) for CH4 and N2O are suggested for heavy-duty vehicles fueled with diesel-based fuels and natural gas. These emission factors are substantially lower than those recommended for use by IPCC methodologies for developing national inventories. Crown Copyright © 2008.

AB  - Candidate plus trees (CPTs) of Pongamia pinnata, a potential biodiesel plant occurring across 10 locations in North Guwahati, were identified based on morphological markers (vegetative and reproductive) using combined analysis over locations. Identified CPTs were then multiplied using seed propagation technique in a nursery bed. The performance of the candidate trees with respect to seed and pod traits, the two most important characters with regard to oil, were evaluated using CROPSTAT software for inferring potential genotypes that can be included in programmes aimed at genetic improvement of the species. Total oil content from the seeds of plus trees was also analysed using solvent extraction procedure at their boiling points. Hexane extraction yielded maximum oil content from seeds (33%) compared with petroleum ether (30%). When the seed to solvent ratio varied, no significant difference was noticed on the total oil yield for an individual tree, although the recovery of solvent and the time taken for oil extraction were significantly reduced at higher ratios of solvent used. © 2008 The Authors.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. (physic nut) has drawn attention in recent years as a source of seed oil that can provide an economically viable substitute for diesel. Very little work on provenance trials and genetic resources of J. curcas L. has been reported so far. Though J. curcas grows widely in India and several collections of the plant are also maintained, pedigree and provenance records are not always available. This article reports our studies on the diversity amongst the accessions of J. curcas L., both amongst already held collections as well as from a few locations in the wild. Two single-primer amplification reaction (SPAR) methods were used for this purpose. The accessions from the North East were most distant from all other accessions in UPGMA analysis. The NBRI, Bhubaneshwar and Lalkuan accessions were more related to each other. The UPGMA tree clearly shows well-separated accession groups: NBRI, Bhubaneshwar, North East, Lalkuan and Outgroup. The study suggests that this relatively recently introduced plant species shows adequate genetic diversity in India and that the SPAR methods are useful for a rapid assessment of the same. The methods provide important tools for analyzing the diversity within the available collections to shortlist the parental lines for adaptability trials and further improvement of Jatropha plants. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas is an oil bearing species with multiple uses and considerable economic potential as a biofuel crop. The effect of NaCl stress on growth, ion accumulation, contents of protein, proline, and antioxidant enzymes activity in callus cultures of J. curcas was investigated. Exposure of callus to NaCl decreased growth in a concentration dependent manner. NaCl treated callus accumulated Na and declined in K, Ca and Mg contents. Na/K ratio increased steadily as a function of external NaCl treatment. NaCl induced significant differences in quality and quantity of proteins, whereas, proline accumulation remained more or less constant with treatment. NaCl stress enhanced the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD; E.C. 1.15.1.1) and peroxidase (POX; E.C. 1.11.1.7). Further in the isoenzyme studies, four SOD isoenzymes (SOD 1, 2, 3, and 4) and two POX isoenzymes (POX 1 and 2) were detected with the treatment. NaCl strongly induced activity of SOD 4 isoenzyme in 40, 60, 80 mM and POX 2 isoenzyme in 40 and 80 mM NaCl concentrations. Increase in antioxidant enzymes activity could be a response to cellular damage induced by NaCl. This increase could not stop the deleterious effects of NaCl, but it reduced stress severity and thus allowed cell growth to occur. © 2008 Versita.

AB  - Investigations were conducted on heterogeneous base catalysts for the transesterification of oil aimed at effective production of biodiesel. Thirteen different kinds of metal oxides containing calcium, barium, magnesium, or lanthanum were prepared as catalysts. Their catalytic activities were tested for transesterification at 60 °C with a 6:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil and a reaction time of 10 h. The calcium-containing catalysts - CaTiO3, CaMnO3, Ca2Fe2O5, CaZrO3, and CaO-CeO2 - showed high activities and approximately 90% yields of methyl ester. Furthermore, catalytic durability tests were performed by repeating the transesterification reaction several times with the calcium-containing catalysts recovered from the previous reaction mixture. It was found that CaZrO3 and CaO-CeO2 show high durability and have the potential to be used in biodiesel production processes as heterogeneous base catalysts. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The developments of both biodiesel and emulsified diesel are being driven by the need for reducing emissions from diesel engines and saving energy. Artificial chemical additives are also being used in diesel engines for increasing their combustion efficiencies. But the effects associated with the use of emulsified additive/biodiesel/diesel blends in diesel engines have never been assessed. In this research, the premium diesel fuel (PDF) was used as the reference fuel. A soy-biodiesel was selected as the test biodiesel. A biosolution made of 96.5 wt % natural organic enzyme-7F (NOE-7F) and 3.5 wt % water (NOE-7F water) was used as the fuel additive. By adding additional 1 vol % of surfactant into the fuel blend, a nanotechnology was used to form emulsified biosolution/soy-biodiesel/PDF blends for fueling the diesel engine. We found that the emulsified biosolution/soy-biodiesel/PDF blends did not separate after being kept motionless for 30 days. The above stability suggests that the above combinations are suitable for diesel engines as alternative fuels. Particularly, we found that the emulsified biosolution/soy-biodiesel/PDF blends did have the advantage in saving energy and reducing the emissions of both particulate matters (PM) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from diesel engines as compared with PDF, soy-biodiesel/PDF blends, and emulsified soy-biodiesel/ PDF blends. The results obtained from this study will provide useful approaches for reducing the petroleum reliance, pollution, and global warming. However, it should be noted that NOx emissions were not measured in the present study which warrants the need for future investigation. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Several Brazilian commercial gasoline physicochemical parameters, such as relative density, distillation curve (temperatures related to 10%, 50% and 90% of distilled volume, final boiling point and residue), octane numbers (motor and research octane number and anti-knock index), hydrocarbon compositions (olefins, aromatics and saturates) and anhydrous ethanol and benzene content was predicted from chromatographic profiles obtained by flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and using partial least square regression (PLS). GC-FID is a technique intensively used for fuel quality control due to its convenience, speed, accuracy and simplicity and its profiles are much easier to interpret and understand than results produced by other techniques. Another advantage is that it permits association with multivariate methods of analysis, such as PLS. The chromatogram profiles were recorded and used to deploy PLS models for each property. The standard error of prediction (SEP) has been the main parameter considered to select the "best model". Most of GC-FID-PLS results, when compared to those obtained by the Brazilian Government Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels Agency - ANP Regulation 309 specification methods, were very good. In general, all PLS models developed in these work provide unbiased predictions with lows standard error of prediction and percentage average relative error (below 11.5 and 5.0, respectively). © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The biodegradability of pure diesel and biodiesel and blends with different proportions of biodiesel (2% (commercial); 5% and 20%) was evaluated employing the respirometric method and the redox indicator 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) test. In the former, experiments simulating the contamination of natural environments (soil from a petrol station or water from a river) were carried out in Bartha biometer flasks (250 ml), and used to measure the microbial CO2 production. With the DCPIP test, the capability of three inocula to biodegrade the blends was tested. Results show that although biodiesel is more easily and faster biodegraded than diesel oil, among the blends evaluated (2%, 5% and 20%), only the blend with higher concentration of biodiesel presented biodegradability significantly different from diesel and it was not verified an improvement on the biodegradation of the diesel by means of co-metabolism. © 2008 Academic Journals.

AB  - Salmon oils separated from salmon processing waste and hydrolysate and their derived methyl esters were analyzed and compared with corn oil and its methyl ester. These materials were characterized for their fatty acid profiles, viscosity, volatility, thermal properties, low temperature properties, oxidative stability, and heating value. The salmon oil methyl esters contained 26.64% saturated fatty acid methyl esters compared to 13.68% for corn oil methyl ester. Salmon oil methyl esters also contained relatively high concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5) and docosahexaenoic (C22:6) acid methyl esters. Despite these differences in fatty acid composition, salmon and corn oil methyl esters had comparable physical properties. In addition, the methyl esters produced from salmon oils extracted from fish processing by-products and hydrolysate showed little difference in their physical properties.

AB  - Fuels produced from renewable sources offer an economically viable pathway to curtail emissions of greenhouse gases. Two such liquid fuels in common usage are biodiesel and ethanol derived from soybean, corn, or other food crops. In recent years, significant effort has been devoted to identify alternate feedstock sources and conversion techniques to diversify the biofuels portfolio. In this study, we have measured emissions from flames of diesel biodiesel, emulsified bio-oil, and diesel-biodiesel blends. Experiments are conducted in an atmospheric pressure burner with an air-atomized injector and swirling primary air around it to replicate typical features of a gas turbine combustor. Experiments were conducted for fixed air and fuel flow rates, while the airflow split between the injector and the coflow swirler was varied. Results show a significant reduction in emissions as the fraction of total air fed into the atomizer is increased. Blue flames, reminiscent of premixed combustion, and low emissions of nitric oxides and carbon monoxide were observed for all fuel blends. In general the fmissions from biofuel flames were comparable or lower than those from diesel flames. Copyright © 2008 by ASME.

AB  - Biodiesel production from Jatropha curcas Linnaeus (JCL) has been considered for partial substitution of diesel fuel for transportation in Thailand. The aim of this study is to investigate the energy consumption for long-term investment (20 years) of Jatropha Methyl Ester (JME) production in Thailand sing a life cycle approach. Apart from the average result, two scenarios-best and worst case-are set up to illustrate the range of results due to the variety of management practices. The main contributors to the energy use are JCL cultivation, transesterification, and transportation process. The net energy gain (NEG) and net energy ratio (NER) of biodiesel and coproducts from the life cycle of JCL are 4720 GJ/ha and 6.03, respectively. Even if only biodiesel is considered without coproducts, the NER is 1.42, still higher than 1. The study will support decision makers in the energy policy sector to make informed decisions vis-a-vis promotion of JCL plantations for biodiesel. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A mathematical model for the calculation of the multi-zone diesel fuel spray combustion process in compression ignition engines is refined in order to expand its capability to describe the operation of diesel engines running on different bio-fuel blends. As an illustration of the capacity of the proposed model to accurately describe the working process numerical simulations of a Caterpillar diesel engine operating on diesel oil and different soybean methyl ester (SME) blends are presented in this paper. A comparison of these theoretical results with published experimental data for the SME 20 and 40 per cent blends shows good agreement. As the proposed model provides a fairly accurate prediction of the heat release rate during the combustion process and the levels of NOx and PM emission formations the model may be used for the optimisation of the engine's design and its working process parameters. © IMechE 2008.

AB  - The aim of the present paper is to investigate bio-fuels produced from biomass materials by thermochemical and biochemical methods and the utilization trends of the products in the world. Bio-fuels are liquid or gaseous fuels made from plant matter and residues, such as agricultural crops, municipal wastes and agricultural and forestry by-products. Liquid bio-fuels being considered world over fall into the following categories: (a) vegetable oils and biodiesels; (b) alcohols; and (c) biocrude and synthetic oils. Bioethanol can be produced from cellulose feedstocks such as corn stalks, rice straw, sugar cane bagasse, pulpwood, switchgrass, and municipal solid waste. Conversion technologies for producing bioethanol from cellulosic biomass resources such as forest materials, agricultural residues and urban wastes are under development and have not yet been demonstrated commercially. Biodiesel fuel can be made from new or used vegetable oils and animal fats, which are non-toxic, biodegradable, renewable resources.The problems with substituting triglycerides for diesel fuels are mostly associated with their high viscosities, low volatilities and polyunsaturated character. Different ways have been considered to reduce the high viscosity of vegetable oils.

AB  - A product with diesel-like properties was synthesized by a pyrolysis method, from either edible soybean oil or an inedible soybean soapstock starting material (PD and SD, respectively). Some physical properties of the material were studied, neat and in blends, with both high- and low-sulfur diesel fuels (HSD and LSD) and at a range of different temperatures. The kinematic viscosities at 40 °C were 4.5 mm2 s-1 for PD and 3.8 mm2 s-1 for SD, which were reduced in a linear fashion by the addition of HSD or LSD. The densities of the fuels at 40 °C were 0.853 apd 0.844 g mL-1, very similar to the density of HSD. The surface tensions of the compounds, also at 40 °C, were 27.1 mN m-1 for PD and 26.2 mN m-1 for SD. A comparison to traditional biodiesel was made and, overall, lead to the conclusion that the pyrolysis products are a viable alternative. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background, Aims and Scope. To all Member States, the European Union has imposed a minimum percentage of 2% of biofuels in the fuels consumed for road transport since 2005. This percentage is expected to reach 5.75% in 2010, and probably 10% in 2020. In this context, investments are made everywhere in Europe in local productions of biofuels. In Belgium, ethanol from sugar beet and rapeseed methyl ester (RME) are generally supposed to be two of the more valuable possibilities. As these industries are growing, it is important to evaluate the environmental impacts of these productions and to highlight the main sources of these impacts using Life Cycle Assessment methodology. This evaluation will also lead to propositions of improvements of the environmental performances. A comparison with the impacts of the related fossil fuels (petrol and diesel) should also be conducted. Even if these fuels are different and used in different types of engines, it is important to determine which one offers the best environmental performances, as both require arable land, which is the limiting parameter in biofuel production. Methods. The system boundaries include cultivation, extraction, processing and final use of the biofuels. The system has been expanded to take into account valorization of by-products in substitution of animal feed (rapeseed meal or pulps from sugar beet) or chemicals (glycerin). No economical, mass or energetic allocation was made. The yields and fertilizer consumptions of the crops are those of the Belgian conditions. Simapro 7.1 databases and the Eco-Indicator 99 method have been used for the Life Cycle Impact Assessment. The functional unit was road transport over 100 km. Results. The results show that, without valorization of the by-products, the impacts of the two biofuels over their whole life cycle are not significantly lower than those of the related fossil fuels. However, the credits accorded thanks to the valorization of by-products lead to improvements of the environmental performances in comparison to fossil fuels, especially for RME. Discussion. The impacts of agriculture and production of the fertilizers are more important in the case of RME, because the yield per hectare is lower than in the production of ethanol from sugar beet. However, the extraction of the sugar from the beet, fermentation, purification of the ethanol and drying of the pulps and slops consume much more energy than extraction and esterification of rapeseed oil. Moreover, the by-products of RME (rapeseed meal and glycerin) are more valuable than those of ethanol from sugar beet (pulps). This induces a more important environmental benefit in the production of RME. These parameters lead to a global environmental impact that is higher for the production of ethanol than for RME. Conclusions. Life Cycle Assessment methodology has been successfully applied to two of the major ways of production of biofuels in Belgium using specific local data. The assessment of the environmental impacts reveals that rapeseed methyl ester allows a considerable improvement of the environmental performances compared to fossil diesel, while ethanol from sugar beet offers a more limited benefit compared to petrol. Recommendations. Arable land is a limited resource, especially in West-European countries like Belgium. Therefore, choices must be made to have the most valuable environmental benefit. Soil quality and crop rotations should also be taken into account before making a decision. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Full greenhouse gas (GHG) life-cycle analysis of bio-energy production chains is often constrained by a lack of information on pre-harvest GHG costs and emissions during production of the energy crop. In this paper, we assessed pre-harvest GHG costs of production of short rotation coppice (SRC), Miscanthus and oil seed rape (OSR: for liquid bio-fuel production) when compared to a range of former land-use baselines. It was found that GHG costs are very low for Miscanthus and SRC but higher for OSR production, determined mainly by the need for nitrogen fertilisation. Compared to baseline land uses, SRC and Miscanthus have much lower GHG costs than arable cropping or intensively managed grasslands, with OSR production having similar GHG costs to arable cropping. Establishing broadleaved forests have low GHG costs, but 5-year GHG costs of Miscanthus and SRC are similar to forest. We show that former land use is of critical importance when determining if energy crops are a net source or sink of GHGs. Converting to SRC and Miscanthus are the most favourable energy crops in terms of GHG savings. Converting to OSR from arable cropping results in either small increases or decreases in GHG emissions, depending upon the former tillage practice on the arable land, but replacing either broadleaved woodland with OSR (mainly due to soil carbon loss and increased fertiliser-related N2O emissions), or grassland with OSR (mainly due to loss of soil carbon), greatly increases emissions. Policies to maximise GHG benefits from energy crops should encourage that they be established preferentially on croplands. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - From a technical and economic point of view, autothermal steam reforming offers many advantages, as it minimizes heat load demand in the reformer. Bio-oil, the liquid product of biomass pyrolysis, can be effectively converted to a hydrogen-rich stream. Autothermal steam reforming of selected compounds of bio-oil was investigated using thermodynamic analysis. Equilibrium calculations employing Gibbs free energy minimization were performed for acetic acid, acetone and ethylene glycol in a broad range of temperature (400-1300 K), steam to fuel ratio (1-9) and pressure (1-20 atm) values. The optimal O2/fuel ratio to achieve thermoneutral conditions was calculated under all operating conditions. Hydrogen-rich gas is produced at temperatures higher than 700 K with the maximum yield attained at 900 K. The ratio of steam to fuel and the pressure determine to a great extent the equilibrium hydrogen concentration. The heat demand of the reformer, as expressed by the required amount of oxygen, varies with temperature, steam to fuel ratio and pressure, as well as the type of oxygenate compound used. When the required oxygen enters the system at the reforming temperature, autothermal steam reforming results in hydrogen yield around 20% lower than the yield by steam reforming because part of the organic feed is consumed in the combustion reaction. Autothermicity was also calculated for the whole cycle, including preheating of the organic feed to the reactor temperature and the reforming reaction itself. The oxygen demand in such a case is much higher, while the amount of hydrogen produced is drastically reduced. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

AB  - The past few years have seen a phenomenal rise in the production and consumption of biofuels and biodiesel at the global level. This development is of special significance to Africa, where about 550 million people (75% of the total population in Sub-Saharan Africa) depend on traditional biomass (wood, charcoal, cow dung, etc.) and lack access to electricity or any kind of modern energy service. Derived from plants and agricultural crops, biofuels and biodiesel represent modern forms of bioenergy and more efficient use of biomass energy. Beyond efficiency, modern bioenergy offers tremendous opportunities to meet growing household energy demands, increase income, reduce poverty, and mitigate environmental degradation. In the African setting, energy and livelihoods security are indeed inseparable. This paper argues economic, social, and environmental benefits of modern bioenergy can be realized through a strategy that centres on smallholder production and processing schemes and pursuit of a livelihood approach to energy development. Such a scheme opens up new domestic markets, generates new cash incomes, improves social wellbeing, enhances new technology adoption, and lays the ground for rural economic transformation and sustainable land use. The paper concludes by underlining the vital importance of considering sound property rights and strategic planning of sustainable development as tools for sustainable energy and livelihoods security. © 2008 United Nations.

AB  - This research examined the effect of using separate hydrolysis and methanolysis reactions for biodiesel production using a whole-cell biocatalysts derived from Rhizopus Oryzae (ATCC 10260). Biodiesel yield from separate hydrolysis and methanolysis was compared to transesterification reactions where both hydrolysis and methanolysis reactions occur in the same reactor. All reactions were conducted at room temperature. The effect of substituting ethanol for methanol was also studied. Separating the hydrolysis and methanolysis reactions did not significantly increase biodiesel yields; however, this approach successfully converted about 99% of triglycerides into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and free fatty acids (FFA). Use of ethanol in place of methanol did not significantly improve the biodiesel yield. However, there is evidence that ethanol may either esterify FFA more quickly than methanol, or result in a more stable ester. The best biodiesel yield was about 90% when a transesterification reaction using methanol was followed by one hydrolysis and one ethanolysis reaction; however, this is only slightly higher than the 88% biodiesel yield of two transesterification reactions in series (using methanol as alcohol).

AB  - The production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from waste activated bleaching earth (ABE) discarded by the crude oil refining industry using lipase from Candida cylindracea was investigated in a 50-L pilot plant. Diesel oil or kerosene was used as an organic solvent for the transesterification of triglycerides embedded in the waste ABE. When 1% (w/w) lipase was added to waste ABE, the FAME content reached 97% (w/w) after reaction for 12 h at 25 °C with an agitation rate of 30 rpm. The FAME production rate was strongly dependent upon the amount of enzyme added. Mixtures of FAME and diesel oil at ratios of 45:55 (BDF-45) and 35:65 (BDF-35) were assessed and compared with the European specifications for biodiesel as automotive diesel fuel, as defined by pr EN 14214. The biodiesel quality of BDF-45 met the EN 14214 standard. BDF-45 was used as generator fuel, and the exhaust emissions were compared with those of diesel oil. The CO and SO2 contents were reduced, but nitrogen oxide emission increased by 10%. This is the first report of a pilot plant study of lipase-catalyzed FAME production using waste ABE as a raw material. This result demonstrates a promising reutilization method for the production of FAME from industrial waste resources containing vegetable oils for use as a biodiesel fuel. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A preliminary evaluation of the feasibility of producing biodiesel using oil extracted from defective coffee beans was conducted as an alternative means of utilizing these beans instead of roasting for consumption of beverage with depreciated quality. Direct transesterifications of triglycerides from refined soybean oil (reference) and from oils extracted from healthy and defective coffee beans were performed. Type of alcohol employed and time were the reaction parameters studied. Sodium methoxide was used as alkaline catalyst. There was optimal phase separation after reactions using both soybean and healthy coffee beans oils when methanol was used. This was not observed when using the oil from defective beans which required further processing to obtain purified alkyl esters. Nevertheless, coffee oil was demonstrated to be a potential feedstock for biodiesel production, both from healthy and defective beans, since the corresponding oils were successfully converted to fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The potential of accumulation of lipids by Lipomyces starkeyi when grown on sewage sludge was assessed. On a synthetic medium, accumulation of lipids strongly depended on the C/N ratio. The highest content of lipids was measured at a C/N-ratio of 150 with 68% lipids of the dry matter while at a C/N-ratio of 60 only 40% were accumulated. Within a pH range from 5.0 to 7.5 the highest lipid accumulation was found at pH 5.0 while the highest yield per litre was pH 6.5. Although sewage sludge had no inhibitory effects on growth or accumulation on L. starkeyi when added to synthetic medium, there was no significant growth on untreated sewage sludge. However, pretreatment of sludge by alkaline or acid hydrolysis, thermal or ultrasonic treatment lead to accumulation of lipids by L. starkeyi with highest values of 1 g L-1 obtained with ultrasound pre-treatment. Based on the content of free fatty acids and phosphorus, lipids accumulated from sewage sludge could serve as a substrate for the production of biodiesel. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cetane number is an important parameter in evaluating the quality of biodiesel fuel. Its determination is usually arduous and expensive, and the results obtained are not always accurate due to experimental error. This work is aimed at developing a relationship between the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) composition and the cetane number (CN). Data were collected from the literature on the cetane number of various biodiesel fuels and their FAME composition. A regression analysis was performed on pure FAME to establish a relationship between the cetane number and FAME composition. An equation was developed relating the cetane number with the % composition by weight of FAME of biodiesel fuel. The predicted cetane number values compare well with the average measured cetane number values. This work establishes the general dependence of cetane number on FAME composition of biodiesels. © 2008 Institute of Agrophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - A methodology based in flow analysis and membrane-based extraction has been applied to the determination of methanol in biodiesel samples. A hydrophilic membrane was used to perform the liquid-liquid extraction in the system with the organic sample fed to the donor side of the membrane and the methanol transfer to an aqueous acceptor buffer solution. The quantification of the methanol was then achieved in aqueous solution by the combined use of immobilised alcohol oxidase (AOD), soluble peroxidase and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS). The optimization of parameters such as the type of membrane, the groove volume and configuration of the membrane unit, the appropriate organic solvent, sample injection volume, as well as immobilised packed AOD reactor was performed. Two dynamic analytical working ranges were achieved, up to 0.015% and up to 0.200% (m/m) methanol concentrations, just by changing the volume of acceptor aqueous solution. Detection limits of 0.0002% (m/m) and 0.007% (m/m) methanol were estimated, respectively. The decision limit (CCα) and the detection capacity (CCβ) were 0.206 and 0.211% (m/m), respectively. The developed methodology showed good precision, with a relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) <5.0% (n = 10). Biodiesel samples from different sources were then directly analyzed without any sample pre-treatment. Statistical evaluation showed good compliance, for a 95% confidence level, between the results obtained with the flow system and those furnished by the gas chromatography reference method. The proposed methodology turns out to be more environmental friendly and cost-effective than the reference method. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Carbon certification rules are about to take effect in Europe and in the US, offering certified biofuels the advantage of tax relief. The rules will not offer this benefit to the noncertified ones, which bears major implications for this subsidized industry. Governments in Europe and the US are introducing systems that will eliminate levies only to biofuels that are certified 'low carbon' as compared to conventional gasoline and diesel. Measures are being taken to produce the lowest biofuels carbon footprints from waste products, waste land, or very high-efficiency cultivation systems. Three EU countries, including Germany, Netherlands, and the UK, are planning to tax biofuels according to their carbon emissions. A biofuel must demonstrate a certified footprint at least 30% lower than the petrofuel, but none of the major biofuels will currently qualify for certification, as under default values nominated by the Ministry of Environment, none of then clear the 30% obstacle.

AB  - The soaring of oil prices have paved the way for reducing food miles and carbon footprint. Research is on going on different solutions to yield low-carbon operations. One alternative to fuel are gas like LNG, biogas and biomethane. The fuel burned is non-toxic and is cleaner than petrol or diesel. However, the downside is that it has a lower energy density. Hydrogen and fuel cells are also an alternative. The technology is clean and has no harsh residues but is currently expensive. Biofuels can be produced from any source, like sugar, starch crops or yeast to produce ethanol, which is then the alternative fuel. Hybrid cars are currently the best solutions available. Hybrid cars run on two engines, wherein the first is by rechargeable batteries, which is a cleaner offering.

AB  - Traditionally agriculture has supplied the human need for food, feed, and fiber (linen, cotton, wool) and to a minor extent for fuel in the form of wood used in the less-developed regions of the world. Wood is also used for constructional purposes. Now there is a change. Driven by concerns about security of supply to meet our oil and gas needs and about our carbon footprint, the demand for alternative energy supply is rising rapidly. By using new technology, moving air (wind) and moving water (tidal flow and rivers) are being harnessed to produce electricity. Additionally, there is a need for a source of liquid fuel for transport and heating systems. Bioethanol, produced particularly in the United States and Brazil, can be mixed with gasoline. Biodiesel, produced particularly in Europe but increasingly in other countries, can be mixed with petro-diesel. These are now the major biofuels for transport. In 10-20 years' time they will be replaced or supplemented by second-generation liquid fuels. These will still be products of the agricultural industry but will be less competitive with foods.

AB  - Transesterification reaction was performed using sunflower oil and short-chain alcohol by immobilized lipases in organic solvents. The fatty acid ester, which is the product of this reaction, can be used as a diesel fuel that does not produce sulfur oxide and minimize the soot particulate. Immobilized porcine pancreatic lipase (PPL) and Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) showed the satisfactory activity in these reactions. Immobilization of lipases was carried out using inorganic absorbance Celit 545 particle as a carrier. Organic solvent like hexane in reactions was required when methanol and ethanol were used as alcoholic substrate. The reaction could be performed in absence of solvent when 1-propanol and 1-butanol were used as short-chain alcohol. The activities of immobilized lipases were highly increased in comparison with free lipases because its activity sites became more effective. Immobilized enzyme could be repeatedly used without difficult method of separation and the decrease in its activity was not largely observed. Copyright © Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - Hyderabad represents a clear case of an emerging megacity where the evolution of problems of sustainability and the drivers of undesirable change can be easily observed. The peri-urban areas of Hyderabad provide substantial empirical evidence of the interdependencies between urban and rural issues of sustainable development. The state government of Andhra Pradesh implements a programme for the production of bio-diesel from Jatropha curcas plantations in semi-arid areas around Hyderabad. Bio-fuel plantations are considered as one of the options to rehabilitate degraded lands and to enhance employment generation for the rural poor in India. The biofuel programme has also high potentialities to improve the urban environment of Hyderabad city. Trials with 20% biofuel mix in buses have shown positive results. Long term comprehensive policies, institutional innovation and improved governance structures at village level play an important role to reduce rural-urban migration and to contribute more effectively to poverty alleviation.

AB  - Blends of biodiesel and petrodiesel are being used increasingly worldwide. Due to several factors, inaccurate blending of these two mixtures can occur. To test the accuracy of biodiesel blending, we developed and validated a radiocarbon-based method and then analyzed a variety of retail biodiesel blends. Error propagation analysis demonstrated that this method calculates absolute blend content with ± 1% accuracy, even when real-world variability in the component biodiesel and petrodiesel sources is taken into account. We independently confirmed this accuracy using known endmembers and prepared mixtures. This is the only published method that directly quantifies the carbon of recent biological origin in biodiesel blends. Consequently, it robustly handles realistic chemical variability in biological source materials and provides unequivocal apportionment of renewable versus nonrenewable carbon in a sample fuel blend. Analysis of retail biodiesel blends acquired in 2006 in the United States revealed that inaccurate blending happens frequently. Only one out of ten retail samples passed the specifications that the United States Department of Defense requires for blendsthatare 20% biodiesel (v/v; referred to as B20). © 2008 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The aim of this study is to provide a global approach on liquid biofuels such as bioethanol and biodiesel, a key topic for the future of energy for transportation. The term biofuel is referred to as liquid or gaseous fuel for the transport sector that are predominantly produced from biomass. There are several reasons for biofuels to be considered as relevant technologies by both developing and industrialized countries. They include energy security reasons, environmental concerns, foreign exchange savings, and socioeconomic issues related to the rural sector. Bioethanol is a petrol additive/substitute. It is possible that wood, straw, and even household wastes may be economically converted to bioethanol. Bioethanol is derived from alcoholic fermentation of sucrose or simple sugars, which are produced from biomass by hydrolysis process. Biodiesel is an environmentally friendly alternative liquid fuel that can be used in any diesel engine without modification. There has been renewed interest in the use of vegetable oils for making biodiesel due to less pollution and its renewable nature in contrast to conventional petroleum diesel fuel.

AB  - We describe the primary aerobic biodegradation of a B20 fuel (20% soybean fatty acid methyl esters, 80% petroleum diesel) by unacclimated inocula from a rainwater detention pond. Biodegradation was rapid and essentially complete, with an overall median 'half-life', at ∼100 ppm B20, of 6.8 days (n = 34). Using purge-and-trap and extraction methodologies, both coupled to GC/MS, and hexachloroethane and hexachlorobenzene as conserved internal markers in the B20, we followed the biodegradation of total detectable material, 76 individual analytes and eight undifferentiated groups of isomers, and calculated their half-lives under these conditions. The fatty acid methyl esters, n-alkanes and iso-alkanes, and simple and alkylated aromatic compounds were the most readily degraded compounds, followed by the naphthenes. The last (identified) compounds to be degraded were ethylalkanes, trisubstituted cyclohexanes and decalins, but even these disappeared with an apparent 'half-life' of <30 days. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Problem-solving processes in value management (VM) workshops in the construction industry are experience-based, and the quality of these workshops depends very much on the experience of the team members. The efficiency and effectiveness of VM workshops can be improved by better reusing the experience of previous VM cases and field knowledge. This paper describes a new approach to facilitate VM workshops in the construction industry using data mining (DM) techniques. The feasibility of integrating DM techniques with VM workshops in the construction industry is demonstrated in case studies. Examples are presented to illustrate different methods of applying DM tools in VM workshops. The results show that DM techniques can help team members in VM workshops to understand their problems more clearly and to generate more ideas for current problems. © 2008 Tsinghua University Press.

AB  - Non-edible oil contains several unsaponifiable and toxic components, which make them unsuitable for human consumption. Karanja (Pongamia pinnata) is an underutilized plant which is grown in many parts of India. Sometimes the oil is contaminated with high free fatty acids (FFAs) depending upon the moisture content in the seed during collection as well as oil expression. The present study deals with production of biodiesel from high FFA Karanja oil because the conventional alkali-catalyzed route is not the feasible route. This paper discusses the mechanism of a dual process adopted for the production of biodiesel from Karanja oil containing FFA up to 20%. The first step is acid-catalyzed esterification by using 0.5% H2SO4, alcohol 6:1 molar ratio with respect to the high FFA Karanja oil to produce methyl ester by lowering the acid value, and the next step is alkali-catalyzed transesterification. The yield of biodiesel from high FFA Karanja oil by dual step process has been observed to be 96.6-97%. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Kosteletzkya virginica, a perennial halophyte, is native to the American salt marsh. It was introduced into China as a potential species to improve tideland and develop ecologically sound saline agriculture. The experimental results in the fields over 10 years indicated that K. virginica adapts excellently to the tidal flat habitats in China's east coast, with multiple ecobenefits such as landscape beautification, revegetation and providing food source for targeted wildlife or migratory birds. Seed yields of unselected mixed and bred lines were 621 kg/ha and 957 kg/ha, respectively. Oil contents in the seeds of the unselected mixed and bred lines were 17.536% and 20.64%, respectively. The unsaturated fatty acids (70.134%) in the seed oil predominated over the saturated ones (29.866%). Seed oil of K. virginica could produce a high quality biodiesel, of which the unsaturated C18 content of the main part was about 68.62% and sulfur content was 0.0003%. Cetane No. and flash point were both higher than those of diesel fuel, and rust class of steel was lower than that of diesel fuel. These indicate that K. virginica could be used as an agroecoengineering species for alternative agricultural production and for revegetation of salt-affected tidal flats in China's east coast. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The autoignition of methyl butanoate has been studied at 1 and 4 atm in a shock tube over the temperature range 1250-1760 K at equivalence ratios of 1.5, 1.0, 0.5, and 0.25 at fuel concentrations of 1.0 and 1.5%. These measurements are complemented by autoignition data from a rapid compression machine over the temperature range 640-949 K at compressed gas pressures of 10, 20, and 40 atm and at varying equivalence ratios of 1.0, 0.5, and 0.33 using fuel concentrations of 1.59 and 3.13%. The autoignition of methyl butanoate is observed to follow Arrhenius-like temperature dependence over all conditions studied. These data, together with speciation data reported in the literature in a flow reactor, a jet-stirred reactor, and an opposed-flow diffusion flame, were used to produce a detailed chemical kinetic model. It was found that the model correctly simulated the effect of change in equivalence ratio, fuel fraction, and pressure for shock tube ignition delays. The agreement with rapid compression machine ignition delays is less accurate, although the qualitative agreement is reasonable. The model reproduces most speciation data with good accuracy. In addition, the important reaction pathways over each regime have been elucidated by both sensitivity and flux analyses. © 2008 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - In this study, usability of cotton oil soapstock biodiesel-diesel fuel blends as an alternative fuel for diesel engines were studied. Biodiesel was produced by reacting cotton oil soapstock with methyl alcohol at determined optimum condition. The cotton oil biodiesel-diesel fuel blends were tested in a single cylinder direct injection diesel engine. Engine performances and smoke value were measured at full load condition. Torque and power output of the engine with cotton oil soapstock biodiesel-diesel fuel blends decreased by 5.8% and 6.2%, respectively. Specific fuel consumption of engine with cotton oil soapstock-diesel fuel blends increased up to 10.5%. At maximum torque speeds, smoke level of engine with blend fuels decreased up to 46.6%, depending on the amount of biodiesel. These results were compared with diesel fuel values. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Alternative renewable fuels are more and more important due to increasing oil prices, environmental concerns and their potential to preserve the agricultural activity. For the case of biofuels derived from agricultural crops, several possibilities can be considered, such as raw oil, oil-derived methyl esters, bioethanol or mixtures with conventional fuels (diesel fuel or gasoline). The straight use of vegetable oils and their derivates poses some problems on the mixture formation process and droplet evaporation, that are essentially derived from their much higher viscosity (up to five times the viscosity of the diesel fuel) and higher boiling temperature. The present paper presents a numerical study on evaporating biofuel droplets injected through a turbulent cross-stream. This study uses an Eulerian/Lagragian approach to account for turbulent transport, dispersion, evaporation and coupling between both processes in practical spray injection systems, which usually include air flows in the combustion chamber-like swirl, tumble and squish in I.C. engines or cross-flow in boilers and gas turbines. An array of evaporating biofuel droplets through a cross-flow is studied, and a comparison of the droplet fuel dispersion and evaporation with conventional fuels is performed. The results obtained with DF-2 and RME showed that an homogeneous mixture can only be obtained with very high levels of pre-heating, and the use of ethanol (obtained from sugar or starch crops) may be a better alternative in ignition-assisted combustion systems, while RME can be successfully used as an alternative fuel in applications that utilize diffusion flames. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Raphanus sativus (L. Var) is a perennial plant of the Brassicaceae (or Cruciferae) family whose oil has not been investigated in detail for biodiesel production, particularly when ethanol is used as the alcoholysis agent. In this work, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to determine the optimum condition for the ethanolysis of R. sativus crude oil. Three process variables were evaluated at two levels (23 experimental design): the ethanol:oil molar ratio (6:1 and 12:1), the catalyst concentration in relation to oil mass (0.4 and 0.8 wt% NaOH) and the alcoholysis temperature (45 and 65 °C). When the experimental results were tentatively adjusted by linear regression, only 58.15% of its total variance was explained. Therefore, a quadratic model was investigated to improve the poor predictability of the linear model. To apply the quadratic model, the 23 experimental design had to be expanded to a circumscribed central composite design. This allowed the development of a response surface that was able to predict 97.75% of the total variance of the system. Validation was obtained by performing one ethanolysis experiment at the conditions predicted by the model (38 °C, ethanol:oil molar ratio of 11.7:1 and 0.6 wt% NaOH). The resulting ester yield (104.10 wt% or 99.10% of the theoretical yield of 105.04 wt%) was shown to be the highest among all conditions tested in this study. The second ethanolysis stage of the best RSM product required 50% less ethanol and 90% less catalyst consumption. The amount of ethyl esters obtained after this procedure reached 94.5% of the theoretical yield. The resulting ethyl esters were shown to comply with most of the Brazilian biodiesel specification parameters except for oxidation stability. Addition of 500 ppm of BHT to the esters, however, complied with the specification target of 6 h. The application of 2 wt% Magnesol® after the second ethanolysis stage eliminated the need for water washing and helped generate a final product with less unreacted glycerides. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A technique to produce biodiesel from crude Jatropha curcas seed oil (CJCO) having high free fatty acids (15%FFA) has been developed. The high FFA level of JCJO was reduced to less than 1% by a two-step pretreatment process. The first step was carried out with 0.60 w/w methanol-to-oil ratio in the presence of 1% w/w H2SO4 as an acid catalyst in 1-h reaction at 50 °C. After the reaction, the mixture was allowed to settle for 2 h and the methanol-water mixture separated at the top layer was removed. The second step was transesterified using 0.24 w/w methanol to oil and 1.4% w/w NaOH to oil as alkaline catalyst to produce biodiesel at 65 °C. The final yield for methyl esters of fatty acids was achieved ca. 90% in 2 h. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Both ethanol and biodiesel are important biofuels. As oxyfuels, ethanol and biodiesel can be blended with diesel oil to reduce diesel engine emissions, especially particulate matter emission. A novel biofuel blend containing biodiesel, ethanol, and diesel oil (biodiesel-ethanol-diesel blended fuel) was introduced based on summary of separate practical application of ethanol-diesel blend fuel and biodiesel to diesel engines. Some recent researches on the solubility and phase behavior of the biodiesel-ethanoldiesel ternary system, its fuel properties, and its emission characteristics from diesel engine were reviewed.

AB  - Though a tenth of Nepal's energy requirement, especially in the urban sector, is met with petroleum products; the external dependence on it has caused irregularity in the supply and hampered economic growth of the country. Moreover; the dependence of more than 80% of Nepal's rural population on traditional biomass and/or fossil fuel for energy has always been the reason for health problems and has stopped them from moving out of their woe towards economic development. One of the ways to get rid of this external dependence and to improve the national economy is to find alternatives and biofuel could be a better option to substitute fossil fuels as compared to other energy resources such as hydropower or solar energy that need expensive infrastructure and more time to develop. The abundance of resources such as molasses, plant species producing inedible oil, fat and resins could support the intervention of biofuel such as ethanol, biodiesel, un-esterified plant oil and turpentine in various applications ranging from urban vehicles to rural requirements of operating irrigation pumps, agro-processing mills, electric generators, cookers and lamps. Initiations for the use of biofuel started in Nepal long back with various action research activities by different sectors and this needs to be continued by developing infrastructures, building technical capacity of stakeholders and formulating policies that are favorable for harnessing energy from the abundantly available resources.

AB  - Palm oil biodiesel (POB) has excellent properties as a fuel for engines. However, due to its highly saturated chemical composition, this biofuel presents a faulty performance at temperatures close to the environmental temperature of several Colombian cities. At 16 °C, POB begins to form small crystals which grow and form agglomerates as the temperature continues decreasing, in such a way they can completely plug the fuel flow at temperatures between 12 °C and 9 °C. In this work, the fractionation technique of POB by crystallization induced by cooling was evaluated for improving its cold flow properties. The cooling or winterization temperature (Tw) and the stabilization time (ts) were the variables taken into account in the fractionation process. According to the values of the cloud point (CP) and pour point (PP) of the POB, the range for Tw tested was very limited (12 °C-16 °C). The process allowed the production of a liquid fraction, at Tw, with better cold flow properties than those of the original POB. For the extreme tested conditions (ts=24 hours and Tw=14 °C), a liquid fraction having a CP of 6 °C lower than the original POB was obtained. Such a change in the CP corresponded to an increase in the unsaturated methyl esters content of 4,7% and a reduction of the palmitic acid methyl esters content of 5,29%. The induced changes in the chemical composition of liquid fractions did not have significant effects on their fuel basic properties.

AB  - The feasibility of biodiesel production from tung oil was investigated. The esterification reaction of the free fatty acids of tung oil was performed using Amberlyst-15. Optimal molar ratio of methanol to oil was determined to be 7.5:1, and Amberlyst-15 was 20.8wt% of oil by response surface methodology. Under these reaction conditions, the acid value of tung oil was reduced to 0.72mg KOH/g. In the range of the molar equivalents of methanol to oil under 5, the esterification was strongly affected by the amount of methanol but not the catalyst. When the molar ratio of methanol to oil was 4.1:1 and Amberlyst-15 was 29.8wt% of the oil, the acid value decreased to 0.85mg KOH/g. After the transesterification reaction of pretreated tung oil, the purity of tung biodiesel was 90.2wt%. The high viscosity of crude tung oil decreased to 9.8mm2/s at 40°C. Because of the presence of eleostearic acid, which is a main component of tung oil, the oxidation stability as determined by the Rancimat method was very low, 0.5h, but the cold filter plugging point, -11°C, was good. The distillation process did not improve the fatty acid methyl ester content and the viscosity. © 2007 Humana Press Inc.

AB  - The reduction of local pollutants from vehicles is a high priority for cities around the world, especially those with chronic air pollution. Technology and innovation are vital to delivering alternative fuels that address these conditions. According to the International Energy Authority, energy demand is expected to increase 50% by 2030. While world energy demand as a whole will reflect more non-hydrocarbon options, world energy demand for transportation will stay predominantly oil-based, with India and China the focus of increased demand. Greater hydrocarbon use means more CO2 emissions. Substitutes for oil in the transport and power generation sectors are actively being developed, including gas-to-liquids (GTL) fuel, biofuels, and hydrogen. Diesel containing GTL fuel from Malaysia is available in ∼ 4000 Shell retail stations in Europe and Thailand. Shell and Iogen are working together to commercialize cellulose ethanol as EcoEthanol™, and with Volkswagen to explore the economic feasibility of producing cellulose ethanol in Germany. Shell Hydrogen is working on mini-networks, where hydrogen is offered at a number of regular fueling stations, so that hydrogen vehicles can operate freely and refuel throughout a city. The use of of biofuels in place of conventional fuels can reduce CO2 emissions and increase energy security for countries without hydrocarbon reserves. Although gasoline and diesel will continue to dominate for many years, Shell technology and innovations have already changed the global transport fuels mix in response to the energy challenge.

AB  - The US pulp and paper industry is taking effective measures to help the renewable fuels grow beyond the capability of corn-based ethanol and utilize the 'second-generation' biofuels through integrated biorefineries to overcome the global shortage of oil and gas. These fuels include renewable gasoline and diesel, cellulosic ethanol, and fuel feedstock, manufactured from catalytic reactions, such as the Fischer-Tropsch. One of the unique aspects of a forest products biorefinery is its powerful life cycle and its ability to offer good results for the life cycle of potential steam hosts. The US is also planning to have the mill skills and the corporate rate will to integrate a second biorefinery, which will increase the life cycle of the facility. One of the novel aspects of a properly managed biorefinery also is that it may have a lifetime that exceeds that of a modern tropical pulp mill, which remains a pulp mill.

AB  - Currently, considerable attention has been given to the investigation of biofuels, including biodiesel, as alternative fuels for internal combustion engines. This study is aimed to investigate the effects of fumigation methanol on the emissions of a diesel engine fueled with biodiesel as the baseline fuel. The biodiesel used in this study was converted from waste cooking oil. Experiments were performed on a 4-cylinder naturally aspirated diesel engine operating at a constant speed of 1800 rev/min for three engine loads. The results indicate no significant change in brake thermal efficiency and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, an increase in both carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbon (HC) emissions, and a decrease in both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions. In particular, there is also an increase in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the exhaust gas. The results obtained at a fumigation ratio of 0.1 are compared with those obtained with the engine operating on ultralow sulfur diesel: there is still an increase in CO and HC, by a factor of up to two, and an increase in NO2, by a factor of up to 5, while the NOx is reduced by up to 8% and the particulate mass is reduced by up to 50%, depending on the engine load. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Particulate emissions from a 4.8-kW diesel generator running on ultra-low sulfur diesel and biodiesel fuels are characterized as a function of engine load. Number distributions measured by a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) show that particle mobility diameters rise with increasing engine loads. The elemental carbon (EC) to organic carbon (OC) ratio, measured by thermo-optical transmission evolved gas analysis, with careful attention to avoid OC sampling artifacts, increases from about 0.5 at idle load to 3.8 at 100% load when using diesel fuel. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the particles showed that at idle, the particles were liquid droplets together with a few aggregates. When a load was applied, the droplets were replaced by chain aggregates, which had a mean primary particle size of 29±9 nm at 100% load. Fractal dimension averaged 1.63±0.13, consistent with much larger diesel engines emissions reported in the literature. The use of biofuel (B100) results in emissions of particles that are compact, irregular, and lack the clearly defined primary particles of diesel aggregates, and yet at maximum load they have similar EC and OC content as diesel particles. The accuracy of the idealized aggregate (IA) theory correction and its extension to the transition regime [Lall, A.A., Friedlander, S.K., 2006. On-line measurement of ultrafine aggregate surface area and volume distributions by electrical mobility analysis: 1. Theoretical analysis. Journal of Aerosol Science 37, 260-271] was tested as a method to obtain mass distributions for diesel aggregates using and SMPS. The total mass concentrations calculated from the SMPS measurements using the extended IA theory are in good agreement with the mass concentrations obtained from gravimetric and EC/OC measurements. The loss of aggregates in the TSI SMPS inlet impactor is also discussed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biofuels are often presented as a contribution towards the solution of the problems related to our strong dependency on fossil fuels, i.e. greenhouse effect, energy dependency, urban pollution, besides being a way to support rural development. In this paper, an integrated assessment approach is employed to discuss the social desirability of a large-scale biodiesel production in Italy, taking into account social, environmental and economic factors. The conclusion is that the advantages in terms of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, energy dependency and urban pollution would be very modest. The small benefits would not be enough to offset the huge costs in terms of land requirement: if the target of the European Directive 2003/30/EC were reached (5.75% of the energy used for transport by 2010) the equivalent of about one-third of the Italian agricultural land would be needed. The consequences would be a considerable increase in food imports and large environmental impacts in the agricultural phase. Also, since biodiesel must be de-taxed in order to make it competitive with oil-derived diesel, the Italian energy revenues would be reduced. In the end, rural development remains the only sound reason to promote biodiesel, but even for this objective other strategies look more advisable, like supporting organic agriculture. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The vegetable oils are all extremely viscous with viscosities ranging from 10 to 20 times greater than petroleum diesel fuel. The purpose of the transesterification process is to lower the viscosity of the oil. Methyl and ethyl esters as biodiesel were prepared from cottonseed oil through transesterification using non-catalytic supercritical fluids. The transesterfication of linseed oil in SCF such as methanol and ethanol has proved to be the most promising process. The biodiesels were characterized for their physical and main fuel properties including viscosity, density, flash point and higher heating value (HHV). The viscosities of biodiesels (3.6-4.0 mm2/s at 311 K) were much less than those of pure oils (33-36 mm2/s at 311 K), and their HHVs of approximately 40.5 MJ/kg were 10% less than those of petrodiesel fuels (∼45 MJ/kg). The flash point values (435-445 K) of methyl and ethyl esters are highly lower than that of cottonseed oil (507-512 K). The most important variables affecting the ester yield during the transesterification reaction are molar ratio of alcohol to vegetable oil and reaction temperature. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To improve the oxidation stability and the low temperature flow properties of a biodiesel mixture, the dependence of the oxidation stability and the cold filter plugging point (CFPP) on the fatty acid compositions was examined. Three different kinds of biodiesels, palm, rapeseed, and soybean biodiesels, were blended with the different weight ratios. The oxidation stability and the CFPP of the blended biodiesels had a close relationship with the compositions of the major fatty acid components. The oxidation stability of the blended biodiesels decreased as the total contents of the linoleic and linolenic acids increased. The correlation was obtained as Y = 117.9295/X + 2.5905 (0 < X < 100) where X is the content of the linoleic and linolenic acids (wt%) and Y is the oxidation stability (h). The CFPP decreased with the increase of the total unsaturated fatty acid contents. The correlation was obtained as Y = -0.4880X + 36.0548 (0 < X ≤ 88) and Y = -2.7043X + 232.0036 (88 < X < 100) where X is the content of the unsaturated fatty acid (wt%) and Y is the CFPP (°C). If the compositions of the blended biodiesels are determined, it is possible to predict their oxidation stability and CFPP. Using the above three correlations, the blending ratios of biodiesel mixture having the specified properties can be determined. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The success of implementing alternative fuels for road transport depends on their cost, performance and reliability. This paper focuses on the use of natural gas and LPG, hydrogen and biofuels in Europe. A brief presentation is given of their technical development status, their market potential, and barriers to their implementation in various market segments. Some market barriers are common to many new technologies, and can be overcome through adequate policy measures at European level. Generally, a combination of policies is required, and a number of supporting measures increase their effectiveness. The following policies affecting energy use in transport are discussed: market incentives, policies targeting technology and vehicle efficiency, and overall system improvement. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Two different biodiesel fuels, obtained from waste cooking oils with different previous uses, were tested in a DI diesel commercial engine either pure or in 30% and 70% v/v blends with a reference diesel fuel. Tests were performed under a set of engine operating conditions corresponding to typical road conditions. Although the engine efficiency was not significantly affected, an increase in fuel consumption with the biodiesel concentration was observed. This increase was proportional to the decrease in the heating value. The main objective of the work was to study the effect of biodiesel blends on particulate emissions, measured in terms of mass, optical effect (smoke opacity) and size distributions. A sharp decrease was observed in both smoke and particulate matter emissions as the biodiesel concentration was increased. The mean particle size was also reduced with the biodiesel concentration, but no significant increases were found in the range of the smallest particles. No important differences in emissions were found between the two tested biodiesel fuels. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The current use of South Asian palm oil as biofuel is far from climate neutral. Dependent on assumptions, losses of biogenic carbon associated with ecosystems, emission of CO2 due to the use of fossil fuels and the anaerobic conversion of palm oil mill effluent currently correspond in South Asia with an emission of about 2.8-19.7 kg CO2 equivalent per kg of palm oil. Using oil palm and palm oil processing wastes for the generation of energy and preventing further conversion of tropical forest into oil palm plantations by establishing new plantations on non-peaty degraded soils can, however, lead to large cuts in the emission of carbon-based greenhouse gases currently associated with the palm oil lifecycle. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Oil was extracted from Lophira lanceolata seeds and some physicochemical properties were examined. The oil yield is promising. Methyl ester derivative which exhibited better fuel properties was produced from the oil. The refractive index, free fatty acid, kinematic viscosity, saponification and iodine values were determined and discussed in relationship to its applications. The energy density compared favourably with those of other seed oils and commercial grade diesel. The waste shells were also utilized for the production of biogas with potentials as energy resource that can be stored and used. The residue left behind possessed bio-fertilizer value showing the presence of N, P, K, Ca, Mg. Hence, L. lanceolata has potentials of a renewable energy resource. © 2008 Academic Journals.

AB  - America's insatiable demand for energy ensures that the marketplace is very large and has plenty of room for competition for both the oil and biofuels industry. Meanwhile, the oil industry has developed their own version of renewable fuels, such as the production of diesel through the thermal depolymerization (TDP) of Tyson Foods' chicken offal. On the one hand, the biofuel industry argued that high oil prices are a result of the oil industry's lack of refining capacity. However, the biofuel industry is complaining that they are subjected to just the same tax breaks afforded by the government to the oil industry. However, an impending doom for the biofuel industry is that they do actually need the assistance of the oil industry especially when their transport comes into mind. To be viable, biodiesel must get into existing pipelines and blending facilities in large quantities.

AB  - Due to the concern on the availability of recoverable fossil fuel reserves and the environmental problems caused by the use those fossil fuels, considerable attention has been given to biodiesel production as an alternative to petrodiesel. However, as the biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils and animal fats, there are concerns that biodiesel feedstock may compete with food supply in the long-term. Hence, the recent focus is to find oil bearing plants that produce non-edible oils as the feedstock for biodiesel production. In this paper, two plant species, soapnut (Sapindus mukorossi) and jatropha (jatropha curcas, L.) are discussed as newer sources of oil for biodiesel production. Experimental analysis showed that both oils have great potential to be used as feedstock for biodiesel production. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) from cold pressed soapnut seed oil was envisaged as biodiesel source for the first time. Soapnut oil was found to have average of 9.1% free FA, 84.43% triglycerides, 4.88% sterol and 1.59% others. Jatropha oil contains approximately 14% free FA, approximately 5% higher than soapnut oil. Soapnut oil biodiesel contains approximately 85% unsaturated FA while jatropha oil biodiesel was found to have approximately 80% unsaturated FA. Oleic acid was found to be the dominant FA in both soapnut and jatropha biodiesel. Over 97% conversion to FAME was achieved for both soapnut and jatropha oil. © 2008 by MDPI.

AB  - With the use of biodiesel in clear growth, it is important to quantify any potential emission benefits or liabilities of this fuel. Several researches are available concerning the regulated emissions of biodiesel/diesel blends, but there is a lack of information about non-regulated emissions. In a previous paper [Corrêa, S.M., Arbilla, G., 2006. Emissões de formaldeído e acetaldeído de misturas biodiesel/diesel. Periódico Tchê Química, 3, 54-68], the emissions of aromatic hydrocarbons were reported. In this work, seven carbonyl emissions (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, acetone, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, and benzaldehyde) were evaluated by a heavy-duty diesel engine fueled with pure diesel (D) and biodiesel blends (v/v) of 2% (B2), 5% (B5), 10% (B10), and 20% (B20). The tests were conducted using a six cylinder heavy-duty engine, typical of the Brazilian fleet of urban buses, in a steady-state condition under 1000, 1500, and 2000 rpm. The exhaust gases were diluted nearly 20 times and the carbonyls were sampled with SiO2-C18 cartridges, impregnated with acid solution of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. The chemical analyses were performed by high performance liquid chromatography using UV detection. Using average values for the three modes of operation (1000, 1500, and 2000 rpm) benzaldehyde showed a reduction on the emission (-3.4% for B2, -5.3% for B5, -5.7% for B10, and -6.9% for B20) and all other carbonyls showed a significative increase: 2.6, 7.3, 17.6, and 35.5% for formaldehyde; 1.4, 2.5, 5.4, and 15.8% for acetaldehyde; 2.1, 5.4, 11.1, and 22.0% for acrolein+acetone; 0.8, 2.7, 4.6, and 10.0% for propionaldehyde; 3.3, 7.8, 16.0, and 26.0% for butyraldehyde. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Agal-fermentation-based microbio-diesel production was realized through high-cell-density fermentation of Chlorella protothecoides and efficient transesterification process. Cell density achieved was 16.8 g l-1 in 184 h and 51.2 g l-1 in 167 h in a 5-l bioreactor by performing preliminary and improved fed-batch culture strategy, respectively. The lipid content was 57.8, 55.2, and 50.3% of cell dry weight from batch, primary, and improved fed-batch culture in 5-l bioreactor. Transesterification was catalyzed by immobilized lipase, and the conversion rate reached up to 98%. The properties of biodiesel from Chlorella were comparable to conventional diesel fuel and comply with US standard for Biodiesel. In a word, the approach including high-density fermentation of Chlorella and enzymatic transesterification process were set up and proved to be a promising alternative for biodiesel production. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Jatropha curcas contains high amounts of oil in its seed and has been considered for bio-diesel production. A transformation procedure for J. curcas has been established for the first time via Agrobacterium tumefaciens infection of cotyledon disc explants. The results indicated that the efficiency of transformation using the strain LBA4404 and phosphinothricin for selection was an improvement over that with the strain EHA105 and hygromycin. About 55% of the cotyledon explants produced phosphinothricin-resistant calluses on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 1.5 mg l-1 benzyladenine (BA), 0.05 mg l-1 3-indolebutyric acid (IBA), 1 mg l-1 phosphinothricin and 500 mg l-1 cefotaxime after 4 weeks. Shoots were regenerated following transfer of the resistant calli to shoot induction medium containing 1.5 mg l-1 BA, 0.05 mg l-1 IBA, 0.5 mg l -1 gibberellic acid (GA3), 1 mg l-1 phosphinothricin and 250 mg l-1 cefotaxime, and about 33% of the resistant calli differentiated into shoots. Finally, the resistant shoots were rooted on 1/2 MS media supplemented with 0.3 mg l-1 IBA at a rate of 78%. The transgenic nature of the transformants was demonstrated by the detection of β-glucuronidase activity in the primary transformants and by PCR and Southern hybridization analysis. 13% of the total inoculated explants produced transgenic plants after approximately 4 months. The procedure described will be useful for both, the introduction of desired genes into J. curcas and the molecular analysis of gene function. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The use of photoionization mass spectrometry for the development of quantitative kinetic models for the complex combustion chemistry of both conventional hydrocarbon fuels and oxygenated biofuels requires near-threshold measurements of absolute photoionization cross-sections for numerous reaction intermediates. Near-threshold absolute cross-sections for molecular and dissociative photoionization for 20 stable reaction intermediates (methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, cyclopropane, methylcyclopentane, 1-butene, cis-2-butene, isobutene, 1-pentene, cyclohexene, 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene, 1,3-hexadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, propanal, 1-butyne, 2-butyne) are presented. Previously measured total photoionization cross-sections for 9 of these molecules are in good agreement with the present results. The measurements are performed with photoionization mass spectrometry (PIMS) using a monochromated VUV synchrotron light source with an energy resolution of 40 meV (fwhm) comparable to that used for flame-sampling molecular beam PIMS studies of flame chemistry and reaction kinetics. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study deals with an experimental work that aims to examine effects of purified sulfate turpentine obtained from a kraft pulp mill in Turkey on an engine performance and exhaust emissions of a spark ignition engine. Three fuel samples are used to test the performance and emission of a 1300 cc engine manufactured by TOFAŞ. They are pure gasoline with 98-octane number and two other gasoline-turpentine fuel samples obtained by blending gasoline with turpentine in ratios of 5% and 10% on basis of total mass of the fuel. The thermophysical properties of the fuels are acquired by density, viscosity, flash and fire points, sulphur content, heating value and distillation tests. The experimental results showed that the turpentine has a positive effect on the engine performance parameters, such as brake power, thermal efficiency, mean effective pressure and specific fuel consumption. The turpentine also increases pollutant NOx, unburned hydrocarbon contents and exhaust temperature, but it decreases CO concentration in the exhaust. It is observed that utilization of the sulfate turpentine alone is not viable and it needs to be used as an additive into gasoline to some extent, thereby providing a viable alternative to pure gasoline. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is the main alternative to fossil diesel. The key advantages of its use are the fact that it is a non-toxic renewable resource, which leads to lower emissions of polluting gases. European governments are targeting the incorporation of 20% of biofuels in the general fuels until 2020. Chemically, biodiesel is a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters, derived from vegetable oils or animal fats, which is usually produced by a transesterification reaction, where the oils/fats react with an alcohol, in the presence of a catalyst. The European Standard (EN 14214) establishes 25 parameters that have to be analysed to certify biodiesel quality and the analytical methods that should be used to determine those properties. This work reports the use of near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to determine the esters content in biodiesel as well as the content in linolenic acid methyl esters (C18:3) in industrial and laboratory-scale biodiesel samples. Furthermore, calibration models for myristic (C14:0), palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2) acid methyl esters were also obtained. Principal component analysis was used for the qualitative analysis of the spectra, while partial least squares regression was used to develop the calibration models between analytical and spectral data. The results confirm that NIR spectroscopy, in combination with multivariate calibration, is a promising technique to assess the biodiesel quality control in both laboratory-scale and industrial scale samples. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The applicability of the headspace liquid phase microextraction and gas chromatography (HS-LPME/GC) for the expeditious and reliable screening of 68 well water samples for selected fuel oxygenates compounds, viz. methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE), tertiary-amyl methyl ether (TAME), ethyl tertiary-butyl ether (ETBE) and n-butyl ethyl ether (n-BEE) has been evaluated. The method used 3 μl of 1:1 benzyl alcohol/1-octanol as extraction solvent, 20 min extraction time with stirring at 1,250 rpm, at 20°C and salt addition of a mixture of 0.3 g ml-1 sodium sulphate/0.1 g ml-1 sodium chloride. The enrichment factors of this method were from 171 to 571. Limits of detection were in the range of 77-110 ng l-1. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) at 0.05, 0.50 and 10.0 mg l-1 of spiking levels were in the range of 1.28-6.80% with recoveries between 96.2 and 106.0%. Sixty-eight groundwater wells that were located near different gasoline reservoirs in eight largest cities of the Sistan and Balouchestan province were screened by the method. Eight contaminated wells were identified contained MTBE at levels between 0.3 and 1.7 mg l-1. In all cases, other target analytes were at low concentrations or not detected. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.

AB  - The use of alternative fuel is considered to be an effective measure to improve the urban air quality. Concerned over deteriorating air quality in Delhi, the Delhi government initiated different measures including stringent emission norms, improved fuel quality and above all introduction of cleaner fuel-CNG in public transport system. The entire city bus fleet was converted to CNG mode by 2002. The present study reports the comparative assessment of the status of air quality with respect to PM10 and PAH before and after the introduction of CNG in public transport system in Delhi. The study has been carried out for two different time periods: first in the year 1998 and second in the year 2004. Following the total conversion of public transport system to CNG in 2002, Post-CNG data indicate a sharp reduction of 51-74% in the PM10 concentration and 58-68% in the TPAH concentration as compared to the Pre-CNG data. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.

AB  - Introduction of the limits for particles smaller than 2.5 μm or PM2.5 in the new ambient air quality standards in North America necessitates a reliable method to measure these very fine particles from different contributing sources. Canada recently developed such a method that offers credible emission characteristic data from stationary combustion systems that can be used in source apportionment modeling. The technique applies dilution sampling, cooling and humidification of stack gas to promote plume simulation, followed by comprehensive particulate analysis to provide secondary particulate concentrations that normally form under cooler ambient-like conditions. By adapting the size and chemical characterization techniques used in ambient particulate monitoring, the method enables derivation of emission source signature profiles from various combustion systems that are fingerprints of the fuel burned and the combustion equipment. Several source signature profiles for PM2.5 as well as PM10 (10 μm diameter) and total particulate matter have been developed using this methodology for several types of petroleum oils, bitumen emulsions, biofuels and pulverized coal blends using research and pilot-scale boilers and field sampling at Canadian industrial plants. Laboratory results and limited field data suggest that the particulate characteristics can be related to combustion unit configuration, fuel properties and operational conditions. PM 2.5 emissions from petroleum based fuel oils are most affected by fuel sulphur content whereas by blending with biodiesels reduces particulate emissions and sulphate content of particulate matter. Data from pulverized coal combustion showed a strong influence of mineral ash and sulphur content on particulate emissions and the efficiency of the particulate control device. The combustion equipment configuration also plays a critical role in combustion performance of the fuel, hence pollution emissions. Experimental results and field data are being examined for developing PM2.5 management strategies for industrial plant emissions, based on fuel modifications alone. For example, burning low sulphur and low asphaltene fuels or biofuel/petroleum blends and employing advanced burner designs could reduce emissions from oil combustion. For pulverized coal, burning of low sulphur and low ash coal blends combined with advanced particulate control devices would offer the best abatement options. The use of promising fuels such as bitumen emulsions and biodiesel blends would provide additional energy security as well as beneficial options for greenhouse gas reductions. PM 2.5 management options based on the fuel modification approach alone are given and overall plant emission reduction strategies could be further developed by incorporating additional economic and operational aspects. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - (Chemical Equation Presented) In this paper, we report a detailed analysis of the breakdown kinetic mechanism for methyl butanoate (MB) using theoretical approaches. Electronic structures and structure-related molecular properties of reactants, intermediates, products, and transition states were explored at the BH&amp;HLYP/cc-pVTZ level of theory. Rate constants for the unimolecular and bimolecular reactions in the temperature range of 300-2500 K were calculated using Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus and transition state theories, respectively. Thirteen pathways were identified leading to the formation of small compounds such as CH3, C2H3, CO, CO2, and H2CO. For the initial formation of MB radicals, H, CH3, and OH were considered as reactive radicals participating in hydrogen abstraction reactions. Kinetic simulation results for a high temperature pyrolysis environment show that MB radicals are mainly produced through hydrogen abstraction reactions by H atoms. In addition, the C(O)OCH3 = CO + CH3O reaction is found to be the main source of CO formation. The newly computed kinetic sub-model for MB breakdown is recommended as a core component to study the combustion of oxygenated species. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The UK transport sector has the fastest rate of growth in terms of primary (and end-use) energy consumption, and is currently responsible for 30% of UK CO2 emissions. Biofuels could significantly reduce the emissions from the road-transport sector if they were widely adopted. They have been shown to reduce carbon emissions, and may help to increase energy security. There are many different types of biofuels, which are produced from various crops and via different processes. Biofuels can be classified broadly as biodiesel and bioethanol, and then subdivided into conventional or advanced fuels. Such biofuels are assessed in terms of indigenous UK production potential, and whether they are able to meet the domestic take-up targets set by the British Government for the road-transport sector. The various types of biofuels currently available are examined, together with potential future conversion-technologies. In-vehicle performance of these biofuels is then compared with conventional fuels, and their potential carbon savings evaluated. Finally, the main drivers and barriers to the use of biofuels in the road transport sector are discussed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An efficient regeneration method via axillary nodes has been developed for Jatropha curcas, which is a medicinal as well as a promising plant for biofuel production. This was achieved on MS medium with BA (3.0 mg/L) + IBA (1.0 mg/L) + Adenine sulfate (25 mg/L) + Glutamine (50 mg/L) +L- arginine (15 mg/L) + Citric acid (25 mg/l) within three to four weeks of inoculation. On an average, within a period of three subcultures, a single initial axillary node explant generated 100 shoots respectively there by favoring the economics of the cost of the materials and time factors. Plants were rooted on 1/2 strength MS medium supplemented with IBA (1.0-4.0 mg/L) and NAA (1.0-4.0 mg/L). The highest frequency of root induction was on the medium with 3.0 mg/L IBA. The in vitro raised plantlets were acclimatized in green house and successfully transplanted to the nursery. This is a first report of regeneration of Jatropha curcas with additives especially with L-arginine. © IJIB, All rights reserved.

AB  - This work aimed to evaluate the use of sunflower biodiesel (Helianthus annuus L.) blends in a CI engine, direct injection. The test procedure was carried out in a dynamometer bench that determined the performance of engine through power take-off (PTO) with use of diesel and sunflower biodiesel blends (B5, B10, B20 and B100). The lubricating oil was analyzed before and after period of 96 hours. The results were: D (40,7 kW; 271 g/kW.h); B5 (40,3 kW; 271 g/kW.h); B10 (39,8 kW; 277 g/kW.h); B20 (40,0 kW; 277 g/kW.h) e B100 (39,8 kW; 291 g/kW.h). One conclude that the use of blends B5, B10, B20 and B100 decreased the power of PTO max. 2,2% and increased the fuel consumption max. 7, 3%. The analysis of the lubricating oil before and after the use of B100 showed acceptable alterations and the viscosity, water content and level of iron were the most affected parameters.

AB  - Germany's existing biodiesel production plants had a total annual biodiesel capacity of more than 3 million tonnes (Mt) in 2006, while most of the countries in Africa have just initiated a first phase of biodiesel development. Commercial viability of manufacture of biodiesel for use in transportation can be facilitated in Africa through a better understanding of the economic and other factors that have contributed to the success of Germany's biodiesel industry. A cost-capacity factor n = 0.89 was obtained for biodiesel plants in some EU countries, indicating that capital costs increase more rapidly for biodiesel than for a typical processing enterprise, judging by the average 0.6 rule. The average personnel requirement (integral number of operators) for a stand-alone biodiesel plant is E ∝ Q0.5, where Q is plant capacity, indicating significant economies of scale for labour in biodiesel plants over the range of plants investigated. The net cost of biodiesel for four different system boundaries, representing a cross-section of installed biodiesel plants, (1) agricultural (oil-mill based) biodiesel plant, (2) industrial biodiesel plant (integrated with oil mill), (3) industrial biodiesel plant (stand-alone), and (4) industrial multi-feedstock plant, are Euro 0.65/l, 0.62/l, 0.73/l and 0.49/l respectively. Biodiesel production is thus not economically feasible and it will still require continued government support over time on a price basis for it to be sustainable, unless yields or petroleum prices increase considerably. Biodiesel production costs are mainly driven by the cost of raw materials, ranging from 66% for biodiesel based on yellow grease up to 85%for a large-scale standalone plant, while the "fixed" operating and capital costs comprise about 15% of the total cost. As a result, evaluation of the cost of the feedstock in any location including Africa should provide some insight into potential competitiveness of biodiesel production. It appears that small-scale plants capable of being allied to a source of feedstock or seed-oil-processing plant, with standards satisfactory to engine manufacturers, could be a feasible option for encouraging the development of a biodiesel industry in Africa as they keep more resources within the local communities. © 2008 International Energy Initiative, Inc.

AB  - The two major energy challenges for the United States are to replace crude oil in our transportation system and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A multilayer strategy to replace oil using nuclear energy and various carbon sources (fossil fuels, biomass, or air) is described that (a) allows the continued use of liquid fuels (ethanol, gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel) in the transport sector, (b) does not require major changes in lifestyle by the consumer, and (c) ultimately eliminates carbon dioxide emissions from the transport sector. Nuclear energy is used to provide electricity, heat, and ultimately hydrogen, with the hydrogen produced by either electrolysis or more advanced thermochemical production methods. In the near term, nuclear energy can provide low-temperature heat (steam) for ethanol production and electricity for transportation. Midterm options include low-temperature heat and limited quantities of hydrogen for processing cellulosic biomass into liquid fuels (ethanol and lignin-derived hydrocarbons) and providing high-temperature heat for (a) traditional refining and (b) underground oil production and refining. In the longer term, biomass becomes the feedstock for liquid-fuels production, with nuclear energy providing heat and large quantities of hydrogen for complete biomass conversion to hydrocarbon fuels. Nuclear energy could be used to provide over half the total energy required by the transportation system, and the use of oil in the transport sector could potentially be eliminated within several decades.

AB  - Nowadays, energetic utilization of biomass, biotechnology attracts a big attention not only from the environmental point of view but also have a social, political and economical impact. According to the Directive 2003/ 30/EC of the European Parliament and the European Council the emission of greenhouse gases can be reduced by 49% using bioethanol produced by a manufacturing process based on corn, instead of crude oil based fuels. Moreover in Hungary from 1st of July 2007 only gasoline with at least 4.4% bioethanol content is commercialized. In this article, some concrete examples of successful developments and/or implementation of biomass projects in Hungary are given such as: production friendly raw synthetic material at "Nitrokémia" chemical plant, manufacture of bioethanol by "Hungrana" and "Gyor Distillery" companies, bio-ethyl-tert-buthyl-ether production by MOL Pls. Danube Refinery, research on new generation of biofuels. The main advantages and disadvantages as well motivations for further research and development of Hungarian bio-industrial and bio-consumer sectors are discussed.

AB  - The Cubatão industrial complex of southeast Brazil is sited on a coastal strip bounded on the continental side by a mountainous scarp covered with tropical forest. Four cities have developed around the complex. The metropolitan region of São Paulo is located on a plateau above the scarp. The combination of the region's topography, the industrial installations, and an intensely trafficked road network causes widespread atmospheric pollution. In November 2004, measurements were made of the 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons designated as priority pollutants by the US Environmental Protection Agency, as well as of aerosol mass and ionic composition. Use of characteristic concentration ratios for emission sources show that tailpipe emissions from diesel vehicles was the main source of the compounds. This means that a shift from gasoline to ethanol as fuel in spark ignition engines will have only minor influence on atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations, despite very low emissions during ethanol combustion. On the other hand, reduction in emissions associated with increasing use of biodiesel in compression ignition engine fuel mixtures could significantly reduce atmospheric concentrations. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: Particles in ambient air are associated with such health effects as lung diseases and cancer of the lung. Exposure to bioaerosols has been found to be associated with respiratory symptoms. The toxic properties of exposure to combustion and bioaerosol particles from biofuel plants have not been studied in detail. This study investigated whether exposure to dust from biofuel plants induces DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) damage and inflammation in exposed mice. Methods: DNA damage and inflammation were evaluated in mice exposed through the intratracheal installation of airborne dust collected at a biofuel plant at the straw storage hall and in the boiler room. The mice were given either a single dose of dust (18 or 54 μg) or four doses of 54 μg on each of four consecutive days. Control mice were exposed to a 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Results: In the mice exposed to 4 × 54 μg of dust, the lung tissue mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) were increased more than 10-fold if the dust was from the boiler room and 30- to 60-fold if the dust came from the straw storage hall. The levels of DNA strand breaks in broncheoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from the mice exposed to dust did not differ from those in the control samples. Conclusions: The results indicate that the instillation of dust from a biofuel plant, at doses corresponding to 2 weeks of exposure to human endotoxins, results in a strong inflammatory response without detectable DNA damage in BAL cells. The dust from the straw storage hall induced the strongest inflammatory response and had the highest concentration of most microbial components.

AB  - Motor graders are a common type of nonroad vehicle used in many road construction and maintenance applications. In-use activity, fuel use, and emissions were measured for six selected motor graders using a portable emission measurement system. Each motor grader was tested with petroleum diesel and B20 biodiesel. Duty cycles were quantified in terms of the empirical cumulative distribution function of manifold absolute pressure (MAP), which is an indicator of engine load. The motor graders were operated under normal duty cycles for road maintenance and repair at various locations in Wake and Nash Counties in North Carolina. Approximately 3 hr of quality-assured, second-by-second data were obtained during each test. An empirical modal-based model of vehicle fuel use and emissions was developed, based on stratifying the data with respect to ranges of normalized MAP, to enable comparisons between duty cycles, motor graders, and fuels. Time-based emission factors were found to increase monotonically with MAP. Fuel-based emission factors were mainly sensitive to differences between idle and non-idle engine operation. Cycle average emission factors were estimated for road "resurfacing," "roading," and "shouldering" activities. On average, the use of B20 instead of petroleum diesel leads to a negligible decrease of 1.6% in nitric oxide emission rate, and decreases of 19-22% in emission rates of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and particulate matter. Emission rates decrease significantly when comparing newer engine tier vehicles to older ones. Significant reductions in tailpipe emissions accrue especially from the use of B20 and adoption of newer vehicles. Copyright 2008 Air & Waste Management Association.

AB  - This paper describes the procedures of the analysis of pollutant gases, as volatile organic compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene, m-xylene and p-xylene) emitted by engines, using high-resolution gas chromatography (HRGC). In a broad sense, CI engine burning diesel was compared with B10 and a drastic reduction was observed in the emissions of the aromatic compounds by using B10. Especially for benzene, the reduction of concentrations occurs on the level of about 19.5%. Although a concentration value below 1 μg ml-1 has been obtained, this reduction is extremely significant since benzene is a carcinogenic compound. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how opting for multiple contributors to the lowC economy and introducing new intelligent solutions allows a smooth transition to renewable fuels. Undoubtedly, biofuels are no longer everybody's darling. This is partly owed to the need to produce bio fuels at the lowest possible price and absent sustainability regulations or their enforcement like the European parliament initiated by banning bio fuels with not sufficient evidence of saving CO2. But on the other hand, the end of cheap oil is clearly visible and it is clear that second generation lowC fuels may by no means be able to replace all of the worlds growing fuel consumption in a few years. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a tri-fold approach which has originated of two EU-projects (SUGRE and RECODRIVE) based on reduction of the propulsion demand, intelligent powertrain configuration and the use of residues and waste as feedstock. The RECODRIVE approach tested in the European project with the same name introduces a quality management in fleet management which comprises procurement, driving and maintenance. This approach comprising also logistics should be able to reduce the propulsion demand at least by 10 per cent targeting 30 per cent and more. Findings - Hybrid power trains are regenerating the braking energy and are reducing the propulsion demand by 15-25 per cent in stop'n go traffic in cities. Parallel or power split hybrids may operate with phlegmatized and thus more efficient combustion engines, but serial hybrid electric power trains drive this characteristics, the extreme which is helpful introducing alternative fuels. They decouple the production of energy from the throttle command and allow for a more steady operation of the internal combustion engine. Practical implications - By employing a serial hybrid power train simpler low-RPM engines may be used which are modified to run on plant oils and other alternative fuels which are difficult to use in modern highly performing diesel engines. By reducing the propulsion demand, a higher share of alternative fuels based on natural feedstock may be achieved. This feedstock may be also amended by better utilising waste. The paper describes two examples. In Graz, used frying oil is collected to feed a transesterification plant and in Linköping waste from the meat industry is collected to produce biogas. Originality/value - The approach enables the transport sector to increase the independence on oil at short-term without the risk of putting a lot of venture capital in the wrong fuel or engine technology. The serial hybrid electric concept remains the basis for future solutions working on different end energy like hydrogen© Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the dynamic performance of an agricultural tractor utilizing distilled biodiesel (50% ethylic + 50% methylic) as a function of the proportion of biodiesel and diesel of petroleum (0 and 100%, 5 and 95%, 15 and 85%, 25 and 75%, 50 and 50%, 75 and 25% and 100 and 0%), respectively. This research was done in the area of the Department of Rural Engineering of the Paulista State University (UNESP), Jaboticabal Campus, SP, located in the latitude 21° 14′ 28″ S and longitude 48° 17′12″ W. A tractor 4 x 2 FWA was used, with a 73.6 kW (100 HP) motor and a ballast tractor. The biodiesel used was produced from spent oil from food frying. The experimental design was entirely randomized, with 7 treatments and 5 repetitions, totaling 35 observations. The results showed that the biodiesel and diesel blend significantly influenced the hourly volumetric consumption, hourly mass consumption, fuel consumption per worked area and specific fuel consumption variables. When the tractor operated with 100% of biodiesel (B100) the specific fuel consumption increased 18% on average in relation to diesel (B0).

AB  - Life cycle energy, environment and economic assessment for conventional diesel (CD) and soybean-based biodiesel (SB) in China was carried out in this paper. The results of the assessment have shown that compared with CD, SB has similar source-to-tank (StT) total energy consumption, 76% lower StT fossil energy consumption, 79% higher source-to-wheel (StW) nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions, 31%, 44%, 36%, 29%, and 67% lower StW hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM), sulfur oxides (SOX), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, respectively. SB is thus considered to be much more renewable and cleaner than CD. However, the retail price of SB at gas stations would be about 86% higher than that of CD without government subsidy according to the cost assessment and China had to import large amount of soybean to meet the demand in recent years. Therefore, although SB is one of the most promising clean and alternative fuels, currently it is not a good choice for China. It is strategically important for China to diversify the feedstock for biodiesel and to consider other kinds of alternative fuels to substitute CD. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is biodegradable, less CO2 and NOx emissions. Continuous use of petroleum sourced fuels is now widely recognized as unsustainable because of depleting supplies and the contribution of these fuels to the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the environment. Renewable, carbon neutral, transport fuels are necessary for environmental and economic sustainability. Algae have emerged as one of the most promising sources for biodiesel production. It can be inferred that algae grown in CO 2-enriched air can be converted to oily substances. Such an approach can contribute to solve major problems of air pollution resulting from CO 2 evolution and future crisis due to a shortage of energy sources. This study was undertaken to know the proper transesterification, amount of biodiesel production (ester) and physical properties of biodiesel. In this study we used common species Oedogonium and Spirogyra to compare the amount of biodiesel production. Algal oil and biodiesel (ester) production was higher in Oedogonium than Spirogyra sp. However, biomass (after oil extraction) was higher in Spirogyra than Oedogonium sp. Sediments (glycerine, water and pigments) was higher in Spirogyra than Oedogonium sp. There was no difference of pH between Spirogyra and Oedogonium sp. These results indicate that biodiesel can be produced from both species and Oedogonium is better source than Spirogyra sp. © 2008 Science Publications.

AB  - Oxygenated fuels increase fuel consumption due to their low enthalpy of combustion; however, their high antiknock index renders them suitable for use in engines with a high compression rate, increasing their thermal yield. This study evaluated the performance of biorenewable oxygenated fuels (ethanol and isoamyl alcohol) and partially renewable fuels (ETBE: ethyl tert-butyl ether, TAEE: tert-amyl ethyl ether and di-TAE: di-tert-amyl ether) with high degree of purity and in mixtures with automotive gasoline, based on tests with Otto cycle engines. Among the oxygenated fuels evaluated here, di-TAE was found to present the best characteristics of performance, both individually and in mixtures with gasoline. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The relative amount of 14C in a sample of atmospheric particulate matter (PM), defined as percent modern carbon (pMC), allows the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to infer the fraction of PM derived from anthropogenic pollution sources. With increased use of biofuels that contain 14C, the main assumption of the two-source model, that 14C is solely derived from biogenic emissions, may become invalid. The goal of this study was to determine the 14C content of PM emitted from an off-highway diesel engine running on commercial grade biodiesel. Tests were conducted with an off-highway diesel engine running at 80% load fueled by various blends of soy-based biodiesel. A dilution tunnel was used to collect PM10 emissions on quartz filters that were analyzed for their 14C content using accelerator mass spectrometry. A mobility particle sizer and 5-gas analyzer provided supporting information on the particle size distribution and gas-phase emissions. The pMC of PM10 aerosol increased linearly with the percentage of biodiesel present in the fuel. Therefore, PM emissions resulting from increased combustion of biodiesel fuels will likely affect contemporary 14C apportionment efforts that attempt to split biogenic vs. anthropogenic emissions based on aerosol-14C content. Increasing the biodiesel fuel content also reduced emissions of total hydrocarbons (THC), PM10 mass, and particulate elemental carbon. Biodiesel had variable results on oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - While transesterification is well established, there remain considerable inefficiencies in existing transesterification processes. In this study an alternative energy stimulant, "microwave irradiation" was used for the production of the alternative energy source, biodiesel. The optimum parametric conditions obtained from the conventional technique were applied using microwave irradiation in order to compare both systems. The results showed that application of radio frequency microwave energy offers a fast, easy route to this valuable biofuel with advantages of enhancing the reaction rate and improving the separation process. The methodology allows for the use of high free fatty acid content feedstock, including used cooking oil; hence it helps to reduce the cost of production which constitutes a major hurdle towards widespread commercialization of biodiesel. The study also showed that the optimum reaction time for microwave-enhanced biodiesel production should be highly respected. Exceeding the optimum reaction time will lead to deterioration of both biodiesel yield and purity. This paper also reported the performance and exhaust emissions from a diesel engine when fuelled with a petroleum diesel fuel and two different biodiesel fuels; one obtained by the conventional technique and the other by microwave irradiation. It was concluded that microwave-enhanced biodiesel is not, at least, inferior to that produced by the conventional technique. © IRSEN, CEERS, IAU.

AB  - Trans esterification of three vegetable oils, sunflower oil, linseed oil and mixed oils as; sunflower-soyabean and olein were carried out using methanol, and potasium hydroxide as catalyst. The methyl esters of the corresponding oils were separated from the crude glycerol and characterized by physical-chemical methods to evaluate their thermal properties. This methods are determination of densities, cloud points, pour points, flash points, kinematic viscosities, hydrogen/carbon ratios, sulfur contents, ash contents and triglycerides. The physico-chemical characteristic of biodiesel treated with ozone showed improvement of pour point and flash point indicating higher degree of safety for fuel. Methyl esters mixed with their corresponding ozonated oil were subjected to comparison and evaluation for their thermal properties by the thermo gravimetric analysis differential thermal analysis from which the calculated heat of enthalpy and comparison with the heat of conventional diesel. The results showed that the oxygen content of biodiesel samples treated with ozone increased weight % and resulted in more extensive chemical reaction, promoted combustion characteristics and less carbon residue was produced. Gas chromatography appeared more suitable to address the problem of determining/verifying biodiesel methyl ester and showed that methyl ester content was impurity free. Ultra violet-detection was used for rapid quantization of triglycerols. From the analyses performed biodiesel treated with ozone modified the thermal and oxidative stability shown by the high combustion efficiency indicated by the high heat of enthalpy and reducing the emission of particulate matter. © IRSEN, CEERS, IAU.

AB  - The number of various transport facilities used in Europe is rapidly growing. They release a big amount of pollutants into the atmosphere. Therefore, environment protection from these pollutants ejected by internal combustion engines is a key problem facing us today and which will be acute in the future. Biofuel is the only effective and widely used alternative fuel which can reduce pollution of the environment. The main aim of the present paper is to perform a comparative analysis of burnt gases of engines using rapeseed oil methyl ester and petroleum diesel oil and to determine ecological effectiveness of biofuel used in diesel locomotive engines in railway transport.

AB  - Enzyme has been an attractive alternative to metal catalyst in biofuel cells. Enzymatic fuel cell (EFC) has the possibility of lower electric properties as well as the benefits of renewability and low temperature operation. Efficiency of the enzymatic fuel cell was related to cell conditions such as the component concentrations (substrate, enzyme cofactors, and electron transfer mediator), pH, and reaction temperature. In this study, a basic enzymatic fuel cell which contained gold electrode, pyrroloquinoline quinine (PQQ) as electron transfer mediator, lactate dehydrogenase, and lactate as substrate at ambient conditions (pH 7.0 and 25 °C of reaction temperature) was designed. Also the correlations between various components in the optimization of the component concentrations such as lactate, NAD+, and CaCl2 in electrolyte was observed by response surface methodology (RSM). The more concentration of Ca2+ ion was added, the less power density was obtained. As the concentration of CaCl2 was considered the optimized conditions (24.43 mM of lactate, 21.35 mM of NAD+ and 1.5 mM of CaCl2) for the highest power density (0.21 W) in the enzymatic fuel cell at given conditions (pH 7.0 and 25 °C of reaction temperature). © 2008 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

AB  - This study provides a comprehensive analysis on the use of palm biodiesel in Malaysia and its exports outlook in the world market. The Malaysian government planned to introduce processed palm oil blends with diesel for domestic use under a mandatory ruling with methyl ester, derived from palm oil, for exports. The domestic market is far from ready as proper policy framework and engine warranty are yet in place. As with the export market, palm oil is potentially competitive to supply to the growing biofuel markets with respect to its price, productivity, and production volume. Nevertheless, international trade in biodiesel is minimal, as yet, and heavily restricted by trade barriers, agriculture policies, subsidies, incentives, etc. Copyright © 2008 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel derived from vegetable oils and animal fats can be used in diesel engines with little or no modifications. In this work, the combustion, performance and emission characteristics of various biodiesel (rice bran oil and pungam oil) and their blends are evaluated in a direct injection diesel engine. Lower ignition delay, higher peak pressure and heat release rate with almost same brake thermal efficiency are obtained for 20% biodiesel blend as compared with diesel fuel. They exhibited lower unburned hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide and soot emissions with a penalty of higher NOx emissions. Copyright © 2008 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The world is faced with a global triple crisis: climate change, Peak Oil (the end of inexpensive energy) and global resource depletion. These are interrelated and interactive problems which makes the subject to be discussed in this paper extremely complex. The certainties are that there will be great changes to contend with in the future in order to produce and deliver food to maintain the present world population, let alone a balanced diet for everyone. At the present time there are roughly 1 billion people that are underfed and/or on unbalanced diets lacking essential micro nutrients that are provided by animal protein. The primary resource depletion is that of fossil fuel energy since the world has been using more fossil energy than is being discovered and it appears that the reserves of oil that can be cheaply mined are now at peak production (half these resources have been combusted). As oil reserves are depleted it is predictable that, just as with any other commodity, prices will rise with increasing scarcity. World population expansion has been promoted by the availability of inexpensive oil, which has supported increased world food production by providing inexpensive inputs including fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides, traction power( lowering the need for labour and reducing the numbers of people in farming) and in places irrigation water. Inexpensive oil allowed food to be produced cheaply but this will change greatly as oil prices rise creating the potential for major disruptions in food availability. Peak oil represents a massive change and will affect other resource availabilities. Agriculture has received inexpensive fertilizers on which high crop yields have been predicated including • nitrogen fertilizers as urea manufactured using natural gas as the major energy source, • phosphates, the world is now dependent on extracting phosphate fertilizers from low grade rock phosphate at high energy costs and phosphorus availability is in decline • Potassium, which is mined in a number of countries The dependency of the industrialized countries on oil to drive agricultural production and the fact that most of these same countries cannot meet their own domestic requirements from local resources has seen a headlong development of alternative fuels including bioethanol produced from sugar cane and maize mainly in Brazil and the USA, respectively; and development of bio diesel from plant oils. The implications for world food stocks and prices are enormous, potentially creating major cereal food /feed grain shortages as land is diverted to fuel production. The expectation are that world cereal grain availability for livestock will be highly restricted and the case is made for the forage-fed ruminant as a major source of animal protein for the future. Herbivores in general are likely to be used more extensively with time, particularly the rabbit with its dual capabilities of high reproduction rates and the capacity to utilize efficiently forage resources produced locally. Biofuels production diverts land from food production to transportation energy and often the land is accessed from clearing of forests with often dramatic effects on biodiversity, erosion and the carbon balance of the land area. Water is the other major resource required for agriculture, which has also been depleted. Fossil ground water (water created as the world cooled many millions of years ago) has been exploited using cheap fuel, but most fossil resources are now too deep to be economically mined for irrigation reducing some of the major areas of crop production (eg: The U.S. Ogallala aquifer and the aquifer under the North China Plain). Many of the world's aquifers that were normally replenished by rainfall have also been drawn down with periodic loss of irrigation potential The advent of Peak Oil with ultimate high cost of fuel will clearly cause return of vast areas of highly productive irrigated crop land back to rain fed cropping, pasture or desert in the future with major loss of food productivity. Soil erosion and fertilizer run off from cropping systems are also major concerns as the present day cereal crops only tap the nutrients in the top few inches of soil and even the prairies of USA which have been only cropped for about 100 years have depleted the top soil reserves with potential to decrease crop yields significantly. Global warming is now accepted as occurring and cannot be ignored in any discussion on future agriculture. Increasing sea levels will undoubtedly remove considerable areas of fertile delta and weather patterns will certainly change, leading to at times more intense drought and or flooding rains. Warming also carries with it the risk of decreased crop production as recent research has demonstrated that rice yields decrease by 10% for every °C rise in night time temperatures. Each of the triple global crises has the potential to lower world crop production by direct or various flow on effects. It is suggested that we must now enter a stage in the world where grain-based animal production will become increasingly expensive as the competition for resources for food, feed and fuel, develops. The animal production industries based on herbivores will need extensive development exploiting a wide range of waste byproducts of agriculture or from land not dedicated to food or biofuels production. Oil depletion, pressure to produce biofuels, soil fertility decline (including salinity and sodicity) the high cost of chemical fertilizers and the loss of arable land to erosion, non agricultural purposes (such as roads and houses), coupled with likely overall decreases in crop production from global warming, all appear to be interacting such that it will be difficult for many nations to feed themselves in the future. The developing countries seen by some as backward in agriculture may be the most capable of supporting themselves through the maintenance of small-scale farmer practices that integrate food and fuel production.

AB  - Biodiesel, a fuel derived from animal or vegetable oil and fats, is presented in this paper. More specifically, its physico-chemical properties as well as the raw materials and existing standards are described. The advantages, limitations, and future of biodiesel are discussed. Biodiesel offers significant environmental advantages over petrodiesel: its combustion produces fewer atmospheric emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases; in addition, it biodegrades easily and does not present a major risk during storage. On the other hand, the substitution of biodiesel for petrodiesel usually causes an increase in fuel consumption by engines. In addition, according to various estimates, the price of biodiesel is higher than that of petrodiesel. Nevertheless, biodiesel is easy to produce and, with the anticipated decline in stocks of fossil fuels, it constitutes an interesting substitute that should become increasingly used in the next decade. © 2008 CNRC Canada.

AB  - Biodiesel is a biofuel obtained, from vegetable or animal oils and fats. These are mainly composed of triglycerides but can contain significant amounts of water and free fatty acids, depending on their origin. Biodiesel is generally produced by transesterification, with or without catalyst, by enzymatic interesterification, by microemulsification, or by pyrolysis. Transesterification. (with acid, basic, or enzymatic homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts) is the most frequently used reaction. The operating parameters, including the types and concentrations of alcohol and catalyst, the reaction temperature and duration as well as the agitation intensity, must be optimized for successful application. In general, biodiesel is characterized by a higher viscosity and a lower heating value than those of petrodiesel. To improve these physical properties, petrodiesel or additives can be added to biodiesel. © 2008 CNRC Canada.

AB  - Almost 100% of energy supply in the transport sector in Japan depends on petroleum. Improvement of its demand and supply structure is an important issue desired to be tackled as soon as possible. In the 'New National Energy Strategy'a goal "The dependence on petroleum in the transport sector should be decreased to less than about 80% by 2030" has been set. In the Energy Technology Strategy Map 2007, 56 technologies were picked up, which would contribute the achievement of the goal of fuel diversification in the transport sector. The fuels or energies which are expected to make a large contribution include biomass derived fuels, synthetic fuels such as GTL, hydrogen, and electricity. Roadmaps for individual technologies related to the fuels and energies developed in the Energy Technology Strategy Map 2007 are introduced. A report 'Initiatives of the next generation vehicles and fuels' published in May 2007 is also mentioned in this paper. The report focuses on 5 fields of technology; advanced batteries, hydrogen and fuel cells, clean diesel engines, bio-fuels, and information technologies; and describes how to combine and advance them.

AB  - US producer Newpage and Swedish engineering company Chemrec have signed an agreement with the purpose of pursuing the prospect of developing a black liquor gasification plant (BLG). This plant will be hosed at the NewPage pulp and paper mill in Escanaba, MI, is intended by parties on both sides on the up and running by 2010. This plant could put Michigan at top of the renewable next-generation fuels, helping to end the dependence on foreign oil while bringing jobs and investments to the community. The proposed plant will employ Chemrec's BLG technology, which converts waste from the pulping process into synthesis gas. The synthesis gas can be used to generate power and electricity, or processed into a variety of biofuels such as dimethyl ether and methanol, or alternatively Fischer-Tropsch Diesel (FTD), synthetic natural gas (SNG) or hydrogen. It is estimated that the process of the mill could yield up to 13 million gallons of liquid biofuel per year from the black liquor waste stream.

AB  - Bio-petroleum with unusual H/C molar ratio of 1.90 and higher heating value of 44.22 MJ/kg was obtained from soybean stalk by deoxy-liquefaction (deoxygenation in the process of liquefaction). This bio-petroleum had similar composition to fossil petroleum which contains long-chain alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons. The oil with H/C molar ratio of 2.00 and the higher heating value of 46.95 MJ/kg was obtained after bathing with 1% NaOH solution by refluxing. And then this bathed bio-petroleum was directly distilled and the fractions were boiled under <120 °C, 120-180 °C, 180-240 °C, 240-350 °C, respectively, of which the distillate of 240-350 °C was almost the same with diesel oil in composition and could be used as a substitute transport fuel after decolorization using activated clay. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bio-oil was produced at 450 °C by fast pyrolysis in a continuous auger reactor. Four feed stocks were used: pine wood, pine bark, oak wood, and oak bark. After extensive characterization of the whole bio-oils and their pyrolytic lignin-rich ethyl acetate fractions by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), calorific values, viscosity dependences on shear rates and temperatures, elemental analyses, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, water analyses, and ash content, these bio-oils were shown to be comparable to bio-oils produced by fast pyrolysis in fluidized bed and vacuum pyrolysis processes. This finding suggests that portable auger reactors might be used to produce bio-oil at locations in forests to generate bio-oil on-site for transport of the less bulky bio-oil (versus raw biomass) to biorefineries or power generation units. The pyrolysis reported herein had lower heat transfer rates than those achieved in fluidized bed reactors, suggesting significant further improvements are possible. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Interest in use of biodiesel fuels derived from vegetable oils or animal fats as alternative fuels for petroleum-based diesels has increased due to biodiesels having similar properties of those of diesels, and characteristics of renewability, biodegradability and potential beneficial effects on exhaust emissions. Generally, exhaust emissions of regulated pollutants are widely studied and the results favor biodiesels on CO, HC and particulate emissions; however, limited and inconsistent data are showed for unregulated pollutants, such as carbonyl compounds, which are also important indicators for evaluating available vehicle fuels. For better understanding biodiesel, this study examines the effects of the biodiesel blend fuel on aldehyde chemical emissions from diesel engine exhausts in comparison with those from the diesel fuel. Test engines (Mitsubishi 4M40-2AT1) with four cylinders, a total displacement of 2.84 L, maximum horsepower of 80.9 kW at 3700 rpm, and maximum torque of 217.6 N m at 2000 rpm, were mounted and operated on a Schenck DyNAS 335 dynamometer. Exhaust emission tests were performed several times for each fuel under the US transient cycle protocol from mileages of 0-80,000 km with an interval of 20,000 km, and two additional measurements were carried out at 40,000 and 80,000 km after maintenance, respectively. Aldehyde samples were collected from diluted exhaust by using a constant volume sampling system. Samples were extracted and analyzed by the HPLC/UV system. Dominant aldehydes of both fuels' exhausts are formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. These compounds together account for over 75% of total aldehyde emissions. Total aldehyde emissions for B20 (20% waste cooking oil biodiesel and 80% diesel) and diesel fuels are in the ranges of 15.4-26.9 mg bhp-h-1 and 21.3-28.6 mg bhp-h-1, respectively. The effects of increasing mileages and maintenance practice on aldehyde emissions are insignificant for both fuels. B20 generates slightly less emission than diesel does. Major difference in both fuels is formaldehyde emission which drops by 23% on the average. Lower aldehyde emissions found in B20 correspond to lower ozone formation potentials. As a result, use of biodiesel in diesel engines has the beneficial effect in terms of aldehyde emissions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Small, handheld two-stroke engines used for lawn and garden work (e.g., string trimmers, leaf blowers, etc.) can emit a variety of potentially toxic carbonaceous air pollutants. Yet, the emissions effluents from these machines go largely uncharacterized, constraining the proper development of human exposure estimates, emissions inventories, and climate and air quality models. This study samples and evaluates chemical pollutant emissions from the dynamometer testing of six small, handheld spark-ignition engines-model years 1998-2002. Four oil-gas blends were tested in each engine in duplicate. Emissions of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and gas-phase hydrocarbons were predominant, and the PM emitted was organic matter primarily. An ANOVA model determined that engine type and control tier contributed significantly to emissions variations across all identified compound classes; whereas fuel blend was an insignificant variable accounting for &lt;5% of the observed variation in emissions. Though emissions rates from small engines were generally intermediate in magnitude compared with other gasoline-powered engines, numerous compounds traditionally viewed as motor vehicle markers are also present in small engine emissions in similar relative proportions. Given that small, handheld two-stroke engines used for lawn and garden work account for 5-10% of total US emissions of CO, CO2, NOx, HC, and PM2.5, source apportionment models and human exposure studies need to consider the effect of these small engines on ambient concentrations in air polluted environments. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Biodiesel is increasingly perceived as an important component of solutions to the important current issues of fossil fuel shortages and environmental pollution. Biocatalysis of soybean oils using soluble lipase offers an alternative approach to lipase-catalyzed biodiesel production using immobilized enzyme or whole-cell catalysis. The central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology (RSM) was used here to evaluate the effects of enzyme concentration, temperature, molar ratio of methanol to oil and stirring rate on the yield of fatty methyl ester. Results: Lipase NS81006 from a genetically modified Aspergillus oryzae was utilized as the catalyst for the transesterification of soybean oil for biodiesel production. The experimental data showed that enzyme concentration, molar ratio of methanol to oil and stirring rate had the most significant impact on the yield of fatty methyl ester; a quadratic polynomial equation was obtained for methyl ester yield by multiple regression analysis. The predicted biodiesel yield was 0.928 (w/w) under the optimal conditions and the subsequent verification experiments with biodiesel yield of 0.936 ± 0.014 (w/w) confirmed the validity of the predicted model. Conclusion: RSM and CCD were suitable techniques to optimize the transesterification of soybean oil for biodiesel production by soluble lipase NS81006. The related lipase NS81006 reuse stability, chemical or genetic modification, and transesterification mechanism should be taken into consideration. © 2007 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Biodiesels are promoted as alternative fuels and their applications in diesel engines have been investigated by many researchers. However, the particle size distribution emitted from heavy-duty diesel engines fueled with palm-biodiesel blended with premium diesel fuel and paraffinic fuel blended with palm-biodiesel has seldom been addressed. Thus, five test fuels were used in this work to study the particle size distribution: D100 (premium diesel fuel), B100 (100% palm-biodiesel), B20 (20 vol% palm-biodiesel+80 vol% D100), BP9505 (95 vol% paraffinic fuel+5 vol% palm-biodiesel) and BP8020 (80 vol% paraffinic fuel+20 vol% palm-biodiesel). A Micro-Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactor (MOUDI) equipped with aluminum filters was used to collect size-resolved samples. Experimental results indicated that palm-biodiesel blends and paraffinic fuel blends could improve combustion efficiency in diesel engines, but pure palm-biodiesel could cause incomplete combustion. Adding palm-biodiesel to diesel fuel would slightly increase particles with diameter &lt;0.31 μm but paraffinic fuel blends could decrease particles with diameter &lt;1 μm. The mass median diameter of overall particles (MMDo) and σg,o are 0.439 μm and 3.88 for D100; 0.380 μm and 3.24 for B20; 0.465 μm and 4.22 for B100; 1.40 μm and 4.92 for BP9505; 1.46 μm and 2.25 for BP8020. There are more particles with low aerodynamic diameters (diameter &lt;0.31 μm) in the exhaust of D100, B20 and B100 fuels. On the other hand, a greater fraction of particulate matter of BP9505 and BP8020 existed in coarse particles (diameter: 2.5-10 μm). Energy efficiency also increases significantly by 12.3-15.1% with the introduction of paraffinic fuel blends into the engine. Nevertheless, paraffinic fuel blends also reduce the emission of particulate matters by 36.0-38.4%. Carbon monoxide was decreased by 36.8-48.5%. Total hydrocarbon is 39.6-41.7% less than diesel fuel combustion. Nitrogen oxides emission is about 5% lower for paraffinic fuel. These results show that paraffinic fuel can be very competitive and replaced diesel fuels in the future. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Detailed carbonyls emissions from ethanol-blended gasoline (containing 10% v/v, ethanol, E-10) and biodiesel-ethanol-diesel (BE-diesel) were carefully investigated on an EQ491i gasoline engine equipped with a three-way-catalyst (TWC) and a Commins-4B diesel engine. In engine-out emissions for the gasoline engine, total carbonyls from E-10 varied in the range of 66.7-99.4 mg kW-1 h-1, which was 3.1-8.2% less than those from fossil gasoline (E-0). In tailpipe emissions, total carbonyls from E-10 varied in the range of 9.2-20.7 mg kW-1 h-1, which were 3.0-61.7% higher than those from E-0. The total carbonyls emissions from BE-diesel were 1-22% higher than those from diesel at different engine operating conditions. Compared with fossil fuels, E-10 can slightly reduce CO emission, and BE-diesel can substantially decrease PM emission, while both alternative fuels increased slightly NOx emission. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper documents the application of exhaust gas fuel reforming of two alternative fuels, biodiesel and bioethanol, in internal combustion engines. The exhaust gas fuel reforming process is a method of on-board production of hydrogen-rich gas by catalytic reaction of fuel and engine exhaust gas. The benefits of exhaust gas fuel reforming have been demonstrated by adding simulated reformed gas to a diesel engine fuelled by a mixture of 50% ultra low sulphur diesel (ULSD) and 50% rapeseed methyl ester (RME) as well as to a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine fuelled by bioethanol. In the case of the biodiesel fuelled engine, a reduction of NOx emissions was achieved without considerable smoke increase. In the case of the bioethanol fuelled HCCI engine, the engine tolerance to exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) was extended and hence the typically high pressure rise rates of HCCI engines, associated with intense combustion noise, were reduced. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many performance and emission tests have been carried out in reciprocating diesel engines that use biodiesel fuel over the past years and very few in gas turbine engines. This work aims at assessing the thermal performance and emissions at full and partial loads of a 30 kW diesel micro-turbine engine fed with diesel, biodiesel and their blends as fuel. A cycle simulation was performed using the Gate Cycle GE Enter software to evaluate the thermal performance of the 30 kW micro-turbine engine. Performance and emission tests were carried out on a 30 kW diesel micro-turbine engine installed in the NEST laboratories of the Federal University of Itajubá, and the performance results were compared with those of the simulation. There was a good agreement between the simulations and the experimental results from the full load down to about 50% of the load for diesel, biodiesel and their blends. The biodiesel and its blends used as fuel in micro-turbines led to no significant changes in the engine performance and behaviour compared to diesel fuel. The exhaust emissions were evaluated for pure biodiesel and its blends and conventional diesel. The results revealed that the use of biodiesel resulted in a slightly higher CO, lower NOx and no SO2 emissions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Algae is offering an alternative source in producing fuel in a cheapest, easiest and most environmentally friendly way than corn and sugar. The single-celled organisms of algae needs only sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to grow and can quadruple in biomass in just one day. The use of algae can help remove carbon from the air and nitrogen from wastewater. The production of algae grown in an average hectare for pharmaceutical industries can generate 47,000 liter of biodiesel annually while an average hectare of corn produces 3,950 liters of ethanol annually and 655 liters of biodiesel annually from soybeans.

AB  - Raw glycerol, byproduct from bio-diesel production process, is used as carbon substrate in several biotechnological applications. Using Clostridium butyricum F2b, 47.1 g L-1 of 1,3-propanediol was produced in batch anaerobic cultures while substrate uptake rate (rS, expressed in g L-1 h-1) increased with increase in glycerol concentration in the medium. In continuous cultures, microbial behaviour was studied in transitory states after addition of 1,3-propanediol in the chemostat vessel. Microbial growth was not affected by the high 1,3-propanediol (which was added in the chemostat vessel) concentration, while butyric and acetic acids concentrations were increased. In a two-stage continuous culture, 43.5 g L-1 of 1,3-propanediol was produced with a total volumetric productivity of 1.33 g L-1 h-1. Yarrowia lipolytica ACA-DC 50109 was grown in nitrogen-limited aerobic cultures on raw glycerol and it exhibited remarkable biomass production even at high glycerol concentration media, while rS decreased with increase in glycerol concentration. Citric acid was produced after nitrogen depletion in the medium, with the highest quantity of 62.5 g L-1, and yield on glycerol consumed was 0.56 g g-1. Fatty acid analysis of total cellular lipids showed that glycerol concentration increase in the growth medium somehow increased the cellular unsaturated fatty acids content of lipids. Mortierella isabellina ATHUM 2935 exhibited satisfactory growth in nitrogen-limited aerobic cultures with raw glycerol used as sole substrate. When high initial glycerol quantities were employed (e.g. 100 g L-1), 4.4 g L-1 of lipid were accumulated corresponding to around 51% (wt/wt) of lipid in dry weight. rS constantly decreased with increase in glycerol concentration in the medium, and in all cases notable glycerol quantities remained unconsumed in the medium. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The paper reports on research in Tanzania about the scope for developing biofuels from an oil-seed bearing plant called Jatropha curcas Linnaeus. The plant is widely seen to have potential to help combat the greenhouse effect, help to stop local soil erosion, create additional income for the rural poor, and provide a major source of energy both locally and internationally. The principal analytic tool is Strategic Niche Management (SNM), an approach rooted in evolutionary innovation theory. We analyse how the scope for an energy transition is influenced by factors at three societal levels: the overarching 'landscape'; the sectoral setting or 'regime'; and the 'niche' level where the innovation develops and diffuses. Valuable niche processes were found in a few areas, especially in cultivation, but we conclude that there are still many obstacles in Tanzania's prevailing energy regime. The development of Jatropha biofuels is still in an early phase. We list policy recommendations and discuss some methodological issues arising from the use of SNM. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Diesel emissions have been measured from an automotive engine using anhydrous bioethanol blended with conventional diesel, with 10% ethanol in volume and no additives. The resulting emissions have been compared with those from pure diesel. A stationary engine test bed, together with the instrumentation for measuring the most stringent regulated emissions (nitric oxides, total hydrocarbons and particulate matter) and the particle size distributions, allowed to study the effect of this blend on the engine performance and emissions under five different steady state operating conditions, selected from the transient cycle for light duty vehicles established in the European Emission Directive 70/220. Both the consideration of the thermochemical properties of the tested fuels and the computations of a chemical equilibrium model were helpful for the results analysis. These results proved that the use of this renewable component provides a significant reduction on particulate emissions, with no substantial increase in other gaseous emissions, which makes it helpful for contributing, on the one hand, to fulfil the European compromise of using more than 5.75% biofuels in 2010, and on the other hand, to stop the increase in particulate emissions caused by transportation as a consequence of the unceasing dieselization. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Poultry fat (biofuel) and its 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% mixtures with #2 pump diesel fuel were stored for 1 year at bench scale (1 L) under controlled laboratory conditions at 4, 38, 54.4 °C and at ambient room temperature. Poultry fat (100%) was studied under these same conditions with and without an antioxidant additive. Poultry fat mixtures (20% and 80%) were also stored at pilot scale (250 gallons) under outdoor, ambient conditions. Physical properties and phenomenon relevant to the use of these mixtures as biofuels for industrial boilers were studied and tracked. These properties include specific gravity, dynamic viscosity, sedimentation accumulation and separation (layering). Corrosive effects of these fuels on various metals were also examined. Viscosity and specific gravity of these biofuels changed very little over the course of the 1 year storage period. Sediment accumulation was present in all treatments, with increasing sedimentation correlating with increasing biofuel concentrations. The addition of antioxidant to 100% biofuel minimized changes in physical properties and sedimentation over the course of this study. Layering occurred in all mixtures of poultry fat and diesel fuel. Results also include the approximate amount of energy required to insure proper mixing of each treatment. After mixing, homogenization was maintained for considerable time periods. This suggests that mixing should only be performed immediately before the fuels are utilized. Corrosive properties of these biofuels were generally as expected; brass and copper were susceptible to attack by these fuels where as 316 stainless steel and carbon steel were not. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Enzymatic syntheses of biodiesel via alcoholysis of different vegetable oils (sunflower, borage, olive and soybean) have been studied. Loss of lipase activity induced by the nucleophile is greater with methanol than with ethanol, and is greater for Lipozyme® TL IM than for Novozym® 435. The optimum volume of ethanol depends on the loading of solid biocatalyst and is higher for preparations of Novozym® 435 than for Lipozyme® TL IM. Maximum rates were obtained with Lipozyme® TL IM, for a molar ratio of alcohol to FA residues of 0.33. By contrast, Novozym® 435 requires at least a 2:1 ratio. Alcoholysis of the vegetable oils is faster with Lipozyme® TL IM than with Novozym® 435. Use of a high loading of Novozym® 435 (50% w/w) and a large molar excess of ethanol are required to obtain an initial rate similar to that obtained with Lipozyme® TL IM at a lower enzyme loading (10% w/w) and an equimolar ratio of ethanol and FA residues. Novozym® 435 produces quantitative conversions in only 7 h at 25 °C, but complete conversions are not obtained with Lipozyme® TL IM. Three stage stepwise addition of ethanol yields 84% conversion to ethyl esters for Lipozyme® TL IM. Hence use of Novozym® 435 is preferred. After nine cycles in a batch reactor Novozym® 435 retained 85% of its initial activity. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pyrolysis of jute stick for bio-oil production has been investigated in a continuous feeding fluidized bed reactor at different temperatures ranging from 300 °C to 600 °C. At 500 °C, the yields of bio-oil, char and non-condensable gas were 66.70 wt%, 22.60 wt% and 10.70 wt%, respectively based on jute stick. The carbon based non-condensable gas was the mixture of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ethane, ethene, propane and propene. The density and viscosity of bio-oil were found to be 1.11 g/mL and 2.34 cP, respectively. The lower heating value (LHV) of bio-oil was found to be 18.25 MJ/kg. Since bio-oil contains some organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, etc., the pH and acid value of the bio-oil were found to be around 4 and 135 mg KOH/g, respectively. The water, lignin, solid and ash contents of bio-oil were determined and found to be around 15 wt%, 4.90 wt%, 0.02 wt% and 0.10 wt%, respectively. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Effects of residence time (3-12 min), stirrer speed (0-800 rpm), and NaOH concentration (0.25-1.0 wt% of oil) on the production performance of the designed 6-stage continuous reactor (2.272 l) for transesterification of palm oil were investigated at molar ratio of methanol to oil of 6:1 and temperature of 60 °C. Higher stirrer speed increased the reaction rate up to an appropriate speed but excessive stirrer speed decreased the reaction rate. Inappropriate stirrer speed runs dramatically decreased the production capacity of the reactor. Higher NaOH concentration significantly increased reaction rate and production capacity of the reactor. The reactor had a residence time distribution equivalent to 5.98 ideal CSTRs in series and a production performance equivalent to a plug flow reactor. At NaOH of 1.0 wt% of oil, the reactor could produce saleable biodiesel within residence time of 6 min in which a production capacity was 17.3 l/h and a power consumption of stirrer was 0.6 kW/m3. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Traditional biomass remains the dominant contributor to the energy supply of a large number of developing countries, where it serves the household energy needs of over a third of humanity in traditional cookstoves or open fires. Efforts to reduce the enormous human health, socioeconomic, and environmental impacts by shifting to cleaner cookstoves and cleaner biomass-derived fuels have had some success, but much more needs to be done, possibly including the expanded use of fossil-derived fuels. Concurrendy, biomass is rapidly expanding as a commercial energy source, especially for transport fuels. Bioenergy can positively contribute to climate goals and rural livelihoods; however, if not implemented carefully, it could exacerbate degradation of land, water bodies, and ecosystems; reduce food security; and increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For largescale commercial biofuels to contribute to sustainable development will require agriculturally sustainable methods and markets that provide enhanced livelihood opportunities and equitable terms of trade. The challenge lies in translating the opportunity into reality. Copyright © 2007 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the current paper, a new simulation model for light-duty vehicle compression ignition diesel/bio-diesel internal combustion engines is presented. Main inputs are engine (maximum power and respective engine speed, maximum torque and respective engine speed, and displacement) and vehicle characteristics (weight, aerodynamics, tires, gearbox ratio, and others). The engine simulator was called the diesel engine map builder (DEMB). The engine fuel consumption calculation is based on correlations for indicated efficiency and frictions losses using also a lower heating value of the fuel and engine specifications. HC, CO, NOx, and PM are calculated by correlations as a function of fuel consumption, load, and engine speed, derived from experimental data of a Mercedes Vaneo 1.7CDi engine, and CO2, H2O, and SO2 are calculated from a mass balance. This model, after integration with a road vehicle simulator (EcoGest), was used to simulate and compare the in-use fuel consumption and engine emissions (HC, CO, NOx, PM, SO2, and CO2) of the use of petrodiesel, biodiesel, and blends in a Citroen C5 1.6HDi under the new European driving cycle (NEDC) driving conditions. The DEMB presented maximum and minimum errors for fuel consumption of 20 and 48, respectively, and an average error of about 1 when compared to the BMW 320D and Mercedes 1.7Cdi engines. The DEMB combined with EcoGest were validated using 1.3 liter (automobile) to 6.8 liter (heavy-duty) engines throughout the NEDC. Results indicate that the maximum errors obtained were 12 (average 7) for fuel consumption, and for emissions errors of one order above were encountered because emissions change due to cold start-up were not considered. Biodiesel results were not validated because of the lack of experimental results, but are qualitatively what was expected. © 2007 by Begell House, Inc.

AB  - A novel concept of fueling of the diesel engine with biofuels: rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) and ethanol was proposed, developed, and investigated. The idea of the concept depends on standard fueling with RME and additional injection of ethanol into the inlet port at the inlet valve, which had yet not opened. This enabled ethanol to evaporate and, in the result, filling the cylinder with gaseous mixture of ethanol and air. After ignition from burning RME droplets, the ethanol-air mixture burns very quickly and promotes combustion of main fuel droplets. This results in a shorter combustion period. Experiments were carried out with the use of a one-cylinder direct-injection diesel engine adapted to ethanol injection at three speeds and two loads: low and high and for three injection timings. At each experimental point (i.e., for constant load and speed), and changing quantity of ethanol (proportion of ethanol to RME was changed from zero to the value at which diesel knock occurred). This procedure enabled to find influence of ethanol energy to total fuel energy ratio (E) on efficiency and emissions (E was a main independent variable parameter). Considerable decrease of CO2 and smoke level was obtained and-for high load-also CO and HC emission. At low loads, NOx emission was reduced. The optimum ratio of ethanol energy to total fuel energy, in terms of brake fuel conversion efficiency and benefit of emission decrease, was found to be about 25%. © 2007 by Begell House, Inc.

AB  - A discussion covers the pitfalls and opportunities with respect to the use of biofuels in the world. A proposal has been made at the UN for a moratorium on bio-fuels for 5 yr. In justification, it was noted that 854 million persons in the world suffer from malnutrition. Using agricultural land for bio-ethanol and bio-diesel production would increase hunger on a large scale. To make 50 L of bio-ethanol requires 232 kg of corn from which a child in Zambia or Mexico could live for 1 yr. A moratorium has also been proposed not to allow the transfer of the use of soil from agriculture to producing bio-fuel for 5 yr. The principle of bio-fuels itself is not opposed such that the Mercedes company, for example, has an advanced program in which it plants the jatropha plant, a bush that grows on arid soil and does not compete with agricultural plants, to develop bio-fuel. This concept has taken hold in India where DaimlerChrysler has installed three pilot sites at Bhavnagar producing 100 L/day of bio-diesel. In these facilities, jatropha oil is transesterified. Jatropha oil contains triglycerides, fatty acids, and glycerol esters that are difficult to treat and tend to form resin. In transesterification the glycerol is converted to methanol, eliminating drawbacks. At the end of the reaction, the biomass is centrifuged after scrubbing to eliminate traces of glycerol and excess methanol. When the bio-fuel is combusted, it emits two times less hydrocarbon and only a third of particles versus diesel fuel emissions. Two states in India will cultivate the jatropha plant on sanitary landfills.

AB  - Substituting transportation fuels with biomass-based fuels is presented as one of the options in climate change mitigation and reducing dependency on fossil oil. In Finland, production techniques of synthetic biodiesel have been developed which are based on the gasification of biomass (i.e. Fischer-Tropsch diesel). As a raw material for F-T-diesel production, peat can be used, which raises a lot of interest due to the large peat reserves in Finland. In this study, the greenhouse impact of peat-based F-T-diesel from the life cycle point of view was assessed. The utilisation chains of peat and peatlands assessed were compared to fossil diesel and F-T-diesel based on logging residues and reed canary grass. The greenhouse impact is assessed by radiative forcing. In this study, the greenhouse impact of different production chains was calculated using different assumptions. The reality of different assumptions was not assessed. Calculational time spans were 100 and 300 years. The impact of peat-based F-T-diesel on the climate depends on the system boundaries, the initial situation and the after-treatment, and it varies when compared to the climate impact of fossil diesel as well as logging residues and reed canary grass-based fuels. Greenhouse gas impact of peat-based F-T-diesel is higher compared to fossil diesel in many of the chains considered. If peat is produced from cultivated peatlands, which are powerful sources of greenhouse gases, the greenhouse impact is lower than if peat is produced from forestry-drained peatland. If peatland is utilised after peat production for afforestation or cultivation of reed canary grass and the produced biomass is then utilised for F-T-diesel, it lowers the total greenhouse impact of the F-T-diesel produced in the certain chain. When peat-based F-T-diesel is compared to fossil fuel, the greenhouse impact is lower when the peat is produced from the cultivated peatland. In addition to peat resource utilised the most remarkable impact on the greenhouse impact of peat-based F-T-diesel is the processing of fuel (losses and electricity) and end-use. The greenhouse gas emissions from the production of the electricity used in the production process of F-T-diesel have a major impact on the total greenhouse impact. Usually in a new function, which consumes electricity, the used electricity should be considered as marginal electricity, but in certain special cases, the used electricity can be low-emission electricity. In this study, the used electricity in the F-T-diesel refining process was assessed to be both current typical marginal electricity and zero-emission electricity, which enables us to emphasize the impact of the emissions due to the electricity used. The greenhouse impact of the peat-based F-T-diesel produced as an integrated production in the forest industry plant is lower than fossil fuels, when zero-emission electricity is used in the process and peatland is used comprehensively in F-T-diesel production, i.e. first peat-F-T-diesel is produced and then biomass produced in the after-treatment (afforestation) is also processed as F-T-diesel. The use of carbon capture and storage in the F-T-diesel production process was also assessed. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has listed CCS as one of the significant means to mitigate climate change in the future. In the production of F-T-diesel, carbon dioxide is separated in the process and major part of the separated CO2 (losses) can be captured, which reduces the greenhouse impact of biomass-based (peat, logging residues and reed canary grass) F-T-diesel. If CCS is included in the F-T-diesel production, it decreases the greenhouse impact of peat and biomass-based F-T-diesel to the same level of impact as that of fossil diesel or below depending on the F-T-diesel production chain.

AB  - Jatropha Methyl Ester (JME) is a potential biodiesel in India. Although high quality EN 14214 grade biodiesel production from Jatropha curcas has been demonstrated by us for the first time, leading to a surge of interest worldwide, large-scale cultivation of the plant with high seed productivity is critical to overall success. The core processes are carried out under ambient conditions and effluent discharge is eliminated through integration with by-product recovery. A target of 2 tonnes (tonne = metric ton = 1000 kg) per hectare of jatropha seeds is realistic with proper agronomic practices in cultivable wastelands. Even so, only a small fraction of total diesel requirement can be met through biodiesel. Besides biodiesel, jatropha cultivation can make a considerable impact in promoting organic farming through use of the oil cake. The shell, having a calorific value equivalent to coal, can be made into briquettes and used in solid fuel fired boilers and other applications as a substitute for fossil fuel. Other by-products too find useful applications. The overall environmental impact of large-scale jatropha cultivation is so far not studied. Although the desertification process would be arrested, greenhouse emissions would be reduced and the atmosphere enriched in oxygen, there is a potential threat to biodiversity. This may be mitigated if such activities are confined to wasteland. Long term impact of toxicity of the plant and toxicity, if any, of products/byproducts also need to be carefully assessed. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Jatropha curcas is a multipurpose, drought-resistant, biofuel tree originating from Central and South America, but now growing pantropic. The tree produces seeds containing 27-40% inedible oil, which is easily convertible into biodiesel. Although even some basic agronomic characteristics of J. curcas are not yet fully understood, the plant enjoys a booming interest, which may hold the risk of unsustainable practice. Our qualitative sustainability assessment, focusing on environmental impacts and strengthened by some socio-economic issues, is quite favorable as long as only wastelands or degraded grounds are taken into J. curcas cultivation. Preliminary lifecycle energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) balances are positive, but the GHG balance is expected to be much dependent on the type of land use which is converted to J. curcas. Removing natural forest will have a severe impact on the global warming potential of the jatropha biodiesel. The cultivation intensity and the distance to markets are expected to have a significant impact on the GHG balance as well. Similar reasoning applies for the impact on soil, water, vegetation structure and biodiversity, although the latter will always depend on local circumstances. Next to biodiesel production and wasteland reclamation, J. curcas also hosts socio-economic development potential. The multipurpose character of the plant and the labor-intensive production chain are thought to be the main drivers for rural development, but are uncertain. In order to achieve best results with respect to both environmental and socio-economic issues, decisions have to be based on local environmental, economical, cultural and social characteristics. © 2007 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Some of the views on the development of Asian biofuel at a crossroad are discussed. Different strategic choice in technologies and market development can lead to different prospects for Asian biofuel development. Malaysia and Indonesia are expanding their palm oil cultivation in the hope of exporting at least 30% of the bio-diesel to the European countries. China is the third largest bioethanol produces in the world after Brazil and US. The reason behind the drastic increase of non-state-owned biofuels processors in China is the potential international demand, particularly for the European Union. Some of the Asian countries such as China, India, and the Philippines are trying to create or enlarge domestic markets by introducing a blending mandate to reduce the growing dependency on imported oil. India jatropha and pongamia strategies are intended to balance the disparity between urban and rural development and also to decrease oil imports.

AB  - The paper analyzes the world's present situation in bioenergy development and makes suggestions for the exploitation of bioenergy in China. The following are mainly expounded: Clear, environment-friendly and renewable bioenergy is being paid more attention all over the world. The developed countries promote the development of bioenergy by making laws and S&T programs and supporting the utilization of bioenergy, and the United States takes the lead, especially in development of fuel-ethanol and bio-diesel fuel. China has achieved success in the fields of biogas, gasification for power generation, etc, but is still confronted with the cost problem in biofuel development. From a long-term point of view, China should make a strategy of energetically developing fuel-ethanol by using non-crop materials.

AB  - Shell Global Solutions is committed to the continuing development of fuel technology. They strongly focused on crucial emerging second-generation biofuels - those produced from non-food feedstocks such as residues from agriculture and forestry. By using non-food feedstocks, such as woodchips and straw, second-generation biofuels do not compete with food crops and they offer an effective way to manage agricultural waste. They also offer greater CO2 reduction benefits. In 2002, Shell invested in the Iogen Corp, a world-leading cellulose ethanol technology company in Canada. Shell's investment enabled developing innovative process technology to create cellulose ethanol from straw by using enzymes. In February 2007, Iogen Biorefinery Partners LLC was chosen by the DOE for potential funding to build a biorefinery in Shelley, ID. Further investment by Shell in Choren Industries, a German company, will also deliver the world's first demonstration scale biomass-to-liquids (BTL) plant later in 2007. The plant will convert feedstock such as woodchips into a gas that is then upgraded into a high-quality synthetic fuel using Shell's middle distillates synthesis technology. The BTL fuel can be blended with diesel fuel for use in diesel engines and offers the potential to cut well-to-wheels CO2 emissions by 90% as compared to conventional fuels.

AB  - Lipase AK was modified with short alkyl chains to form a highly organic soluble enzyme and was used to catalyze the synthesis of biodiesel from soybean oil in organic media. The effects of several key factors including water content, temperature, and solvent were examined for the solubilized enzyme in comparison with several other commercially available lipases. Whereas native lipases showed no activity in the absence of water, the organic soluble lipase demonstrated reaction rates of up to 33 g-product/g-enzyme h. The biocatalyst remains soluble in the biodiesel product, and therefore, there is no need to be removed because it is expected to be burned along with the diesel in combustion engines. This provides a promising one-pot mix-and-use strategy for biodiesel production. © Humana Press Inc. 2007.

AB  - This study presents a consistent, national-level evaluation of potential biodiesel volumes and prices, replicated across 226 countries, territories, and protectorates. Utilizing all commercially exported lipid feedstocks from existing agricultural lands, we compare the upper-limit potential for expanded biodiesel production in terms of absolute biodiesel volumes, profitable potential from biodiesel exports, and potential from expanded vegetable oil production through agricultural yield increases. Country findings are compared across a variety of economic, energy, and environmental metrics. Our results show an upperlimit worldwide volume potential of 51 billion liters from 119 countries; 47 billion of which could be produced profitably at today's import prices. Also significant production gains are possible through increasing agricultural yields: a 12-fold increase over existing potential, primarily hinging on better management of tropical oilseed varietals. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

AB  - After the energy crisis in the 1970s, considerable attention was focused on the development of alternate energy resources. At present, there is a renewed interest in biofuels due to increasing concerns about energy security and environmental pollution. One such biobased fuel that is being widely commercialized is biodiesel. With the increasing production of biodiesel a glut of glycerol has been created, causing market prices to plummet. This situation warrants finding alternative uses for glycerol. This study attempted to identify the possibility of blending glycerol and glycerol based co-products, such as propanediol and propanol with gasoline as oxygenates. The study revealed that there is a possibility to use glycerol and its derivatives with gasoline as an automotive fuel. Octane number and the heating value of different mixtures of gasoline, ethanol, and glycerol and its derivatives are presented. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Concern with environmental issues such as global climate change has stimulated research into the development of more environmentally friendly technologies and energy sources. One critical area of our economy is liquid fuels. Fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass for liquids production is of particular concern, as it is one of the most interesting ways to produce renewable liquid fuel for transport and heat and power production. The aerobic biodegradability of various pyrolysis oils from different origins and of a EN 590 diesel sample was examined using the Modified Sturm (OECD 301B). The results demonstrate that all fast pyrolysis oils assessed are biodegradable with similar shaped curves with 41-50% biodegradation after 28 days, whereas the diesel sample reached only 24% biodegradation. Since pyrolysis oils achieved biodegradability over 20% these are classified as inherently biodegradable. Modelling of biodegradation processes was successfully performed with a first-order chemical reaction. The biodegradability results obtained for biomass pyrolysis oils are compared to those of conventional and alternative fuels. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Atmospheric particulate matter samples were collected at two Maldives climate observatories from 30 August 2004 to 21 January 2005. This time period encompassed both wet and dry seasons, which correspond to low and high aerosol loadings. High aerosol loadings were observed in the northern sampling site in Hanimaadhoo, caused by long-range transport from south and Southeast Asia, whereas the southern sampling site, Gan, was not subject to as much continental inflow. The polluted period began in mid-November and lasted through the remainder of the sampling period. Fine particulate matter during this time was characterized by relatively high concentrations of aerosol mass and elemental carbon. Concentrations of water-soluble potassium, sulfate, levoglucosan, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic diacids, aromatic diacids, and trace metals increased over the clean, transition, and polluted dry season. Organic speciation suggested that significant secondary organic aerosol formation occurred during the polluted dry season, meaning that traditional methods of source identification relying on fixed elemental and organic carbon ratios between source and receptors are not sufficient. Well-studied molecular markers for combustion sources were not adequate in fully attributing elemental carbon over the northern Indian Ocean to specific sources. Further source profiling of south and Southeast Asian biofuels and fossil fuels is recommended. A receptor-based positive matrix factorization model was applied to fine particulate matter trace metal measurements and showed that biofuel burning and fossil fuel combustion were equally important sources of elemental carbon during the polluted dry season.

AB  - The transesterification of triolein with ethanol to make biodiesel fuel was studied under ultrasonic irradiation. The effects of the amount of base catalyst (NaOH or KOH), molar ratio of ethanol to triolein (E/T), and temperature were determined. The ethyl ester concentration increased with increasing reaction time under both ultrasonic irradiation and stirring. The optimum conditions for the formation of ethyl ester under ultrasonic irradiation at 25°C were E/T molar ratio of 6:1, base catalyst concentration of 1 wt, and reaction time of < 20 min. Increases in reaction time and temperature as well as E/T molar ratio contributed to the steady state concentration of ethyl ester. Alcoholysis of triolein by ultra sonic irradiation has the potential for producing cheap biofuels, which could reduce pollution and protect the environment.

AB  - The development of new biofuels that use less valuable agricultural land and drive diesels without the need for engine modification, is discussed. The new biofuels use techniques, such as biomass-to-liquid to convert organic materials, including straw, wood chip and household waste, into an environmentally-friendly synthetic fuel for diesel engines. The technique can produce higher yield per unit area, without impacting on food crop production. It offers the capability of cleaner combustion and reduced emissions compared with conventional transport fuels. Choren, Germany, is working for the development of new biofuels by employing a process called Carbo-V, which uses the Fischer-Tropsch chemical reaction to convert renewable biomass into a synthetic automotive fuel. The company is increasingly using several organic feedstock, including woodchips, fast-growing willow or miscanthus grass, and treated household waste.

AB  - Transesterification of vegetable oils is an important reaction that produces fatty acid alkyl esters, methyl and ethyl esters which are excellent substitutes for diesel fuel. Biodiesel prepared by catalyzed mild transesterification has become of much current interest for alternative fuel production. In the present study the ability of a commercial immobilized Pseudomonas fluorescens MTCC 103 to catalyze the transesterification of Jatropha oil and methanol was investigated. The cell of P. fluorescens was easily immobilized within the sodium alginate during batch process. The important parameters like reaction temperature, pH, oil/methanol molar ratio, amount of beads and reaction time was studied. From the study it was found that maximum yield of biodiesel was obtained at the optimum conditions of at 40°C, pH of 7.0, molar ratio of 1:4, amount of beads of 3 g and reaction time of 48 h. The physical properties of the products were analyzed and the results were compared with conventional petroleum based diesel and it was found that the product can be used as an effective alternate fuel in existing diesel engine without any hardware engine modifications. © 2007 Academic Journals.

AB  - Caterpillar Marine Power Systems has developed C series of marine engine, a fuel-efficient engine that is controlled electronically with a displacement of 18.1 litre, combining high horsepower and proven durability with low emission in a compact design. The Cat C18 burns B30 biodiesel, which is composed of 30 % biodiesel and 70 % regular mineral diesel. The fuel is blended before fueling, as opposed to 100 % biodiesel which is consequently added to regular mineral diesel already in the tank. This pre-blending makes sure that the fuel, which is being supplied into the engines, is B30 and the performance of the engine is the same as with regular mineral diesel. There is no requirement of maintenance intervals in Cat C18s operating on B30 biodiesel and the newly introduced marine engine model will also be compatible with biodiesel blends.

AB  - The catalytic cracking of palm oil over rare earth-Y (REY) catalyst for the production of biofuels in a transport riser reactor at atmospheric pressure, temperature of 673-773 K, catalyst-to-oil ratio (CTO) of 5-10, is reported. The cracking was studied at different residence times and axial reactor lengths. In the present study, palm oil-based fatty acid mixture (FAM) cracking kinetics was found to be similar to the cracking kinetics of palm oil, because both FAM and palm oil consist of different fatty acids, with oleic acid as the major component. A six-lump, nonisothermal kinetic model for the plug-flow reactor was developed to analyze palm oil cracking data. The model includes unconverted palm oil, gasoline fraction, kerosene fraction, diesel fraction, gaseous product, and coke. A nonselective catalyst deactivation function was incorporated in the model. The experimental cracking activity data obtained in the microreactor were used for the evaluation of kinetic parameters. The product yields predicted by the model showed a good agreement with the experimental data obtained in the microreactor as well as in the transport riser reactor. The model also accounts for the temperature drop due to endothermic cracking reaction as a function of residence time. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

The process can convert virtually any vegetable oil or high free fatty acid animal fat directly into biodiesel without the need for costly preprocessing. It also eliminates caustics and requires no washing of the fuel to reduce the environmental impact associated with most diesel facilities. The process can use a fixed bed, continuous flow reactor as well as can be used to create biolubricant base oils rather than biodiesel fuel.

AB  - The objective of this work was to produce renewable liquid fuel (bio-oil) from locally produced bagasse by pyrolysis in a batch feeding and fixed bed reactor. The experiments were performed at different temperatures ranging from 300 to 600 °C. The bio-oil was collected from two condensers of different temperatures and defined as oil-1 and oil-2. The maximum total yield of bio-oil was found to be 66.0 wt% based on bagasse. The carbon based non-condensable gases were CO, CO2, methane, ethane, ethene, propane and propene. The density and viscosity of oil-1 were found to be 1130 kg/m3 and 19.32 centipoise and that were 1050 kg/m3 and 4.25 centipoise for oil-2, respectively. The higher heating values (HHV) of them were 17.25 and 19.91 MJ/kg, respectively. The pH of the bio-oils was found to be around 3.5 and 4.5 for oil-1 and oil-2, respectively. The water, solid and ash contents of oil-1 and oil-2 were determined and found to be around 15, 0.02 and 0.03 wt% and 11, 0.01 and 0.02 wt%, respectively based on bagasse. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An 80,000-km durability test was performed on two engines using diesel and biodiesel (methyl ester of waste cooking oil) as fuel in order to examine emissions resulting from the use of biodiesel. The test biodiesel (B20) was blended with 80% diesel and 20% methyl ester derived from waste cooking oil. Emissions of regulated air pollutants, including CO, HC, NOx, particulate matter (PM) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were measured at 20,000-km intervals. The identical-model engines were installed on a standard dynamometer equipped with a dilution tunnel used to measure the pollutants. To simulate real-world driving conditions, emission measurements were made in accordance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) FTP transient cycle guidelines. At 0 km of the durability test, HC, CO and PM emission levels were lower for the B20 engine than those for diesel. After running for 20,000 km and longer, they were higher. However, the deterioration coefficients for these regulated air pollutants were not statistically higher than 1.0, implying that the emission factors do not increase significantly after 80,000 km of driving. Total (gaseous+particulate phase) PAH emission levels for both B20 and diesel decreased as the driving mileage accumulated. However, for the engine using B20 fuel, particulate PAH emissions increased as engine mileage increased. The average total PAH emission factors were 1097 and 1437 μg bhp h-1 for B20 and diesel, respectively. For B20, the benzo[a]pyrene equivalence emission factors were 0.77, 0.24, 0.20, 7.48, 5.43 and 14.1 μg bhp h-1 for 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-ringed and total PAHs. Results show that B20 use can reduce both PAH emission and its corresponding carcinogenic potency. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ethanol use in Brazil as a motor fuel has been largely promoted since the two oil shocks of the 1970s, either as a gasoline additive (anhydrous ethanol) or as a gasoline substitute (hydrated ethanol). As of today, the uncertainties in the international oil markets, the methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) ban in the US and the growing concerns with global climate change, all justify the quest for a new role to be played by ethanol worldwide. The current prevailing view sees ethanol as a real threat to gasoline and, eventually, to oil itself. This paper examines this issue and concludes that by replacing mainly MTBE and not allowing the use of improved Otto engines, E10 (gasohol blend) does not pose any serious treat to the oil industry, nor do flexfuel vehicles using fairly typical gasoline engines and, in the lack of ethanol supply, running on gasoline. On the other hand, if Otto engines at compression ratios found in diesel engines are promoted, then E30 could become a suitable strategy for spreading the use of ethanol fuel in large volumes and also for saving gasoline. This paper proposes coupling policies of blending ethanol with gasoline, with policies aiming at saving fuel use in light duty vehicles (LDV). © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Historically, during petroleum shortage, vegetable oils and their derivatives have been proposed as alternatives to petroleum diesel fuel. Since 1930, different approaches have been proposed by Brazilian's universities and research institutes, including the use of neat vegetable oils (pure or in blends) or their derivatives, such as hydrocarbons obtained by thermal-catalytic cracking and fatty acids' methyl or ethyl esters (nowadays known as "biodiesel") produced by alcoholysis. Recently, the external dependence on imported diesel fuel and the present petroleum crisis have increased the discussion in Brazil in the sense of starting to use alternatives to diesel fuel, biodiesel being the main alternative for a large petroleum diesel substitution program. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The future of US fuels market will be mostly affected by policy issues. One is the aggressive promotion of biofuels programs as well as increases in Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. There is also the dieselization of US motor fuels as well as the price of carbon emissions. It is found that gasoline will be much affected compared with diesels. The Bush administration also plans to reduce gasoline demand by 20% in 10 years time by means of aggressively promoting the use of biofuels and a 4% increase in the fuel economy of new light vehicles. However, such plans are to happening as wished since by 2015 biofuels will account for 650 gallons which is only 1% of the diesel market if diesel demand grows 15-20% as expected. On the CAFE standards, automakers are receiving credit towards CAFE goals by marketing flexible fuel vehicles. Meanwhile, the talk on carbon tax has been mostly unpopular although render them as possibly increasing pressure on using alternative fuels. This is because it would likely slow economic growth as well as reduce the efficiency of distribution of goods.

AB  - Numerous laboratory studies report carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and particulate matter emission reductions with a slight nitrogen oxides emission increase from engines operating with biodiesel and biodiesel blends as compared to using petroleum diesel. We conducted a field study on a fleet of school buses to evaluate the effects of biodiesel use on gaseous and particulate matter fuel-based emission factors under real-world conditions. The field experiment was carried out in two phases during winter 2004. In January (phase I), emissions from approximately 200 school buses operating on petroleum diesel were measured. Immediately after the end of the first phase measurement period, the buses were switched to a 20% biodiesel blend. Emission factors were measured again in March 2004 (phase II) and compared with the January emission factors. To measure gaseous emission factors we used a commercial gaseous remote sensor. Particulate matter emission factors were determined with a combination of the gaseous remote sensor, a Lidar (light detection and ranging), and transmissometer system developed at the Desert Research Institute of Reno, NV, U.S.A. Particulate matter emissions from school buses significantly increased (up to a factor of 1.8) after the switch from petroleum diesel to a 20% biodiesel blend. The fuel used during this campaign was provided by a local distributor and was independently analyzed at the end of the on-road experiment. The analysis found high concentrations of free glycerin and reduced flash points in the B100 parent fuel. Both measures indicate improper separation and processing of the biodiesel product during production. The biodiesel fuels used in the school buses were not in compliance with the U.S.A. ASTM D6751 biodiesel standard that was finalized in December of 2001. The U.S.A. National Biodiesel Board has formed a voluntary National Biodiesel Accreditation Program for producers and marketers of biodiesel to ensure product quality and compliance with the ASTM standard. The results of our study underline the importance of the program since potential emission benefits from biodiesel may be reduced or even reversed without appropriate fuel quality control on real-world fuels. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The company established the business in 2006, to develop biofuels, using environmental friendly technology. The technology has been jointly developed by UOP and Eni, a refiner located in Milan. Italy. The refiner converts vegetable oil into high-octane diesel fuel. The company's green diesel technology is different from conventional biodiesel technology, which is produced by reacting methanol and vegetable oil. The company's green diesel technology is processed through hydrodeoxygenation, decarboxylation, and hydroisomerization reactions, to produce diesel fuel from vegetable oil and hydrogen at mild conditions.

AB  - 'Soot' or 'black carbon', which comes from incomplete combustion, absorbs light and warms the atmosphere. Although there have been repeated suggestions that reduction of black carbon could be a viable part of decreasing global warming, it has not yet been considered when choosing actions to reduce climatic impact. In this paper, I examine four conceptual barriers to the consideration of aerosols in global agreements. I conclude that some of the major objections to considering aerosols under hemispheric or global agreements are illusory because: (1)a few major sources will be addressed by local regulations, but the remainder may not be addressed by traditional air quality management; (2)climate forcing by carbon particles is not limited to 'hot spots' - about 90% of it occurs at relatively low concentrations; (3)while aerosol science is complex, the most salient characteristics of aerosol behavior can be condensed into tractable metrics including, but not limited to, the global warming potential; (4)despite scientific uncertainties, reducing all aerosols from major sources of black carbon will reduce direct climate warming with a very high probability. This change in climate forcing accounts for at least 25% of the accompanying CO2 forcing with significant probability (25% for modern diesel engines, 90% for superemitting diesels, and 55% for cooking with biofuels). Thus, this fraction of radiative forcing should not be ignored. © IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - A complete protocol is presented for the first time for the micropropagation of Pongamia pinnata, a biofuel tree, using cotyledonary nodes derived from axenic seedlings. Multiple shoots were induced in vitro from nodal segments through forced axillary branching. Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 7.5 μM benzylaminopurine (BAP) induced up to 6.8 shoots per node with an average shoot length of 0.67 cm in 12 d. Incorporation of 2.5 μM gibberellic acid (GA3) in the medium during the first subculture after establishment and initiation of shoot buds significantly improved the shoot elongation. Single use of GA3 during the first subculture eliminated the need for prolonged culturing on BAP medium. Further use of GA3 in the medium was not useful. Shoot culture was established for at least two subcultures without loss of vigor by repeatedly subculturing the original cotyledonary node on shoot multiplication medium followed by shoot elongation medium after each harvest of the newly formed shoots. Thus, from a single cotyledonary node, about 16-18 shoots were obtained in 60 d. Shoots formed in vitro were rooted on full-strength MS medium supplemented with 1.0 μM indole butyric acid (IBA). Plantlets were successfully acclimated, established in soil, and transferred to the nursery. © 2007 The Society for In Vitro Biology.

AB  - Bioethanol (BioE) is a fuel derived from renewable sources of feedstock, typically plants such as wheat, sugar beet, corn, straw, and wood. Bioethanol is an alternative fuel that is produced almost entirely from food crops. Bioethanol represents an important, renewable liquid fuel for motor vehicles. In order to produce BioE from cellulosic biomass, a pretreatment process is used to reduce the sample size, break down the hemicelluloses to sugars, and open up the structure of the cellulose component. The cellulose portion is hydrolyzed by acids or enzymes into glucose sugar that is fermented to BioE. The sugars from the hemicelluloses are also fermented BioE. Producing and using BioE as a transportation fuel can help reduce carbon dioxide buildup in two important ways: by displacing the use of fossil fuels, and by recycling the carbon dioxide that is released when it is combusted as fuel. Using ethanol-blended fuel for automobiles can significantly reduce petroleum use and exhaust greenhouse gas emission. An important advantage of crop-based ethanol is its greenhouse benefits.

AB  - In the first quarter of 2007, the world's LNG demand reach 43.54 million ton (MMton), which represents an increase of 2.9 MMton ? 7.1%. The strongest growth areas will continue to be the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions, Russia, and Africa. By 2010, Asia's LNG demand is expected to reach 126 MMton, up 23 MMton or > 20% from 2006. The US fuel market is gasoline driven and will continue in that direction for the next few years. Presently, the US consumes ≈ 9 million bpd of gasoline or 43% of global gasoline consumption. US refineries refine about 20 million bop of crude oil into fuels and other petrochemical products. However, the administration's program to decrease gasoline demand 20% in 10 yr is unlikely to reach that goal, but pursuit of biofuels and higher Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards could substantially reduce historic gasoline demand growth. Meanwhile, polyethylene (PE) represents the largest segment of the commodity plastics business globally. In 2006, of the 173 million ton of commodity plastic consumption, PE represented almost 40% of the market. PE demand is expected to grow about 5% over the next 5 yr. Capacity additions in the Middle East and Asia will dominate PE production.

AB  - MAN Diesel four strokes have logged over 70,000 operating hours since 2001 on liquid biofuels, including waste, oils, and fats. This success is based on the robustness of engines designed for operation on heavy fuel oil (HFO), especially compared to high-speed diesel engines designed for high-grade distillate fuels, where untreated plant oils can cause severe problems. The company's 18 cylinder, Vee-configuration MAN Diesel type 18V48/60 engine powers a generator set producing 17.7 MWe electrical energy while providing a further 14 MW of thermal energy from its exhaust gases and coolant. Two generator sets based on inline, five-cylinder type 5L27/38 engines run on processed palm oil purchased under annual contracts with merchants. The combined electrical output of the two engines is fed entirely to the local grid, while the usable thermal output of the engines amounts to around 3000 kW.

AB  - Energy from aquatic biomass and microbial fuel cells (MFC) are increasingly attracting R&amp;D and venture capital funds in the midst of increasing oil prices. Officials target for a minimum 10% replacement of existing petrol and diesel consumption by biofuels would require the use of 43% of cropland in the US and 38% in Europe. Trees can contribute more to the reduction of CO 2 emissions than existing biofuels for which large amounts of fossil fuels are required during the cultivation, transportation, and processing of their raw materials. A major application of MFCs would be as a means of energy recovery in wastewater treatment plants so that they could provide electricity for the plant itself and even excess energy external consumption. An important factor with costs will be the amounts of materials that may be required for certain MFC systems, particularly if large surface areas are needed for supporting the biofilm.

AB  - The consequences of running a fleet of trucks or buses on biofuels and bioethanol are discussed. Biodiesel has the ability to cut carbon-dioxide emissions, and saves energy around three percent in a typical B5 blend. Oxygen in biodiesel aids combustion and reduces emissions of unburnt sooty particulates. Compared with conventional, sulphur-free diesel, pure (B100) biodiesel is claimed to cut particulates emissions by 30 to 75 per cent. Biodiesel's lubricity is good, but its boiling point is considerably higher than that of petroleum diesel, so any unburnt fuel getting into engine oil in the cylinders is less likely to burn and more likely to accumulate in the sump, diluting the oil. Biodiesel is a solvent, and its action can be aggressive on some fuel-hose rubber. Biodiesel can strip zinc coatings off galvanized metal and should be kept clear of paintwork. Pure biodiesel typically is 50-100 per cent more viscous than petroleum diesel and has an inferior cold-filter- plugging-point (cFPP).

AB  - In whatever measure liquid biofuels are produced, they avoid the use of politically and economically unstable petroleum. However, there has been much debate regarding their environmental impact and sustainability. Corn ethanol manufacturing uses large quantities of fossil fuels, which, although locally produced, create doubt on whether its continual use will bring any clear economic and environmental benefits. On the other hand, biodiesel, because it enjoys a simpler and thus efficient manufacturing process, shows more clarity as to the environmental benefits it provides, but its sustainability at a significant scale is not clear due to the low productivity of its crops. Brazil's ethanol industry, which is based on sugarcane, has shown that it is possible to be efficient, both environmentally and economically in the implementation of a biofuel infrastructure. Very akin to sugarcane ethanol technology is cellulosic ethanol. A cellulosic ethanol infrastructure can make use of crops that have higher productivities and lower environmental impact. In addition, the conversion process uses very little fossil fuels, which makes it even more sustainable and environmentally benign.

AB  - H2 and ethanol production from glycerol-containing wastes discharged from a biodiesel fuel production plant by Enterobacter aerogenes NBRC 12010 was demonstrated in bioelectrochemical cells. Thionine as an exogenous electron transfer mediator was reduced by E. aerogenes, and was re-oxidized by a working electrode applied at +0.2 V against a Ag/AgCl reference electrode by a potentiostat (electrode system). At the initial glycerol concentration of 110 mM, 92.9 mM glycerol was consumed in the electrode system with 2 mM thionine after 48 h. On the other hand, the concentration of glycerol consumed was only 50.3 mM under the control conditions without thionine and the electrodes (normal fermentation). There are no differences in the yields of H2 and ethanol against glycerol consumed between the control conditions and the conditions with the electrode system. A pH of 6.0 was suitable for the H 2 production in the range between pH 6 and pH 7.5 in the electrode system. At pH values of 7.0 and 7.5, H2 production decreased and formate was remarkably produced in the reaction solution. The rates of both glycerol consumption and the H2 and ethanol production increased as the thionine concentration and the surface area of the working electrode increased. After 60 h, 154 mM of the initial 161 mM glycerol concentration in the wastes was consumed in the electrode system, which is a 2.6-fold increase compared to the control experiment. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) is a non-edible oil-seed plant with adaptability to marginal semi-arid lands and wastelands. The Indian Government is promoting jatropha to reduce dependence on the crude oil and to achieve energy independence by the year 2012, under the National Biodiesel Mission. Selected strains of Bacillus spp., either supplemented with or without chitin, were tested for their ability to promote growth of jatropha seedlings in pot culture studies. The strains supported growth of jatropha seedlings up to 42 days after sowing. Among all strains, Bacillus pumilus (IM-3) supplemented with chitin showed over all plant growth promotion effect resulting in enhanced shoot length (113%), dry shoot mass (360%), dry root mass (467%), dry total plant mass (346%), leaf area (256%), and chlorophyll content (74%) over control. Treating seeds with strain IM-3 without chitin resulted in enhanced dry shoot mass (473%), dry total plant mass (407%), and chlorophyll content (82%). However, Bacillus polymyxa (KRU-22) with chitin supported maximum root length (143%). Either strain IM-3 alone or in combination with other promising strains could be promoted further for enhanced initial seedling growth of jatropha. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Renewable liquid alkanes can be produced by hydrotreating of vegetable oils and vegetable oil-heavy vacuum oil (HVO) mixtures at standard hydrotreating conditions (i.e. 300-450 °C) with conventional hydrotreating catalysts (sulfided NiMo/Al2O3). The reaction pathway involves hydrogenation of the C{double bond, long}C bonds of the vegetable oils followed by alkane production by three different pathways: decarbonylation, decarboxylation and hydrodeoxygenation. The straight chain alkanes can undergo isomerization and cracking to produce lighter and isomerized alkanes. The carbon molar yield of straight chain C15-C18 alkanes was 71% on a carbon basis (the maximum theoretical yield for these products is 95%) for hydrotreating of pure vegetable oil under optimal reaction conditions. The rate of alkane production from pure sunflower oil is greater than the rate of hydrodesulfurization of a HVO with a 1.48 wt% sulfur content (e.g. 100% conversion of sunflower oil at 350 °C compared to 41% conversion of sulfur). The yield of straight chain alkanes increases when sunflower oil is mixed with HVO, illustrating that dilution of HVO can improve the reaction chemistry. For example, with a 5 wt% sunflower oil-95 wt% HVO feed the maximum theoretical straight chain C15-C18 yield from the sunflower oil was higher (87%) than it was with the pure sunflower oil (75%). Mixing the sunflower oil with HVO does not decrease the rate of desulfurization indicating that sunflower oil does not inhibit the hydrotreating of HVO. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The possible use of pre-fleshing wastes from tanneries in the production of biodiesel fuel was examimed in our previous study in 2005. In this study, engine performance and emission values of biodiesel obtained from these wastes have been investigated and compared to petrodiesel fuel. The test results demonstrated that although the wheel force and power of biodiesel fuel is slightly lower than petrodiesel and the acceleration periods are accordingly longer, the emission values of hydrocarbons and particulate matter were found to be considerably lower with biodiesel. Thus, it has been shown that a waste byproduct can be utilized in the production of an environmentally friendly fuel, which can be used in some diesel engines without a need for major adjustment, providing economic and ecological benefits. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The synthesis of biodiesel from poultry fats provides a way to convert the by-product of a renewable resource to a very important value-added biofuel. In this work, the use of heterogeneous base catalysts derived from Mg-Al hydrotalcite was investigated for the conversion of poultry lipids to biodiesel. This solid base showed high activity for triglyceride (TG) transesterification with methanol without signs of catalyst leaching. Catalytic performance was significantly affected by pretreatment and operating conditions. Calcination at optimum temperature was key in obtaining the highest catalyst activities. Rehydration of the calcined catalyst before reaction using wet nitrogen decreased catalytic activity for the transesterification of poultry fat, opposite to what has been reported for condensation reactions. Also, methanol had to be contacted with the catalyst before reaction; otherwise, catalyst activity was seriously impaired by strong adsorption of triglycerides on the active sites. Both temperature (60-120 °C) and methanol-to-lipid molar ratio (6:1-60:1) affected the reaction rate in a positive manner. The use of a co-solvent (hexane, toluene, THF), however, gave rise to a change in TG conversion profile which cannot be explained solely by a dilution effect. The catalyst underwent significant deactivation during the first reaction cycle probably due to deactivation of the strongest base sites. Subsequent reaction cycles showed stable activity. By re-calcination in air, complete catalyst regeneration was achieved. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of biodiesel, a partial replacement for petroleum diesel, has increased in the global market adding the need of investigation on the extent and effects of biodiesel in modern engines outfitted with diesel particulate filters (DPF). The major impact of biodiesel on the behavior of the crankcase lubricant can be rectified by using lubricants, while in case of using higher biodiesel blends, enhanced lubricant can be applied. Some original equipment manufacturers (OEM) have suggested halving oil drain intervals if biodiesel is implemented, to avoid lubricant degradation and thickening due to the oxidization of unburnt biodiesel entering the oil sump. The properties of biofuel, and the way they behave in the engine, vary significantly depending on the source of the fuel, including the oil type and geography. It is also being investigated that how biodiesel esters or biodiesel contaminants may interact with lubricating oil additives in the bulk of the lubricant.

AB  - A modern and innovative demonstration has been carried out along the southern coast of England with use of a Horizon 20M motor yacht, which is outfitted with twin Cat C18 engines that can burn fuel consisting of 30% biodiesel and 70% regular mineral diesel. Horizon Motor Yachts anticipates rising demand in biodiesel and motor yachts, which is capable of burning biodiesel, such as the Horizon 20M with Cat C18 marine engines. Cat C18s that operate on B30 biodiesel need no maintenance intervals and are thereby different from those for engines that run on regular marine diesel, while a set of standard maintenance procedures is needed once per year. It is also expected that Horizon's C18 will perform reliably, fuel efficiently, and be virtually smokeless, with nearly 1400 Cat engines operating successfully in pleasure craft and commercial marine functions in the UK.

AB  - Biofuels are seen as sustainable supplements to petrol and diesel that may reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the security of fuel supplies. The uptake of the two major biofuels in current use, including bioethanol and biodiesel, is aided by their compatibility with existing fuel distribution systems and vehicle fleets. The EU biofuels directive sets a target of a 5.75% market share for transport use by 2010 and it is likely that this will rise to 10% by 2020. Studies regarding the true environmental impacts of biofuel production remain inconclusive, since additional net carbon dioxide emissions occur as a result of farming methods, shipping, and manufacturing processes. Fuel security is also commonly cited by governments as a key consideration in the adoption of biofuels to decrease reliance on crude oil imports from politically unstable global regions.

The actual call on EU refineries will be further affected by the rate of introduction of biofuels and the extent to which products are imported into and exported from Europe. A discussion covers the fleet and fuels model, which describes the average fuel efficiency of gasoline and diesel vehicles for new vehicles and for the total fleet in each of the past 15 yr; the sensitivity of projected fuel demand to vehicle efficiency and mobility demand assumptions; and meeting EU ambitious biofuels.

AB  - Between 2006 and 2010 the Wacker company will triple its polycrystalline silicon production at its Burghausen facility. It now makes 6,500 tonnes/yr. An ongoing expansion will increase this to 10,000 tonnes/yr at the start of 2008. It is also investing 400 million euros to increase this production to 21,500 tonnes/yr by 2010. Polysilicon demand in electronics and photovoltaics is expected to increase by 10%/yr in the coming years. The global silicon production was 32,000 tonnes/yr in 2005 and 40,000 tonnes/yr in 2006 of which 15,000 tonnes/yr was for the photovoltaics market. In the coming years the demand for solar grade silicon is expected to exceed supply and reach 23,600 tonnes in 2010. France is expected to open the first plant of this type at St-Auban in 2009 with 4,000 tonnes/yr initial capacity in a Silpro company project in association with Degussa. The other market leaders are SolarWorld, Hemlock, Solar Grade Silicon, and Renewable Energy Corp. Photograph. Green chemistry. Biofuels.

AB  - Complex research into the change of parameters concerning the fuel economy, thrust, and harmful components of exhaust gases, namely, hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitric oxides (NOx), was carried out to evaluate the efficiency of fuel replacement; that is, mineral diesel fuel, which is normally used by diesel engine fleets of agricultural machinery in Lithuania, was replaced with biofuel (hereafter biodiesel), which is rapeseed oil methyl esters, hereafter RME. Diesel engine F2L511 and a single section of diesel engine A41 were chosen as models and tested within the above-mentioned research parameters. Fuel blends of mineral diesel fuel and RME-biodiesel fuel, and also pure RME, were tested as follows: BIO, in which the content of RME is 10%; B15 and B30, in which the contents of RME are 15% and 30% appropriately; and B100, which is pure RME. A nonlinear change of operational characteristics was determined depending on the loads of the diesel engine. According to its technical ecological parameters, B30-biodiesel fuel was acknowledged as the most convenient and reliable one being tested within a wide range of speed and load regimes. In the same range of speed and load regimes, the influence of technical conditions of the fuel injector on harmful emission parameters of diesel engine exhaust gases, while running on RME, was estimated by means of a failure simulation of the fuel injector, namely, gumming up the fuel injector nozzle. An improvement of all the ecological parameters was estimated by optimization of the diesel engine injection timing while running on RME. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

AB  - There are several reports on the synthesis of fuel additives based on oleochemical esters, and physical data on some of these compounds is lacking. Herein, we report the surface tension of several epoxidized oleochemicals and their comparable fatty esters, at temperatures between 25 and 60 °C. Surface tensions of the olefins measured at 40 °C range from 25.9 mN m-1, for isobutyl oleate, to 28.4 mN m-1 for methyl linoleate. The epoxy versions of the same compounds displayed higher surface tensions of 28.1 and 32.1 mN m-1, respectively. Branched ester compounds also had surface tensions between 27.4 and 30.2 mN m-1. Several trends and observations were elucidated. More epoxidation or unsaturation leads to higher surface tension. Epoxidation has a larger effect on surface tension than unsaturation. Linear alkyl headgroups on fatty esters have similar surface tensions, but branched headgroups gave slightly lower surface tensions. Soy methyl esters, or epoxy soy methyl esters, give surface tensions which are between that of their two main components. Overall, the results show that all of these compounds have surface tensions which make them suitable for use as biofuel additives.

AB  - The renewable nonfossil fuel biomethane is often neglected in debates regarding sustainability. However, studies show that it has a lot of potential. Biomethane is the most effective biofuel in terms of greenhouse gas reduction according to the 2007 Eucar/Concawe/Jrc Well-To-Wheels report. This is due to the fact that biogas produced from liquid manure has the potential for negative greenhouse gas emissions, as the process captures methane that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere, which then act as a methane sequestration technique. However, its implementation is hampered by the fact that there is a lack of distribution infrastructure and lack of vehicles that can run them as fuel. Despite being cheaper than diesel and petrol by 40 and 50% respectively, the savings are offset by higher capital costs such as £20,000 for a dual-fuel heavy duty goods vehicle conversion and £5,000 for a light goods vehicle, not to mention higher maintenance costs. As such, Cenex was formed by the UK government as a public-private enterprise to make sure the competitiveness of the UK automotive supply chain in low-carbon technology, including biomethane.

AB  - Advanced vessel propulsion technologies including hybrid, solar, and wind power can help to reduce pollution and greenhouse gases. Australian-based company Solar Sailor's Hybrid Marine Power (HMP) and Solar Wing technology are designed to take advantage of both applications ranging from yachts to large tankers. HMP combines the efficiency of electric drive with the power of conventional propulsion systems including those using alternative fuels such as biofuels or gaseous fuels. The HMP also adds renewable solar and wind energy captured by computer-controlled Solar Wings. Solar panels made by British Petroleum charge the vessel's batteries, while wind power and biodiesel-compatible engines can be used if needed. Solar Sail is proposing several applications for its technology. Iceland is poised to be the first nation with a hydrogen economy and has already developed hydroelectric and geothermal energy resources that are ideal for producing the large quantities of hydrogen.

AB  - The production plants around the world are aimed to produce second-generation cost-effective biofuels with an economically sustainable biomass conversion. The US government has aimed to make cellulosic ethanol cost-competitive with petrol by 2012, and with the help of bioethanol and increased fuel efficiency to reduce the country's petrol consumption by 20%. The developed nations are aimed to develop large biorefineries that are able to make biomethanol, biodiesel, and a range of high-value products. Integrated thermochemical biorefineries based on syngas from gasification are aimed to produce petrol and diesel biofuels. The biotechnology-centered systems for making bioethanol utilize bacteria-based fermentation methods to eliminate the need for enzyme hydrolysis. The second-generation pyrolysis systems producing condensed bio-oil at the farm or district level are helpful in providing clean syngas for biomass-to-liquid (BLT) production.

AB  - There is a widespread counterfeiting of petroleum products, particularly in the underdeveloped and developing countries of Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia, resulting in the loss of much needed revenues to the governments of these countries, and a loss of confidence in the quality of these products. One method of avoiding taxes is by diluting taxed diesel fuel or motor vehicle gasoline with cheaper fuels or non-taxed solvents. In the case of diesel fuels, gas oils that are sometimes illegally added to conventional diesel fuels are a different fraction from road diesel. They usually contain higher levels of sulfur. Fuel markers are chemical compounds that may be added to a wide variety of petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, kerosene, gas oil, etc. The compounds must be miscible with the petroleum product impart no color and be resistant to simple removal. They are used to guarantee product integrity, protect against counterfeiting, adulteration, and tax fraud. South Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines all use markers to protect the use of lower tax fuels. The Philippines is considering the use of a marker system for biofuels, which will not only provide a quick test for adulteration, but also for tagging purposes.

AB  - This research is one of the largest studies of biodiesel in both on-road and off-road uses. The testing was conducted for the military and encompassed a wide range of application types including two medium-duty trucks, two Humvees, a heavy heavy-duty diesel truck, a bus, two stationary backup generators (BUGs), a forklift, and an airport tow vehicle. The full range of fuels tested included a California ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel, different blend ratios of two different yellow-grease biodiesels and one soy-based biodiesel, JP-8, and yellow-grease biodiesel blends with two different NOx reduction additives. The B20-YGA, B20-YGB, and B20-Soy did not show trends relative to ULSD that were consistent over all applications tested. Higher biodiesel blends were tested on only one vehicle, but showed a tendency for higher total hydrocarbons (THC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions and lower particulate matter (PM) emissions. The JP-8 showed increases in THC and CO relative to the ULSD. © 2007.

AB  - Polar organic species, including n-alkanols, sterols, anhydrosugars, n-alkanoic acids, n-alkenoic acids and dicarboxylic acids were quantified to typify the composition of fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM10-2.5) aerosols collected simultaneously at roadside and background sites in Oporto (Portugal) and Copenhagen (Denmark) during separate month-long intensive summer and winter campaigns. As a general trend, both cities exhibit roadside average concentrations higher than their correspondent urban background levels. The polar organics are more abundant in the fine fraction, exhibiting a seasonal pattern with high winter concentrations and low summer loads. Aerosols from both cities showed typical distributions of n-alkanols and n-alkanoic acids in the ranges C12-C28 and C8-C28, respectively. The &lt;C20 homologues, usually attributed to kitchen emissions, vehicular exhausts and microbial origins, dominated the fatty acid fraction. Linear alcohols were mainly represented by higher molecular weight homologues from vegetation waxes. Molecular tracer species for wood smoke (e.g. levoglucosan, mannosan and resinic acids) were found to contribute significantly to the urban aerosol, especially in winter. Ratios between these tracers indicated different biofuel contributions to the atmospheric particles of the two cities. Secondary constituents from both biogenic (e.g. pinonic acid) and anthropogenic precursors (e.g. phthalic and benzoic acids) were detected in both cities and seasons. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, several bio-source-fuels like fresh and waste vegetable oil and waste animal fat were tested at different injector pressures (120, 140, 190, 210 bar) in a direct-injection, naturally aspirated, single-cylinder diesel engine with a design injection pressure of 190 bar. Using 2k factorial analysis, the effect of injection pressure (Pi) and fuel type on three engine parameters, namely, combustion efficiency (ηc), mass fuel consumption (mf), and engine speed (N) was examined. It was found that Pi and fuel type significantly affected both ηc and mf while they had a slight effect on engine speed. Moreover, with diesel and biodiesels, the ηc increased to a maximum at 190 bar but declined at the higher Pi value. In contrast, higher Pi had a favorable effect on ηc over the whole Pi range with all the other more viscous fuels tested. In addition, the mass fuel consumption consistently decreased with an increase in Pi for all the fuels including the baseline diesel fuel, with which the engine consistently attained higher ηc and higher rpm compared to all the other fuels tested. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The scarce and rapidly depleting conventional petroleum resources have promoted research for alternative fuels for internal combustion engines. Among various possible options, fuels derived from triglycerides (vegetable oils/animal fats) present promising "greener" substitutes for fossil fuels. Vegetable oils, due to their agricultural origin, are able to reduce net CO2 emissions to the atmosphere along with import substitution of petroleum products. However, several operational and durability problems of using straight vegetable oils in diesel engines reported in the literature, which are because of their higher viscosity and low volatility compared to mineral diesel fuel. In the present research, experiments were designed to study the effect of reducing Jatropha oil's viscosity by increasing the fuel temperature (using waste heat of the exhaust gases) and thereby eliminating its effect on combustion and emission characteristics of the engine. Experiments were also conducted using various blends of Jatropha oil with mineral diesel to study the effect of reduced blend viscosity on emissions and performance of diesel engine. A single cylinder, four stroke, constant speed, water cooled, direct injection diesel engine typically used in agricultural sector was used for the experiments. The acquired data were analyzed for various parameters such as thermal efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), smoke opacity, CO2, CO and HC emissions. While operating the engine on Jatropha oil (preheated and blends), performance and emission parameters were found to be very close to mineral diesel for lower blend concentrations. However, for higher blend concentrations, performance and emissions were observed to be marginally inferior. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The oil industry is currently researching on nonfood biofeedstocks as substitute for transportation fuel. Biofuels currently rely on corn or soybeans in the US, sugar cane in Brazil and rapeseed of flaxseed in Europe. Algae can also be grown on a commercial scale which could lead to being a feedstock for refining and processing. Another oil company has been researching on cellulosic ethanol and a biomass-to-liquids plant that converts wood chips into synthesis gas and fuel for diesel engines. Animal fats with hydrocarbon feedstocks are also being utilized produce ultralow-sulfur diesel. In terms of production, corn ethanol production almost tripled and biodiesel production increased tenfold in 5 years in the US. Meanwhile, ethanol is is produced through fermentation of sugars, distillation and then drying. A potentially revolutionary fuel is biobutanol because of the possibility of easy integration into the refining and gasoline distribution infrastructure better than ethanol. It is easier to integrate because butanol has a low vapor pressure and low solubility in water.

AB  - This paper is concerned with a comparative study of the energy sustainability of the production of biodiesel from oleaginous plants (rape and sunflower), of bioethanol from sugar crops (sugar beet and sweet sorghum) and of electricity from lignocellulose materials (miscanthus and short rotation forestry poplar). The results show the lignocellulose feedstock to perform best in terms of both net energy produced per unit area of cultivated land, from around 184 GJ/ha to more than 434 GJ/ha, and of energy ratio between energy produced and energy consumed, in the order of 12-19. Biodiesel and bioethanol production were found to be less advantageous in terms of energy sustainability, especially when residues and by-products are not used as feedstock. For bioethanol production, sweet sorghum exhibited the higher energy ratio of around 5.2, due mainly to the heat recovered from residue in cogeneration plants. As for biodiesel production, neither the rape nor the sunflower proved to be particularly sustainable with an energy ratio of around 1.3-1.4, but performance can be improved using the agricultural and industrial processing residues to produce energy, increasing energy ratios up to 3.4-4.2. © IMechE 2007.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable fuel conventionally prepared by transesterification of pre-extracted vegetable oils and animal fats of all resources with methanol, catalyzed by strong acids or bases. This paper reports On a novel biodiesel production method that features acid-promoted direct methanolysis of cellular biomass of oleaginous yeasts and filamentous fungi. The process was optimized for tuning operation parameters, such as methanol dosage, catalyst concentration, reaction temperature and time. Up to 98% yield was reached with reaction conditions of 70°C, under ambient pressure for 20 h and a dried biomass to methanol ratio 1:20 (w/v) catalyzed by either 0.2 mol L-1 H2SO4 or 0.4 mol L-1 HCl. Cetane numbers for these products were estimated to range from 56 to 59. This integrated method is thus effective and technically attractive, as dried microbial biomass as feedstocks omits otherwise tedious and time-consuming oil extraction processes. © 2007 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - In the present work, a normal diesel engine was modified to work in a dual fuel (DF) mode with turpentine and diesel as primary and pilot fuels, respectively. The resulting homogeneous mixture was compressed to a temperature below the self-ignition point. The pilot fuel was injected through the standard injection system and initiated the combustion in the primary-fuel air mixture. The primary fuel (turpentine) has supplied most of the heat energy. Usually, in all DF engines, low-cetane fuels are preferred as a primary fuel. Therefore, at higher loads these fuels start knocking and deteriorating in performances. Usually, DF operators suppress the knock by adding more pilot-fuel quantity. But in the present work, a minimum pilot-fuel quantity was maintained constant throughout the test and a required quantity of diluent (water) was added into the combustion at the time of knocking. The advantages of this method of knock suppression are restoration of performance at full load, maintenance of the same pilot quantity through the load range and reduction in the fuel consumption at full load. From the results, it was found that all performance and emission parameters of turpentine, except volumetric efficiency, are better than those of diesel fuel. The emissions like CO, UBHC are higher than those of the diesel baseline (DBL) and around 40-45% reduction of smoke was observed at 100% of full load. The major pollutant of diesel engine, NOx, was found to be equal to that of DBL. From the above experiment, it was proved that approximately 80% replacement of diesel with turpentine is quite possible. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Urban buses reduce individual transport, participate to reinforce attractiveness of public transport, and illustrate city's image. Between all pathways available (NGV, LPG, Diesel with particulates filter, biofuel...) with their advantages, not easily valorised (pollutants, green houses gas, noise...), their inconveniences (costs, practise &amp; expertise changes), choices are more and more difficult for decision makers. Instead of leading national individual evaluation of these pathways, the project aims at overcoming these barriers for promoting alternative fuels, and best adapted technology or fuel for a given bus network. Five national agencies for Environment &amp; Energy management with bus network associated, an expert laboratory on engine measurements, a technical service for communication from Ministry of Public works, Transportation and Housing, one of the biggest European bus networks, will design, create, test and disseminate a new decision tool, completed by methodologies, examples, and web site. Based on bibliography, existing studies and information from bus networks involved in the project, methodologies, criteria for pathways comparison and on-board pollutants measurements are developed and specified. Emissions databases will be created from well to wheel (for integrating pollutants from fuel production: well to tank and tank to wheel), from Euro 1 to Euro 4, for majors pathways in use in Europe: Diesel with DPF, biofuel, NGV, LPG... Theses pollutants (CO, HC, NOx and Particulates) and green houses gas (GHG) emissions will be measured on more than 10 different pathways, for all engines speeds and loads' points, during the project. For the tested bus network, "simple" measures will be realized for determining speeds and loads map in real conditions. Then, all pollutants emissions will be estimate without any expensive measurements, crossing databases and map measured. Theses pollutants and GHG will be completed by other parameters important for comparison, such as noise or unregulated pollutants. Specific simulation tool will be developed for estimate some of theses parameters (noise for example), to avoid expensive measures in real conditions. Tool for comparison will be realized using previous methodologies, databases and simulation tools, totally adaptable to national situation integrating specific incentives, fuel costs... This tool will be created under software form. Based on existing bus network description, on new bus information, it will calculate all emissions (pollutants, GHG, noise, other to be determined) in real conditions. Then, it will valorise in economics terms theses emissions using external costs, add to "classics" economics costs (vehicle, fuel station and infrastructures...), uniting all relevant criteria in one easy-to-use tool adapted to local conditions. Software will be tested in real conditions, by future users (bus networks &amp; cities). European dissemination will be done by: Two conferences, one for methodologies presentation, and final conference for software presentation, and results of tests presented by bus networks, Web site presenting best practises for alternatives fuels developing, examples, tests results and demonstration version of software: www.starbus-project.eu.

AB  - Diesel engine emissions (DEE) are classified as probably carcinogenic to humans. In recent years every effort was made to reduce DEE and their content of carcinogenic and mutagenic polycyclic aromatic compounds. Since 1995 we observed an appreciable reduction of mutagenicity of DEE driven by reformulated or newly designed fuels in several studies. Recently, the use of rapeseed oil as fuel for diesel engines is rapidly growing among German transportation businesses and agriculture due to economic reasons. We compared the mutagenic effects of DEE from two different batches of rapeseed oil (RSO) with rapeseed methyl ester (RME, biodiesel), natural gas derived synthetic fuel (gas-to-liquid, GTL), and a reference diesel fuel (DF). The test engine was a heavy-duty truck diesel running the European Stationary Cycle. Particulate matter from the exhaust was sampled onto PTFE-coated glass fibre filters and extracted with dichloromethane in a soxhlet apparatus. The gas phase constituents were sampled as condensates. The mutagenicity of the particle extracts and the condensates was tested using the Salmonella typhimurium/mammalian microsome assay with tester strains TA98 and TA100. Compared to DF the two RSO qualities significantly increased the mutagenic effects of the particle extracts by factors of 9.7 up to 59 in tester strain TA98 and of 5.4 up to 22.3 in tester strain TA100, respectively. The condensates of the RSO fuels caused an up to factor 13.5 stronger mutagenicity than the reference fuel. RME extracts had a moderate but significant higher mutagenic response in assays of TA98 with metabolic activation and TA100 without metabolic activation. GTL samples did not differ significantly from DF. In conclusion, the strong increase of mutagenicity using RSO as diesel fuel compared to the reference DF and other fuels causes deep concern on future usage of this biologic resource as a replacement of established diesel fuels. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Production of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) from palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) having high free fatty acids (FFA) was investigated in this work. Batch esterifications of PFAD were carried out to study the influence of: including reaction temperatures of 70-100 °C, molar ratios of methanol to PFAD of 0.4:1-12:1, quantity of catalysts of 0-5.502% (wt of sulfuric acid/wt of PFAD) and reaction times of 15-240 min. The optimum condition for the continuous esterification process (CSTR) was molar ratio of methanol to PFAD at 8:1 with 1.834 wt% of H2SO4 at 70 °C under its own pressure with a retention time of 60 min. The amount of FFA was reduced from 93 wt% to less than 2 wt% at the end of the esterification process. The FAME was purified by neutralization with 3 M sodium hydroxide in water solution at a reaction temperature of 80 °C for 15 min followed by transesterification process with 0.396 M sodium hydroxide in methanol solution at a reaction temperature of 65 °C for 15 min. The final FAME product met with the Thai biodiesel quality standard, and ASTM D6751-02. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The energetic and environmental performance of production and distribution of the Brassica carinata biomass crop in Soria (Spain) is analysed using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology in order to demonstrate the major potential that the crop has in southern Europe as a lignocellulosic fuel for use as a renewable energy source. The Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) including midpoint impact analysis that was performed shows that the use of fertilizers is the action with the highest impact in six of the 10 environmental categories considered, representing between 51% and 68% of the impact in these categories. The second most important impact is produced when the diesel is used in tractors and transport vehicles which represents between 48% and 77%. The contribution of the B. carinata cropping system to the global warming category is 12.7 g CO2 eq. MJ-1 biomass produced. Assuming a preliminary estimation of the B. carinata capacity of translocated CO2 (631 kg CO2 ha-1) from below-ground biomass into the soil, the emissions are reduced by up to 5.2 g CO2 eq. MJ-1. The production and transport are as far as a thermoelectric plant of the B. carinata biomass used as a solid fuel consumes 0.12 MJ of primary energy per 1 MJ of biomass energy stored. In comparison with other fossil fuels such as natural gas, it reduces primary energy consumption by 33.2% and greenhouse gas emission from 33.1% to 71.2% depending on whether the capacity of translocated CO2 is considered or not. The results of the analysis support the assertion that B. carinata crops are viable from an energy balance and environmental perspective for producing lignocellulosic solid fuel destined for the production of energy in southern Europe. Furthermore, the performance of the crop could be improved, thus increasing the energy and environmental benefits. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was used to optimize the three important reaction variables-methanol quantity (M), acid concentration (C) and reaction time (T) for reduction of free fatty acid (FFA) content of the oil to around 1% as compared to methanol quantity (M′) and reaction time (T′) and for carrying out transesterification of the pretreated oil. Using RSM, quadratic polynomial equations were obtained for predicting acid value and transesterification. Verification experiments confirmed the validity of both the predicted models. The optimum combination for reducing the FFA of Jatropha curcas oil from 14% to less than 1% was found to be 1.43% v/v H2SO4 acid catalyst, 0.28 v/v methanol-to-oil ratio and 88-min reaction time at a reaction temperature of 60 °C as compared to 0.16 v/v methanol-to-pretreated oil ratio and 24 min of reaction time at a reaction temperature of 60 °C for producing biodiesel. This process gave an average yield of biodiesel more than 99%. The fuel properties of jatropha biodiesel so obtained were found to be comparable to those of diesel and confirming to the American and European standards. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Energy resources will play an important role in the world's future. Rural bioenergy is still the predominant form of energy used by people in the less developed countries, and bioenergy from biomass accounts for about 15% of the world's primary energy consumption and about 38% of the primary energy consumption in developing countries. Furthermore, bioenergy often accounts for more than 90% of the total rural energy supplies in some developing countries. Earth life in rural areas of the world has changed dramatically over time. Industrial development in developing countries, coming at a time of low cost plentiful oil supplies, has resulted in greater reliance on the source of rural bioenergy than is true in the developed countries. In developed countries, there is a growing trend towards employing modern technologies and efficient bioenergy conversion using a range of biofuels, which are becoming cost wise competitive with fossil fuels. Currently, much attention has been a major focus on renewable alternatives in the developing countries. Renewable energy can be particularly appropriate for developing countries. In rural areas, particularly in remote locations, transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative. Renewable energy can facilitate economic and social development in communities but only if the projects are intelligently designed and carefully planned with local input and cooperation. Particularly in poor rural areas, the costs of renewable energy projects will absorb a significant part of participants' small incomes. Bio-fuels are important because they replace petroleum fuels. Biomass and biofuels can be used as a substitute for fossil fuels to generate heat, power and/or chemicals. Generally speaking, biofuels are generally considered as offering many benefits, including sustainability, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, regional development, social structure and agriculture and security of supply. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this study is to compare the engine performance and emission results of biodiesel derived from used cooking oil when applied in different proportions in outboard engines. Results revealed that the use of biodiesel resulted in lower emissions of CO (up to 12%) with an increase in emissions of NOx (up to 20%, except in one case which presented a slight reduction). Biodiesel also presented a slight increase in specific fuel consumption (lower than 11.4%) which may be acceptable considering the reduction in exhaust emissions. The experimental results proved that biodiesel alone or blended biodiesel can be used in compression ignition outboard engines, thereby providing a viable alternative to diesel. Special attention should be paid to the use of biodiesel in boats operating on lakes and rivers and in sheltered bays, which are more vulnerable to pollution. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Indian government is promoting its biofuels program to counteract an increase in the costs of crude oil imports, but the lack of feedstock and financial incentives threatens to burn out the industry's potential. To achieve a target economic growth rate of 9%/yr between 2007 and 2012, India's energy demand in the transportation sector is expected to grow by 6-8%/yr. India's petroleum product consumption is expected to rise from 113 million short ton (102.51 million ton) in the fiscal year 2006 to 135 million short ton by fiscal 2012. The Indian government, through the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, is in the process of implementing a national policy on biofuels that will cover R&D, capacity building, purchase policy and registration for enabling biofuel use. The new policy, which is still at the draft stage, aims for a 5% blending requirement of petroleum-based fuel with biofuels by 2012, increasing to 10% by 2017. In 2003, India launched its National Biodiesel Mission to meet 20% of the country's diesel requirements in 2012 by cultivating a total of 11.2 million ha of jatropha for biodiesel feedstock. The program also aims to install transesterification plants to process the oilseed in each state.

AB  - Biodiesel can be easily obtained starting from high-quality or refined vegetable oils and performing on these feedstocks a transesterification reaction usually promoted by alkaline catalysts in the homogeneous phase. In this production scheme the employment of low-quality or waste raw materials, as cheap as possible, must be carefully considered to strongly improve the economic competitiveness of this biofuel with respect to the petroleum-derived diesel. In the case of raw materials characterized by a high content of free fatty acids (FFAs), a preliminary esterification treatment with methanol or ethanol is necessary for the abatement of the FFA concentration below the threshold limit value of 0.5-1.0% by weight that is tolerable by the subsequent process step of alkaline transesterification. In the present work the esterification reaction in tubular packed bed reactors, operating under pressure and using a sulfonic acid resin as catalyst, has been extensively studied. As it is well-known, sulfonic exchange resins are subjected to an impressive swelling phenomenon, and it is difficult to obtain, in this case, a dimensionally stable packed bed reactor. A particular solution to this problem has been proposed by the authors using springs of suitable size and shape as catalyst diluent. The influence of operative conditions like overall feed flow rate, reactants feed molar ratio, reactor aspect ratio L/DR, and mixture viscosity in the described reactors has been investigated. The collected experimental data have been interpreted by means of a mono-dimensional packed bed reactor model in which the external mass-transfer limitation (fluid-to-particle) has been accounted for. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Wheb Biofuels launched plans for a $99.6 million biodiesel plant at Rotterdam port in April 2007. The facility, expected on stream in 2009, will be able convert up to 400,000 ton/yr of vegetable oil to biodiesel. Wheb's project is the latest of many biofuels projects planned for Europe. By July 2006, the capacity to produce biodiesel within the 25 EU member states had increased to 6.07 million ton/yr - around double that of the previous year, according to the European Biodiesel Board. The rising production figures reflect the expectation among European producers of strong demand growth, against the backdrop of calls from the European Commission for members voluntarily to increase the proportion of biofuels used in gasoline and diesel to 2% by 2005 and 5.75% by 2010. With pressure from the EU to raise biofuels use increasing, the sector remains a good bet for investors. However, it is difficult to predict precisely how it will develop. Either bioethanol or biodiesel could come to dominate the market, for example. Meanwhile, a second generation of potentially more efficient biomass-to-liquids feedstocks could become commercially viable in a few years if the technology works out.

AB  - Biodiesel is an environmentally friendly alternative diesel fuel consisting of the alkyl monoesters of fatty acids. It is obtained from triglycerides through the transesterification process. Biodiesel has been observed to reduce most engine exhaust pollutant emissions with the exception of oxides of nitrogen (NO x), which generally increase by 5% to 15%. The objective of this research was to determine the relationship between changes in combustion timing caused by differences in the fuel properties between diesel fuel and biodiesel and the NO x increase. The properties investigated in this research included the lower heating value, density, speed of sound, bulk modulus, and cetane number of biodiesel. It was found that half of the start of combustion advance associated with biodiesel originated from a start of injection advance that was split approximately evenly between the automatic timing advance of the pump as it injects more fuel to compensate for the lower heating value of biodiesel and the effect of the bulk modulus, viscosity, and density of the fuel. At the same temperature, the fuel delivery of biodiesel was higher than for petroleum-based diesel fuel because of the higher viscosity of biodiesel. At the same viscosity level, it was found that the fuel delivery of petroleum-based diesel fuel was higher than for biodiesel. This was attributed to the metering orifices in the fuel injection pumps restricting the amount of fuel flow for denser fuels. The other half of the start of combustion timing advance was due to the higher cetane number of the biodiesel. © 2007 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - The true potential for some promising alternative fuels has been discovered, which can suppress carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. The net reduction in greenhouse gases in creating veggie diesel works out at seven percent, though supply chains are getting more efficient and future energy for processing will come from wind, tide or sunlight. French farmers are welcoming the increase to their incomes from biofuel crops while plans are in progress in Angola, Tanzania and Zambia for massive introduction of biofuel crops. A switch to ethanol is an easy way of getting particulates and nitrogen oxides emissions below Euro-5 limits. Production of synthetic diesel fuel from liquid extracts of decomposed plant waste is also increasing. A biofuel is unlikely to be a commercial success unless it is competitive in economic terms.

AB  - Bioethanol is an attractive fuel due to its renewable origin and its oxygen content, but it is unable to be used directly in diesel engines. Although biodiesel can be produced with bioethanol through ethanolisis, direct blending of ethanol and diesel fuel, called e-diesel, has at least the same potential to reduce particulate emissions, despite their much lower production cost. The main drawback is that ethanol is immiscible with diesel fuel over a wide range of temperatures, leading to phase separation. Consequently, in many cases the presence of a surfactant and cosolvent additive in the e-diesel blend becomes necessary. In this paper the conditions in which the e-diesel blends are stable have been studied. The stability of samples is affected by three factors mainly: temperature, water content and initial ethanol content. The results show that the presence of water in the blends, low temperatures and high ethanol contents favour the phase separation whereas the presence of the additive leads to the opposite effect. These effects have been quantified through level curve maps for stability and for separation time. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A naturally aspirated multi cylinder diesel genset (DG) was operated successfully with mixed fuels (fossil-diesel (FD), refined rice bran oil (RRBO) and producer gas from a wood gasifier). Performance of DG set in FD, dual fuel mode (FD+RRBO in different proportion and FD+producer gas) and mixed fuels mode (with preheated blend of 75% RRBO+FD and producer gas) at different engine load conditions are presented in this paper. Performance of DG was evaluated in terms of specific energy consumption (SEC), brake thermal efficiency, exhaust gas temperature and exhaust gas composition. Study revealed that blends containing up to 75% RRBO with FD could be used as engine fuel without any adverse effect on the engine. The blend of RRBO and FD was preheated to 60 °C before use in the compression ignition (CI) engine. In general, exhaust gas temperature and SEC increased in all the three modes compared to FD. However, break thermal efficiency decreased. It may be due to lower calorific value of RRBO and producer gas. It was observed that at 84% engine load having 18.4:1 compression ratio (CR) and operating in dual fuel mode (FD+producer gas), the concentration of pollutants like carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) reduced by 55%, 19.7%, 82% and 83%, respectively, while hydrocarbon (HC) increased by 67.2% as compared to FD. Similarly at 84% engine load having 17:1 CR and operating in dual fuel mode (FD+RRBO), the concentration of pollutant like CO, CO2 and HC reduced by 60%, 0.86% and 91%, respectively. However, NOx increased by 23.48% as compared to FD. In mixed fuel mode (preheated blends of RRBO+FD in the proportion of 3:1 and producer gas) at 84% engine load having 18.4:1 CR, the concentration of pollutants like HC, NO and NO2 reduced by 48.28%, 61.57% and 80.48%, respectively, while CO increased by 16.31% as compared to FD. In addition to the findings on environmental aspects, the study also proved that the diesel engine could be run safely in mixed fuel mode (53% producer gas, rest RRBO and FD at the ratio of 3:1 and heated at 60 °C). © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Transesterification of canola oil was carried out with methanol, ethanol, and various mixtures of methanol/ethanol, keeping the molar ratio of oil to alcohol 1:6 and using KOH as a catalyst. Mixtures of alcohol increased the rate of transesterification reaction and produced methyl as well as ethyl esters. The increased rate was result of better solubility of oil in reaction mixture due to better solvent properties of ethanol than methanol and equilibrium due to methanol. With 3:3 molar ratio of methanol to ethanol {MEE (3:3)} the amount of ethyl ester formed was 50% that of methyl ester. Properties (acid value, viscosity, density) of all esters including mixed esters were within the limits of ASTM standards. Lubricities of these esters are in the order: ethyl ester > methyl ethyl ester > methyl ester. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A study was made of the material balance for the fatty acid methyl ester (biodiesel) synthesis from sunflower oil using potassium hydroxide as the catalyst. A factorial design of experiments and a central composite design have been used to evaluate the influence of operating conditions on the process material balance. The responses chosen were the biodiesel yield and the yield losses due to triglyceride saponification and methyl ester dissolution in glycerol, while the variables studied were temperature, initial catalyst concentration and the methanol:vegetable oil molar ratio. The biodiesel yield increased and therefore the yield losses decreased by decreasing catalyst concentration and temperature. However, the methanol:sunflower oil molar ratio did not affect the material balance variables significantly. Second-order models were obtained to predict the biodiesel yield and both yield losses. Within the experimental range studied, these models largely matched the results from the experiments. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study consists of the development and optimisation of the potassium hydroxide-catalysed synthesis of fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel) from sunflower oil. A factorial design of experiments and a central composite design have been used. The variables chosen were temperature, initial catalyst concentration by weight of sunflower oil and the methanol:vegetable oil molar ratio, while the responses were biodiesel purity and yield. The initial catalyst concentration is the most important factor, having a positive influence on biodiesel purity, but a negative one on biodiesel yield. Temperature has a significant positive effect on biodiesel purity and a significant negative influence on biodiesel yield. The methanol:vegetable oil molar ratio is only significant for the biodiesel purity, having a positive influence. Second-order models were obtained to predict biodiesel purity and yield as a function of these variables. The best conditions are 25 °C, a 1.3% wt for the catalyst concentration and a 6:1 methanol:sunflower oil molar ratio. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, a capillary electrophoresis (CE) methodology for the determination of free glycerol in biodiesel using oxidative cleavage with periodate was optimized and validated. The amount of iodate produced in the reaction was determined by CE. The optimized electrolyte was 20 mmol L-1 glycine and 10 mmol L-1 trifluoroacetic acid (direct UV detection, 210 nm). The short total analysis time (less than 28 s) was obtained using the short end injection mode. The optimization of the method was carried out using Peakmaster® software. The choice of the components of the run electrolyte and of the internal standard (nitrate) was made through the use of effective mobility curves. A good correlation coefficient higher than 0.9991 and low LOD 4.3 mg L-1 was obtained. The recovery of free glycerol was 95.4-102.4%. This method was used to determine glycerol in commercial biodiesel samples. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the positive features of biofuel concerning environmental protection is its high biodegradability. Fuel is considered to be biodegradable if not less than 90% of it degrades within 21 days. The aim of this work was to determine the biodegradability of various kinds of fatty acid methyl esters and their mixtures with fossil diesel fuel in natural environments. It was determined that fatty acid methyl esters meet the requirements for biodegradability set by the EU. Of rapeseed oil fatty acid methyl esters (RME), 91.2% degraded within 21 days, compared to 94.2% of rapeseed oil fatty acid ethyl esters, 98.3% of linseed oil fatty acid methyl esters (LSME), 90% of tallow fatty acid methyl esters, and 92.5% of pork lard fatty acid methyl esters (LME), while the amount of degraded fossil diesel fuel reached only 57.3%. The biodegradability of multi-component biofuels containing RME, LSME and LME is similar; the best is of a mixture of 70% RME, 6% LSME and 24% LME. It was determined that more than 90% of multi-component biofuel and fossil diesel fuel mixtures degrade within 21 days when they contain 35% and more of multi-component biofuel. © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biowastes can be utilized to produce microdiesel, a promising alternative energy source for limited crude oil and food based biofuels. As an alternative fuel, microdiesel produced from lignocellulosic materials has superior environmental benefits; be economically competitive; be producible in sufficient quantities and the energy conversion efficiency was also estimated in the article in theory. In the article, Populus euramevicana cv leaves acid hydrolysate has been utilized as a substrate for microbial oil production using Rhodotorula glutinis. Microdiesel was further produced by transesterification and most properties complied with the limits established by ASTM related to biodiesel quality. In order to further reduce the cost, exogenous depolymerization enzymes used in the hydrolysis process could be replaced with plants that are capable of synthesizing these enzymes in situ and the cellulase and hemicellulase would be produced and break, down the cell wall just before harvest.

AB  - Bio-fuels are important because they replace petroleum fuels. The production of biofuel feedstocks from agricultural and forestry sources has been considered for many years, particularly just after the 1970's "energy crisis". A number of environmental and economic benefits are claimed for biofuels. Worldwide interest reflect convergence of developed and developing country perspectives on the role bio-fuels can play in energy for sustainable development. The increase in bio-fuels utilization has also been accompanied over the past 3-4 years with policy decisions that encourage future growth of these fuels. The United States and several European Union member states already pursue successful bio-fuel policy. This work presents a review of the thermochemical and biochemical methods that could be used to produce bio-fuels and the production trends of the products in the world.

AB  - We present an emission inventory of primary black carbon (BC) and primary organic carbon (OC) aerosols from fossil fuel and biofuel combustion between 1850 and 2000. We reconstruct fossil fuel consumption and represent changes in technology on a national and sectoral basis. Our estimates rely on new estimates of biofuel consumption, and updated emission factors for old technologies. Emissions of black carbon increase almost linearly, totaling about 1000 Gg in 1850, 2200 Gg in 1900, 3000 Gg in 1950, and 4400 Gg in 2000. Primary organic carbon shows a similar pattern, with emissions of 4100 Gg, 5800 Gg, 6700 Gg, and 8700 Gg in 1850, 1900, 1950, and 2000, respectively. Biofuel is responsible for over half of BC emission until about 1890, and dominates energy-related primary OC emission throughout the entire period. Coal contributes the greatest fraction of BC emission between 1880 and 1975, and is overtaken by emissions from biofuel around 1975, and by diesel engines around 1990. Previous work suggests a rapid rise in BC emissions between 1950 and 2000. This work supports a more gradual increase between 1950 and 2000, similar to the increase between 1850 and 1925; implementation of clean technology is a primary reason.

AB  - This article will review an experiment conducted to test the capability of an EP-IR spectrometer to quantify the percentage volume of water in ethanol. Ethanol is a popular biofuel that is often used as an effective alternative to fossil fuels such as gasoline or diesel. For the ethanol to be usable as a fuel, water must be removed in the distillation process. The results of the experiment confirm the ability of EP-NIR spectroscopy, together with an extended-range transmission Direct Immersion Probe (DIP), to predict low-level moisture content in ethanol samples accurately and effectively, particularly when ethanol concentrations are 90% or greater.

AB  - The conference on biofuels held at London, UK, on April 23-24, 2007, focused on the creation of a balanced international forum for the exchange of views on the technologies and prospects of biofuels. The conference discussed the topics such as role of biofuels to provide sustainable energy and the impact of global warming and the unfettered use of biofuels. The use of biofuel by the oil industry to reduce carbon dioxide emissions was also acknowledged at the conference. The options for biomass, the potential yields, and carbon savings gave a clear message of the highest yields from ligno-cellulosic biomass and not by food crops and vegetable oils. The conference also emphasized on the shortcomings of the limitations of ethanol and bio-diesel to low proportion blends with gasoline and diesel. High temperature gasification process was identified at the conference for processing biomass alone on a scale required to feed a Fischer Tropsch plant.

AB  - A comparative life cycle assessment examining soybean and petroleum-based lubricants is compiled using Monte Carlo analysis to assess system variability. Experimental data obtained from an aluminum manufacturing facility indicate significantly less soybean lubricant is required to achieve similar or superior performance. With improved performance and a lower use rate, a transition to soybean oil results in lower aggregate impacts of acidification, smog formation, and human health from criteria pollutants. Regardless of quantity consumed, soybean-based lubricants exhibit significant climate change and fossil fuel use benefits; however, eutrophication impacts are much greater due to non-point nutrient emissions. Fundamental tradeoffs in the carbon and nitrogen cycles are addressed in the analysis, demonstrating that a transition to soybean oil may result in climate change benefits at the expense of regional water quality. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A field study was initiated in December 2000 in two selected sub-Antarctic soils (Kerguelen Archipelago) with the objective of determining the long-term effects of a fertilizer addition on the degradation rate and the toxicity of oil residues under severe sub-Antarctic conditions. Two soils were selected. The first site was an organic soil supporting an abundant vegetal cover while the second one was a mineral soil, free from vegetation. Both soils were located in the vicinity of the permanent station of Port-aux-Français (69°42′E-49°19′S). Two series of five experimental plots (0.75 × 0.7 5 m) were settled firmly into each of the studied soils. Each plot received 500 ml of diesel fuel or Arabian light crude oil and some of them were treated with a bioremediation agent: the slow release fertilizer Inipol EAP-22® (Elf Atochem). All plots were sampled on a regular basis over a 4-year period. The microbial response was improved by bioremediation treatments but fertilizer addition had a greater impact on the mineral soil when compared to the organic one. The rate of degradation was significantly improved by bioremediation treatments. However, even after 4 years, the toxicity of oiled soils as determined by Microtox solid phase tests showed a persistent response in spite of an apparent significant degradation of alkanes and aromatics. Despite the very small amount of contaminant used in this experiment, 4 years of bioremediation was not sufficient to obtain a complete return to pristine conditions. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Interest in the use of alternative fuels and engines is increasing as the price of petroleum climbs. The inherently higher efficiency of Diesel engines has led to increased adoption of Diesels in Europe, capturing approximately 40% of the new passenger car market. Unfortunately, lower CO2 emissions are countered with higher nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions and higher noise. Adding oxygenated compounds to the fuel helps reduce PM emissions. However, relying on fuel alone to reduce PM is unrealistic due to economic constraints and difficult due to the emerging PM standards. Keeping peak combustion temperature below 1700 K inhibits NOx formation. Altering the combustion regime to burn at temperatures below the NOx threshold and accept a wide variety of fuels seems like a promising alternative for future engines. Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) is a possible solution. Fuel and air are well mixed prior to intake into a cylinder (homogeneous charge) and ignition occurs by compression of the fuel-air mixture by the piston. HCCI is rapid and relatively cool, producing little NOx and PM. Unfortunately, it is hard to control since HCCI is initiated by temperature and pressure instead of a spark or direct fuel injection. We investigate biofuel HCCI combustion, and use intrinsically labeled biofuels as tracers of HCCI combustion. Data from tracer experiments are used to improve our combustion modeling. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Postemergence contact herbicidal activities of biodiesels from several oilseed sources were examined for potential use to control broadleaf weeds in turfgrasses. Cuphea, lesquerella, meadowfoam, milkweed and soybean oils were applied as 1 and 2% (v/v) aqueous emulsions plus a nonionic surfactant to 2-week-old seedlings of perennial ryegrass, velvetleaf and sicklepod in the greenhouse. All five biodiesels were more phytotoxic to sicklepod and velvetleaf than to perennial ryegrass. Several different surfactants were tested together as emulsions with 1% soybean biodiesel, with Triton X-100 being the most effective. These results indicate that biodiesels may be useful as environmental friendly contact herbicides in turfgrasses, as there are few contact herbicides options available for the homeowner market which will not cause turf injury. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A promising option to substitute fossil energy carriers by renewables is the production of synthetic natural gas (SNG) from wood, as this results in a flexible energy carrier usable via existing infrastructure in gas boilers or passenger cars. The comprehensive life cycle-based ecological impact of SNG is investigated and compared with standard fuels delivering the same service (natural gas, fuel oil, petrol/diesel, and wood chips). Life cycle impact assessment methodologies and external costs from airborne emissions provide measures of overall damage. The results indicate that the SNG system has the best ecological performance if the consumption of fossil resources is strongly weighted. Otherwise natural gas performs best, as its supply chain is energy-efficient and its use produces relatively low emissions. Wood systems are by far the best in terms of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), where SNG emits about twice as much as the wood chips system. The main negative aspects of the SNG system are NOx and particulate emissions and the relatively low total energy conversion efficiency resulting from the additional processing to transform wood to gas. Direct wood combustion has a better ecological score when highly efficient particulate filters are installed. SNG performs better than oil derivatives with all the evaluation methods used. External costs for SNG are the lowest as long as GHG are valued high. SNG should preferably be used in cars, as the reduction of overall ecological impacts and external costs when substituting oil-based fuels is larger for current cars than for heating systems. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A packed-bed reactor (PBR) system using fungus whole-cell biocatalyst was developed for biodiesel fuel production by plant oil methanolysis. Lipase-producing Rhizopus oryzae cells were immobilized within 6 mm × 6 mm × 3 mm cuboidal polyurethane foam biomass support particles (BSPs) during batch cultivation in a 20-l air-lift bioreactor. Emulsification of the reaction mixture containing soybean oils and water improved the methanolysis reaction rate. Using a high flow rate for the reaction mixture in the PBR caused exfoliation of the immobilized cells from the BSPs, while the inefficient mixing of the reaction mixture at low flow rates allowed the BSPs to be covered with a hydrophilic layer of high methanol concentration, leading to a significant decrease in lipase activity. A high methyl ester content of over 90% was achieved at a flow rate of 25 l/h in the first cycle of repeated batch methanolysis and a high value of around 80% was maintained even after the tenth cycle. Comparison with methanolysis reaction in a shaken bottle suggested that the PBR enhances repeated batch methanolysis by protecting immobilized cells from physical damage and excess amounts of methanol. The process presented here is therefore considered to be promising for industrial biodiesel-fuel production. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stora Enso has signed an agreement with Neste Oil to develop the technology for producing new-generation biofuels for transport vehicles from wood residues. The first step will be to design and build a demonstration plant at Stora Enso's Varkaus mill in Finland. The plant, which will take the form of a 50/50 joint venture is expected to start up in 2008. Costing around €14 million, the demonstration plant will be integrated into the energy infrastructure at Varkaus. It will convert logging residues into a hydrocarbon stock to be taken to Neste Oil's Porvoo refinery for production of diesel fuel. The second phase will involve building a commercial-scale plant at one of Stora Enso's mills. Stora Enso will supply the wood biomass and will use the heat generated by the process in its pulp and paper production. Neste Oil will handle refining and marketing of the biofuel produced. UPM has also announced its intention to begin production of wood-based biofuel. The company is currently developing a suitable business concept and the necessary technology, and a decision on whether to go ahead with a commercial-scale plant will be taken in the next few years. The plant will be built at one of UPM's mills in the UK, France, Germany or Finland.

AB  - The complete basis set method CBS-QB3 has been used to study the thermochemistry and kinetics of the esters ethyl propanoate (EP) and methyl butanoate (MB) to evaluate initiation reactions and intermediate products from unimolecular decomposition reactions. Using isodesmic and isogeitonic equations and atomization energies, we have estimated chemically accurate enthalpies of formation and bond dissociation energies for the esters and species derived from them. In addition it is shown that controversial literature values may be resolved by adopting, for the acetate radical, CH3C(O)Ȯ, Δfo(298.15K) = -197.8 kJ mol-1 and for the trans-hydrocarboxyl radical, C(O)OH, -181.6 ± 2.9 kJ mol -1. For EP, the lowest energy decomposition path encounters an energy barrier of ∼210 kJ mol-1 (∼50 kcal mol-1), which proceeds through a six-membered ring transition state (retro-ene reaction) via transfer of the primary methyl H atom from the ethyl group to the carbonyl oxygen, while cleaving the carbon-ether oxygen to form ethene and propanoic acid. On the other hand, the lowest energy path for MB has a barrier of ∼285 kJ mol-1, producing ethene. Other routes leading to the formation of aldehydes, alcohols, ketene, and propene are also discussed. Most of these intramolecular hydrogen transfers have energy barriers lower than that needed for homolytic bond fission (the lowest of which is 353 kJ mol-1 for the Cα-Cβ bond in MB). Propene formation is a much higher energy demanding process, 402 kJ mol-1, and it should be competitive with some C-C, C-O, and C-H bond cleavage processes. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The kinetics of oxidation of kerosene Jet A-1 and a kerosene/rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) mixture (80/20, mol/mol) (biokerosene) was studied experimentally in a jet-stirred reactor at 10 atm and constant residence time, over the temperature range 740-1200 K, and for variable equivalence ratios (0.5-1.5). Concentration profiles of the reactants, stable intermediates, and final products were obtained by probe sampling followed by on-line and off-line gas chromatography analyses. The oxidation of these fuels in these conditions was modeled using a detailed kinetic reaction mechanism consisting of 2027 reversible reactions and 263 species. The surrogate biokerosene model fuel used here consisted of a mixture of n-hexadecane, n-propylcyclohexane, n-propylbenzene, and n-decane, where the long-chain methyl ester fraction was simply represented by n-hexadecane. The proposed kinetic reaction mechanism used in the modeling yielded a good representation of the kinetics of oxidation of kerosene and biokerosene under jet-stirred reactor conditions and of kerosene in a premixed flame. The data and the model showed the biokerosene (Jet A-1/RME mixture) has a slightly higher reactivity than Jet A-1, whereas no major modification of the product distribution was observed besides the formation of small unsaturated methyl esters produced from RME's oxidation. The model predicts no difference in the ignition delays of kerosene and biokerosene. Using the proposed kinetic scheme, the formation of potential soot precursors was studied with particular attention. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Due to the world's over-reliance on fossil fuels there has been a developing interest in the production of renewable biofuels such as methyl and ethyl esters derived from vegetable oils and animal fats. To increase our understanding of the combustion chemistry of esters, the oxidation of methyl butanoate and ethyl propanoate, both with a molecular formula of C 5H10O2, have been studied in a series of high-temperature shock tube experiments. Ignition delay times for a series of mixtures, of varying fuel/oxygen equivalence ratios (φ = 0.25-1.5), were measured behind reflected shock waves over the temperature range 1100-1670 K, and at pressures of 1.0, and 4.0 atm. It was found that ethyl propanoate was consistently faster to ignite than methyl butanoate, particularly at lower temperatures. Detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms have been assembled and used to simulate these experiments with good agreement observed. Rate of production analyses using the detailed mechanisms shows that the faster reactivity of ethyl propanoate can be explained by a six-centered unimolecular decomposition reaction with a relatively low activation energy barrier producing propanoic acid and ethylene. The elimination reaction itself is not responsible for the increased reactivity; it is the faster reactivity of the two products, propanoic acid and ethylene that leads to this behavior. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The steadily increasing world market prices for fossil fuels in the past years have significantly increased interest in the development of indigenous sources of energy in the Pacific islands. As an import substitution strategy, many Pacific island Governments are looking into the use of local biomass resources to replace traditionally imported fuels such as petrol and diesel by biofuels. An overview of biofuel activities is given, with experiences and key achievements in Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Kiribati and Marshall Islands with regard to efforts to develop alternative fuels. There are strong linkages between developments in the various Pacific island countries and lessons to be learned from experiences and policies implemented among Governments in the Pacific region. The paper concludes that there is a need for standardization, quality control and testing facilities for biofuels in the region. Governments need to investigate further the level of support that is required to make biofuel operations viable and maximize macroeconomic and environmental benefits. © 2007 The Author.

AB  - The continuous-flow preparation of biodiesel using a commercially available scientific microwave apparatus offers a fast, easy route to this valuable biofuel. The methodology allows for the reaction to be run under atmospheric conditions and performed at flow rates of up to 7.2 L/ min using a 4 L reaction vessel. It can be utilized with new or used vegetable oil with methanol and a 1:6 molar ratio of oil/alcohol. Energy consumption calculations suggest that the continuous-flow microwave methodology for the transesterification reaction is more energy-efficient than using a conventional heated apparatus. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel is gaining momentum in India and rice bran oil (RBO) could be utilized as a possible source of biodiesel. Since industrial grade RBO has high FFA content, base catalyzed transesterification process is not an appropriate method for production of biodiesel. This study reports two-stage formulation process (esterfication followed by transesterification) to convert industrial grade RBO into biodiesel, physio-chemical characterization of biodiesel and run a small capacity, single cylinder, direct injection diesel engine on biodiesel. The performance and emission results of biodiesel are compared with diesel.

AB  - In Uttar Pradesh (UP) state of India, during 2003-04, transport sector has consumed about 2150 million liters [ML] diesel while the projected demand for the same alone may be 2987 ML by 2020. Considering 20% blend of biodiesel in diesel, requirement of UP would be about 596 ML of biodiesel, which could be produced from non-edible oil resources especially Jatropha. This will save foreign exchange and reduce CO2 emission. Paper presents potential of Jatropha cultivation on the available wastelands in UP and techno-economic study of biodiesel production and utilization for transport sector of the state with particular reference to Uttar Pradesh State Roadways Transport Corporation (UPSRTC).

AB  - The advantages of increasing the investment in research and development of biofuels in the Gambia are discussed. The use of biofuels in the transportation sector will help to reduce the cost of imported fuel and save foreign exchange. The use of biofuels can help to sustain rural economy and improve the life of people. The are two sources of biodiesel in Gambia, which includes groundnut oil and jatropha oil. It has been observed that groundnut oil has a heating value of 39.5 MJ/kg, which is similar to diesel. Groundnut oil-based biodiesel has the potential to replace 20-30% of the current diesel consumption. Variuos NGO's and aid agencies such as the World Bank are currently promoting a new crop, Jatropha curcas, as a major raw material for biodiesel production in developing countries. The jatropha oil have a high oil content ranging from 46-58% by kernel weight and up to 40% in the seeds themselves. The raw oil is similar to groundnut oil with heating value of 39 MJ/kg.

AB  - The use of biodiesel fuel as a substitute for fossil fuel in diesel engines has received increasing attention in recent years. This study is the first to investigate and compare the characteristics of mutagenic species, trans,trans-2,4-decadienal (tt-DDE), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the diluted exhaust of diesel engines operated with diesel and biodiesel blend fuels. An engine of current design was operated on a dynamometer consistent with the US federal test procedure transient-cycle specifications. Petroleum diesel and a blend of petroleum diesel and biodiesel (B20) were tested. Exhaust sampling was carried out on diluted exhaust in a dilution tunnel with a constant-volume sampling system. Concentrations of tt-DDE and PAHs were analyzed by GC/MS. Although average PAH emission factors decreased from 1403 to 1051 μg bhp-h-1, the results show that tt-DDE is evidently generated (1.28 μg bhp-h-1) in the exhaust of diesel engine using B20 as fuel. This finding suggests that tt-DDE emission from the use of biodiesel should be taken into account in characterization and health-risk assessment. The results also show that tt-DDE is depleted in the diesel engine combustion process and the existence of tt-DDE in biodiesel is the major source of tt-DDE emission. The distribution of tt-DDE in the particulate phase is 55.3% under this study's sampling conditions. For diesel and B20, PAH phase distributions have similar trends. Lower molecular weight PAHs predominate in gaseous phase for both diesel and B20. Cold-start driving has higher tt-DDE and PAH emission factors, as well as a higher percentage of tt-DDE in particulate phase, than for warm-start driving. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soot and hydrocarbons are usually found in diesel exhaust gases. They are formed when the fuel is burnt out incompletely. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are sorbed on the soot, and may cause cancerous diseases, asthma and other diseases. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the dependence of smoke opacity and amount of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in engine emissions on multi-component biodiesel fuel composition. We analyzed the composition of exhaust gases when diesel engine was fuelled with rapeseed oil methyl esters (RME), RME mixtures with linseed oil methyl esters (LSME) and fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) of animal origin, assessing the smoke opacity and qualitative and quantitative composition of PAH. It was determined that smoke opacity of exhaust gases decreases at different rotation speeds (1200 and 2000 min-1) when the amount of FAME, containing a greater amount of saturated fatty acids, is increasing. Total PAH concentration in exhaust gases of biofuel mixtures with pork lard fatty acid methyl esters (LME) is lower than in the case of mixtures with beef tallow fatty acid methyl esters (TME). The amount of PAH at a rotation speed of 1200 min-1 reduced down to 57%, if compared to pure RME, and down to 30%, when the rotation speed was 2000 min-1. In the exhaust gases of biofuel mixtures with pork lard fatty acid methyl esters there are fewer PAHs with highly expressed mutagenic and carcinogenic effects if compared to pure RME and its mixtures, containing tallow fatty acid methyl esters. The most effective from an environmental point of view is use of a fuel mixture containing 80% RME, 4% LSME and 16% LME.

AB  - An instrumented EURO I Ford Mondeo was used to perform a real-world comparison of vehicle exhaust (carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen) emissions and fuel consumption for diesel and 5% biodiesel in diesel blend (B5) fuels. Data were collected on multiple replicates of three standardised on-road journeys: (1) a simple urban route; (2) a combined urban/inter-urban route; and, (3) an urban route subject to significant traffic management. At the total journey measurement level, data collected here indicate that replacing diesel with a B5 substitute could result in significant increases in both NOx emissions (8-13%) and fuel consumption (7-8%). However, statistical analysis of probe vehicle data demonstrated the limitations of comparisons based on such total journey measurements, i.e., methods analogous to those used in conventional dynamometer/drive cycle fuel comparison studies. Here, methods based on the comparison of speed/acceleration emissions and fuel consumption maps are presented. Significant variations across the speed/acceleration surface indicated that direct emission and fuel consumption impacts were highly dependent on the journey/drive cycle employed. The emission and fuel consumption maps were used both as descriptive tools to characterise impacts and predictive tools to estimate journey-specific emission and fuel consumption effects. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuels are liquid or gaseous fuels made from plant matter and residues, such as agricultural crops, municipal wastes and agricultural and forestry by-products. The term biofuels can refer to fuels for direct combustion for electricity production, but is generally used for liquid fuels for transportation. Biofuels are made from biomass through biochemical or thermochemical processes. Currently much attention is fo cused on utilization of ethanol, methanol, biodiesel, biocrude, and methane as biofuels. The European Union is on the third rank of biofuel production world wide, behind Brazil and the United States. In Europe, Germany is the largest, and France the second largest producer of biofuels. Most biofuels in commercial production in Europe today are based on sugar beet, wheat and rapeseed, which are converted to bioethanol/ETBE and biodiesel. The European Commission has set as a goal that by the end of 2005, 2% of the energy used in transportation shall be biofuels. The use of biofuels is then to grow by 0.75% annually. The ambition is to have 5.75% biofuels in transportation by 2010.

AB  - The anticipated decreasing supply of fossil fuel but increasing demand and concern for the environment have led the developed countries to introduce policies to encourage the use of alternative fuels, especially "bio"-based fuel. Several types of biofuels are now available as substitutes for gasoline (petrol) or diesel. These include oil/fat (either crude, processed, or used), methyl ester from oil/fat, and ethanol or liquid fuel from biomass. Fatty acid methyl ester (ME) has been identified as a suitable substitute for blending with diesel or to be used in diesel engines without the need to modify the engines. The European Union (EU) encourages the use of ME as diesel substitute (biodiesel) as are many other countries, including Malaysia.

AB  - Car makers in Geneva are adopting different strategies and implementing different type of design to develop an effective and environmentally friendly motor cars. Renault has ensured that at the end of the decade all of its diesels and half its petrol engines will be able to run on biofuels as well as petroleum fuels. Toyota and Honda presented sleek hybrid sports car design studies in an apparent effort to decide whether adding passion to ecology would sell more cars. Design students for the IED BeOn imagined a hybrid in which a thermal engine powers a hydraulic pump and hydraulic in-wheel motors. Dassault has patented its manner of arranging the Saft cells, which are now in series production. Lotus has developed a hybrid powertrain that can be retrofitted into its existing sports cars, and its SVE subsidiary is developing electric and hybrid powertrains under the brand name Cleanova for installation in existing vehicles car bodies.

AB  - In order to achieve the United States government's goal of a 20% reduction in US gasoline consumption by 2017, existing technology for converting coal to liquid fuel to biological raw materials should be implemented and entirely different technologies perfected. The Fisher-Tropsch process for making liquid fuels which was introduced in Germany in the 1920s produces a mixture of alkane hydrocarbons of molecular weights suitable for use in gasoline or diesel fuel. A drawback of the process is that it also produces a number of byproducts. An alternative process has been developed by James Dumesic of the University of Wisconsin (Madison). The multistep synthetic chemical process converts carbohydrates into alkanes. Efforts to generate synthesis gas from biomass are also under way at Black & Veatch Energy (Kansas) and UPM-Kymmene Corp. (Finland).

AB  - Bio-diesel has been accepted as a renewable liquid biofuel worldwide. In order to ensure customers' acceptance, standardisation and quality assurance are the key factors to the market introduction of bio-diesel as a transport fuel. Lubricity of bio-diesel is an important issue and it is well reported that 1-2% bio-diesel is sufficient to maintain the lubricity of diesel even of very poor lubricity. However, a wide variation in lubricity performance of bio-diesel from different vegetable oils and sources has been noticed. In addition, on critical examination, it was noticed that the variation in the lubricating performance of bio-diesel could be better linked to its residual acidity than to variation in fatty acid composition.

AB  - Bioenergy cropping systems could help offset greenhouse gas emissions, but quantifying that offset is complex. Bioenergy crops offset carbon dioxide emissions by converting atmospheric CO2 to organic C in crop biomass and soil, but they also emit nitrous oxide and vary in their effects on soil oxidation of methane. Growing the crops requires energy (e.g., to operate farm machinery, produce inputs such as fertilizer) and so does converting the harvested product to usable fuels (feedstock conversion efficiency). The objective of this study was to quantify all these factors to determine the net effect of several bioenergy cropping systems on greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. We used the DAYCENT biogeochemistry model to assess soil GHG fluxes and biomass yields for corn, soybean, alfalfa, hybrid poplar, reed canarygrass, and switchgrass as bioenergy crops in Pennsylvania, USA. DAYCENT results were combined with estimates of fossil fuels used to provide farm inputs and operate agricultural machinery and fossil-fuel offsets from biomass yields to calculate net GHG fluxes for each cropping system considered. Displaced fossil fuel was the largest GHG sink, followed by soil carbon sequestration. N2O emissions were the largest GHG source. All cropping systems considered provided net GHG sinks, even when soil C was assumed to reach a new steady state and C sequestration in soil was not counted. Hybrid poplar and switchgrass provided the largest net GHG sinks, &gt;200 g CO2e-C·m -2·yr-1 for biomass conversion to ethanol, and &gt;400 g CO2e-C·m-2·yr-1 for biomass gasification for electricity generation. Compared with the life cycle of gasoline and diesel, ethanol and biodiesel from corn rotations reduced GHG emissions by ∼40%, reed canarygrass by ∼85%, and switchgrass and hybrid poplar by ∼115%. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - The Philippines service station sector is adapting to new market conditions as motorists reduce private car use due to high gasoline prices. While vehicle fuel sales are down, a growing number of service station operators are looking to increase turnover by providing customers with convenience store and car wash facilities. Meanwhile, the government is looking to cut the nations rising oil import bill and has begun promoting the use f biofuels to help reduce the transport sectors share of petroleum use in the future. New legislation is due to be enacted shortly that will require the addition of ethanol to diesel fuel and encourage the use of other lower cost fuel blends. Service station operators are preparing for important changes as new fuels containing ethanol and biodiesel products are introduced. Shell already has introduced Shell Super Unleaded E10 in the Philippines, with a 10% ethanol content, without waiting for the government to introduce the new legislation. Production of ethanol in the Philippines is due to begin to coincide with the introduction of new regulations. While preparing to introduce new fuels, Petron also intends to expand its national service station network.

AB  - Burning of agricultural waste residue is a common method of disposal when preparing land following crop harvest. This practice introduces volatile organic compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), into the atmosphere. This study examines the particle size distribution in the smoke emissions of two common agricultural waste residues (biofuels) in California, almond prunings and rice straw. The residues were burned in a combustion chamber designed specifically for this purpose, and the smoke emissions were collected on 10-stage MOUDI impactors for analysis of PAH and total particle mass. The results, in units of emission factors, show that combustion temperature is an important factor in determining the smoke particle PAH composition. Total PAH emissions from rice straw burns were 18.6 mg kg-1 of fuel, while the emissions from almond prunings were lower at 8.03 mg kg-1. The less volatile five- and six-ring PAH was predominately on smaller particles where it condensed in the early stages of combustion while the more volatile three- and four-ring PAH formed on larger particles as the smoke cooled. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, the combustion characteristics and emissions of two different petroleum diesel fuels (No. 1 and No. 2) and biodiesel from soybean oil were compared. The tests were performed at steady state conditions in a four-cylinder turbocharged DI diesel engine at full load at 1400-rpm engine speed. The experimental results compared with No. 2 diesel fuel showed that biodiesel provided significant reductions in PM, CO, and unburned HC, the NOx increased by 11.2%. Biodiesel had a 13.8% increase in brake-specific fuel consumption due to its lower heating value. However, using No. 1 diesel fuel gave better emission results, NOx and brake-specific fuel consumption reduced by 16.1% and 1.2%, respectively. The values of the principal combustion characteristics of the biodiesel were obtained between two petroleum diesel fuels. The results indicated that biodiesel may be blended with No. 1 diesel fuel to be used without any modification on the engine. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work it has been shown that the routine ASTM methods (ASTM 4052, ASTM D 445, ASTM D 4737, ASTM D 93, and ASTM D 86) recommended by the ANP (the Brazilian National Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels) to determine the quality of diesel/biodiesel blends are not suitable to prevent the adulteration of B2 or B5 blends with vegetable oils. Considering the previous and actual problems with fuel adulterations in Brazil, we have investigated the application of vibrational spectroscopy (Fourier transform (FT) near infrared spectrometry and FT-Raman) to identify adulterations of B2 and B5 blends with vegetable oils. Partial least square regression (PLS), principal component regression (PCR), and artificial neural network (ANN) calibration models were designed and their relative performances were evaluated by external validation using the F-test. The PCR, PLS, and ANN calibration models based on the Fourier transform (FT) near infrared spectrometry and FT-Raman spectroscopy were designed using 120 samples. Other 62 samples were used in the validation and external validation, for a total of 182 samples. The results have shown that among the designed calibration models, the ANN/FT-Raman presented the best accuracy (0.028%, w/w) for samples used in the external validation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The US demand for ultralow-sulfur diesel (ULSD) continues to grow as its market will function smoothly while meeting new deadlines in 2007 and beyond. Refiners are confident that they could meet demand for ULSD but are worried about logistics that they could not control. Most of the diesel fuel sold in the US and Canada has been ULSD. The US inventories of ULSD were down from 58 million bbl but up from 1.7 million bbl during the same period a year ago. Refiners will see some shift in diesel and gasoline demand in the next decade due to the slow growth in the fleets of vehicles requiring ULSD. The road diesel demand increase was 4.2% year-on-year and markets shows that the world needs more diesel than gasoline. Refineries are relatively flexible and can handle a 10% increase manufacture of gasoline or diesel. Concentration of the diesel-distribution infrastructure varies in the US but there is more than sufficient infrastructure for supplying diesel. An increasing number of sold diesel-fueled cars and light trucks in the US could create additional demand in a tight supply. On the other hand, biodiesel is a more efficient fuel than ethanol and should be further pushed by the government. The US biodiesel production increased to 75 million gal in 2005 and 225 million gal in 2006.

AB  - Biodiesel production is expected to grow steadily in the future. In converting vegetable oils into biodiesel, approximately 10% (w/w) of glycerin is produced as a by-product. With the increasing production of biodiesel, there would be glut of glycerin in the world market; therefore, it is essential to find useful applications for this by-product. Glycerin is a potential feedstock for hydrogen production because one mole of glycerin can produce up to four moles of hydrogen. The objective of this study was to develop, test, and characterize promising catalysts for hydrogen production from steam reforming of glycerin. The following five catalysts were prepared on ceramic foam monoliths (92%) Al 2O 3, 8% SiO 2): rhodium-cerium, rhodium-cerium-platinum, ruthenium-yttrium, nickel, and iridium. The catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness technique. This article discusses selectivity data of the selected gases resulting from the glycerin steam reforming process. The study found that the rhodium-cerium-platinum catalyst was the most selective towards hydrogen under the experimental conditions investigated (700°C, 1 atm, and gas hourly specific velocity of 9.2 × 10 4 h -1). The glycerin conversion was 100%) with all the catalysts tested. © 2007 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Biodiesel wastes containing glycerol were utilized by Klebsiella pneumoniae DSM 2026 to produce hydrogen. The optimization of medium components was performed using both Plackett-Burman and uniform design methods. Using the Plackett-Burman design, glycerol, yeast extract, NH4Cl, KCl and CaCl2 were found to be the most important components, which were further investigated by uniform design and second-order polynomial stepwise regression analysis. The optimized medium containing 20.4 g·L-1 glycerol, 5.7 g·L-1 KCl, 13.8 g·L-1 NH4Cl, 1.5 g·L-1 CaCl2 and 3.0 g·L-1 yeast extract resulted in 5.0-fold increased level of hydrogen (57.6 mL/50 mL medium) production compared to initial level (11.6 mL/50 mL medium) after 24 h of fermentation The optimization of fermentation condition (pH, temperature and inoculum) was also conducted. When the strain grew in the optimized medium under optimal fermentation condition in a 5-L stirred tank bioreactor for batch production, hydrogen yield and production reached 0.53 mol/mol and 117.8 mmol/L, respectively. The maximum hydrogen evolution rate was 17.8 mmol/(L·h). Furthermore, 1,3-propanediol (6.7 g·L-1) was also obtained from the liquid medium as a by-product. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

AB  - The views of Charles R. Meyers, FMC Technologies, USA, on the challenges encountered in blending biofuels such as biodiesel, are presented. Suitable standardization processes and viscosity of renewable fuel blending are two of the significant factors that need to be considered, while blending biodiesel. The biodiesel fuel blendstock (B100) US Standard ASTM D 6751-2006 is one of the significant factors, which suggests that blending B100 with diesel fuel close to its upper limit can be effective in producing an oil-specific final product. Cloud point is another factor, which defines the temperature at which a cloud of mist comprising crystals appears in the fuel under prescribed conditions and needs to be considered to overcome the challenges associated with biodiesel blending. The author also suggests that the cloud point of B100 and its impact on the cloud flow properties of the resulting blend should be monitored in cold climates to overcome blending challenges.

AB  - The biomass-to-liquid (BTL) process can turn a wide range of agricultural materials into biofuels and boost the yield of a rapeseed field for biofuel uses. Estimates suggest that about 20% of future diesel production will be covered by BTL fuels. DaimlerChrysler (DC) is participating in the development of second generation fuels, which allow total crop utilization. These fuels offer a considerably higher CO2 reduction potential of up to 90%. These include SunDiesel, a BTL (biomass-to-liquid) fuel, which is produced via the Fischer-Tropsch process. DC is cooperating with Choren Industries and Volkswagen in developing SunDiesel and is operating several test vehicles with SunDiesel. BTL fuels are the most promising option for the future because of their high CO2 reduction potential and large quantity potential.

AB  - Process technology for the production of biomes is a solution for the reduction of fossil fuels in the US and France. In the US, about 20% of the 206 corn harvest has already been converted to biotechnology. The country has over 10 major plants for the conversion of corn to ethanol already in operation and another 50 planned to come on stream. In Europe, rapeseed cultivation for biocides production is being greatly extended. The demand for diesel fuel throughout Europe is estimated at about 170 million tonnes per year and by 2010, this quantity will have to contain a blending component of 5.75% biocides, which is produced by transmogrification of rapeseed oil with methanol. SunDiesel, a biomass-to-liquid (BTL) fuel, is a highpoint product and can be used without problems both neat and as a blending component.

AB  - The present paper concerns the ignition of single droplets of mixtures of rapeseed oil and fuel oil that was used as the biofuel. A special apparatus was built to measure fuel ignitability. On the basis of the measurements the ignition delay time of a droplet was determined as a function of temperature, biofuel composition and droplet size. The experimental results show that the biofuel composition as well as the ambient temperature in the experimental cylinder has a fundamental impact on the ignition phenomenon. Moreover, the results show that the droplet size is also of significance. The influence of the main factors on the delay time of ignition was given by an equation describing the ignition delay time as a function of temperature and the fuel oil fraction. © 2007 Energy Institute.

AB  - Methyl esters from crude sunflower oil were produced via methanolysis reaction using sodium hydroxide catalyst. Methanolysis was carried out at different agitation speeds (200-600 rpm), temperatures (25-60 °C), catalyst loadings (0.25-1.00% by weight of oil), and methanol:oil mole ratios (6:1-20:1). Mass-transfer limitation was effectively minimized at agitation speeds of 400-600 rpm with no apparent lag period. Lowering the temperature resulted in a fall in the rate of reaction prolonging the reaction time necessary to achieve maximum production of methyl ester. Using 0.50% hydroxide catalyst was found to be adequate, resulting in 97-98% conversion without compromising recovery due to soap formation. Increasing the methanol:oil mole ratio beyond the usual amount of 6:1 tended to speed up the initial rate of methanolysis and was found to lower the bonded glycerol content, especially the amount of diglyceride in the sample. Kinetic rate constants were derived from experimental results using second-order rate expressions, and values of activation energy for glyceride methanolysis have been established. © 2007 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - New Zealand is expected to announce a policy, which following the completion of the legislative process, will require local oil firms, e.g., BP, Gull, Mobil, Shell, and Caltex, to meet a biofuels sales obligation from 4/1/2008. The proposal is unique in that it does not specify limits on biodiesel or ethanol blends, as in other Asia-pacific nations. However, it is not as aggressive as the EU's 2010 target of 5.75%. The proposal calls for a 5-yr phase-in period starting in 2008 at 0.25% building ≤ 2.25% from 2011 onwards. Oil currently represents approximately a third of the nation's primary energy supply, but contributes to ∼ 50% of the CO2 emissions from combustion by fuel type. The biofuels sales obligation is designed to allow oil firms some flexibility; the proposed obligation levels reflect the amount of biofuel feedstock currently estimated to be available in New Zealand.

AB  - Throughout the Philippines, all grades of diesel fuels must be blended with a minimum of 1 vol % biodiesel come May 2007, when the Biofuels Act, which took effect in February, becomes mandatory for biodiesel. At 1% biodiesel blend, the country's biodiesel requirements would be equivalent to 62.9 million L. The country's largest producer of coconut methyl ester (CME), Chemrez Inc, has two plants with a total capacity of 75 million L/yr. In 2 yr's time, the nation's biodiesel requirements would likely double, when the minimum biodiesel blend goes ≤ 2%. The increase would depend on the availability of locally sourced biodiesel component to be determined by the newly created National Biofuels Board. Chemrez already announced plans to build a third plant, with a capacity to produce 180 million L/yr of CME.

AB  - Alternative fuels are becoming more prominent on the market today and, soon, fire debris analysts will start seeing them in liquid samples or in fire debris samples. Biodiesel fuel is one of the most common alternative fuels and is now readily available in many parts of the United States and around the world. This article introduces biodiesel to fire debris analysts. Biodiesel fuel is manufactured from vegetable oils and/or animal oils/fats. It is composed of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and is sold pure or as a blend with diesel fuel. When present in fire debris samples, it is recommended to extract the debris using passive headspace concentration on activated charcoal, possibly followed by a solvent extraction. The gas chromatographic analysis of the extract is first carried out with the same program as for regular ignitable liquid residues, and second with a program adapted to the analysis of FAMEs.

AB  - Biodiesel is a fuel generally consisting of a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) which is used in alternative or in combination with petroleum diesel for its environmental benefits. Biodiesel is conveniently manufactured from vegetable oils by transesterification of triglycerides with methanol. However, the process brings about the concurrent formation of glycerol, which may become an oversupplied chemical if biodiesel production keeps growing. A novel biodiesel-like material (abbreviated as DMC-BioD) was developed by reacting soybean oil with dimethyl carbonate (DMC), which avoided the co-production of glycerol. The main difference between DMC-BioD and biodiesel produced from vegetable oil and methanol (MeOH-biodiesel) was the presence of fatty acid glycerol carbonate monoesters (FAGCs) in addition to FAMEs. In the following study, details regarding synthesis and composition of DMC-BioD are provided along with physical properties relevant for its use as a fuel. In addition, the production of potential pyrogenic contaminants was investigated by analytical pyrolysis and compared with those from MeOH-biodiesel, and the model compounds tristearin, triolein, trilinolein and oleic acid glycerol carbonate ester (OAGC). The presence of FAGCs influenced both fuel and flow properties, while the distribution of main pyrogenic compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), was little affected. Benefits and drawbacks of DMC as a candidate transmethylating reagent for producing biofuel from renewable resources and alternative co-products (glycerol carbonate and glycerol dicarbonate) are discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Guaranteeing tax reductions and exemptions, the European governments intend to increase the share of biofuels in total EU fuel consumption to 5.75% by 2010. The financial support of this EU objective is frequently justified by expected positive environmental impacts, most notably the mitigation of climate change, and by favorable employment effects in the agricultural sector. This paper investigates the environmental and economic implications of the support of rapeseed-based biodiesel as a substitute for fossil diesel. Based on a survey of recent empirical studies, we find that the energy and greenhouse gas balances of this environmental strategy are clearly positive. Yet, it appears to be unclear whether the overall environmental balance is also positive. Most importantly, though, biodiesel is not a cost-efficient emission abatement strategy. Thus, for the abatement of greenhouse gases, we recommend more efficient alternatives based on both renewable and conventional technologies. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Prospective impact of biofuels produced from corn and other agricultural products on the agricultural equipment market in North America are discussed. It is expected that the need to cultivate more corn in North America to produce biofuels, will significantly influence the market for large tractors. Farm tractor sales in the US and Canada decreased by about 3% in 2006 as compared to 2005, despite growing significance of corn cultivation for producing biofuels. Agricultural equipment manufacturers are concerned that the sale of large tractors over 100 horse power (hp) and large four-wheel drive tractors also decreased by 13% and 15% during the same period. Combine sales of wheat and soybean crops also decreased by 6% in North America, with sales of 8000 units. It is also expected that increasing demand for biofuels will have minimum impact on oil imports and farm equipment sales in the region.

AB  - Impending legislation in Europe will provide incentives to blend a growing percentage of biofuels into all gasoline and diesel produced. This will have an impact on diesel and gasoline pools for most, if not all, refiners, most significantly impacting the gasoline pool. While bio-ethanol is a good octane source, its Reid vapor pressure (Rvp) is high and its oxygen content will displace any methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) currently used. Due to government mandates, refiners must consider all possible processing scenarios that could be applied when blending biofuels into the transportation fuels.

AB  - Energy efficiency is widely viewed as an important element of energy and environmental policy. Applying the TIMES model, this paper examines the impacts of additional efficiency improvement measures (as prescribed by the ACROPOLIS project) over the baseline, at the level of individual sectors level as well as in a combined implementation, on the German energy system in terms of energy savings, technological development, emissions and costs. Implementing efficiency measures in all sectors together, CO2 reduction is possible through substitution of conventional gas or oil boilers by condensing gas boilers especially in single family houses, shifting from petrol to diesel vehicles in private transport, increased use of electric vehicles, gas combined cycle power plants and CHP (combined heat and power production) etc. At a sectoral level, the residential sector offers double benefits of CO2 reduction and cost savings. In the transport sector, on the other hand, CO2 reduction is the most expensive, using bio-fuels and methanol to achieve the efficiency targets. An additional case is examined which assumes the CO2 emissions in the combined efficiency measures case as the target. This case concludes that, with different options, the same amount of CO2 reduction is possible together with cost reductions over the baseline, confirming that the specific sectoral efficiency targets prescribed by ACROPOLIS may not be the optimal one to mitigate CO2. It applies the same efficiency improvement targets in the residential and industrial sectors but scales down the target in the service sector and avoids any further efficiency improvement in the transport sector. It replaces electricity with heating fuel in final energy consumption, while further increasing the use of gas for power generation in 2030. In 2050, part of the electricity demand is met through the import of electricity from renewable sources. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The enzymatic production of biodiesel by methanolysis of cottonseed oil was studied using immobilized Candida antarctica lipase as catalyst in t-butanol solvent. Methyl ester production and triacylglycerol disappearance were followed by HPLC chromatography. It was found, using a batch system, that enzyme inhibition caused by undissolved methanol was eliminated by adding t-butanol to the reaction medium, which also gave a noticeable increase of reaction rate and ester yield. The effect of t-butanol, methanol concentration and temperature on this system was determined. A methanolysis yield of 97% was observed after 24 h at 50 °C with a reaction mixture containing 32.5% t-butanol, 13.5% methanol, 54% oil and 0.017 g enzyme (g oil)-1. With the same mixture, a 95% ester yield was obtained using a one step fixed bed continuous reactor with a flow rate of 9.6 ml h-1 (g enzyme)-1. Experiments with the continuous reactor over 500 h did not show any appreciable decrease in ester yields. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The immiscibility of canola oil in methanol provides a mass-transfer challenge in the early stages of the transesterification of canola oil in the production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME or biodiesel). To overcome or rather, exploit this situation, a two-phase membrane reactor was developed to produce FAME from canola oil and methanol. The transesterification of canola oil was performed via both acid- or base-catalysis. Runs were performed in the membrane reactor in semi-batch mode at 60, 65 and 70 °C and at different catalyst concentrations and feed flow rates. Increases in temperature, catalyst concentration and feedstock (methanol/oil) flow rate significantly increased the conversion of oil to biodiesel. The novel reactor enabled the separation of reaction products (FAME/glycerol in methanol) from the original canola oil feed. The two-phase membrane reactor was particularly useful in removing unreacted canola oil from the FAME product yielding high purity biodiesel and shifting the reaction equilibrium to the product side. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass based fuel technologies are rapidly developing and the barriers in implementing such technologies are being identified to achieve their widespread commercialisation. The two most common biofuels are biodiesel and bioethanol. About 500 million litres of ethanol is required in India itself for 10% blending to gasoline. Indian Planning Commission sees tremendous potential in Jatropha curcus and has supported through various government agencies nationwide programmes to cultivate using wastes/degraded lands. Biofuel policy might capitalise on the production of biofuels supporting rural economic development and sustainable agriculture. This paper discusses the economic and environmental aspects of Biofuel specially in Indian perspective. © 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Goal, Scope and Background. As part of an LCA study comparing an average Dutch passenger car running on petrol with a similar car running on bio-ethanol and comparing an average Dutch passenger car running on diesel with a similar car running on biodiesel, the question raised to get more insight into the allocations made in fossil fuel chains in existing databases such as ecoinvent. Both biofuel and fossil fuel chains contain various allocation situations that have been approached differently by various authors leading to differing and incomparable results. For biofuel chains, stakeholders had obtained insight into the allocations in earlier studies, but for the allocations made for the fossil chains, this was not the case. Therefore, one part of the study, which is reported in this paper, focused on a quick scan of different allocation scenarios for fossil fuels chains using the Swiss ecoinvent v1.1 database. Methods. The quick scan focused on three different allocation scenarios for fossil fuel chains: economic allocation, physical allocation and the ecoinvent default allocation. There appeared to be 54 multi-output (MO) processes linked to both the passenger car and the diesel system in the ecoinvent v1.1 database. Based on contribution analyses identifying which multi-output processes contribute most to one of the environmental impact categories of the characterisation, seven multi-output processes were selected that have been further analysed with the three allocation scenarios mentioned. Results. The results show that although at the process level allocation factors may differ significantly (up to almost 250), the total results only differ modestly (1-1.5), at least for the present case. Discussion. There is no general rule between these two. They depend on the scaling factor and the environmental impact related to the resource extractions and emissions of a particular multi-output process and its upstream processes in the total system analysed. Conclusions. The results of this quick scan are mainly intended for illustrating and learning purposes focusing on the possible influence of different allocation scenarios for fossil fuel chains. Bearing these limitations in mind, it can be concluded that different allocation methods can generate large differences in allocation factors and thus also at the level of environmental impacts allocated to the derived single-output processes. Nevertheless, the aggregated results for the present case only differ modestly. © 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).

AB  - Goal, Scope and Background. Combined heat and power (CHP) is a strategy aimed at reducing the impact of the energy sector on the climate by more efficient use of the energy content of the fuel. The implementation of CHP requires the utilisation of the heat produced. Space heating by means of district heating is one possible use for such heat. In countries such as Sweden, where district heating is already extensively used, many multiapartment buildings are connected to district heating. For increased use, the distribution systems will have to expand into suburbs with single family homes. However, the environmental impact and cost of the district heat distribution system increase when the pipe networks are extended into such areas. This is due to the production and installation of longer pipe networks and increased heat losses from the system. Attempts have been made to find new types of pipe constructions in order to lower the costs of connecting single family homes to district heating. These should be evaluated from an environmental perspective. The EPSPEX system is a distribution system intended for suburban areas. This system consists of cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) pipes in insulating blocks of expanded polystyrene (EPS). This paper presents a life cycle assessment of the EPSPEX district heat distribution system. In a second scenario, sub-stations were added. The results indicate areas that require improvement and provide a basis for comparison with other types of district heat distribution systems. Methods. Production, network construction and use of the district heat system were studied by means of life cycle methodology, employing specific data for the EPSPEX system and generic data for upstream impacts of the materials used. The system constructed in Vråen, Värnamo, Sweden, in 2002 was studied. The district heating used in Vråen is mainly based on biofuels. The functional unit was the use of one metre of an EPSPEX district heating system over a period of one year. The expected system life was 30 years. The results were characterised as global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential and the use of finite resources, as well as weighted by EPS 2000, ExternE and EcoIndicator 99. No external review was performed, but a reference group of district heating experts familiar with the practice has reviewed the study. Results. Heat losses are clearly the main environmental impact in all characterisations and weightings (71-92% of the total impact), despite the fact that the heat production studied was mainly based on biomass combustion, generally perceived to be environmentally friendly. Of the system components, the production of EPS insulation blocks had the largest environmental impact. Discussion. This impact, however, is compensated for by the fact that the need to produce less heat leads to a lower level of emissions. Several characterisation methods revealed that the production and combustion of diesel for excavating the pipe trench has a significant environmental impact. The jointing brass swaged coupling used for the PEX fluid pipes has a surprisingly high impact in terms of acidification and EPS 2000, considering the small amount of brass in the system. Conclusions. The life cycle environmental impact is dominated by the heat production needed to compensate for heat losses from the system, despite the fact that the EPSPEX system is relatively well insulated compared to a conventional district heating system. It is possible to shut down the heating circuit and only use the hot tap water circuit during the summer months; this reduces the heat losses and is an advantageous feature of the system. The second largest environmental impact of the EPSPEX system arises from the production of the EPS insulation blocks. A decrease in nitrogen oxide emissions, especially those caused by the excavation and filling of pipe trenches, would be beneficial. A rough comparison has been made with available literature data for conventional DN25 twin pipes. The results indicate that the environmental impact of the EPSPEX system is probably lower. However, the pipes are not identical, as the water delivery capacity of the conventional pipe is slightly lower. Recommendations and Perspectives. In Sweden, new types of pipes are being developed for district heating in suburban areas, and there is a need for an environmental comparison between such new alternatives and previous results for conventional polyurethane insulated steel pipes. This study reveals that biofuels, although perceived to be environmentally friendly, must be used with caution in order to ensure a satisfactory environmental performance. Heat loss from district heating should be minimized also when biofuels are used. The most immediate way to reduce such environmental impact is to increase the insulation. The environmental trade-off between lower heat losses achieved by the use of more insulation and the production of greater amounts of insulation material should be further studied. © 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).

AB  - The demand for oil palm-based biofuels is expected to increase rapidly in Malaysia over the next decade due to the country's extensive cultivation of oil palm. Plans are currently under development to promote the use of biomass-based fuels (i.e., bioethanol, biodiesel and straight vegetable oil) as a replacement for petroleum-derived fuels in the transport, industrial and power sectors. Predicting the exact amount of future biofuel demand is complicated by uncertainties in biofuel cost and availability, blending ratios, and consumer acceptance of a new fuel, which may require retrofitting of existing engines and fuel delivery systems. This paper examines the influence that vehicle modification cost and biofuel-blending ratio could have on consumer preference for either biomass- or petroleum-based fuels for the road transport sector. The analysis assumes that a consumer switches completely to a biofuel blend (including 100% biofuel) whenever the price of the blend plus an amortized technology modification cost is equivalent to the price of the petroleum alternative. This indifference price for biofuel, which is unique for a given technology and blending ratio, is calculated by estimating the technology modification cost for vegetable oil, biodiesel, and bioethanol for various vehicle types at different blending ratios. A biofuel demand curve is then constructed that shows the total quantity of biofuel demanded at different values of the pure biofuel price. At low blending ratios (5% for biodiesel and vegetable oil, and 10% for bioethanol) there are no modification costs and the indifference price is only slightly lower than the petroleum price due to the lower volumetric energy content of the biofuels. At higher blends, the indifference price drops significantly for vegetable oil and bioethanol, requiring a more substantial subsidy in order to increase available demand. For biodiesel, the indifference price remains high due to low modification costs for all blend ratios. © 2007 International Energy Initiative, Inc.

AB  - While Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) using coal and natural gas in conventional reactors is an almost well-established technology, the production of liquid hydrocarbons from syngas obtained from biomass is in its preliminary stages of commercialization in countries like Germany. With concerns about global warming and ways of disposing of CO2 being searched for, CO2 hydrogenation using FTS to liquid hydrocarbons can act as a CO2 sink. A brief review of FTS using CO2-rich syngas is given in this paper, looking at FTS as a technology that can help reduce global warming and as a process integration alternative. The reverse water gas shift (r-WGS) reaction is vital for CO2 hydrogenation. We have studied the effect of this using an FT kinetic model and have proposed a new flow sheet alternative for FTS using CO2-rich syngas. Simulations suggested that this new process gives better conversion of CO2. The product selectivity and yields from an FT plant are vital to make the process viable economically. © 2007 International Energy Initiative, Inc.

AB  - Thailand has established an ethanol program with a target of replacing all conventional gasoline with E10 gasohol (gasoline containing 10% by volume of ethanol) by 2012. This paper assesses the impacts of achieving the target on (1) land-use change, (2) trade balance, (3) gasoline and associated food crop self-sufficiency, and (4) GHG emissions. In addition, the abatement cost of replacing gasoline with gasohol (additional cost of supplying gasohol) and the tax revenue forgone in implementing the program are estimated. Finally, in order to obtain insights in relation to the prospects of the national program vs. project-based Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) for CO2 abatement, the ethanol program is compared with specific biofuel projects. We find that achieving the ethanol program target can lead to a significant improvement in the gasoline self-sufficiency rate (from 10 to 20%) and significantly reduce GHG emissions (corresponding to 2% of the total energy-related CO2 emissions in 2004) over the period of 2005-2012. The ethanol program can induce a significant (up to 200,000 ha in magnitude) transition from food crop production (mainly corn and rice) to cassava production for ethanol leading to a reduction in the self-sufficiency rates of associated food crops. But the crop self-sufficiency rates would still be above 100% and Thailand's agricultural sector should be able to accommodate the present program target. Whether and to what extent the program leads to an improvement in the trade balance depends substantially on fuel and agricultural prices, sources of cassava supply, and responses of refineries to decreased gasoline demand. The annual average gasoline substitution cost is estimated at 25-195 US$/tCO2e, which is high compared with the price of project-based certified emission reductions traded during 2006 but low compared with estimates of the cost of substituting biofuels for fossil fuels in Europe. The tax revenue forgone is estimated at 2-4 times the gasoline substitution cost. Thailand's ethanol program illustrates that under dynamic government support, it may not be possible to identify the additionality of CDM projects for biofuel production and blending with fossil fuels. Implementing national programs as the basis for carbon credits could avoid the issues of double-counting and also have other advantages. © 2007 International Energy Initiative, Inc.

AB  - Oil extracted from the inner husk of rice, termed rice bran oil (RBO), promises to be a low-cost, renewable substitute for petroleum-derived diesel as a compression ignition (CI) engine fuel. While rice is a major crop in India, RBO is underutilized. This research work concentrates on the study of the prospect of using unrefined RBO as a diesel engine fuel without any modifications. Like other vegetable oils, crude RBO faces the problem of high viscosity and hence blending RBO with diesel is attempted in this work. Tests were conducted in a naturally aspirated direct injection (DI) four-stroke 4.4 kW stationary diesel engine with pure RBO and blends of RBO with diesel. It is observed that specific energy consumption (SEC) of RBO is higher than that of all the fuels at all loads and for 25% RBO, it is very close to that of diesel. As an oxygenated fuel, RBO reduces emission of pollutants like CO and unburnt hydrocarbon (UBHC) by supplying additional oxygen from the fuel. At no-load condition the delay period for RBO and its blends were slightly higher than for diesel. As the load increased the delay periods were shorter than for diesel. The maximum heat release rates of RBO and its blends were lower than that of diesel. The peak pressures for RBO and its blends were slightly higher and occurred earlier than that of diesel. In general blended fuels result in lower viscosity, better combustion and lesser emission than RBO and 25% RBO shows better results than RBO and other blends of RBO. © 2007 International Energy Initiative, Inc.

AB  - The fears recently expressed by the Energy Commission of Nigeria that the sun will slowly but certainly set on the country's fossil-fuel-led economy coupled with the worldwide depletion of nonrenewable energy sources and its attendant negative environmental impact have resulted in the need to consider alternative renewable fuel sources from the country's abundant agricultural feedstock. One such crop is oil palm, from which palm kernel oil (PKO) is derived. Transesterification of PKO with ethanol to obtain PKO biodiesel was carried out using potassium hydroxide (KOH) catalyst. ASTM standard fuel tests performed on the PKO biodiesel gave promising results as alternative biodiesel fuel. Concentrations of catalysts have been widely reported as an important process parameter upon which biodiesel yield depends. Further in this work therefore, the effect of KOH concentration on PKO biodiesel yield is studied, with a view to identifying the catalyst concentration corresponding to optimal process yield. Three replicated transesterification experimental runs were carried out for each of the KOH concentrations 0.5%, 0.75%, 1.0%, 1.25%, 1.5%, 1.75% and 2.0% (by mass of PKO) under identical typical transesterification reaction conditions of 60°C temperature, 120 minutes duration and 20% ethanol (by mass of PKO). Results of the average PKO biodiesel yield for the respective catalyst concentrations are 90.5%, 95.0%, 95.8%, 85.2%, 73.3%, 71.1% and 71.3%. The KOH concentration 1.0% resulting in maximum PKO biodiesel yield (95.8%) is therefore recommended as optimum, within the constraint of the typical transesterification process parameters used. These findings, agreeing well with earlier works, will find useful applications in the energy sector of the Nigerian economy. © 2007 International Energy Initiative, Inc.

AB  - This paper describes two kinds of renewable energy: photovoltaic (PV) solar energy installations connected to the Italian electrical grid system, and pure biodiesel (BD100) production by using sunflower oil. A comparison between them is proposed on the basis of: (A) greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and (B) land requirement. Point (A) is related to the emissions from carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) deriving from energy production and use, which are calculated in terms of CO2 equivalent by their global warming potentials (GWP); point (B) is related to the area (hectares of biomass plantations and m of photovoltaic panels) necessary for energy production. The results will be compared to those resulting from the use of fossil fuels.

AB  - We assessed agricultural bioenergy pathways using existing and newly developed life cycle energy analyses so as to compare the potential of these pathways to replace fossil fuel in Canada. Energy gains after subtracting life cycle fossil energy inputs (Eg) and the ratio of fuel energy to life cycle fossil energy input (ER) were calculated. Results varied widely, reflecting differences in regional yields and study assumptions. Grasses and coppiced willow processed to electricity and heat exhibited Egs of 29-117 GJ ha-1 yr-1 and ERs of 4-17. These crops processed to lignocellulosic ethanol showed Egs of 22-114 GJ ha-1 yr-1 and ERs of 5-13. Grain ethanol and oilseed biodiesel showed Egs from -15 to 32 GJ ha-1 yr-1 and ERs from 0.8 to 3.7. Assuming 20% of Canada's cleared agricultural land could be dedicated to annual biofuel crops, grain ethanol or oilseed biodiesel could displace up to 10 or 50%, respectively, of national road gasoline or diesel demand. If instead 40% of cleared agricultural land could be dedicated to perennials, the feedstocks could displace up to 52% of road gasoline demand if processed to lignocellulosic ethanol or 100% of utilities' and industries' fossil fuel demand for electricity and steam production. Our analyses showed that a goal of fossil fuel displacement favors the production of perennial crops for electricity and heating.

AB  - To provide production of biodiesel fuel agriculture is required to grow "00" oilseed rape cultivars. In continuous process of the fuel production, grown oilseed rape seed should be regularly dried and properly stored. Drying rate and drying quality of the seed depends on physical conditions of the atmosphere when drying, physical and chemical properties of the material used, and the thickness of the layer through which water is diffused in the regime of drying. The study has been carried out on three "00" oilseed rape cultivars during three years period. Mathematical models of drying have been made to enable mutual comparison among the cultivars. Among the cultivars tested no significant differences were found regarding drying during one-year period. However, significant differences were found when comparison was made within the years of examination.

AB  - On-board emission measurements were performed on 49 light-duty gasoline vehicles in seven cities of China. Vehicle-specific power mode distribution and emission characteristics were analyzed based on the data collected. The results of our study show that there were significant differences in different types of roads. The emission factors and fuel consumption rates on arterial roads and residential roads were approximately 1.4-2 times those on freeways. The carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and nitrogen oxides emission factors of Euro II vehicles were on average 86.2, 88.2, and 64.5% lower than those of carburetor vehicles, respectively. The new vehicle emission standards implemented in China had played an important role in reducing individual vehicle emissions. More comprehensive measures need to be considered to reduce the total amount of emissions from vehicles. Copyright 2007 Air & Waste Management Association.

AB  - In the last decade a great number of studies have been carried out on the possible use of biofuels in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Among biofuels, biodiesel has gained considerable attention as the need to develop alternatives to traditional diesel fuel increases. The Italian parliament adopted directive 2003/30/CE from the European Parliament, in which the guidelines about future production and consumption of biofuels are reported: 1% and 2.5% of biofuels within 2005 and 2010 respectively. The aim of this work is to investigate the reduction in greenhouse gas emission obtained by using biodiesel in agricultural practises, and the role of renewable energy use at a local scale. Comparison between diesel and sunflower methyl ester was made from the point of view of an emission inventory, from production and combustion, by using different scientific tools, such as IPCC methodology and the Danish Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) EDIP Database. Results show that the use of sunflower methyl ester, other than the renewability of CO2 emitted, implies a general reduction of CO2 equivalent emissions of up to 57%. © 2007 WIT Press.

AB  - Dr. Dieter Zetsche, Chairman of DaimlerChrysler AG, have showcased the new generation of clean diesels, branded BLUETEC, at the Washington (DC) Auto Show, while encouraging US lawmakers to set regulations that support a diversity of approaches to reducing the country's dependence on foreign oil. He has introduced the 2007 Dodge Ram 2500 and 3500 with 6.7-liter Cummins turbodiesel engine offered with B5 and B20 biodiesel. This turbodiesel engine that will provide up to 30-percent improved fuel economy, meet 50-state, 2010 emissions standards, available after 2009. Zetsche has stressed that clean diesel technology is a viable solution to reducing dependence on oil and improving air quality. Zetsche has offered that the automotive companies should look to innovation, and to increasingly substituting petroleum products with biofuels.

AB  - Environmentally-conscious design of processes and products is increasingly viewed as an important strategy in the sustainable development of new refining and chemical processes. This paper discusses a new process technology developed by UOP and Eni S.p.A; the UOP/Eni Ecofining™ process to produce green diesel from vegetable oil. This novel process utilizes catalytic saturation, hydrodeoxygenation, decarboxylation and hydroisomerization reactions to produce an isoparaffin-rich diesel fuel from renewable feedstock containing triglycerides and fatty acids. The resultant biofuel product has a high cetane value, a lower gravity, good cold flow properties and excellent storage stability. Green diesel is completely compatible for blending with the standard mix of petroleum-derived diesel fuels, thus providing significant value to the refiner. The process for producing green diesel operates at mild operating conditions and integrates well within existing petroleum refineries. In contrast to fatty acid methyl esters, where fuel properties depend on feed origin and process configuration, green diesel product is independent of feed origin and the fully deoxygenated biofuel is readily blended with conventional diesel fuel. A life cycle assessment (LCA) of this promising new biofuel production technology has been undertaken to quantify the intrinsic benefits of green diesel production over the current practice of converting various forms of lipids to fatty acid methyl esters. This paper will describe the technology, discuss the results of the LCA study and summarize the advantages this new technology can offer over other processing routes.

AB  - This paper presents the results of an experimental study on the direct application of cottonseed oil-diesel blends as fuel for diesel engine vehicles without using additional retrofit mechanical systems. The use of biofuels is one of the main actions promoted by the European Union and member states in an effort to tackle global warming, enhance energy security and contribute to regional development. Here, the possibility to blend cottonseed oil directly with fossil diesel as a fuel for diesel engines is examined. This option has lower cost and larger well-to-wheel greenhouse gas benefits than fatty acid methylesters. The paper presents measurements of important fuel properties, density, viscosity, cetane number and cold flow characteristics. In addition, a common rail Euro 3 compliant diesel car is tested using 10% v/v cottonseed oil-diesel blends in order to examine the effects on performance and emissions of regulated pollutants and CO2. Furthermore, particle emission characteristics are studied, including total and solid particle number concentrations and particle size distributions over driving cycles and steady state modes. The results indicate that the test fuel presents good operating characteristics and limited effects on regulated emissions and vehicle performance. These results would justify further research on the direct use of vegetable oils as automotive fuels. © 2007 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

The superacids (heteropolyacids, HPA) viz; Dodeca- Tungstophosphoric acid [H3PO4 ·12 WO 3·xH2O] (TPA) and Dodeca-Molybdo phosphoric acid ammonium salt hydrate [H12Mo12N3- O 40P + aq] (DMAA) was used to increase the acidity and so the activity by loading on the most active support viz; clay (K-10). These HPA loaded on clay as a catalyst was used for the following study: effect of percent HPA loading on clay, effect of different vegetable oils, effect of different alcohols on the triglyceride conversion based on glycerol formation and selectivity based on alkyl esters formation. The data is compared at the best-optimized identical set of operating reaction conditions: 170°C, 170 rpm, catalyst loading: 5% (w/w of reaction mixture), molar ratio (oil : alcohol): 1:15 and time on stream of 8 h. The generated data is also evaluated based on the reported one. © 2007 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The use of biofuels has been given much attention by governments around the world, especially in increasingly energy-hungry OECD nations. Proponents have argued that they offer various advantages over hydrocarbon-based fuels, especially with respect to reducing dependence on OPEC-controlled oil, minimizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and ensuring financial and lifestyle continuity to farmers and agriculturally dependent communities. This paper adds to the continuing technical debate by addressing the issue from a holistic public policy perspective. In particular, it looks at the proposed benefits of biofuels, yet also addresses the implications of increased demand on the global and regional environment, in addition to the economic welfare of developing nations. Furthermore, it posits that short-term reliance on biofuels vis-à-vis other alternative energy sources may potentially inhibit the development and maturation of longer-term technologies that have greater potential to correct the harmful effects of fossil-fuel dependence. In light of this, the manifold policy instruments currently employed or proposed by governments in developed nations to promote biofuels emerge as questionable. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is often blended with regular U.S. No. 2 diesel. The blending level influences engine performance, emissions, and fuel cold-flow properties. In this article, ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectroscopy is presented as a reliable and affordable technology for blend level detection based on the absorbance patterns of the aromatic compounds in the proposed spectrum. Blends of biodiesel from six different feedstocks and U.S. No. 2 diesels from five different sources were used to test the robustness of the method. Since the absorbance of undiluted samples was too high to measure reliably, the samples were diluted with n-heptane. It was found that the feedstock and alcohol used (methyl or ethyl) did not make a significant difference in the absorbance of diluted biodiesel in the 245 to 305 nm range, while absorbance from 254 to 281 nm was correlated with blend level with R2 ≥ 0.99. It was also observed that if the absorbance of the diesel source was known, then a single wavelength could be used to detect the biodiesel blend level. However, a single wavelength was inadequate when the diesel source was unknown because of variation in the level of aromatics in diesel fuel. Absorbances at 265, 273, and 280 nm were used to calculate the absorbance index, which was found to be independent of the diesel fuel used. Using three wavelengths captured the shape information of the absorbance curve and eliminated the variation from the aromatics content. The root mean square error in determining blend level with this method was estimated to be 2.88%, and the R2 for the linear model was 0.99. The method worked well with biodiesel from the different feedstocks tested in this research and was independent of the diesel fuel used. © 2007 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - There is increased interest worldwide in renewable engine fuels as well as in new combustion technologies. Bioethanol is one of the alternative fuels that have been used successfully in spark ignition engines. A combustion technology that currently attracts a lot of interest is the homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion, which has shown potential for low nitrogen oxides emissions with no particulate matter formation. The authors have shown previously that applying forced induction to bioethanol HCCI with residual gas trapping results in an extended load range compared to naturally aspirated operation. However, at high boost pressures, high cylinder pressure rise rates develop. Work by other researchers has shown that direct injection of water can be used as a combustion control method. The present work explores water blending as a way that might have an effect on combustion in order to lower the maximum pressure rise rates and further improve emissions. The obtained experimental results show that in contrast to variable rate direct injection of water, fixed rate water-ethanol blending is counterproductive for the reduction of pressure rise rates at higher loads. In addition, increasing the water content in ethanol results in reduction of the effective load range and increased emissions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Crude soybean oil is one of the vegetable oils that have potential for use as fuel for diesel engines. Soybean oil is renewable, and is safe and easy to handle. At room temperature crude oil has a viscosity about ten times higher than that of diesel oil. To lower soybean oil's viscosity to the acceptable levels a heating temperature at least 60°C is needed or blending with diesel fuel. The objective of this study was evaluating the soybean oil and blends performance as a fuel for diesel engines. On both crude soybean oil and soybean oil blends were used pre-heating temperature levels on the range between 57°C and 68°C, before fuel pump. The performance of the fuel blends were evaluated in a single cylinder indirect injection diesel engine and compared with the performance with diesel fuel. Engine tests (short term) were conducted at a range speed from 1800 to 2800rpm under full load conditions on hydraulic absorption brake. The tests performed at 68°C showed always the best values of torque, power and specific fuel consumption that the tests at 57°C. The best experiment results were obtained with the blend containing 70% soybean oil and 30% diesel fuel, heated at 68°C.

AB  - The effects of biodiesel (rapeseed methyl ester, RME) and different diesel/RME blends on the diesel engine NOx emissions, smoke, fuel consumption, engine efficiency, cylinder pressure and net heat release rate are analysed and presented. The combustion of RME as pure fuel or blended with diesel in an unmodified engine results in advanced combustion, reduced ignition delay and increased heat release rate in the initial uncontrolled premixed combustion phase. The increased in-cylinder pressure and temperature lead to increased NOx emissions while the more advanced combustion assists in the reduction of smoke compared to pure diesel combustion. The lower calorific value of RME results in increased fuel consumption but the engine thermal efficiency is not affected significantly. When similar percentages (% by volume) of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) are used in the cases of diesel and RME, NOx emissions are reduced to similar values, but the smoke emissions are significantly lower in the case of RME. The retardation of the injection timing in the case of pure RME and 50/50 (by volume) blend with diesel results in further reduction of NOx at a cost of small increases of smoke and fuel consumption. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

An alkaline catalyzed alcoholysis process, to form fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from vegetable oils, is widely used to produce BDF. This process, however, requires high costs for refining the products and recovering the catalysts. In this study, a new reactor was developed to produce FAME by blowing superheated methanol gas continuously into oils without using any catalysts. Effects of reaction temperature, methanol feed flow rate, operating pressure, stirring rate, and initial oil volume on the reaction rate were investigated. The experiment showed that the maximum outflow rate of FAME was occurred at reaction temperature of 290°C, increased with methanol feed flow rate and initial oil volume, but decreased with operating pressure and stirring rate. As a result, effects of reaction conditions on reaction rate were quantitatively evaluated, and necessary information required to improve the reactor design were indicated. © 2007, Japan Society for Food Engineering.

AB  - Although challenges like global climate change and oil depletion will increasingly drive fuel selection, increasing bioenergy use is only one of many possible responses to these problems. Present biomass liquid fuels are almost all derived from food crops, but their potential for further expansion is limited. Any major expansion of biomass liquid fuels will require use of the more abundant cellulosic feedstocks, but as yet no process for conversion of cellulose to liquids is commercial, and future costs are uncertain. Further, transport is the most important application of biomass liquid fuels, but it is not clear what fuels transport will require in the long term. Given these uncertainties facing biomass liquid fuels, researchers must continue to explore diverse options. Copyright © 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Tibet, a region that lacks fossil energy resource, mainly depends on traditional biomass to meet its rising energy demand. Irrational use of traditional biomass affects the local environment as burning of straw and animal dung as fuel pollutes the air and destroys vegetation and ecological environment. The rich forest resources and hydropower resources in the south and east of Tibet, however, hold out the hope of biofuel utilization industrialization, an innovative solution to the Tibet energy issue. Renewable hydropower may be used for briquetting biomass fuel by forest residues, which has higher energy efficiency than traditional biomass and is easier to store and transport. In so doing, the energy demand of Tibet will be better met with least damage to the environment. It also means less reliance on outside supply of fossil fuel even after the opening of the Qinghai-Tibet railway. In addition, it means more job opportunities for local residents as people will be hired to collect forest residues and transport them to the plants. © Springer 2007.

AB  - The regulatory framework for fuels in Brazil is an effective monopoly, with matching prices for close substitutes. Biodiesel prices are unattractive because domestic diesel prices are below international relative oil prices, transportation logistics burden furthermore with unnecessary routes designed for fossil fuels, beyond heavy indirect taxation. An alternative framework, without taxation, for short distance supply, with a large variety of raw materials is better suited for technological innovation.

AB  - Transport makes a significant contribution to total harmful emissions. For long term solutions to reducing emissions, focus is on sustainable hydrogen and biofuels as alternatives to fossil fuels. In the transition era, natural gas (NG) and hydrogen reformed from NG are alternatives, used as fuel in ICEs. To research the effect of using blends of NG and hydrogen on emissions, Mobility Technology Research of HAN University (Arnhem, Netherlands) carried out the Clean Car project. This paper addresses the effect of gas composition and air-to-fuel ratio on performance and emissions of a small combustion engine. Copyright © 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - In our aim to decrease the consumption of materials and energy and promote the use of renewable resources, such as biofuels, rises the need to measure materials and energy fluxes. This paper suggests the use of Exergy Flow Analysis (ExFA) as an environmental assessment tool to account wastes and emissions, determine the exergetic efficiency, compare substitutes and other types of energy sources: all useful in defining environmental and economical policies for resource use. In order to illustrate how ExFA is used, it is applied to the process of biodiesel production. The results show that the production process has a low exergy loss (492 MJ). The exergy loss is reduced by using potassium hydroxide and sulphuric acid as process catalysts and it can be further minimised by improving the quality of the used cooking oil. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper describes an experimental study concerning the feasibility of using bio-oil namely turpentine obtained from the resin of pine tree. The emission and performance characteristics of a D.I. diesel engine were studied through dual fuel (DF) mode. Turpentine was inducted as a primary fuel through induction manifold and diesel was admitted into the engine through conventional fueling device as an igniter. The result showed that except volumetric efficiency, all other performance and emission parameters are better than those of diesel fuel with in 75% load. The toxic gases like CO, UBHC are slightly higher than that of the diesel baseline (DBL). Around 40-45% smoke reduction is obtained with DF mode. The pollutant Nox is found to be equal to that of DBL except at full load. This study has proved that approximately 75% diesel replacement with turpentine is possible by DF mode with little engine modification. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Regional and global air pollution from marine transportation is a growing concern. In discerning the sources of such pollution, researchers have become interested in tracking where along the total fuel life cycle these emissions occur. In addition, new efforts to introduce alternative fuels in marine vessels have raised questions about the energy use and environmental impacts of such fuels. To address these issues, this paper presents the Total Energy & Emissions Analysis for Marine Systems (TEAMS) model. TEAMS can be used to analyze total fuel life cycle emissions and energy use from marine vessels. TEAMS captures “well-to-hull” emissions, that is, emissions along the entire fuel pathway, including extraction, processing, distribution, and use in vessels. TEAMS conducts analyses for six fuel pathways: (1) petroleum to residual oil, (2) petroleum to conventional diesel, (3) petroleum to low-sulfur diesel, (4) natural gas to compressed natural gas, (5) natural gas to Fischer-Tropsch diesel, and (6) soybeans to biodiesel. TEAMS calculates total fuel-cycle emissions of three greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane) and five criteria pollutants (volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters of 10 μm or less, and sulfur oxides). TEAMS also calculates total energy consumption, fossil fuel consumption, and petroleum consumption associated with each of its six fuel cycles. TEAMS can be used to study emissions from a variety of user-defined vessels. This paper presents TEAMS and provides example modeling results for three case studies using alternative fuels: a passenger ferry, a tanker vessel, and a container ship. © 2007 Air & Waste Management Association.

AB  - General Motors has launched its Chevrolet Volt electric vehicle at the Detroit Motor Show in February, 2007. Volt is a part of a larger program to add flexibility to the powertrain for next-generation vehicles in the best-selling mid-range represented in Europe by Astra. The concept is called E-flex and it involves the electric power source mated with others to extend the range and overcome the problems related to Volt's antecedents in the EV1. E-flex is a form of electric vehicle propulsion system with a common drivetrain that is electrically driven with energy stored in the battery or as hydrogen. In E-flex, the drive to the wheels come from a generator that can be topped up by an IC engine burning petrol. diesel or biofuels such as E85 that works when the battery is depleted to just 30 per cent of its charge. The generator offers both range extension and recharging of the battery.

AB  - Presence of fully converted monoalkyl esters is the major requirement in quality biodiesel. Due to high associated costs with testing and widespread production of biodiesel not only in commercial scale but also in small scale, there is a high propensity of substandard biodiesel entering the market and being used in compression ignition engines. Due to this reason, it is important to understand how low grade biodiesel with a lower methyl ester conversion affects the parameters of quality standards and as a result, engine performance and durability. In this paper, the performance of fatty acid methyl esters with different proportions of unconverted triglycerides has been evaluated. The study has comprehensively evaluated the effect of unconverted triglycerides on flash point, water and sediment, kinematic viscosity, sulfur content, sulfated ash, copper strip corrosion, cetane number, cloud point, carbon residue, acid number, free glycerin, total glycerin, phosphorus content and distillation temperature. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Interest in producing ethanol from biomass in an attempt to make transportation ecologically sustainable continues to grow. In recent years, a large number of assessments have been conducted to assess the environmental merit of biofuels. Two detailed reviews present contrasting results: one is generally unfavourable, whilst the other is more favourable towards fuel bio-ethanol. However, most work that has been done so far, to assess the conversion of specific feedstocks to biofuels, specifically bio-ethanol, has not gone beyond energy and carbon assessments. This study draws on 47 published assessments that compare bio-ethanol systems to conventional fuel on a life cycle basis, or using life cycle assessment (LCA). A majority of these assessments focused on net energy and greenhouse gases, and despite differing assumptions and system boundaries, the following general lessons emerge: (i) make ethanol from sugar crops, in tropical countries, but approach expansion of agricultural land usage with extreme caution; (ii) consider hydrolysing and fermenting lignocellulosic residues to ethanol; and (iii) the LCA results on grasses as feedstock are insufficient to draw conclusions. It appears that technology choices in process residue handling and in fuel combustion are key, whilst site-specific environmental management tools should best handle biodiversity issues. Seven of the reviewed studies evaluated a wider range of environmental impacts, including resource depletion, global warming, ozone depletion, acidification, eutrophication, human and ecological health, smog formation, etc., but came up with divergent conclusions, possibly due to different approaches in scoping. These LCAs typically report that bio-ethanol results in reductions in resource use and global warming; however, impacts on acidification, human toxicity and ecological toxicity, occurring mainly during the growing and processing of biomass, were more often unfavourable than favourable. It is in this area that further work is needed.

AB  - The transesterification reactions of triolein with ethanol using various ion-exchange resin catalysts were conducted to produce ethyl oleate as a biodiesel. The anion-exchange resins exhibited much higher catalytic activities than the cation-exchange resin. The anion-exchange resin with a lower cross-linking density and a smaller particle size gave a high reaction rate as well as a high conversion. By combining the three-step regeneration method, the resin could be repeatedly used for the batch transesterification without any loss in the catalytic activity. A continuous transesterification reaction was carried out using an expanded bed reactor packed with the most active resin. The reactor system permitted the continuous production of ethyl oleate with a high conversion. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is usually produced from food-grade vegetable oils that are more expensive than diesel fuel. Therefore, biodiesel produced from food-grade vegetable oil is currently not economically feasible. Waste cooking oils, restaurant grease and animal fats are potential feedstocks for biodiesel. These inexpensive feedstocks represent one-third of the US total fats and oil production, but are currently devoted mostly to industrial uses and animal feed. The characteristics of feedstock are very important during the initial research and production stage. Free fatty acids and moisture reduce the efficiency of transesterification in converting these feedstocks into biodiesel. Hence, this study was conducted to determine the level of these contaminants in feedstock samples from a rendering plant. Levels of free fatty acids varied from 0.7% to 41.8%, and moisture from 0.01% to 55.38%. These wide ranges indicate that an efficient process for converting waste grease and animal fats must tolerate a wide range of feedstock properties. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of the project was to assess energy and greenhouse gas balances as well as greenhouse gas emission reduction costs for biomass-based fuels used in transportation and combined heat and power production (CHP) compared to selected reference fuels. New business opportunities were identified based on the results. Both commercial technologies and technologies under development were assessed. The most suitable large-scale technologies for Finnish conditions were selected for the evaluation. Technologies utilising field crops and forest biomass as raw materials were evaluated. The main options were barley-based ethanol, biodiesel (RME) from turnip rape, forest residue and reed canary grass-derived synthetic fuels, and forest residues and reed canary grass as a fuel for CHP production. The whole utilisation chain from fuel production to end-use was evaluated. The overall energy input per output ratio was less than one for all assessed transportation biofuel chains, which means that more energy was produced than consumed. This energy consumption per energy content of the fuels was, however, 3 to 5 fold compared to fossil fuel chains. Hence, the consumption of primary energy cannot be reduced by substituting fossil fuels by biofuels. Regardless, the consumption of petroleum based energy can be remarkably reduced as typically only minor part of energy consumed in biofuel production is based on crude oil. The results indicated that the production and use of barley-based ethanol or biodiesel from turnip rape does not necessarily reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but can on the contrary increase the greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil-based reference fuels, when the whole production and utilisation chain is considered. Use of fertilizers is significant compared to the energy content of the barley and turnip rape yield in Finland. Production and use of nitrogen fertilizers cause emissions of nitrous oxide, which may be very significant. The cultivation of uncultivated or set-aside lands to produce barley-based ethanol or biodiesel from turnip rape may increase the absolute emissions of greenhouse gases, regardless of the fact that fossil fuels are replaced by the produced fuels. Greenhouse gas emissions in absolute terms can be reduced by optimising cultivation chains producing currently surplus yield. The achievable emission reduction would, however, probably be larger by reducing surplus cultivation than producing ethanol or biodiesel. Utilisation of straw in energy production to substitute emission intensive fuels and measures to increase soil carbon balance and reduce nitrous oxide emissions could remarkably decrease greenhouse gas emissions of cereal crop chains. Second generation biofuels produced using forestry residues or reed canary grass as raw materials seem to be significantly more favourable in reducing greenhouse gases cost-effectively. It is possible to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 70-80% compared to fossil fuels when both production and utilisation chains are considered. The more favourable result is mainly due to significantly lower fertilization demand per energy content of particular raw materials compared to cereal crops. Production of transportation biofuels is currently 30-100% more expensive than production of fossil fuels. The emission reduction costs for the second generation biofuels under development were assessed to vary from 30 to 100 €/t CO2-eq with current crude oil price level. An increase in the crude oil price results in a strong decrease in emission reduction costs. However, mitigation of greenhouse gases in the energy sector can be implemented more cost-effectively than in transportation sector. Copyright © VTT 2006.

AB  - Unique experimental data on the high heat value of biofuels-soy and rapeseed oils and methyl esters of the latter-which are in good agreement with the data of domestic and foreign researchers confirm the results of calculations: high erucic oil and its derivatives have a higher energy potential than low erucic oil. These data allow determining the indicator and effective indexes of operation of diesel (multifuel) engines with a high degree of reliability.

AB  - This paper analyzes energy efficiency of the industrial corn-ethanol cycle. In particular, it critically evaluates earlier publications by DOE, USDA, and UC Berkeley Energy Resources Group. It is demonstrated that most of the current First Law net-energy models of the industrial corn-ethanol cycle are based on nonphysical assumptions and should be viewed with caution. In particular, these models do not (i) define the system boundaries, (ii) conserve mass, and (iii) conserve energy. The energy cost of producing and refining carbon fuels in real time, for example, corn and ethanol, is high relative to that of fossil fuels deposited and concentrated over geological time. Proper mass and energy balances of corn fields and ethanol refineries that account for the photosynthetic energy, part of the environment restoration work, and the coproduct energy have been formulated. These balances show that energetically production of ethanol from corn is 2-4 times less favorable than production of gasoline from petroleum. From thermodynamics it also follows that ecological damage wrought by industrial biofuel production must be severe. With the DDGS coproduct energy credit, 3.9 gallons of ethanol displace on average the energy in 1 gallon of gasoline. Without the DDGS energy credit, this average number is 6.2 gallons of ethanol. Equivalent CO2 emissions from corn ethanol are some 50% higher than those from gasoline, and become 100% higher if methane emissions from cows fed with DDGS are accounted for. From the mass balance of soil it follows that ethanol coproducts should be returned to the fields. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.

AB  - In the face of an increasingly uncertain future for energy, forecasts based on scenarios indicate that the use of non-conventional fuels will increase, but not enough to compensate for the growing demand for transportation fuels. Crude oil, as well as gas and coal, will therefore continue to play a significant role in the years to come. Reduction of greenhouse gases is a main driver for non-conventional fuels and the only short-term option available is the introduction of biofuels. First Generation Bio-fuels like bio-ethanol and esterified vegetable oils typically reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50%. Advanced Bio-fuels can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 90% and because these are made from waste biomass they offer increased overall availability. Shell invested in two Advanced Bio-fuels processes. In the IOGEN process Eco-ethanol® is produced from straw using enzymes. The combination of Choren gasification with Shell Fischer-Tropsch technology results in production of Biomass To Liquid Fuel, which combines the performance benefits of Gas To Liquid Fuel with a significant reduction in greenhouse gases. Woodchips are one possible feedstock for this process. Locally optimised solutions will lead to a range of non-conventional fuels that will become available in the next few years. These are likely to be deployed as blending components with conventional gasoline and diesel. Such a diversity of fuel options poses challenges to ensure ongoing compatibility between future fuels and engine technologies, but should increase the robustness of the transport fuel market to future energy supply uncertainties. To meet future environmental challenges, an important contribution to this future portfolio will be the integrated development of advanced fuels and powertrains.

AB  - The article presents results of research on the levels of emission of carbon monoxide (CO) in exhaust gases emitted by the S-4002 engine of an agricultural tractor depending on two variables: the horsepower Ne developed by the engine and the percentage of RME (rapeseed methyl ester) contained in the fuel mix with fuel oil. In this experiment six different mixtures of mineral oil and RME were used. They included 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% of RME, respectively. The differences of the levels of CO emissions produced by the S-4002 tractor-engine, at two different workload values (at maximum torque speed nMomax of 1600 r.p.m. and at maximum power output speed nNemax of 2000 r.p.m.) were examined. Following the multiple regression analysis using the method of backward elimination for the 120 measurements made during the research, two regression equations were obtained for the per cent ratio of CO (Ne, RME) in the emitted fuel gases, in relation to the horsepower Ne developed by the engine and the RME biofuel content in the mix. © 2006 Institute of Agrophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - In order to fulfil the targets set by the Kyoto protocol, Belgium established a series of regulations for renewable electricity and put in place a virtual market of green certificates. Their attribution is correlated to the reduction of fossil CO2 emissions. For biomass, emissions occurring during harvest have a significant impact. This paper proposes a model to estimate CO2 emissions during this step and applies it to the chipping of poplar forest residues in Southern Belgium. The factors entering into the CO2 ratio per MWh of biofuel are modelled according to the most influential characteristic of forest residues, i.e. mean initial diameter. The results show that if the diameter of the chipped material increased from 4 to 16 cm (factor 4), the CO2 emissions per MWh decreased by a factor 7. This stresses the value of modelling the emissions in order to identify the most critical supply routes for attribution and valuation of the green certificates. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There are significant opportunities for expansion of a forest bioenergy industry in Australia based on distributed electricity generation and production of liquid fuels (ethanol and bio-oil). If the large amounts of forest residues already available annually could be utilized, this would deliver useful greenhouse benefits, assist regeneration of new forests that have increased environmental values, and benefit silvicultural management. Creation of new forests in low rainfall environments for both environmental and commercial reasons will also provide residues in the future that could be used for energy production, thus enhancing overall viability of such ventures. Currently, there are several serious impediments to realising the potential. These include:•Large reserves of accessible coal, and low cost of electricity generated in coal-fired power plants.•Uncertain greenhouse and renewable energy policy (specifically that relating to implementation of the Mandated Renewable Energy Target (MRET)).•Lack of proven efficient small-scale technology to enable distributed electricity generation that would reduce transportation costs for delivery of biofuels.•Controversy over the sustainable use of native forest residues for renewable energy generation.•Lack of markets for environmental credits (carbon, salinity, biodiversity).•Lack of efficient processes for producing ethanol from wood, inadequate commercial products from lignin, and the need for further development before diesel engines can be run on bio-oil for stationary power generation and transport. In Australia, apart from the use of firewood for domestic heating, forest bioenergy has developed only to a very limited extent, despite the existence of significant opportunities. A major impediment to expansion is lack of public acceptance and support, especially for the use of native forest residues which are the main available biomass source. A concerted effort at several levels is needed to address this issue. © 2006.

AB  - Lipase-catalyzed alcoholysis of soybean oil deodorizer distillate (SODD) for biodiesel production was studied. During this system both free fatty acids and glycerides could be converted to biodiesel simultaneously. tert-Butanol has been adopted as the reaction medium, in which both the negative effects caused by excessive methanol and by-product glycerol could be eliminated completely. There was no obvious loss in lipase activity even after being repeatedly used for 120 cycles. Fine-pored silica gel and 3 Å molecular were found to be effective to control by-product water concentration and much higher biodiesel yield could be achieved with those adsorbents present in the reaction system. The highest biodiesel yield of 97% could be achieved with 3 Å molecular sieve as the adsorbent. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this publication is to give a comprehensive overview of the opportunities for and barriers to bioenergy development in Europe. The study carried out within the Bioenergy Network of Excellence "Overcoming Barriers to Bioenergy" (Bioenergy NoE) covers EU policy issues and their implementation in Europe, biomass availability and technology development aspects, and RTD goals to overcome the barriers to bioenergy development. Important European targets have been set for 2010, such as the White Paper targets of doubling the share of renewables to 12%, and tripling the use of biomass to 135 Mtoe (5.7 EJ) compared to 1997, the RES-E Directive target of a 21% share of green electricity, and the Biofuels Directive target of 5.75% of transport fuels to be supplied with biofuels. Recently, a Biomass Action Plan was launched. Further, a biofuels target of 20% substitution by 2020 has been proposed, and the maximum of 35% for the share of MSW to be landfilled has been set for the year 2016. EU policies and regulations are important drivers for bioenergy development in the EU countries. In Europe, the use of biomass and wastes is presently about 2.9 EJ/a (69 Mtoe). By 2050, it is estimated that biomass and waste utilisation could rise to anywhere from 9.0 to 13.5 EJ/a (215-320 Mtoe). According to the Biomass Action Plan the measures could lead to the use of about 150 Mtoe (6.3 EJ) in 2010 or soon after. There are sufficient domestic resources to meet the EU targets set for the year 2010 but if more stringent goals are set for bioenergy in the future, it will be challenging to find sufficient resources in Europe and biomass imports from outside the EU will be necessary. The barrier analysis carried out within the Bioenergy NoE resulted in a wide variety of non-technical and technical barriers. Overall, non-technical barriers dominate, with economic barriers being the most prominent. However, there is no single barrier that appears as the most important; it is the interaction of many barriers that impedes the rapid expansion of bioenergy use. Even omitting the economic barriers and biomass availability constraints technical barriers are critical in introducing novel production and utilization technology. Barriers defined for feedstock production, heat and power technologies, liquid biofuels technology, and waste to energy areas are presented. R&D work is suggested to overcome a wide variety of technical barriers related to individual process steps within production and utilization schemes. The potential for significant biomass utilisation in Europe is influenced by EU and national policies and regulations, emissions trading, availability of biomass and the logistics of feedstock supply, the development of technologies, and economic and social issues. The CAP reform in 2003 substantially influences bioenergy development. A prerequisite for rapid implementation of new bioenergy solutions in the European market is the application of existing infrastructures in the conventional biomass production and energy sectors. Within the Bioenergy NoE, there is agreement that a considerable increase in the use of bioenergy cannot take place without industry support. Therefore the intended increase in the use of biomass can only be realised through new business opportunities. Integration of capacities in bioenergy R&D is needed to reach the EU White Paper goals. New technologies and business concepts are needed, and Bioenergy NoE has to respond to the demands of the European Commission and industry. Integrating bioenergy production with forest industry, electricity and heat, waste recycling, liquid biofuel production and/or chemical industry improves competitiveness. Biorefineries and polygeneration of multiple products are widely seen as an important approach to efficiently utilise limited raw material resources. Copyright © VTT 2006.

AB  - Cetane number (CN) is one of the most significant properties to specify the ignition quality of any fuel for internal combustion engines. The CN of biodiesel varies widely in the range of 48-67 depending upon various parameters including the oil processing technology and climatic conditions where the feedstock (vegetable oil) is collected. Determination of the CN of a fuel by an experimental procedure is a tedious job for the upcoming biodiesel production industry. The fatty acid composition of base oil predominantly affects the CN of the biodiesel produced from it. This paper discusses the currently available CN estimation techniques and the necessity of accurate prediction of CN of biodiesel. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models are developed to predict the CN of any biodiesel. The present paper deals with the application of multi-layer feed forward, radial base, generalized regression and recurrent network models for the prediction of CN. The fatty acid compositions of biodiesel and the experimental CNs are used to train the networks. The parameters that affect the development of the model are also discussed. ANN predicted CNs are found to be in agreement with the experimental CNs. Hence, the ANN models developed can be used reliably for the prediction of CN of biodiesel. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work is focused on the measurement and analysis of the smoke opacity resulting from a Diesel engine fuelled with conventional fuel and biofuels under transient conditions. Methyl esters obtained from used cooking and unused vegetable oils were tested as diesel fuels, pure and blended with 30% and 70% of a commercial diesel fuel which was also used pure. A commercial engine was mounted in a test bench prepared for operating in different transient conditions. A smoke meter AVL 439 allowed for the study of the effect of these fuels on the smoke opacity under varied operating conditions. The thermo chemical properties of the test fuels and the engine parameters, such as fuel/air ratio or exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) ratio, were used for the analysis and interpretation of the results. The engine transient processes studied were (a) engine start, (b) load increase at constant engine speed and (c) engine speed decrease at constant torque. These results suggested that the use of the diesel blends containing vegetable esters is an interesting alternative for a significant reduction in smoke opacity not only in steady conditions but also in transient engine operation, the latter being the most usual condition in passenger vehicles. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The obtained heats of combustion were 46.65 ± 0.20; 38.09 ± 0.31; 39.67 ± 0.22; 41.88 ± 0.31; 37.86 ± 0.46; 39.89 ± 0.09; 41.28 ± 0.31 MJ/kg for diesel, transesterified soybean oil, pyrolysed soybean oil and crude soybean oil, transesterified palm tree oil (Elaeis sp.), pyrolysed palm tree oil, crude palm tree oil, respectively. The results show the heats of combustion of biofuels are approximately 17% smaller than traditional diesel. The data also show the heats of combustion depend on the methodology used for the biofuel production. Addition of biofuels to traditional diesel fuel results in a linear decrease of the heat of combustion with the amount of the alternative fuel added to the diesel. However, for blends with 5% biofuels, which is the limit demanded by Brazilian legislation, no significant decrease of the heat of combustion of the commercial diesel was observed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work gives an overview of traditional and alternative applications of Cynara cardunculus L. The traditional applications are the use of the blanched stalks as an edible vegetable and the use of the flowers as a rennet substitute to make cheese. Alternatively, C. cardunculus can be cultivated as an energy crop and be used for industrial purposes. As an energy crop it is grown using a perennial cultivation system especially developed for producing biomass. The valuable crop produced in this case is the whole aboveground biomass. Two types of products can be harvested: lignocellulosic biomass and oil seeds. Cynara lignocellulosic biomass is a solid biofuel that can be used directly for heating or for electric power generation. The seeds, due to their high oil content, can also be used for energy applications, for example, as raw materials for biodiesel production. In addition to the energy applications of the crop, other alternative applications, such as green forage for ruminants, paper pulp production and pharmacological active compounds extraction, are also discussed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fatty acid alkyl esters, especially FAME, are the most commonly used liquid biofuel. Because biofuels are expected to be important alternative renewable energy sources in the near future, more studies on their stability against oxidation need to be addressed. Biofuel derived from vegetable oils is well researched, currently with more attention focused on the reuse of waste oil sources than on pure vegetable oil for such production. A method to convert used palm oil, i.e., used frying oil, and residual oil of spent bleaching earths (SPE) to their respective methyl esters has been established by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. These methyl esters can be used as diesel substitute. However, the methyl esters obtained from used frying oil have a low induction period (3.42 h). In Europe, any methyl esters must have an induction period of at least 6 h in Rancimat stability to be usable as biodiesel, as required by European Biodiesel Standard (EN 14214). To meet this requirement, the used frying oil methyl esters (UFOME) obtained can be treated with different types of antioxidants, either synthetic or natural, at different treatment levels, such as vitamin E, 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole (BHA), 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl- phenol (BHT), 2,5-di-terf-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ), and n-propyl gallate (PG), to investigate their oxidative stability and storage behavior. The order of increasing antioxidant effectiveness with respect to the oxidative stability of UFOME is: vitamin E < BHT < TBHQ < BHA < PG. Because methyl esters derived from residual oil of SBE have an induction period of 14.6 h, their treatment with antioxidants is unnecessary. Copyright © 2006 by AOCS Press.

AB  - The production of methyl esters (biodiesel) from free fatty acids (FFAs) contained in vegetable oils was studied using a heterogeneous acid catalyst. The feedstock was a by-product of a vegetable oil refinery. The experiments were performed in a batch reactor, in a temperature range of 363.15-393.15 K, with an initial molar ratio of methanol to FFAs of 6.6/1, while the catalyst mass was fixed at 2 wt % of the total vegetable oil mass. A technical kinetic model has been developed which accounts for the reversible esterification reaction. Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting experimental data to the model. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - It is estimated that the combustion of biofuel generates 20% of all carbonaceous aerosols, yet these particles are studied less than those of other common sources. We designed and built a portable battery-operated emission-sampling cart to measure the real-time optical properties and other emission characteristics of biofuel cookstoves. In a field study in Honduras, we measured emission factors averaging 8.5 g/kg, higher than those found in previous laboratory studies. Strong flaming events emitted very dark particles with the optical properties of black particles. The elemental carbon to total carbon ratios ranged from 0.07 to 0.64, confirming that high elemental carbon fractions can be emitted from biofuel combustion and may not be used to distinguish fossil-fuel from biofuel sources when cooking is the dominant usage. Absorption Ångström exponents, representing the dependence of absorption on wavelength, ranged from 1 (black) to 5 (yellow). Strongly absorbing particles with absorption inversely dependent on wavelength were emitted separately from particles with weak absorption and strong wavelength dependence; the latter probably contained conjugated aromatic compounds. Because combustion occurs in distinct phases, different types of carbonaceous aerosols from biofuel combustion are externally mixed at emission and may have different atmospheric fates. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A silica get-based prolonged-release system for methanol was applied in biodiesel production catalyzed by lipase LipB68, instead of the traditional method of three-step addition of methanol. With the application of the prolonged-release system, the recycle times of the catalyst increased substantially from one-off usage to at least six cycles with no detectable decrease in activity, and the yield of biodiesel (94%) remained at a higher level compared with the yield of 92% with the previous method. The results showed the potential of this methanol addition method with little harm to the catalyst. © 2006 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Regulated emissions of biodiesel blends are reasonably well documented in several works, non-regulated emissions, on the contrary, lack research. In this work, mono- and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs and PAHs, respectively) emission tests were performed with a heavy-duty diesel engine, fueled with pure diesel (D) and biodiesel blends (v/v) of 2% (B2), 5% (B5) and 20% (B20%). The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the biodiesel addition on the emission profile of MAHs and PAHs. The tests were conducted using a six cylinder heavy-duty engine, typical of the Brazilian fleet of urban buses, in a steady-state condition under 1500 rpm. The PAHs were sampled with Teflon filters and XAD-2 cartridges and were identified by gaseous chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC/MS) and quantified by flame ionization detection (GC/FID). The MAHs were sampled with active charcoal cartridges and analyzed by GC/FID. Both MAHs and PAHs filters and cartridges were extracted with dichloromethane in an ultrasonic bath. Ten PAHs and eight MAHs were identified and the average reduction of MAHs was 4.2% (B5), 8.2% (B5), and 21.1% (B20). The average reduction for PAHs was 2.7% (B2), 6.3% (B5), and 17.2% (B20). However, some PAHs and MAHs emissions increased because of/due to the biodiesel blends like phenanthrene, ethyl benzene, and trimethyl benzenes. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is environmentally enticing to consider replacing or blending petroleum derived heating fuels with biofuels for many reasons. Major considerations include the soaring worldwide price of petroleum products, especially home heating oil, the toxicity of the petroleum-derived fuels and the environmental damage that leaking petroleum tanks afford. For these reasons, it has been suggested that domestic renewable energy sources be considered as replacements, or at the least, as blending stocks for home heating fuels. If recycled soy restaurant cooking oils could be employed for this purpose, this would represent an environmental advantage. Renewable plant sources of energy tend to be less toxic than their petroleum counterparts. This is an important consideration when tank leakage occurs. Home fuel oil storage tanks practically always contain some bottom water. This water environment has a pH value that factors into heating fuel stability. Therefore, the question is: would the biofuel help or exacerbate fuel stability and furnace maintenance issues? Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We present detailed high-resolution emission inventories of black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) from China in the year 2000. The latest fuel consumption data, including fossil and biomass fuels and socio-economic statistics were obtained from government agencies, mostly at the county level. Some new emission factors (EFs) from local measurements also were used. National and regional summaries of emissions are presented, and gridded emissions at 0.2°×0.2° resolution are shown. Our calculated emissions were 1500 Gg for BC and 4100 Gg for OC, mainly due to the burning of coal and biofuels. The carbonaceous aerosol emissions estimated here are higher than those in previous studies, mainly because coal burning by rural industries and residences were previously underestimated. More carbonaceous aerosols are emitted from eastern China than western China. A strong seasonal dependence is observed for emissions, with peaks in May and October and low emissions in April and July; this seasonality is mainly due to patterns in residential heating and agriculture waste open burning. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The substitution of fossil fuels with biofuels has been proposed in the European Union (EU) as part of a strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from road transport, increase security of energy supply and support development of rural communities. In this paper, we focus on one of these purported benefits, the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The costs of subsidising the price difference between European bioethanol and petrol, and biodiesel and diesel, per tonne of CO2 emissions saved are estimated. Without including the benefits from increased security of energy supply and employment generation in rural areas, the current costs of implementing European domestic biofuel targets are high compared with other available CO2 mitigation strategies. The policy instrument of foregoing some or all of the excise duty and other taxes now applicable to transport fuels in EU15 on domestically produced biofuels, as well as the potential to import low-cost alternatives, for example, from Brazil, are addressed in this context. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To assess which biofuels have the better potential for the short-term or the longer term (2030), and what developments are necessary to improve the performance of biofuels, the production of four promising biofuels-methanol, ethanol, hydrogen, and synthetic diesel-is systematically analysed. This present paper summarises, normalises and compares earlier reported work. First, the key technologies for the production of these fuels, such as gasification, gas processing, synthesis, hydrolysis, and fermentation, and their improvement options are studied and modelled. Then, the production facility's technological and economic performance is analysed, applying variations in technology and scale. Finally, likely biofuels chains (including distribution to cars, and end-use) are compared on an equal economic basis, such as costs per kilometre driven. Production costs of these fuels range 16-22 €/GJHHV now, down to 9-13 €/GJHHV in future (2030). This performance assumes both certain technological developments as well as the availability of biomass at 3 €/GJHHV. The feedstock costs strongly influence the resulting biofuel costs by 2-3 €/GJfuel for each €/GJHHV feedstock difference. In biomass producing regions such as Latin America or the former USSR, the four fuels could be produced at 7-11 €/GJHHV compared to diesel and gasoline costs of 7 and 8 €/GJ (excluding distribution, excise and VAT; at crude oil prices of ∼35 €/bbl or 5.7 €/GJ). The uncertainties in the biofuels production costs of the four selected biofuels are 15-30%. When applied in cars, biofuels have driving costs in ICEVs of about 0.18-0.24 €/km now (fuel excise duty and VAT excluded) and may be about 0.18 in future. The cars' contribution to these costs is much larger than the fuels' contribution. Large-scale gasification, thorough gas cleaning, and micro-biological processes for hydrolysis and fermentation are key major fields for RD&amp;D efforts, next to consistent market development and larger scale deployment of those technologies. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The seeds of Jatropha curcas L. were collected from 6 different locations in Southwest China and their biological characteristics were studied. The physicochemical characteristics and fatty acid composition of the seed oil were also analyzed. The results showed that the hundred-seed-weight ranged from 41.80 g to 71.39 g, the kernel weight of seed from 60.02% to 81.43%, the oil content from 51.76% to 57.93% in kernel and from 31.07% to 47.17% in whole seed, and the total unsaturated fatty acid from 74.89% to 79.68% of all seed samples. The seed produced from Yongsheng was found the best, and its kernel weight was 81.43%, with oil from kernel 57.93% and oil from whole seed 47.17%, and total unsaturated fatty acid 79.68%. The seeds from Panzhihua and Ningnan were also good. Among all the seed samples (acid value ranged from 0.81 to 9.46), the acid value of the seeds from Shuangbai and Luodian was the lowest, that was, 0.81. Variance analysis was done for the data of the seed and oil of J. curcas. The results indicated that there were differences in the biological characteristics of J. curcas seeds, and the physicochemical characteristics and fatty acid composition of its seed oil in different locations.

AB  - In biodiesel production, sodium methoxide or potassium methoxide is employed as a base catalyst. Lurgi, the global leader in the biodiesel technology market, has a sodium methylate catalyst in its process. Petrobras has developed a process in its refineries for making a diesel fuel through the catalytic hydrogenation of a vegetable and mineral oil mixture. With the help of its H-Bio fuel, Petrobras is tripling its output of biodiesel to 600 million L/yr, which it expects will give it close to a third of an estimated total domestic market of 2.5 billion L by 2012. BP aims to use hydrogenation technology with conventional catalysts at its Bulwer Island refinery in Australia to produce 2 billion L/yr of diesel by 2008, which will contain 5% (or 110 million ton) of biodiesel made from tallow. The company also plans to produce 80 million ton/yr of ethanol and to blend and distribute another 20 million ton. Some biofuel catalysts are similar to those used in coal-to-liquid and gas-to-liquid systems based on the Fischer-Tropsch process, which uses mainly iron, cobalt or ruthenium catalysts.

AB  - On 8 February 2006, the European Commission (EU) adopted the "European Union (EU) Strategy for Biofuels" that relies on a range of potential market-based, legislative and research measures to boost production from agricultural raw materials. In this strategy document, the implications of different options for cereals, sugar, and oilseed markets up to 2010 were assessed. Option 1 assumed that biofuel production would remain limited to 2004 production capacities having very little impact on feedstock prices and land use. Options 2 and 3 assumed that until 2010 the main biofuel feedstocks would remain cereals, sugar beet or sugar cane and oilseeds including vegetable oils.

AB  - Biofuels are available as an alternative to petroleum and can reduce the dependence of the US on foreign oil. Biofules are blends of fossil fuels and agriculturally derived oils. Corn-based ethanol has been stretching gasoline supplies while used cooking oil or soybean oil is being mixed with diesel fuel, significantly reducing the emissions depending on the biofuel mix. New York state has begun offering a $.20/gal tax credit for biofuel heating oil, and homeowners are switching to B20 (blend of soybean oil and fuel oil). Other states are considering of boosting biofuels for heating, which will have the greatest impact in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states where fuel oil for space heating is common. B20 is generally the highest blend recommended currently, because it works fine in $# fuel oil boilers and has the same heat content.

AB  - Biomass is an interesting starting material for transportation fuels because of its renewable nature. The main constituents of biomass are the carbohydrate polymers cellulose and hemi-cellulose, and lignin. Current transportation fuels are mixtures of mainly hydrocarbons derived from crude oil. Biomass derived biofuels are preferably used as blends with fossil fuels to avoid the need for adaptations in the existing car fleet. The total blend then needs to meet the set fuel specifications for fossil fuels. The conversion of biomass to biofuels therefore centres on the removal of oxygen from carbohydrates to obtain hydrocarbons. Oxygen is preferably eliminated in the form of CO2 or H2O, because the heat of combustion of these molecules is zero and all energy is concentrated in the remaining products. Based on gross chemical formulae, the conversion options from biomass to biofuels have been investigated, and interesting intermediates have been identified. Conversion routes from carbohydrates to hydrocarbons tend to proceed via C1-intermediates (CO, CH4 and carbon). Gasification and subsequent Fischer Tropsch synthesis seems the logical processing route to obtain hydrocarbons from biomass via these intermediates. If oxygen containing products are allowed, conversion can proceed via larger intermediates. For blending with gasoline, ethanol emerges as an interesting component. Longer carbon chain molecules are required for diesel. These can only be obtained by at least two process steps, involving the combination of carbon chains (e.g. by etherification or esterification), and reduction of polarity (by hydrogenation or oligomerisation). The lignin present in biomass has a complex, highly cross-linked structure, and can probably best be converted to syngas via gasification or applied directly as solid fuel. © 2006 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Biodiesel is a clean renewable fuel with many environmental advantages. One of the most important is its good biodegradability and ability to dissolve crude oil and its derivatives. In this paper, we used the CO2 evolution test to study the biodegradability of biodiesel and its mixtures with fossil diesel fuel and gasoline. The biodegradability of biodiesel was higher than 98% after 28 days, while for diesel fuel and gasoline it was 50% and 56%, respectively. In all the cases, biodegradability increased with the addition of biodiesel. To evaluate the synergic effect, the experimental results for the mixtures were compared with a linear combination of the biodegradability values for the pure compounds. The synergic effect was positive in all the cases, demonstrating that biodiesel enhances the biodegradability of both diesel fuel and gasoline by means of cometabolism. The density and viscosity of the mixtures were also evaluated to determine the possibility of collecting them from an affected area. Although both properties increased with the addition of biodiesel, in all the cases the density was lower than that of water and the viscosity was low enough to allow pumpability. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bio-oil derived via slow pyrolysis process of two indigenous Australian tree species, red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) from the basin of Murray, Victoria, and blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) wood from the region of Mount Gambier, South Australia was blended with ethanol and burned in a circular jet spray at atmospheric pressure. Bio-oil flames were shorter, wider and brighter than diesel fuel flames at the same conditions. Adding of flammable polar additives (e.g. ethanol) to bio-oil improved some of the undesired properties of the fuel such as poor atomisation, low calorific value, and high NOx emission from the flame. Nevertheless, adding of ethanol should be carried out with caution since it leads to a reduction of the heat flux from the flame. Changing the concentration of flammable polar additives in bio-oil can be an optimising factor in achieving the proper balance between the best spray formation and the maximal heat flux from the flame. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The growth aspects of Biofuels Corporation in the UK are discussed. Vegetable oil is shipped in and processed to produce the biodiesel, which is shipped out to refineries to be blended in as a 5% additive to conventional diesel. The plant uses transesterification, where the vegetable oil is mixed with methanol and a catalyst to produce methyl esters, the main component of biodiesel, and glycerine. The glycerine is separated out and refined to a grade suitable for food and pharmaceutical use. The plant uses fairly standard chemical processing technology involving separator vessels, reactor units, distillation columns, pumps, filters, and heat exchangers. The technology has additional flexibility to allow the use of different feedstocks, which enables the company to meet the requirements of its customers. The plant is producing biodiesel at 30 tons an hour in an environment friendly way.

AB  - Castor oil is a non-traditional raw material for the preparation of methyl and ethyl esters of higher fatty acids as alternative fuels for diesel engines. Castor oil contains ricinoleic acid (12-hydroxy octadecene acid) with a major share of about 90%. The article presents the parameters of castor oil-based methyl esters (COME) and ethyl esters (COEE) defined by the standard EN 14 214. The densities of COME and COEE are higher than the limit defined by the standard EN 14 214. The viscosities are more than twice as high as the limit value. The cetane numbers are lower than defined by the standard EN 14 214. For the remaining parameters, COME and COEE meet, in principle, the standard EN 14 214. The presence of the free hydroxyl group has virtually no effect on the values of such parameters as carbon residue, filterability at low temperatures and oxidation stability, for which some influence was expected. The physicochemical parameters of the castor oil esters are discussed in comparison to the analogous esters of high-oleic sunflower oil, which contain about 80% of oleic acid. Both the methyl and ethyl esters of high-oleic sunflower oil meet the standard EN 14 214 in all prescribed parameters. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

AB  - Biofuels utilization has a considerable impact upon the environment, energy diversification, reduction of energy dependency, valorization of endogenous resources, etc. This paper addresses the issue of testing oleic sunflower methyl ester (SME) in large diesel engines. Engine performance was unaffected and fuel consumption was unaltered by the addition of oleic SME. Addition of oleic SME did not visibly affect exhaust gas opacity, but it did contribute to lower CO content. Despite the technical feasibility of SME utilization, the conditions towards SME production in Portugal are still quite limited. Copyright © 2006 by Begell House Inc.

AB  - Microalgae and cyanobacteria are sunlight-driven cell factories that convert carbon dioxide to potential biofuels, foods, feeds and high-value bioactives. In addition, these microorganisms are useful in several bioremediation applications and as nitrogen fixing biofertilizers. This work discusses the industrial and environmental applications of microalgae and the production of algae in photobioreactors. Suitably designed photobioreactors are substantially more productive in comparison with open ponds and “raceways” that have been traditionally used for culturing microalgae. Furthermore, photobioreactors allow monoseptic culture of many more algae than can be grown in open systems. Design of photobioreactors requires an ability to accurately estimate the photosynthetic irradiance level; supply the necessary amount of carbon dioxide; remove the inhibitory oxygen produced by photosynthesis; ensure rapid light–dark cycling of cells for enhanced productivity; and limit the maximum level of turbulence that the fragile algal cells are exposed to. These and other aspects of photobioreactor engineering are discussed. © 2006, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania. All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the ways to reduce the price of biodiesel fuel is to use waste fats of animal and vegetable origin. The objective of this work was to investigate the physical and chemical properties of the fatty acid methyl esters of animal and vegetable origin and their mixtures, to determine their motor characteristics, to choose the optimal composition of biofuel mixtures, and to perform comparative analyses of emissions of harmful components in exhaust gases. It was determined that pure fatty acid methyl esters of animal origin and linseed oil fatty acid methyl esters do not meet standard requirements and cannot be used directly in diesel engines. For diesel engines, three-component mixtures of rapeseed oil methyl esters (RME), pork lard methyl esters (PME) or beef tallow methyl esters (TME), and linseed oil methyl esters (LME) (where the proportion of LME and methyl esters of animal origin is 1:4) may be used as fuel. According to the comparative analyses of motor characteristics of three-component mixtures, they are practically equal to the certified RME and its mixtures with fossil diesel fuel. If these three-component mixtures are used for the high-speed diesel engine, CO emissions are reduced by 20%-50%, hydrocarbon (HC) emissions are reduced by 50%-60%, and the smoke opacity of the exhaust gases is reduced by 25%-70%. The increase in NOx, emissions does not exceed 13%; no significant changes in the CO2 emissions have been noticed. When the mixtures with fossil diesel fuel that contained 30% of the aforementioned three-component biofuel mixtures were tested, CO emissions were reduced by 15%-40%, HC emissions were reduced by 30%-45%, and the smoke opacity was reduced by 25%-30%. The NOx emissions increased ∼6%; there were no notable changes in CO2 emissions. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative energy source and a substitute for petroleum-based diesel fuel. It is produced from renewable biomass by transesterification of triacylglycerols from plant oils, yielding monoalkyl esters of long-chain fatty acids with short-chain alcohols such as fatty acid methyl esters and fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs). Despite numerous environmental benefits, a broader use of biodiesel is hampered by the extensive acreage required for sufficient production of oilseed crops. Therefore, processes are urgently needed to enable biodiesel production from more readily available bulk plant materials like sugars or cellulose. Toward this goal, the authors established biosynthesis of biodiesel-adequate FAEEs, referred to as Microdiesel, in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli. This was achieved by heterologous expression in E. coli of the Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase and the unspecific acyltransferase from Acinetobacter baylyi strain ADP1. By this approach, ethanol formation was combined with subsequent esterification of the ethanol with the acyl moieties of coenzyme A thioesters of fatty acids if the cells were cultivated under aerobic conditions in the presence of glucose and oleic acid. Ethyl oleate was the major constituent of these FAEEs, with minor amounts of ethyl palmitate and ethyl palmitoleate. FAEE concentrations of 1.28 g l-1 and a FAEE content of the cells of 26 % of the cellular dry mass were achieved by fed-batch fermentation using renewable carbon sources. This novel approach might pave the way for industrial production of biodiesel equivalents from renewable resources by employing engineered micro-organisms, enabling a broader use of biodiesel-like fuels in the future. © 2006 SGM.

AB  - This study was set out to characterize particulate emissions from diesel engines fuelled by (i) mineral diesel and (ii) B20 (a blend of 20% biodiesel with diesel); in terms of metals and benzene soluble organic fraction (BSOF), which is an indicator of toxicity and carcinogenicity. A medium duty, transport diesel engine (Mahindra MDI 3000) was operated at idling, 25%, 50%, 75% and rated load at maximum torque speed (1800 rpm) and samples of particulate were collected using a partial flow dilution tunnel for both fuels. Collected particulate samples were analyzed for their metal contents. In addition, metal contents in mineral diesel, biodiesel and lubricating oil were also measured to examine and correlate their (metals present in fuel) impact on particulate characteristics. Results indicated comparatively lower emission of particulate from B20-fuelled engine than diesel engine exhaust. Metals like Cd, Pb, Na, and Ni in particulate of B20 exhaust were lower than those in the exhaust of mineral diesel. However, emissions of Fe, Cr, Ni Zn, and Mg were higher in B20 exhaust. This reduction in particulate and metals in B20 exhaust was attributed to near absence of aromatic compounds, sulphur and relatively low levels of metals in biodiesel. However, benzene soluble organic fraction (BSOF) was found higher in B20 exhaust particulate compared to diesel exhaust particulate. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, much research has been carried out to find suitable alternative fuel to petroleum products. The use of renewable fuels like ethanol, biogas and biodiesel in diesel engines is significant in this context. The properties of biodiesel depend on the type of the vegetable oil used for the trans-esterification process. Experimental analysis of the engine with various biodiesel and its blends requires much effort and time. Hence, a theoretical model is developed to analyze the performance characteristics of the compression ignition engine fueled by biodiesel and its blends. In the present investigation, biodiesel is produced using unrefined rubber seed oil. A two-step trans-esterification process (i.e. acid-alkaline trans-esterification) is developed for the production of methyl-esters of rubber seed oil. The properties of this biodiesel are closely matched with those of diesel fuel. The performance tests are carried out on a C.I. engine using biodiesel and its blends with diesel (B20 and B100) as fuel. The effects of relative air-fuel ratio and compression ratio on the engine performance for different fuels are also analyzed using this model. The comparison of theoretical and experimental results are presented. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is one of the most promising alternative diesel fuels. As diesel emission regulations have become more stringent, the diesel particulate filter (DPF) has become an essential part of the aftertreatment system. Knowledge of kinetics of exhaust particle oxidation for alternative diesel fuels is useful in estimating the change in regeneration behavior of a DPF with such fuels. This study examines the characteristics of diesel particulate emissions as well as kinetics of particle oxidation using a 1996 John Deere T04045TF250 off-highway engine and 100% soy methyl ester (SME) biodiesel (B100) as fuel. Compared to standard D2 fuel, this B100 reduced particle size, number, and volume in the accumulation mode where most of the particle mass is found. At 75% load, number decreased by 38%, DGN decreased from 80 to 62 nm, and volume decreased by 82%. Part of this decrease is likely associated with the fact that the particles were more easily oxidized. Arrhenius parameters for the biodiesel fuel showed a 2-3 times greater frequency factor and ∼6 times higher oxidation rate compared to regular diesel fuel in the range of 700-825 °C. The faster oxidation kinetics should facilitate regeneration when used with a DPF. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The advances and the government incentives has allowed Malaysia to rapidly expand its palm oil biodiesel industry, taking advantages of the growing global demands for biofuels. Trials have shown that diesel engines can run biodiesel with little or no modification. Engine performance and fuel consumption are comparable to petroleum diesel and the palm biodiesel can be stored with little deterioration in quality. The government is supporting the development of biodiesel technology and has already given over 20 grants to stimulate industry and research. It also plans to establish more plantations to cater for the increased demand for palm oil. Malaysia has almost 40,000 km2 of palm plantations and is aiming to plant another 6000 km2 under the new initiatives. The Malaysian government has also announced a biofuel strategy, with the aim to reduce the country's dependence of depleting fossil fuels, and develop environmentally-friendly fuels for greenhouse gas abatement.

AB  - Wärtsilä is using its ten years of biofuel experience to build the world's largest palm oil-fired 100 MWe power plant for Italian energy producer ItalGreen. The two companies commissioned ItalGreen's third Wärtsilä 18V32 diesel generating set at ItalGreen's Monopoli site, creating the world's largest biofuel fired plant. The plant is expected to consume around 41,000 t/year under full baseload operation and will also demonstrate favorable market conditions for renewable energy in Italy. Wärtsilä will also justify the significance of palm oil, both as a fuel additive for environmentally friendly cars, and a profitable contender for new utility-scale power projects.

AB  - University of Minnesota researchers calculated the energy needed for cultivating and harvesting corn and soybeans, transporting them, and processing them into biofuel. The group also examined the amounts of fertilizer and pesticide required and the amount of greenhouse gases and nitrogen, phosphorus, and pesticide pollutants each released into the environment. Results show that soybean biodiesel generates 41% less greenhouse gas emissions than diesel fuel compared to ethanol's generating 12% less than gasoline. Soybeans also use much less nitrogen fertilizer and pesticides. Neither ethanol from corn or biodiesel from soybean can meet the demand for fuels to replace petroleum.

AB  - This article presents the comparative bench testing results of a four stroke, four cylinder, direct injection, unmodified, naturally aspirated Diesel engine when operating on neat RME and its 5%, 10%, 20% and 35% blends with Diesel fuel. The purpose of this research is to examine the effects of RME inclusion in Diesel fuel on the brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) of a high speed Diesel engine, its brake thermal efficiency, emission composition changes and smoke opacity of the exhausts. The brake specific fuel consumption at maximum torque (273.5 g/kW h) and rated power (281 g/kW h) for RME is higher by 18.7% and 23.2% relative to Diesel fuel. It is difficult to determine the RME concentration in Diesel fuel that could be recognised as equally good for all loads and speeds. The maximum brake thermal efficiency varies from 0.356 to 0.398 for RME and from 0.373 to 0.383 for Diesel fuel. The highest fuel energy content based economy (9.36-9.61 MJ/kW h) is achieved during operation on blend B10, whereas the lowest ones belong to B35 and neat RME. The maximum NO x emissions increase proportionally with the mass percent of oxygen in the biofuel and engine speed, reaching the highest values at the speed of 2000 min-1, the highest being 2132 ppm value for the B35 blend and 2107 ppm for RME. The carbon monoxide, CO, emissions and visible smoke emerging from the biodiesel over all load and speed ranges are lower by up to 51.6% and 13.5% to 60.3%, respectively. The carbon dioxide, CO2, emissions along with the fuel consumption and gas temperature, are slightly higher for the B20 and B35 blends and neat RME. The emissions of unburned hydrocarbons, HC, for all biofuels are low, ranging at 5-21 ppm levels. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Negative environmental consequences of fossil fuels and concerns about petroleum supplies have spurred the search for renewable transportation biofuels. To be a viable alternative, a biofuel should provide a net energy gain, have environmental benefits, be economically competitive, and be producible in large quantities without reducing food supplies. We use these criteria to evaluate, through life-cycle accounting, ethanol from corn grain and biodiesel from soybeans. Ethanol yields 25% more energy than the energy invested in its production, whereas biodiesel yields 93% more. Compared with ethanol, biodiesel releases just 1.0%, 8.3%, and 13% of the agricultural nitrogen, phosphorus, and pesticide pollutants, respectively, per net energy gain. Relative to the fossil fuels they displace, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced 12% by the production and combustion of ethanol and 41% by biodiesel. Biodiesel also releases less air pollutants per net energy gain than ethanol. These advantages of biodiesel over ethanol come from lower agricultural inputs and more efficient conversion of feedstocks to fuel. Neither biofuel can replace much petroleum without impacting food supplies. Even dedicating all U.S. corn and soybean production to biofuels would meet only 12% of gasoline demand and 6% of diesel demand. Until recent increases in petroleum prices, high production costs made biofuels unprofitable without subsidies. Biodiesel provides sufficient environmental advantages to merit subsidy. Transportation biofuels such as synfuel hydrocarbons or cellulosic ethanol, if produced from low-input biomass grown on agriculturally marginal land or from waste biomass, could provide much greater supplies and environmental benefits than food-based biofuels. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

AB  - Spain is on its way to become one of the biggest producers of biofuels by announcing major plans to build biofuels production capacity and invest substantial amounts in it. A target has been set up by the Spanish government for biofuels consumption under a €23 billion national renewable energy program, Plan de Energias Renovables. Repsol YPF, Spain's biggest oil firm and renewable energy company Acciona signed an agreement for the biggest program worldwide to construct biodiesel plants. The plants will use vegetable oils as raw material, and will build up to five biodiesel plants, each with a capacity of over 200,000 m.t./year. All the plants are scheduled to come onstream between the first half of 2007 and second half of 2009. Repsol announced that it would head a consortium of 15 Spanish companies planning a four year biodiesel program. Capsa, Spain's second biggest oil firm is also planning to enter the biofuel industry, announcing two new projects.

AB  - The longing for production-scale biofuels is due mainly to the increase in consumption of fuels in the transport sector (China, India, and USA) and to the restrictions on global refining capacity. There is a world market interested in biofuels. In Latin America, various countries have begun or are preparing programs for alternative energies. Brazil is the world leader in the ethanol market. Nicaragua is the pioneer in jatropha curca plantations for biodiesel. Argentina focuses on the use of soya oil as raw material as a motor fuel domestically and for export. India, China, Korea, and Japan have a great interest in biodiesel. The biofuels are represented mainly by biodiesel generated form soya, sunflower, rape, and palm oils, and ethanol produced from corn, beets, sugar cane, and wheat derivatives. It has been over 30 yr since a petroleum refinery has been built in the USA while in 2003 and 2004 over 100 bioethanol distilleries based on corn have been built. A benefit of introducing biofuels into the energy matrix is to provide a diversification in case in the future the petroleum and petroleum derivative situation becomes more complex and conflicting. Another benefit is reduction of greenhouse gases with the exception of Brazil in which ethanol and biodiesel already form part of the energy matrix. For countries that are self sufficient in gasoline and diesel, biofuels serve the export market, creating credit. Biofuels manufacture also creates local employment in agriculture, energy, commerce, technologies, quality control, and so on. Biodiesel decreases carbon dioxide, sulfur, and carcinogenic aromatics emissions. Vegetable fuel is biodegradable and mixes with gasoil. Alcohol biofuel is now being adopted in countries like Venezuela and India and has been studied in Japan and China. Starting in 2008, Petrobras expects to export the equivalent of 350,000 cu m of fuel alcohol to Venezuela and Nigeria. Since Japan allows 3% alcohol in gasoline, Petrobras and Japan Alcohol Trading formed a joint venture in 2005, Brazil Japan Ethanol Co Ltd (BJE) to activate the Japanese market to use bioethanol in its gasoline. The conquest of the international market for ethanol will require Brazilian companies to lease more growing surface in rural areas, mainly in San Pablo state. An estimate is that to respond to internal demand, by 2010 at the latest 10 million hectares will need to be planted and to satisfy exports, and another 20 million acres will have to be planted. Numerous other observations are made with a spotlight on Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Peru, Paraguay, and Colombia.

AB  - The commitments made by Ford to invest £1 billion in technologies to reduce emissions and improve fuel economy, are discussed. The research and development should focus on new generation lightweight premium vehicles, five new gasoline engines with direct injection, three advanced diesel engines, four new and advanced transmissions and, alternative fuel capability (bio fuels). The company views biofuels as a primary means of reducing overall CO2 emissions from transport and is working with BP to develop advanced second generation biofuels. The company is considering cooling to reduce drag linked to CO2, when the grille aperture is made variable to match the thermal load on the coolant. Another option chosen by the company is installing selectable driving modes which allow the car to operate in a way for reducing the pollution. The company believes that 3 per cent cuts in CO2 is possible.

AB  - Enzymatic production of methyl esters (biodiesel) by methanolysis of palm oil in presence and absence of organic solvent was investigated using Candida antarctica lipase immobilized on acrylic resin as a biocatalyst. Although, at least molar equivalent of methanol (methanol-palm oil ratio 3:1) is required for the complete conversion of palm oil to methyl esters, lipase catalyzed methanolysis of palm oil in absence of organic solvent was poisoned by adding more than 1/3 molar equivalent of methanol. The use of polar organic solvents prevented the lipase to be poisoned in methanolysis with a molar equivalent of methanol, and tetrahydrofuran (THF) was found to be the most effective. The presence of water in methanolysis of palm oil both in presence and absence of THF inhibited the reaction rate but this inhibition was considerably low in THF containing system. The palm oil-lipase (w/w) ratio significantly influenced the activity of lipase and the optimal ratio in presence and absence of THF was 100 and 50, respectively.

AB  - Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) plans to use biofuel blends depending on the operational result, the cost of biofuel, and its availability. KSRTC plans to run buses on 100% esterified biofuel, with the aim to provide adequate, economical, and properly coordinated passenger transport services to the citizens of Karnataka State. The use of biofuel in the form of Straight Vegetable Oil (Pure Plant Oil) with an improved filter system increases fuel efficiency from 5.10 km per liter to 5.12 km per liter. It is believed that the use of biofuel and its market depend upon several factors such as production and application potential, appropriate feedstock, financial viability, environmental impact, and government and institutional support. Nearly 81 buses in Bangalore, India, run on a diesel:pongamia oil blends, leading to cuts in emissions and enabling annual savings of over EUR 20,000.

AB  - This study investigated the emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), carcinogenic potencies (BaPeq) and particulate matter (PM), fuel consumption and energy efficiency from the generator under steady state for seven test fuels: P0 (Premium Diesel Fuel), P10 (10% palm biodiesel+90% P0), P20, P30, P50, P75 and P100. Experimental results indicated that PAH emission decreased with increasing palm-biodiesel blends due to small PAH content in biodiesel. The mean reduction fraction of total PAHs emission factor (P0=1110 μg L-1) from the exhaust of diesel generator were 13.2%, 28.0%, 40.6%, 54.4%, 61.89% and 98.8% for P10, P20, P30, P50, P75 and P100, respectively, compared with P0. The mean reduction fraction of total BaPeq (P0=1.65 μg L-1) from the exhaust of diesel generator were 15.2%, 29.1%, 43.3%, 56.4%, 58.2% and 97.6% for P10, P20, P30, P50, P75 and P100, respectively, compared with P0. PM emission decreased as the palm-biodiesel blends increased from 0% to 10%, and increased as the palm-biodiesel blends increased from 10% to 100% because the soluble organic fraction of PM emission was high in blends with high palm-biodiesel content. The brake specific fuel consumption rose with rising palm-biodiesel blends due to the low gross heat value of palm-biodiesel. The increasing fraction of BSFC of palm-biodiesel was lower than those of soy-, soapstock-, brassica-carinate and rapeseed-biodiesel. Palm-biodiesel seems to be the most feasible biodiesel. The best energy efficiency occurred between P10 and P20, close to P15. The curve dropped as the palm-biodiesel content rose above P20. Above results revealed that palm-biodiesel was an oxygenated fuel appropriate for use in diesel engines to promote combustion efficiency and decrease PAH emission. However, adding an excess of palm-biodiesel to P0 leaded to incomplete combustion in the diesel-engine generator and inhibited the release of energy in the fuel. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate systems making organic farms self-sufficient in farm-produced bio-based fuels. The energy balance and environmental load for systems based on rape methyl ester (RME), ethanol and biogas were evaluated using a life cycle perspective. Complete LCAs were not performed. Important constraints when implementing the systems in practice were also identified. The RME scenario showed favourable energy balance and produced valuable by-products but was less positive in some other aspects. The use of land was high and thereby also the emissions associated with cultivation. Emissions, with the exception of CO2, during utilisation of the fuel were high compared to those of the other fuels in the study. The technology for production and use of RME is well known and easy to implement at farm scale. The production of ethanol was energy consuming and the by-products were relatively low value. However, the area needed for cultivation of raw material was low compared to the RME scenario. The production and utilisation of ignition improver and denaturants were associated with considerable emissions. Suitable ethanol production technology is available but is more optimal for large scale systems. The biogas scenario had a low relative need for arable land, which also resulted in smaller soil emissions to air and water. Another advantage was the potential to recycle plant nutrients. On the other hand, the potential emissions of methane from storage of digestate, upgrading of biogas and methane losses during utilisation of fuel produced a negative impact, mainly on global warming. Small scale technology for biogas cleaning and storage is not fully developed and extensive tractor modifications are necessary. The global warming effects of all three systems studied were reduced by 58-72% in comparison to a similar farming system based on diesel fuel. However, the fuel costs were higher for all scenarios studied compared to current diesel prices. In particular, the large costs for seasonal storage of gas meant that the biogas scenario described is currently not financially viable. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is a form of renewable energy that provides a less polluting fuel for diesel engines with minimal reduced engine performance as a result of a slight power loss and specific fuel consumption increase. To extend the use of biodiesel, the main concern is the economic viability of producing biodiesel. This study identified that the price of the feedstock was one of the most significant factors. Also, glycerol was found to be a valuable by-product that could reduce the final manufacturing costs of the process up to 6.5%, depending on the raw feedstock used. Biodiesel can only compete with diesel fuel prices. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - With new legislation requiring obligatory market shares of liquid biofuels of 2% by 2005 and 5.75% by 2010, companies are on the rush to build new biodiesel plants. This paper discusses the opinions of three experts who are intimately acquainted with the process of building biodiesel plants: Körbitz; Myron danzer of Renewable Energy Group (REG); and Derek Masterson of Crown Iron Works (CIW). These experts discuss the necessary steps to be taken, the selection criteria for the process technology, the duration of designing and building a biodiesel plant, the safety issues that need to be addressed; the required capacity; the regulations that apply to biodiesel plants; and whether biodiesel plants are the only ones producing methyl esters.

AB  - Four oil seeds were evaluated in the present study as a renewable and potential source of energy. Successive seed oil extraction indicated that almost 27.64 ± 0.60%, 49.82 ± 0.49%, 50 ± 4.08% and 50.74 ± 2.1% for Garcinia mangostana, Calophylum inophyllum, Pentaclethra macrophylla and Telfairia occidentalis seeds respectively were oil. The physical and fuel related properties of the seed oils were investigated in this work. The results showed that these properties were comparable to those of other vegetable oils that have been used as biofuels and to current European specifications for biodiesel. Using two different esterification procedures, the percentage yield of the alkyl esters of the four seed oils were compared and the batch process of esterification was found to give a better yield. The overall findings from this study suggests that these seed oils may be an appropriate substitute for diesel fuel and that the use of Calophyllum inophyllum, Garcinia mangostana, Pentaclethra macrophylla and Telfairia occidentalis seed oils as fuel represents one possible hope for the tuture ot Nigerian agriculture.

AB  - This paper examines the incremental global climate response of black carbon (BC), the main component of soot, due to absorption and scattering by BC inclusions within cloud and precipitation particles. Modeled soot is emitted as an externally mixed aerosol particle. It evolves to an internal mixture through condensation, hydration, dissolution, dissociation, crystallization, aqueous chemistry, coagulation, and cloud processing. Size-resolved cloud liquid and ice particles grow by condensation onto size-resolved soot and other particles. Cloud particles grow to precipitation by coagulation and the Bergeron process. Cloud and precipitation particles also undergo freezing, melting, evaporation, sublimation, and coagulation with interstitial aerosol particles. Soot, which is tracked in cloud and precipitation particles of all sizes, is removed by rainout, washout, sedimentation, and dry deposition. Two methods of treating the optics of BC in size-resolved cloud liquid, ice and graupel are compared: the core-shell approximation (CSA) and the iterative dynamic effective medium approximation (DEMA). The 10-year global near-surface incremental temperature response due to fossil fuel (ff), biofuel (bf), and biomass burning (bb) BC within clouds with the DEMA was slightly stronger than that with the CSA, but both enhancements were <+0.05 K. The ff+bf portion may be ∼60% of the total, suggesting that BC inclusions within clouds may enhance the near-surface temperature response of ff+bf soot due to all processes (estimated as ∼0.27 K), by < 10%, strengthening the possible climate impact of BC. BC cloud absorption was also found to increase water vapor, decrease precipitation, and decrease cloud fraction. The increase in water vapor at the expense of precipitation contributed to warming in addition to that of the cloud BC absorption itself. Aerosol-hydrometeor coagulation followed by hydrometeor evaporation may have caused almost twice the BC internal mixing as aerosol-aerosol coagulation. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, burning oil of biomass (BOB) was derived from biomass corncob tar by distillation. The fuel BOB1 was extracted from biomass corncob tar by distilling temperature range from 110 to 220 °C, the fuel BOB2 was extracted from biomass corn tar by distilling temperature over 220 °C. This paper presents that the results in the physical characteristic of BOB as an alternative fuel and a comparative control experiences in unmodified diesel engine. Engine power performance, fuel consumption and emissions (CO 2, CO, HC and NO) have been studied. There was no significant difference in performance between diesel fuel and mixed fuel. The mixed fuel operation produced low fuel consumption at the various loading. Mixed fuel 1 (mixed 10% BOB1 with diesel by volume) and mixed fuel 2 (mixed 10% BOB2 with diesel by volume) with 11.7 and 6.6% oil-economizing rate, had better oil-economizing compare to diesel fuel respectively. The mixed fuel 1 and mixed fuel 2 showed significant improvement at CO2 emissions. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Increased pressure from federal and state agencies to improve air quality has resulted in extensive research into the use of biofuels to reduce diesel engine emissions. Oxygenated biofuels such as biodiesel and ethanol blended with diesel fuel are biodegradable, non-toxic, renewable alternatives to imported petroleum diesel, and their use not only creates new markets for domestic agricultural products, but also greatly reduces particulate emissions. Unfortunately, biodiesel has been shown to increase NO X missions upwards of 10% compared to petroleum diesel. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the performance and NO X emissions of selected biofuels and blends with petroleum-based diesel fuel in a turbocharged and intercooled diesel engine using a steady-state nonroad ISO 8-mode test schedule. Test fuels included traditional No. 2 diesel and four biofuels comprising 100% soy methyl ester biodiesel, 2% biodiesel, 10% ethanol-diesel fuel, and 5% ethanol in biodiesel Exhaust NO X missions were monitored with a Horiba NO X analyzer. Reductions in peak torque varying from less than 0.5% to about 10% were measured with the test fuels and were attributed mainly to reduced energy content. Biodiesel fuel showed a 12% increase in NO X emissions, while 2% biodiesel fuel increased emissions 2.3%. The ethanol-diesel fuel blend reduced NO X emissions by 2.7% and was highly sensitive to load, with increased temperature and NO X emissions at light load. Addition of only 5% ethanol to biodiesel suppressed NO X emissions, with only a 2.6% increase occurring. It was concluded that ethanol could act as an effective NO X emissions reducing additive. © 2006 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - The 6th Annual "Harvesting Clean Energy" Conference in Spokane, Washington was held this February. Record attendance of 582 was evidence of booming interest in production fuels and electricity as agricultural commodities. The conference came as the Washington Legislature was moving to set a mininum standard for use of biodiesel and ethanol in vehicle fuels, and weeks after the government's announcement of new support for biofuels and other alternatives to what the president called the US oil addiction. The event emphasized the emergence of an unusual coalition comong together to further farmgrown fuels and other alternatives to petroleum.

AB  - With mineral oil prices high and likely to stay high, more and more diesel car and light truck owners across the Atlantic are converting their vehicles to run on vegetable oils. Diesel engines run perfectly well on waste vegetable oil, provided fuel and engines are sufficiently pre-heated to get over viscosity and polymerization problems. In the UK, bioethanol is now sold publicly.

AB  - Study presents that supercritical methanol has the ability to convert oils/fats consisting of triglycerides and free fatty acids (FFAs) into fatty acid methyl esters through transesterification and methyl esterification, respectively, without any catalyst. This one-step method (Saka process) is simpler process realizing shorter reaction time and higher yield of methyl esters than those of the conventional alkali-catalyzed method. To improve the biodiesel quality that satisfies the standard specification, another reaction route was also developed by the two-step method (Saka-Dadan process), which consists of hydrolysis step for oils/fats in subcritical water and subsequent methyl esterification of the hydrolyzed products of fatty acids from oils/fats in supercritical methanol. These new methods are highly tolerant against the presence of FFAs and water in oils/fats. Therefore, compared to the alkali-catalyzed method, proposed methods can be applied for various types of oils/fats and their wastes as raw materials to produce biodiesel fuel.

AB  - An experimental programme examining performance and emissions from spark- and compression-ignition engines, running on a variety of bio-fuels, including simulated bio-gas and commercial seed oil is presented. Both engines were single-cylinder laboratory-type engines of comparable power output having variable speed and load capability, the spark-ignition engine additionally having variable compression ratio. For bio-gas, containing carbon dioxide, emissions of oxides of nitrogen were reduced relative to natural gas, while unburnt hydrocarbons were increased. Brake power and specific fuel consumption changed little and carbon monoxide was predominantly affected by air:fuel ratio. Equivalent effects were demonstrated with nitrogen replacing carbon dioxide in the simulated bio-gas and similar trends were evident as compression ratio was increased. Seed-oil bio-fuel gave similar performance to diesel fuel without major disadvantages, other than an increased specific fuel consumption. Tests with cetane and rape-seed methyl ester bio-diesel are also presented for comparison. Specific fuel consumption was about the same and specific NOx emissions were lower with bio-fuel than results from the spark-ignition engine tests running on biogas. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Oxygenated diesel fuel blends have a potential to reduce the emission of particulate matter (PM) and to be an alternative to diesel fuel. This paper describes the emission characteristics of a three compounds oxygenated diesel fuel blend (BE-diesel), on a Cummins-4B diesel engine. BE-diesel is a new form of oxygenated diesel fuel blends consisted of ethanol, methyl soyate and petroleum diesel fuel. The blend ratio used in this study was 5:20:75 (ethanol: methyl soyate: diesel fuel) by volume. The results from the operation of diesel engine with BE-diesel showed a significant reduction in PM emissions and 2%-14% increase of NOx emissions. The change of CO emission was not conclusive and depended on operating conditions. Total hydrocarbon (THC) from BE-diesel was lower than that from diesel fuel under most tested conditions. Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde and acetone in the exhaust were measured, and the results indicated that use of BE-diesel led to a slight increase of acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde and acetone emissions. A small amount of ethanol was also detected in the exhaust from burning BE-diesel. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this work is to understand the impact of biodiesel chemical structure, specifically fatty acid composition on particulate matter formation, particularly on the retention of hydrocarbons by soot due to the scrubbing effect and absorption processes. A typical diesel fuel supplied in petrol stations, two biofuels composed of methyl esters from the transesterification process of waste oils with different origins and some blends of biofuels with the reference fuel were tested in a commercial direct injection engine reproducing five modes of the European transient urban/extraurban certification cycle. The values of parameters related to the scrubbing effect and the absorption process were evaluated and fitted using neural networks (NNs). Simulation from NNs equations proves that in the case of tested fuels, the amount of palmitic acid methyl ester (PME) is the main factor affecting the amount of soluble material retained due to scrubbing. PME produces a lower amount of particulates, which reduces the agglomeration process and increases their specific surface. It is also proved that sulphur in sulphates (well known to be responsible for the scrubbing effect) must mainly come from the oil lube since the use of biofuels and their mixtures eliminates or significantly reduces sulphur concentration in the fuel, respectively. Condensation onto the particles due to inadequate vaporization and significant unburned biofuel must also be considered. The absorption process during particle formation was found to be negligible when biofuels were tested. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - With petroleum supplies dwindling, there is increasing interest in selective methods for transforming other carbon feedstocks into hydrocarbons suitable for transportation fuel. We report the development of highly productive, well-defined, tandem catalytic systems for the metathesis of n-alkanes. Each system comprises one molecular catalyst (a "pincer"- ligated indium complex) that effects alkane dehydrogenation and olefin hydrogenation, plus a second catalyst (molecular or solid-phase) for olefin metathesis. The systems all show complete selectivity for linear (n-alkane) product. We report one example that achieves selectivity with respect to the distribution of product molecular weights, in which n-decane is the predominant high-molecular-weight product of the metathesis of two moles of n-hexane.

AB  - This paper examines whether switching from fossil fuels to biofuels is really the best way to address CO 2 emissions from road transport. Critics say using biofuels does not result in a significant reduction in CO 2 emissions relative to petrol and diesel production. They are also concerned that turning over land to biofuel crops could lead to economic and environmental disaster. Advocates, on the other hand, believe that a combination of imports and new technology could bypass potential land shortage problems. Lower value feedstocks from straw to organic waste materials could also be converted to fuels via advanced process technologies currently under development. Then there are those who say that the use of biomass for power generation is more cost-effective than biofuels in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Fossil fuel is currently the major energy source driving global socio-economy, but its stock is being heavily depleted due to increasing anthropogenic activities worldwide. There are also concerns regarding the burning of fossil fuels, which contributes to global climate warming and air pollution. As such, the development of biodiesel as a non-toxic, biodegradable, and renewable alternative energy source using oil crops such as soybean and rapeseed has quickly emerged in the West countries. However, the production of oil crops in China is far from sufficient to meet the demands of the country's population of 1.3 billion, and increasing oil crop production is inhibited by a severe shortage of agricultural land, which currently averages 0.2 acre per person and, as such, is less than half the world average. The current national policy in China regarding land use is more towards revering cultivated lands in ravins and hills to forestry, which presents an ideal opportunity to further develop plantations of walnut (Juglans regia L.) trees, a plant that is tolerant to drought and infertile soils and has a high oil content. Study in this paper shows that one ament of walnut staminate flowers produces about 0.168 g dry pollen, and the dry pollen contained 49.67% oil. Based on this discovery, oil yield obtained from staminate flowers is estimated to reach 6.95% of that from walnut nuts. Thus walnut staminate flower is suggested to explore as supplementary plant oil source, and has a great opportunity to utilize as a biodiesel feedstock. © 2006 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The present study introduced an integrated method for the production of biodiesel from microalgal oil. Heterotrophic growth of Chlorella protothecoides resulted in the accumulation of high lipid content (55%) in cells. Large amount of microalgal oil was efficiently extracted from these heterotrophic cells by using n-hexane. Biodiesel comparable to conventional diesel was obtained from heterotrophic microalgal oil by acidic transesterification. The best process combination was 100% catalyst quantity (based on oil weight) with 56:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil at temperature of 30°C, which reduced product specific gravity from an initial value of 0.912 to a final value of 0.8637 in about 4 h of reaction time. The results suggested that the new process, which combined bioengineering and transesterification, was a feasible and effective method for the production of high quality biodiesel from microalgal oil. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Waste frying oils transesterification was studied with the purpose of achieving the best conditions for biodiesel production. Transesterification reactions were carried out for 1 h using waste frying oils (WFOs), methanol, and sodium hydroxide as catalyst. In order to determine the best conditions for biodiesel production, a series of experiments were carried out, using methanol/WFO molar ratios between 3.6 and 5.4 and catalyst/WFO weight ratios between 0.2% and 1.0%. For oils with an acid value of 0.42 mg KOH/g, results show that a methanol/WFO ratio of 4.8 and a catalyst/WFO ratio of 0.6% gives the highest yield of methyl esters. Furthermore, an increase in the amount of methanol or catalyst quantity seems to simplify the separation/purification of the methyl esters phase, as showed by a viscosity reduction and an increasing purity to values higher than 98% for methyl esters phase. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Four promising biofuels for the future - methanol, ethanol, hydrogen, and synthetic diesel - were systematically analyzed for their technical and economic potential, and for improvements necessary to fulfil these potentials. Key technologies for the production of these fuels, such as gasification, gas processing, synthesis, hydrolysis and fermentation, and their improvement options were studied and modelled. The production facilities' technological and economic performance were analysed, applying variations in technology and scale. Production costs of these fuels range 16 - 22 €/GJHHV now, down to 9 - 13 €/GJHHV in future (2030) under the assumption that certain technological developments have taken place and that biomass is available at 3 €/GJHHV. The feedstock costs strongly influence the resulting biofuel costs by 2 - 3 €/GJfuel for each €/GJHHV feedstock change. In biomass producing regions such as Latin America, the four fuels could be produced at 7 - 11 €/GJ HHV, equalling diesel and gasoline production costs. The uncertainties in the biofuels production costs of the four selected biofuels are 15-30 %. Large-scale gasification, thorough gas cleaning, and microbiological processes for hydrolysis and fermentation are key major fields for RD&amp;D efforts.

AB  - The European biofuels industry has been in a vigorous growth stage. The EU estimates that biodiesel production capacity increased by 35% between 2002 and 2005. It may now have reached a stage where raw materials will limit further growth in European manufacturing, and biodiesel capacity is being built in the US for the European market. European policy makers are under pressure to reduce tariffs and alter fuel parameters, such as density, to allow greater use of imported biofuel raw materials. Enjoying, as it does, tax incentives, biofuels blending ought to be welcomed in many ways by the European fuels and auto industries. Although it slightly increases NOx emissions, biodiesel adds useful oxygen for good combustion, has good cetane, has low aromatics, and ought to help considerably with lubricity issues as more and more diesel moves over to the new 10-ppm sulfur level.

AB  - Neste Oil abandoned conventional first-generation technology in favor of a process which would give refiners the environmental benefits of a biofuel, but with excellent top-tier blending properties of a synthetic diesel. NExBTL has exceptionally high cetane, zero sulfur and aromatics, and can be blended at volumes of ≤ 50% with conventional diesel. Neste states that NExBTL is a second-generation biofuel, although some argue that second-generation fuels should source energy from biomass, not food or food-waste oils. In terms of the product quality produced, NExBTL equals or surpasses BTL derived from Fischer-Tropsch gas- or biomass-to-liquids component. Overall, the CO2 emissions are somewhere between 0.5 and 1.5 kg/kg of diesel depending on what raw material is used. It is a significant saving compared to conventional diesel reduction, which leads to 3.8 kg CO2/kg of diesel. For the Porvoo plant, the NExBTL process will use &lt; 1 ton/hr of hydrogen. That hydrogen results in 0.3 kg CO2 emissions/kg of NExBTL product.

AB  - Dimethyl-ether (DME) is a product which is better known today as a propellant for hairspray than as a fuel for heavy duty vehicles. DME's advocates point to its clean-burning properties, exceptionally high well-to-wheel efficiency and its potential to leverage biomass as a feedstock. According to Manager of Environmental Projects at Volvo Power Train Corp, Henrik Landälv, introducing DME would require a gradual phase-out of existing infrastructure, and phase-in of suitably adapted vehicles. With a simple change-out of equipment at the end of its economic life, DME from natural gas and bio sources could be phased in before the second generation biofuels industry is anywhere near ready for the scale of the diesel market. DME as a clean, efficient biofuel is not to be discounted. Landälv urges the critics of DME to consider the chemistry of DME compared to BTL and GTL fuels.

AB  - Choren's so-called "SunDiesel" is a bold venture to commercialize second-generation biofuels technology, which has won investment and technology support from Shell. Although Choren brands its product as SunDiesel, its likely market will be as a blending component. Choren's biomass-to-liquids (BTL) technology is an example of second-generation biofuels. The company claims a first in producing BTL fuels outside of the laboratory. While first-generation biofuels use the same part of a plant as is used for food production, second-generation BTL, or ethanol derived from wood, do not compete with or displace food production. Currently under construction is a Beta unit, which will produce 15,000 ton/yr or 300 bbl/day. The Beta plant will be optimized for natural wood and wood waste and will be able to integrate ≤ 30% of agricultural straw. Energy crops, such as Miscanthus, a woody Asian reed harvested annually, are also a likely source of biomass for the plant.

AB  - A subsidiary of the growing independent fuels group Greenergy International will operate a new rapeseed methyl ether (RME) biofuels plant situated near the ConocoPhillips and Total refineries at Immingham in the UK. The plant will produce 100,000 ton/yr of RME beginning in autumn of 2006. The project is representative of a large number of bio RME plant constructions throughout Europe, although as a major petroleum and RME supplier, Greenergy is particularly well placed to monetize its investment. Greenergy has signed a memorandum of understanding with ConocoPhillips regarding production from the plant. The company also markets substantial quantities of a 5% RME, 95% ultra-low-sulfur-diesel blend itself. Greenergy has a long record of innovating in the retail marketplace, pioneering low-sulfur diesels and even registering the term City Diesel as its own brand. During the autumn, the UK government announced a Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation requiring all road fuels to have a 5% biofuel component by 2010.

AB  - The auto industry has published, for the first time, a fuel charter calling for so-called "sulfur free" diesel. Policy concerns were shifting from city air quality to the so-called "global environment" and fuel efficiency. German ministers are calling for the newly implemented Fuels Directive to mandate 10-ppm diesel by 2007, while the German government was preparing a scheme of tax incentives, which would force German refiners into an immediate investment program. Some refiners were making great margins on the new ultra-low-sulfur diesel, and the kerosene-to-crude differential was exceptionally strong, as others attempted to blend their way into a buoyant market. Published on 5/17/2003, the biofuels directive affects every European state and will lead to an amendment of the EN590 diesel specification. By 2010, member states will be expected to ensure that 5.75% of the energy content of transport fuels sold are derived from renewable sources. The development of forecourt fuels is featured, which market the advantages of gas-to-liquids directly to the consumer.

AB  - All the kinetic studies, found in the literature, on the production of biodiesel (fatty acids methyl esters) considered the esterifications of free fatty acids rather than the transesterification of the vegetable oil itself. The main industrial interest, however, is for the production of biodiesel with the triglyceride (oil) being the substrate. A mathematical model taking into account the mechanism of the methanolysis reaction starting from the vegetable oil as substrate, rather than the free fatty acids, has been developed. From the proposed model equation, the regions where the effect of alcohol inhibition fades, at different substrate concentrations, were identified. The proposed model equation can be used to predict the rate of methanolysis of vegetable oils in a batch or a continuous reactor and to determine the optimal conditions for biodiesel production. © 2005 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - 'Biodiesel' is the name given to a renewable diesel fuel that is produced from fats and oils. It consists of the simple alkyl esters of fatty acids, most typically the methyl esters. We have developed a computer model to estimate the capital and operating costs of a moderately-sized industrial biodiesel production facility. The major process operations in the plant were continuous-process vegetable oil transesterification, and ester and glycerol recovery. The model was designed using contemporary process simulation software, and current reagent, equipment and supply costs, following current production practices. Crude, degummed soybean oil was specified as the feedstock. Annual production capacity of the plant was set at 37,854,118 l (10 × 10 6 gal). Facility construction costs were calculated to be US$11.3 million. The largest contributors to the equipment cost, accounting for nearly one third of expenditures, were storage tanks to contain a 25 day capacity of feedstock and product. At a value of US$0.52/kg ($0.236/lb) for feedstock soybean oil, a biodiesel production cost of US$0.53/l ($2.00/gal) was predicted. The single greatest contributor to this value was the cost of the oil feedstock, which accounted for 88% of total estimated production costs. An analysis of the dependence of production costs on the cost of the feedstock indicated a direct linear relationship between the two, with a change of US$0.020/l ($0.075/gal) in product cost per US$0.022/kg ($0.01/lb) change in oil cost. Process economics included the recovery of coproduct glycerol generated during biodiesel production, and its sale into the commercial glycerol market as an 80% w/w aqueous solution, which reduced production costs by ≈6%. The production cost of biodiesel was found to vary inversely and linearly with variations in the market value of glycerol, increasing by US$0.0022/l ($0.0085/gal) for every US$0.022/kg ($0.01/lb) reduction in glycerol value. The model is flexible in that it can be modified to calculate the effects on capital and production costs of changes in feedstock cost, changes in the type of feedstock employed, changes in the value of the glycerol coproduct, and changes in process chemistry and technology.

AB  - Biomass-based renewable fuels are produced outside of refineries. However, there are profitable opportunities to incorporate bio-mass-based materials into the refining industry. Modern biofuels or components can be produced and used as part of upgrading processes for a refinery. Novel technologies can manufacture premium fuel component biomass materials and integrate into the refining scheme. Bioether production can provide potential processing flexibility to blend biodiesel and biogasoline. Also, bioether production can provide a novel way to manufacture a premium-quality diesel-biofuel component for the modern ultra-low-sulfur diesel pool. A discussion covers the bioethers processing; unique processing features of bioethers; product yields and properties for bioethers; impact of bioethers; biodiesels; second-generation synthetic diesel; product properties for biodiesel; comparison between synthetic diesel and FAME manufacturing; synthetic diesel product in comparison with other diesel fuels; CO2 balance issue with synthetic diesel; and commercial status of synthetic diesel.

AB  - A central composite rotatable design was used to study the effect of methanol quantity, acid concentration and reaction time on the reduction of free fatty acids content of mahua oil during its pretreatment for making biodiesel. All the three variables significantly affected the acid value of the product, methanol being the most effective followed by reaction time and acid catalyst concentration. Using response surface methodology, a quadratic polynomial equation was obtained for acid value by multiple regression analysis. Verification experiments confirmed the validity of the predicted model. The optimum combinations for reducing the acid level of mahua oil to less than 1% after pretreatment was 0.32 v/v methanol-to-oil ratio, 1.24% v/v H 2SO4 catalyst and 1.26 h reaction time at 60°C. After the pretreatment of mahua oil, transesterification reaction was carried out with 0.25 v/v methanol-to-oil ratio (6:1 molar ratio) and 0.7% w/v KOH as an alkaline catalyst to produce biodiesel. The fuel properties of mahua biodiesel so obtained complied the requirements of both the American and European standards for biodiesel. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this report combustion and exhaust emissions with neat diesel fuel and diesel-biodiesel blends have been investigated. In the investigation, firstly biodiesel from non-edible neem oil has been made by esterification. Biodiesel fuel (BDF) is chemically known as mono-alkyl fatty acid ester. It is renewable in nature and is derived from plant oils including vegetable oils. BDF is non-toxic, biodegradable, recycled resource and essentially free from sulfur and carcinogenic benzene. In the second phase of this investigation, experiment has been conducted with neat diesel fuel and diesel-biodiesel blends in a four stroke naturally aspirated (NA) direct injection (DI) diesel engine. Compared with conventional diesel fuel, diesel-biodiesel blends showed lower carbon monoxide (CO), and smoke emissions but higher oxides of nitrogen (NO x) emission. However, compared with the diesel fuel, NOx emission with diesel-biodiesel blends was slightly reduced when EGR was applied. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of fuels derived from vegetable oils represents a potential opportunity to meet EU Commission guidelines promoting renewable energy utilization. This is particularly true for Mediterranean countries where farmers are well familiarized with oil crops. Sunflower is one of the most adapted crops to dry conditions typical of Mediterranean environments. The oleic acid content in sunflower oil seems to be a suitable character for biofuel production with regard to fuel oxidative stability. For the same reason, the high oleic varieties are considered particularly promising. In this study the effect of climatic conditions and agronomic practices on oleic acid content of sunflower seeds is investigated with respect to the Southern Italy regions. Effects of high temperature, water deficit, irrigation water quality, sowing time and genotype on oil yield and quality are evaluated. Finally, the potential of sunflower cultivation for biofuel production in the light of the recent European agricultural policy is discussed. © 2006, by Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Transport is the highest-cost component of the South African economy and road transport dominates it. Road transport energy is provided by diesel and petrol, of which 60 % is sourced from imported crude oil, the rest from a once unique and still world-leading synthetic fuels (synfuels) industry that converts local coal and natural gas into liquid fuels. South Africa grows maize and sugar crops in excess of local needs, so is well positioned to produce bio-ethanol. Bio-ethanol can replace petrol from imported crude oil and save valuable foreign exchange, contribute to the local economy, generate or save jobs and enhance energy security. The South African approach is based on a proposed 10 % blend of ethanol into the petrol pool of about 11 billion litres. High oil prices and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions make investment in biofuels desirable. This article examines the economics of investments in liquid biofuel production, both from a national interest and a commercial perspective. It concludes that fuel bio-ethanol investment is desirable from a national economic perspective and thus fiscal support is justified. Support is necessary to cater for low oil price scenarios and to warrant commercial investment. The government needs to balance the needs of investors and feedstock crop-growers with those of the public, in particular the fuel consumers, by providing the right level of support. Given future price uncertainties, finding this right level of support is likely to be an ongoing process. © 2006 International Energy Initiative, Inc.

AB  - Ethanol derived from sugarcane is an efficient and renewable biofuel that appears as a solution to the problems of rural development, diversification of energy sources, and fossil fuel-saving, as well as contributing to the reduction of local pollutants from vehicle exhausts and net reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. During the 30 years of the Brazilian Alcohol Program, Brazil has accumulated a significant amount of experience in the various aspects of sugarcane ethanol production. This paper discusses this experience and the lessons learned, with special attention paid to the following aspects: (1) private investments now fund alcohol mill construction, eliminating the need for subsidies or other government incentives (so there is no influence of the sunk capital investments made in the past), and it is competitive with gasoline without the need for government subsidies to the industry; (2) the favorable energy balance of ethanol; (3) there is no competition for land with food crops; (4) the quality of jobs and social impacts; (5) the compatibility of existing fleets with ethanol-gasoline blends; (6) adequate legislation can control local environmental impacts associated with feedstock production and biofuel manufacture; (7) perspectives for the replication of the Brazilian ethanol program in other developing countries. © 2006 International Energy Initiative, Inc.

AB  - The present energy crisis has reactivated worldwide the interest in biofuels, particularly in developing countries that are dependent on import of petroleum products and may have, in terms of land availability and climatic conditions, the potential for large-scale biomass production. Various routes are possible for converting biomass into transport fuel. Technologies and processes are described and fuel properties compared to those of the fuels they are supposed to substitute. Emphasis is given to the first generation biofuels, biodiesel and bioethanol, as the second-generation biofuels using whole biomass are still at an early stage of development and would require long and strong public support to be available on an industrial scale. A big consideration is biomass supply, as these resources may affect land availability and competition with food and feed production. These aspects are addressed in a separate paper. Small-scale stand-alone power generation is briefly discussed, as is the possible use of straight vegetable oil (SVO). The main barrier to the development ofbiofuel is economic. That is why cost considerations are developed. However, assessing the cost of biofuel is not easy because the feedstock biomass accounts for the largest part of the total costs and therefore the total cost depends greatly on national policy and subsidy frameworks. The paper concludes with some socio-economic considerations and discusses opportunities for implementing transport biofuel programmes in developing countries. © 2006 International Energy Initiative, Inc.

AB  - Radiocarbon analysis was performed by liquid scintillation counting (LSC) and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) to assess whether the content of biological components in hydrocarbon fuels could be derived. Different fuel mixtures were prepared containing bioethanol, fossil ethanol, and fossil gasoline. The specific 14C activity of these mixtures was obtained from LSC measurements and directly related to the concentration of carbon originating from the bioethanol (biocarbon). The results were checked via standardized carbon dating procedures and AMS. A good linear correlation exists between the fuel mixture's specific 14C activity and the concentration of biocarbon. Also, the biocarbon fraction of the fuel mixture (the ratio biocarbon: total carbon) and the normalized fraction of biocarbon (%M) showed good linear correlation. Therefore, both relations provide a possibility to quantitatively determine a fuel's biocarbon content by 14C analysis. When the sample composition is known (e.g. resolved by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy [GC-MS] and nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR]), the amount of particular biological components in a fuel sample can be derived subsequently. For mixtures of bioethanol, fossil ethanol, and gasoline with bioethanol contents in the range of 0.5-2% m/m, it was found that errors in the normalized fraction of biocarbon (%M) were in the range of 25-10%, respectively. For samples with a higher bioethanol content (up to pure bioethanol), the errors in %M were &lt;10%. Errors might be larger if substantial changes in the concentration of atmospheric 14C took place during the growth period of the biofuel feedstock. By taking into account the variation in specific 14C activity of carbon over the last decades, and by modeling simple tree-growth, it could be illustrated that this effect becomes significant only if the biofuel feedstock stopped growing more than 1 decade ago, e.g. with wood from constructions. © 2006 by the Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of the University of Arizona.

AB  - Vegetable oils used as fuel for Diesel engines are the object of an increasing interest in sectors like agriculture, electricity generation or transportation, in Southern countries as much as in Northern countries. The recent directive of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union clearly expresses the will to promote the use of biofuels for transportation from 2005 onwards. Equipments and machines adapted or designed for the use of biofuels including vegetable oils should soon be launched on the market. In a context of high and increasing oil prices, we can wonder about the energy opportunities of cotton oil whose yield per hectare varies between 100 and 300 litres according to the site. Previous works and some applications started since the end of the 1980s show that cotton oil used as biofuel presents the same behaviour as rapeseed oil or sunflower oil used more and more massively in Europe. Technical constraints of use are pointed out for engines as well as burners. If equipments are adapted, performances and efficiencies are very close, sometimes better, than those of petroleum products. Pollutant emissions are also identical with the advantage that vegetable oils do not reject fossil CO2 in the atmosphere. Two examples of use in Africa, since 1988, of cotton oil as biofuel are mentioned.

AB  - This study characterizes the compositions of two biodiesel vapors, soy biodiesel and waste cooking oil biodiesel, to provide a comprehensive understanding of biodiesels. Vapor phases were sampled by purging oil vapors through thermal desorption tubes which were then analyzed by the thermal desorption/GC/MS system. The results show that the compounds of biodiesel vapors can be divided into four groups. They include methyl esters (the main biodiesel components), oxygenated chemicals, alkanes and alkenes, and aromatics. The first two chemical groups are only found in biodiesel vapors, not in the diesel vapor emissions. The percentages of mean concentrations for methyl esters, oxygenated chemicals, alkanes and alkenes, and aromatics are 66.1%, 22.8%, 4.8% and 6.4%, respectively for soy biodiesel, and 35.8%, 35.9%, 27.9% and 0.3%, respectively for waste cooking oil biodiesel at a temperature of 25 ± 2 °C. These results show that biodiesels have fewer chemicals and lower concentrations in vapor phase than petroleum diesel, and the total emission rates are between one-sixteenth and one-sixth of that of diesel emission, corresponding to fuel evaporative emissions of loading losses of between 106 μg l-1 and 283 μg l-1. Although diesels generate more vapor phase emissions, biodiesels still generate considerable amount of vapor emissions, particularly the emissions from methyl esters and oxygenated chemicals. These two chemical groups are more reactive than alkanes and aromatics. Therefore, speciation and quantification of biodiesel vapor phases are important. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biofuels are expected to play an increasingly important role in the transportation market, as we search for ways to reduce fossil fuels depletion and emissions. However, the extent to which biofuel can displace petroleum-based fuels depends on the efficiency with which it can be produced. To demonstrate that biofuel has a positive energy balance-i.e. more energy is contained in the fuel than is used in the production-a life-cycle approach must be employed. This paper presents a Life-Cycle Energy Analysis of bioethanol (from sugar beet or wheat) and bioETBE systems in France. Physical and economic data was collected. A systemic description was implemented and the energy used throughout was calculated. A novel indicator aiming at characterizing the renewability of (bio)energy sources is proposed-the energy renewability efficiency (ERenEf). ERenEf measures the fraction of final fuel energy obtained from renewable sources. Inventory results-calculated using four different allocation approaches and ignoring co-product credits-are analyzed in order to understand the effect of allocation in the energy efficiency and renewability results. Sensitivity analysis shows that allocation has a major influence in the results. This research concludes that bioethanol produced in France is clearly favorable in terms of primary energy. A maximum ERenEf value of 48% was obtained for wheat-based ethanol (mass allocation), meaning that 48% of the biofuel energy content is indeed renewable energy. Fossil energy savings when gasoline is displaced by bioethanol, bioETBE or E5 are calculated. In particular, pure bioethanol may save up to 0.70 MJ, depending on whether wheat or sugar beet is used and on the allocation procedure adopted. © 2006.

AB  - This study aims to identify and evaluate the biomass utilization options and evaluate the sustainable biomass production for combined heat and power (CHP) in Turkey. The total biomass energy potential of Turkey is about 32 Mtoe. The amount of usable biomass potential of Turkey is approximately 17 Mtoe. Among the biomass energy sources, fuel wood seems to be one of the most interesting because its share of the total energy production of Turkey is high at 21%. The use of biofuels for CHP on a large scale is focused mainly on forest industry sites, where considerable quantities of biomass are available. Biomass available for energy can be converted to different types of final energy (e.g., electricity, heat), of these, the production of electricity appears to be particularly important. While CHP provides several environmental benefits by making use of waste heat and waste products, air pollution is a concern any time fossil fuels or biomass are burned. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Al2O3 and H3PO4/ Al2O3 catalysts were investigated in the conversion of oleic acid to biofuels and biolubricant at 1 atm and at 623 K. The catalytic tests were performed in a fixed bed and continuous flow reactor, using an oleic acid-catalyst ratio of 4 and N2 as the carrier gas. The reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography and acidity measurements. N2 adsorption-desorption, X ray diffraction, 31P nuclear magnetic resonance and FT-IR spectroscopy were also employed to evaluate the textural, structural and acidic properties of the catalysts. The results showed that phosphoric acid impregnation improved the alumina decarboxylation activities, generating hydrocarbons in the range of gasoline, diesel oil and lubricant oil. The best catalytic performance was achieved with the highest surface area alumina impregnated with H3PO4, which was the solid that allied high total acidity with a large quantity of mesopores. © 2006.

AB  - Governor Christine Gregoire of Washington has presented an "energy independence" policy based on biofuels like biodiesel that would build a market for crops such as canola. It would also encourage bioenergy ventures from seed-crushing plants to manure digesters. A basic step in the legislation would require a minimum of two percent biodiesel in all diesel fuel sold in the state, while farmers would know they'd get paid for growing canola seed for use in making biodiesel. John Plaza of Seattle Biodiesel called the proposal "incredibly important" for getting the industry up and running.

AB  - In this study, the applicabilities of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been investigated for the performance and exhaust-emission values of a diesel engine fueled with biodiesels from different feedstocks and petroleum diesel fuels. The engine performance and emissions characteristics of two different petroleum diesel-fuels (No. 1 and No. 2), biodiesels (from soybean oil and yellow grease), and their 20% blends with No. 2 diesel fuel were used as experimental results. The fuels were tested at full load (100%) at 1400-rpm engine speed, where the engine torque was 257.6 Nm. To train the network, the average molecular weight, net heat of combustion, specific gravity, kinematic viscosity, C/H ratio and cetane number of each fuel are used as the input layer, while outputs are the brake specific fuel-consumption, exhaust temperature, and exhaust emissions. The back-propagation learning algorithm with three different variants, single layer, and logistic sigmoid transfer function were used in the network. By using weights in the network, formulations have been given for each output. The network has yielded R2 values of 0.99 and the mean % errors are smaller than 4.2 for the training data, while the R2 values are about 0.99 and the mean % errors are smaller than 5.5 for the test data. The performance and exhaust emissions from a diesel engine, using biodiesel blends with No. 2 diesel fuel up to 20%, have been predicted using the ANN model. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Size- and time-resolved aerosol samples were collected using an eight-stage Davis rotating unit for monitoring (DRUM) sampler from 29 March to 29 May in 2002 at Gosan, Jeju Island, Korea, which is one of the representative background sites in East Asia. These samples were analyzed using synchrotron X-ray fluorescence for 3-h average concentrations of 19 elements consisting of S, Si, Al, Fe, Ca, Cl, Cu, Zn, Ti, K, Mn, Pb, Ni, V, Se, As, Rb, Cr, Br. The size-resolved data sets were then analyzed using the positive matrix factorization (PMF) technique in order to identify possible sources and estimate their contribution to particulate matter mass. PMF analysis uses the uncertainty of the measured data to provide an optimal weighting. Fifteen sources were resolved in eight size ranges (0.07-12 μm) and included continental soil, local soil, sea salt, biomass/biofuel burning, coal combustion, oil heating furnace, residual oil fired boiler, municipal incineration, non-ferrous metal source, ferrous metal source, gasoline vehicle, diesel vehicle, copper smelter and volcanic emission. PMF analysis of size-resolved source contributions showed that natural sources represented by local soil, sea salt and continental soil contributed about 79% to the predicted primary particulate matter (PM) mass in the coarse size range (1.15-12 μm). On the other hand, anthropogenic sources such as coal combustion and biomass/biofuel burning contributed about 60% in the fine size range (0.5-2.5 μm). The diesel vehicle source contributed the most in the ultra-fine size range (0.07-0.56 μm) and was responsible for about 52% of the primary PM mass. © 2006 Author(s).

AB  - The separation behavior of diesel fuel and biodiesel as well as mixtures of both components in model separators were studied on a laboratory scale. Under short times of exposure (4 wk), higher amounts of biodiesel caused a slightly faster change of the test values of the water phase (TC, TOC, electric conductivity, pH-value), whereas after much longer times of exposure (24 wk), especially high amounts of diesel fuel were responsible for significant changes of the test values. The observed tendencies were intensified by increase of temperature, addition of tensides or de-icing salt; the tendencies were diminished as expected, when 20% of the water was exchanged periodically.

AB  - Greenhouse gas emission assessments of energy supply systems have traditionally included the CO2 emissions produced as the fuel is burned. A lot of models and calculations for evaluating greenhouse gas emission savings by using bioenergy have been introduced. The approaches often cover a major part or sometimes even the whole energy system. The biofuel production process itself is one piece that is normally covered very briefly or considered insignificant. Unfortunately, this means that the significance of some affecting factors might not have been estimated. The object of the thesis was to study the greenhouse gas balances in connection with the harvesting and production of biofuels and, based on this, evaluate in what situations there is a need to re-evaluate the potentials of greenhouse gas emission savings when using bioenergy for substituting fossil fuels. Different methodologies were used in the separate evaluations: the philosophy and methodology of industrial ecology was used to analyse the sustainability and material flows of the Finnish forest industry. A simple calculation model was developed for analysing the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions for biomass production chains, upgrading of biofuels and production of solid recovered fuels. Emission risks from long-time storage of biofuel and biodegradable material were evaluated as well as changes in forest soil carbon due to harvesting of forest residues. The examination of the biofuel production chains showed that in a favourable situation as much as 97-98% of greenhouse gas emissions for a fossil fuel could be avoided by substituting it with a biofuel. On the other hand the investigation also pointed out that e.g. increasing fuel storage and upgrading activities for biofuels are likely to decrease this percentage remarkably. The main conclusion of the thesis was that the neutrality of greenhouse gas emissions when producing bioenergy should be re-evaluated. The author further suggests that tools and stimulants for keeping the greenhouse gas emission levels in fuel production chains as low as possible should be developed.

AB  - The biological treatment of wastewater discharged from a biodiesel fuel (BDF) production plant conducting alkali catalysis transesterification was investigated. BDF wastewater has a high pH and high hexane-extracted oil and low nitrogen concentrations, and inhibits the growth of microorganisms. The biological treatment of BDF wastewater is difficult because the composition of such wastewater is not suitable for microbial growth. To apply the microbiological treatment of BDF wastewater using an oil degradable yeast, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, the pH was adjusted to 6.8 and several nutrients such as a nitrogen source (ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride or urea), yeast extract, KH2PO4 and MgSO4·7H 2O were added to the wastewater. The optimal initial concentration of yeast extract was 1 g/l and the optimal C/N ratio was between 17 and 68 when using urea as a nitrogen source. A growth inhibitor was also present in the BDF wastewater, and this growth inhibitor could be detected by measuring the solid content in an aqueous phase after the hexane extraction of the wastewater. Microorganisms could not grow at solid contents higher than 2.14 g/l in the wastewater. To avoid the growth inhibition, the BDF wastewater was diluted with the same volume of water. Oil degradation in the diluted BDF wastewater was observed and the best result was obtained under the determined optimal conditions. This treatment system is simple because no controllers, except for a temperature, are necessary. These results suggest that the biological treatment system developed for BDF wastewater is useful for small-scale BDF production plants. © 2005, The Society for Biotechnology.

AB  - The feasibility of using ultrasonic mixing to obtain biodiesel from soybean oil was established. The alkaline transesterification reaction was studied at three levels of temperature and four alcohol-to-oil ratios. Excellent yields were obtained for all conditions. For example, at 40°C with ultrasonic agitation and a molar ratio of 6:1 methanol/oil, the conversion to FAME was greater than 99.4% after about 15 min. For a 6:1 methanol/oil ratio and a 25 to 60°C temperature range, a pseudo second-order kinetic model was confirmed for the hydrolysis of DC and TG. Reaction rate constants were three to five times higher than those reported in the literature for mechanical agitation. We suspect that the observed mass transfer and kinetic rate enhancements were due to the increase in interfacial area and activity of the microscopic and macroscopic bubbles formed when ultrasonic waves of 20 kHz were applied to a two-phase reaction system.

AB  - Budget estimate for carbonaceous aerosols including black carbon (BC) and organic carbon, emitted from the combustion of various fuels, is very important for regional climate studies. Emission factors for carbonaceous aerosols from bio-fuels and soft coke were determined in a controlled combustion study. The emission factors thus obtained along with those available for other fossil fuels consumed in different sectors have been applied to assess the budget for carbonaceous aerosols from India. Preliminary calculations give a range of 1.6-1.8 Tg of carbonaceous aerosols that include 0.4-1.4 Tg of BC. A major (∼80%) portion of carbonaceous aerosols emitted from India is found to originate from the use of biomass for energy as 70-80% of energy requirement in rural India is met by combustion of traditional bio-fuels. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A life cycle assessment of different cropping systems emphasizing corn and soybean production was performed, assuming that biomass from the cropping systems is utilized for producing biofuels (i.e., ethanol and biodiesel). The functional unit is defined as 1 ha of arable land producing biomass for biofuels to compare the environmental performance of the different cropping systems. The external functions are allocated by introducing alternative product systems (the system expansion allocation approach). Nonrenewable energy consumption, global warming impact, acidification and eutrophication are considered as potential environmental impacts and estimated by characterization factors given by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA-TRACI). The benefits of corn stover removal are (1) lower nitrogen related environmental burdens from the soil, (2) higher ethanol production rate per unit arable land, and (3) energy recovery from lignin-rich fermentation residues, while the disadvantages of corn stover removal are a lower accumulation rate of soil organic carbon and higher fuel consumption in harvesting corn stover. Planting winter cover crops can compensate for some disadvantages (i.e., soil organic carbon levels and soil erosion) of removing corn stover. Cover crops also permit more corn stover to be harvested. Thus, utilization of corn stover and winter cover crops can improve the eco-efficiency of the cropping systems. When biomass from the cropping systems is utilized for biofuel production, all the cropping systems studied here offer environmental benefits in terms of nonrenewable energy consumption and global warming impact. Therefore utilizing biomass for biofuels would save nonrenewable energy, and reduce greenhouse gases. However, unless additional measures such as planting cover crops were taken, utilization of biomass for biofuels would also tend to increase acidification and eutrophication, primarily because large nitrogen (and phosphorus)-related environmental burdens are released from the soil during cultivation. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A discussion covers oil reserves and resources; oil price and security of supply; demands on the environment and future capability; alternative fuels; biofuels; efforts to date of the political will with respect to the use of rapeseed methyl ester (RME) and ethanol at refineries in Germany; increasing the security of supply by biofuels; climate protection; the ethanol added value chain; policy goals with respect to the use of bio motor fuels; and conclusions. World oil reserves are more than adequate to cover world needs for petroleum in the coming 50 yr. The availability depends on technological developments and price that the economy is willing to pay. The oil price determines the E&amp;P of existing and new resources. A "path from oil" is in terms of availability, significance, and advantages of petroleum not worthwhile or realistic. Independent of the long term range, short term availability affects the price of oil. In 2004, the reserve capacity at a world need of 82.5 million bpd dropped to under 2 million bpd. The low crude oil prices of the 1990s that signaled an oversupply in crude oil limited investments in new production fields now have their effect. The increase in demand of the past years has shrunken reserve capacities. The result is strong price increases that offer a stimulus for investments in production. Motor fuels from petroleum have contributed to the Auto-Oil program. For gasoline this means for example the reduction of the vapor pressure in summer, limiting the aromatics content, especially benzene, and limiting the olefins content. For diesel motor fuels, the cetane index has been increased and the admissible density reduced. All types of motor fuels have been converted to sulfur-free quality enabling efficient exhaust gas technologies. Particle filters are no problem to the petroleum industry. Particles and other emissions can be reduced to almost nil. The supply structure for Ad Blue enables efficient reduction of NOx emissions from utility vehicles. CO2 exhausts are inescapable when using fossil fuels but by the increasingly higher quality of motor fuels it is possible to further increase the efficiency of modem energies and thus reduce the exhaust of CO2. The list of alternative motor fuels is long but not all of them are equally suitable. Fossil fuels will still cover 90% of the energy needs for individual mobility in 2020. Up to 2010 biofuels such as bioethanol and biodiesel will play increasing roles in the fuel mix. The use of ethanol as pure fuel or mixed at high concentrations in gasoline will not occur. Up to 2020 this use will of slight worth.

AB  - The development of motor drives at Volkswagen AG takes the progression from turbo direct injection (TDI) and fuel stratified injection (FSI) of fossil fuels then to hybrid, TDI and TFSI of synthetic fuels from gas to liquids (GTL) and coal to liquids (CtL), then to the combined combustion system (CCS) with renewable SunFuel®, and then to fuel cell drives with renewable hydrogen. The key point is the development and increase in efficiency of the TDI and FSI engine concept and its implementation in a hybrid system and especially melding the combustion process into the CCS. This new combustion system combines low emissions from the gasoline engine with the high efficiency of diesel combustion. The potential of the CCS combustion process will be expanded with use of synthetic motor fuels from alternative energy carriers. The socalled designer motor fuel SunFuel can be more exactly tailored to the needs of the combustion process and enables futuristic drive technologies. SunFuel from alternative fossil energy carriers (natural gas and coal) or SunFuel from biomass will contribute more in the future to provide for the security of mobility and give the needed time to develop fuel cells for mass production. The quality and chemical composition of SynFuel are identical whether made from GtL, CtL, or biomass to liquid. The SynFuel can be used in present and future combustion engines. Volkswagen also supports the EU directive to promote renewable motor fuels. For the time being, to comply with the EU Biofuel Directive conventional renewable ethanol and biodiesel motor fuels must be used. Volkswagen promotes ETBE. ETBE is made from the reaction of ethanol (60%) with isobutene (40%). ETBE can be mixed with gasoline to 15 vol % without effects on engines. Volkswagen approves the increasing mixing with diesel fuel such as with use of RME to comply with the biofuel directive. Volkswagen does not pursue the use of pure biodiesel (B100) because diesel vehicles today that operate with biodiesel do not comply with emissions limits and the biodiesel damages their particle filters.

AB  - Tools are needed to evaluate and compare different available feedstocks, and process parameters and modifications for biodiesel production. To address this need, a biodiesel process model was developed with commonly used spreadsheet software and process-engineering principles. The basis of the model is a continuous process with two stirred-tank reactors and sodium methoxide catalysis. The process was modeled as 27 units with 51 flows and 18 components. Mass flow rates and compositions of the process input and output streams were quantified using mass and component balances, energy balances, stoichiometric relations, and established process parameters. Oil composition and rate, methanol:triglyceride ratio, and expected transesterification of triglyceride were the user-specified inputs in the model. Based on commonly reported parameters (6:1 methanol:triglyceride ratio and 98% transesterification) and a basis of 100 kg/h crude soybean oil, the model computes (in kg/h) inputs of 13.8, 10.8, 34.7 for methanol, 10% sodium methoxide in methanol, and process water, respectively, and outputs of 93.5, 10.3, 55.6 for soy biodiesel, glycerol, and waste stream, respectively. These mass flow rates can be linked to cost data for calculating the material costs from various feedstocks, and can be readily adapted to factor in alternative parameters and units. © 2005 American Society of Agricultural Engineers.

AB  - A comprehensive study of biodiesel preparation from canola oil was performed on a continuous-flow reactive distillation (RD) reactor system. Optimization of six process variables was studied experimentally and analyzed statistically on the overall performance of the RD reactor system. These variables include the feed methanol to triglycerides molar ratio, reaction time, reboiler temperature, catalyst concentration, methanol circulation mode, and catalyst formulation. An experimental design was used in the experiments, and statistical multiple response regression models were employed for process optimization. Under the operating conditions explored, product yields ranged from 41.5% to 94.9%, productivity ranged from 16 to 55.8 kmol/m 3·h (5.6 to 19.5 m3/m3·h), and soap formation varied from 4.44 to 29.1 mol/100 mol (0.19 to 1.27%wt.). For different optimization criteria, the following optimum variable ranges were found: feed molar ratio from 3.65:1 to 4.50:1, reaction time from 3.76 to 5.56 min, reboiler temperature from 100°C to 130°C, and catalyst concentration from 0.13 to 0.24 mol/mol. Although the process variables individually affected the system performance to a certain extent, the interactive effect of the process variable combinations affected the system efficiency more significantly. When maximized, the product yields and productivity were 98.8% and 55.6 kmol/m3·h (18.5 m 3/m3·h), respectively. However, when soap formation was minimized, the yield and productivity were 72% and 9.3 kmol/m 3·h (3.1 m3/m3·h), respectively. It is recommended that the optimization of the RD reactor system be based on the maximization of product yield and reactor productivity. © 2005 American Society of Agricultural Engineers.

AB  - Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was used to compare energy consumption and pollutant emissions of two oxygen biofuels, ethanol and methyl ester, which were mixed with gasoline and diesel oil at levels of 10% and 30% of the biofuel. The future of oxygen-containing biofuels was analyzed and forecasted. The results show that the mixture of biofuels and petroleum products can reduce crude oil consumption, but only methyl ester alternative fuel can reduce fossil fuel consumption. Use of methyl ester mixtures would reduce NOx by 50% compared to gasoline or diesel on a life cycle basis; however, NOx would increase using ethanol. Each alternative fuel mixture reduced PM10 emissions from the vehicle and methyl ester decreased VOCs. The SO2 emissions from the fuel production processes, which account for about 80% of SO2 life cycle emissions, must be strictly controlled.

AB  - Transesterification of vegetable oils in supercritical methanol are carried out without using any catalyst. Methyl esters of vegetable oils or biodiesels have several outstanding advantages among other new-renewable and clean engine fuel alternatives and can be used in any diesel engine without modification. The most important variables affecting the methyl ester yield during the transesterification reaction are molar ratio of alcohol to vegetable oil and reaction temperature. Compared to no. 2 Diesel fuel, all vegetable oils are more viscous, while the methyl esters of vegetable oils are slightly more viscous. Biodiesel has become more attractive because of its environmental benefits. The cost of biodiesel, however, is the main obstacle to commercialization. With cooking oils as raw material, viability of a continuous transesterification process and recovery of high quality glycerol as a biodiesel by-product are primary options to be considered to lower the cost of biodiesel. Supercritical methanol has a high potential for both transesterification of triglycerides and methyl esterification of free fatty acids to methyl esters for diesel fuel substitute. In supercritical methanol transesterification method, yield of conversion rises 95% in 10 min. Viscosity of vegetable oils (27.2-53.6 mm2/s) get reduced in vegetable oil methyl esters (3.59-4.63 mm2/s). The flash point values of vegetable oil methyl esters are highly lower than those of vegetable oils. An increase in density from 860 to 885 kg/m3 for vegetable oil methyl esters increases the viscosity from 3.59 to 4.63 mm2/s.

AB  - Biodiesel, a fuel comprised of mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils or animal fat (or mixtures thereof), is produced by transesterification with glycerol being produced as a co-product. Worldwide, 1 billion ton of diesel fuel are consumed annually. The total feedstocks available for biodiesel production are 115 million tons. This represents less than 12% of diesel fuel use. The opportunities for the future for biodiesel include improvements in the conversion technology, which appears promising, and expanding the amount of available feedstock through various plans to increase oil yields or oilseed production.

AB  - This paper presents recent developments on biodiesel production from palm oil, its properties and engine test results to evaluate its performance on diesel engine. The potential of palm diesel to be commercially used depends on its price comparison with diesel fuel and its status of reservation. Increasing cost and pollution effects of fossil diesel fuel can be resolved through producing vegetable oil based fuels such as palm diesel. This paper discusses Malaysian palm diesel as well as global biodiesel status, standardization of biodiesel and their commercial price consideration and various engine test results on aspects of brake power, combustion, emissions, engine wear and lubrication performance.

AB  - Mahua oil methyl, ethyl and butyl esters were prepared and studied in a four stroke, direct injection diesel engine for their performance and emissions. The engine test results showed high thermal efficiency in case of methyl ester compared to all other esters and diesel fuel. Different emissions such as carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), hydrocarbons (HC) is low for alkyl esters compared to diesel. Among alkyl esters except NOx all tail pipe emissions are lower in case of methyl ester compared to other esters. The ethyl ester shows lower NOx emission compared to other esters. Based on this study, mahua oil methyl ester performs well compared to other esters on the basis of performance and emissions.

AB  - Oil was extracted from tomato seeds, tested for several important alternative fuel properties and compared with other vegetable oils. The oil yield of tomato seeds is about 35% on a dry weight basis. This vegetable oil has low volatility, low sulphur, low ash content, and high viscosity. Cetane number, density as well as the cold flow properties are similar to those of other vegetable oils. The fatty acid profile of tomato seed oil shows that there is a predominance of compounds containing an even number of carbon atoms, especially C16 and C18. The total saturated and unsaturated fatty acid composition is 18.28% and 81.72%, respectively, and the most abundant fatty acid is linoleic acid (56.12%). This study indicates that tomato seed oil is a renewable energy source and a promising fuel substitute which could be used in the diesel engine to bring down the consumption of the conventional petroleum products. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study compares the land use impacts of sustainable transportation scenarios. Energy efficiency is calculated for four hypothetical, renewable fuel cycles possible for light vehicles: (1) renewable electricity to electrolytic hydrogen to fuel cell vehicles, (2) renewable electricity to battery electric vehicles, (3) biomass gasified to hydrogen to fuel cell vehicles and (4) biomass liquefied to biofuel to fuel cell vehicles. A presumption of 200 W/m 2 nominal average insolation allows comparison of the fuel cycle efficiencies on a land use basis. The two electricity-based fuel cycles show much higher calculated efficiencies (and lower land uses) than the biomass-based fuel cycles. The use of hydrogen as an energy carrier improves the performance of the biomass resource, but does not show a distinct advantage in performance of the electricity resource. Finally, gross land use is calculated for the particular instance of the U.S. light vehicle fleet, for each of the four fuel cycles. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this work is to study the effect of specific fatty acid methyl esters preset in biofuels on particulate matter emissions. A typical diesel fuel supplied in petrol stations (reference), two biofuels composed of methyl esters from the transesterification process of waste oils with different origins and some blends of biofuels with the reference fuel were tested in a commercial direct injection engine reproducing five modes of the European transient urban/extraurban certification cycle. Results from the tests are fitted using neural networks (NN). The equations allow the amount of soluble and insoluble material of Diesel particulates to be determined as a function of engine operating conditions and fuel composition. Simulation from NNs equations proves that the amount of palmitic acid methyl ester in fuels is the main factor affecting the amount of insoluble material emitted due to its higher oxygen content and cetane number. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Biofuels Directive places an onus on EU member states to ensure that biofuels are placed on their markets. This paper investigates the use of CH 4-enriched biogas as a fuel. A number of options, which produce CH4-enriched biogas, were analysed from technical, economic and environmental perspectives. Biogas may be produced at a centralised anaerobic digestion (CAD) facility, accepting agricultural slurries plus a portion (typically 20%) of municipal waste such as the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). Alternatively, OFMSW may be the sole feedstock utilised in the dry anaerobic combustion (DRANCO) process. Importation of green electricity to satisfy parasitic electrical demand and the burning of biogas to satisfy thermal demand was found to be more advantageous than using biogas in a combined heat and power (CHP) plant to cover parasitic electrical and thermal demand. The DRANCO process produced more fuel than the CAD process due to the lower thermal demand of the digester. The economics of the DRANCO process were superior to the CAD process due to the greater gate fee (it is assumed that no gate fee is obtained from agricultural slurry) and the greater quantity of biogas available for sale. The DRANCO process leads to greater greenhouse-gas savings than the CAD process due to the displacement of more OFMSW from landfill and more petrol from transport. The options when applied to Ireland could lead to a substitution of 1% of petrol and diesel and to a 12% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions from the transport sector. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study we determined the oxidative activity of combustion particles derived from the biomass fuel dung cake by examining their capacity to deplete antioxidants from a model human respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF). For comparison, the observed oxidative activity was compared with that of particles derived from industrial and vehicular sources. Results: Incubation of the dung cake particle suspensions in the RTLF for 4 h resulted in a mean loss of ascorbate of 72.1 ± 0.7 and 89.7 ± 2.5% at 50 and 100 μ/ml, respectively. Reduced glutathione was depleted by 49.6 ± 4.3 and 63.5 ± 22.4% under the same conditions. The capacity of these samples to deplete ascorbate was in excess of that observed with diesel or gasoline particles, but comparable to that seen with residual oil fly ash and considerably in excess of all three control particles in terms of glutathione depletion. Co-incubation with the metal chelator diethylenetriaminepentaacetate inhibited these losses, whilst minimal inhibition was seen with superoxide dismutase and catalase treatment. The majority of the activity observed appeared to be contained within aqueous particle extracts. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that biomass derived particles have considerable oxidative activity, largely attributable to their transition metal content. © 2005 Mudway et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Wind energy, solar energy, and biomass energy sources are expected to become economically feasible for the glass and ceramic industries, with the increasing fossil-fuel prices and decreasing renewable energy. Renewable energy refers to energy sources that are continually replenished from either the Sun or the Earth. Fossil-fuel, such as petroleum, natural gas, coal, and nuclear are not considered renewable. Solar power can be used for either heating or electric generation. Concentrating solar collectors use parabolic mirrors to produce steam that drives turbines. Biomass can be manipulated to make liquid and gaseous biofuels, such as bio diesel, methane (CH4), and Hydrogen. Biosyngas is a burnable mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide (CO) generated by the gasification of cellulosic biomass in which the material is heated in a low-oxygen environment to break down the material without oxidizing it completely.

AB  - Fatty acid profiles of seed oils of 75 plant species having 30% or more fixed oil in their seed/kernel were examined. Saponification number (SN), iodine value (IV) and cetane number (CN) of fatty acid methyl esters of oils were empirically determined and they varied from 169.2 to 312.5, 4.8 to 212 and 20.56 to 67.47, respectively. Fatty acid compositions, IV and CN were used to predict the quality of fatty acid methyl esters of oil for use as biodiesel. Fatty acid methyl ester of oils of 26 species including Azadirachta indica, Calophyllum inophyllum, Jatropha curcas and Pongamia pinnata were found most suitable for use as biodiesel and they meet the major specification of biodiesel standards of USA, Germany and European Standard Organization. The fatty acid methyl esters of another 11 species meet the specification of biodiesel standard of USA only. These selected plants have great potential for biodiesel. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The fractional compositions of fatty acid methyl esters from rape and sunflower oils were determined by the method in GOST 2177-99. The data obtained can be used to calculate the characteristic temperatures and thermophysical parameters of biofuels. The difference in the boiling points of the esters and their vapors was established. The ingredients of the biofuels and their fractions were determined by gas-liquid chromatography. Fuels of plant origin evaporate in a narrow temperature range so that the fatty acid methyl esters are distributed very unevenly over all fractions. The results obtained can be used to create an adequate mathematical model of evaporation of biofuel in the diesel cylinder.

AB  - Biodiesel was prepared from the non-edible oil of Pongamia pinnata by transesterification of the crude oil with methanol in the presence of KOH as catalyst. A maximum conversion of 92% (oil to ester) was achieved using a 1:10 molar ratio of oil to methanol at 60°C. Tetrahydrofuran (THF), when used as a co-solvent increased the conversion to 95%. Solid acid catalysts viz. Hβ-Zeolite, Montmorillonite K-10 and ZnO were also used for this transesterification.

AB  - This paper presents a detailed analysis on different properties of two kind of animal fats and their suitability of using them as fuel in diesel engines. Initially, the physical and chemical properties (viscosity, low heating value (LHV) and chemical compositions) of animal fats are obtained experimentally. In the second phase of work, the animal fats are modified to form emulsions with water in different quantities. In the last phase, methanol is added to improve the physical properties of emulsions further. On the whole it is concluded that the animal fats can be transformed into a stable biofuel emulsions with improved physical and chemical properties and used as good alternative fuel in diesel engines. An optimum formulation is obtained by mixing 15% of water, 15% of methanol and 2% of surfactant. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A self-made lipase preparation from Candida sp. 99-125 was used for the production of biodiesel through enzymatic esterification of fatty acids. The crude lipase powder and fermentation broth were immobilized on a cheap fiber cloth carrier. The conditions of lipase-catalyzed esterification between long-chain fatty acids and methanol in a solvent system were investigated in detail, including the temperature, pH value, substrate concentration, solvent, absorbent agent, enzyme dosage and purity, immobilization method, the mode of addition of substrate. The results show that reaction temperature, pH of lipase micro-environment, substrate concentration, enzyme dosage and purity affect the esterification strongly. Several new methods and enzymatic procedures for improving the enzymatic reaction involving the process cost are also discussed, such as fossil diesel fuel as reaction solvent, immobilization method, multi-step gradient addition of methanol. The esterification degree of 92.8% was obtained with oleic acid and methanol under the optimal reaction condition after 12.5 h reaction time. The half-life of the immobilized lipase preparation from crude free lipase powder for esterification was 15 days.

AB  - A study was performed of the transesterification reaction of used frying oil by means of methanol, using sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium methoxide, and potassium methoxide as catalysts. The objective of the work was to characterize the methyl esters for use as biodiesels in compression ignition motors. The operation variables used were methanol/oil molar ratio (3:1-9:1), catalyst concentration (0.1-1.5 wt %), temperature (25-65 °C), and catalyst type. Also, experiments in two stages of reaction, with separation of the glycerol in the first stage, were carried out. The evolution of the process was followed by gas chromatography, determining the concentration of the methyl esters at different reaction times. The biodiesel was characterized by its density, viscosity, high heating value, cetane index, cloud and pour points, characteristics of distillation, flash and combustion points, saponification value, and iodine value according to ISO norms. The biodiesel with the best properties was obtained using a methanol/oil molar ratio of 6:1, potassium hydroxide as catalyst (1%), and 65 °C temperature. This biodiesel had properties very similar to those of no. 2 diesel. The two-stage transesterification was better than the one-stage process. © 2005 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Historical changes of black carbon (BC) and particulate organic matter (POM) emissions from biomass burning (BB) and fossil fuel (FF) burning are estimated from 1870 to 2000. A bottom-up inventory for open vegetation (OV) burning is scaled by a top-down estimate for the year 2000. Monthly and interannual variations are derived over the time period from 1979 to 2000 based on the TOMS satellite aerosol index (AI) and this global map. Prior to 1979, emissions are scaled to a CH4 emissions inventory based on land-use change. Biofuel (BF) emissions from a recent inventory for developing countries are scaled forward and backward in time using population statistics and crop production statistics. In developed countries, wood consumption data together with emission factors for cooking and heating practices are used for biofuel estimates. For fossil fuel use, we use fuel consumption data and specific emission factors for different fuel use categories to develop an inventory over 1950-2000, and emissions are scaled to a CO2 inventory prior to that time. Technology changes for emissions from the diesel transport sector are included. During the last decade of this time period, the BC and POM emissions from biomass burning (i.e., OV + BF) contribute a significant amount to the primary sources of BC and POM and are larger than those from FF. Thus 59% of the NH BC emissions and 90% of the NH POM emissions are from BB in 2000. Fossil fuel consumption technologies are needed prior to 1990 in order to improve estimates of fossil fuel emissions during the twentieth century. These results suggest that the aerosol emissions from biomass burning need to be represented realistically in climate change assessments. The estimated emissions are available on a 1° × 1° grid for global climate modeling studies of climate changes. Copyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.

AB  - As a contribution to the climate protection program and to CO2 reduction, the EU has made a commitment to the application of regenerative energy resources as a substitute for fossil fuels. Fatty acid esters are available as biofuel for use in diesel vehicles and bio-ethanol for use in spark ignition engines as regenerative energy resources according to Directive 2003/30/EG. These products are made from regenerative raw materials and are used as blending components. Apart from the reduction of CO2 emissions caused by road traffic, the intentions of the directive are to protect agricultural jobs and to reduce the dependency on imported crude oil. Problems arise with the increase of vapor pressure, when small amounts of ethanol are added to the fuel; furthermore, there are problems in the logistic chain regarding increased capacities of water absorption. This can result in a separation into two phases and in a change of fuel oil characteristics. The present laboratory test program aims to fully investigate the addition of ethanol to petrol to obtain a broad data basis.

AB  - Exposure to carbonaceous particles from biomass burning is associated with increased respiratory morbidity in both women and children in the developing world. However, the amount of carbon reaching lower airway cells has not been determined in these populations. Alveolar macrophages (AM) remove inhaled particulate matter (PM), and are implicated in the pathogenesis of PM-induced lung disease. In this study, we aimed to compare AM carbon loading in women and children exposed to biomass PM in Gondar, Ethiopia, with individuals exposed to fossil-fuel PM in the developed world (Leicester, UK). To achieve these aims, we sampled AM from Ethiopian mothers and children, and from UK adults and children using induced sputum (IS). AM were imaged under light microscopy, and the total two-dimensional surface area of carbon within each AM determined by image analysis. AM containing carbon were detected in all subjects. The total surface area of carbon per AM was higher in Ethiopian women (n=10) compared with UK adults (n=10, median 9.19 vs. 0.71 μm2/AM, p=0.0002). Similarly, the total surface area of carbon per AM was higher in Ethiopian children (n=10) compared with UK children (n=10, 3.32 vs. 0.44 μm2/AM, p=0.0002). However, loading in Ethiopian children was lower than paired maternal levels (3.32 vs. 9.19 μm2/AM, p=0.011). We conclude that analysis of AM obtained by induced sputum is a practical way of quantifying natural exposure of the lower airway to carbonaceous particles from the burning of biomass fuels. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study presents an efficiency and renewability analysis of the production of three biofuels: rapeseed methyl ester (RME), soybean methyl ester (SME) and corn-based ethanol (EtOH). The overall production chains have been taken into account: not only the agricultural crop production and the industrial conversion into biofuel, but also production of the supply of agricultural resources (pesticides, fertilizers, fuel, seeding material) and industrial resources (energy and chemicals) to transform the crops into biofuel. Simultaneously, byproducts of the agricultural and industrial processes have been taken into account when resources have to be allocated to the biofuels. The technical analysis via the second law of thermodynamics revealed that corn-based EtOH results in the highest production rate with an exergetic fuel content of 68.8 GJ ha-1 yr-1, whereas the RME and SME results were limited to 47.5 and 16.4 GJ ha-1 yr-1. The allocated nonrenewable resource input to deliver these biofuels is significant: 16.5, 15.4, and 5.6 MJ ha-1 yr-1. This meansthat these biofuels, generally considered as renewable resources, embed a nonrenewable fraction of one-quarter for EtOH and even one-third for RME and SME. This type of analysis provides scientifically sound quantitative information that is necessary with respect to the sustainability analysis of so-called renewable energy. © 2005 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Transportation of timber from forests to industrial sites consumes more fossil fuels than any other part of the Swedish wood supply chain. This paper compares the environmental performance and energy requirements of a range of possible long-distance transport strategies involving lorry or lorry-and-train combinations using a variety of potential fuels/energy carriers, including diesel-oil, coal, hydropower, nuclear fuel and biofuels. The total efficiency of the complete system (i.e. "well-to-wheel" efficiency) is considered. The results indicate that transport alternatives including railway transport require less process energy than options relying exclusively on road vehicles. However, calculations showed that by using biofuels instead of fossil fuel in a lorry, it is possible to replace 96% of the fossil energy. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The objective of this research was to develop a detailed numerical spray atomization, ignition, and combustion model for direct-injection diesel engines using KIVA3V code that could be applied to biodiesel fuels for investigating NOX emissions. Several modified or recalibrated submodels were incorporated into KIVA3V, including a KH-RT spray breakup model, a Shell ignition model, and a single-step kinetic combustion model. This modified model was applied to a John Deere 4045T direct-injection diesel engine fueled by a soybean methyl ester, a yellow grease methyl ester, and No. 2 diesel fuel. The output of the model was in close agreement with the experimental measurements of cylinder pressure and heat release rate from this engine. It was predicted from the modeling results that the two biodiesel fuels had shorter ignition delay and higher overall cylinder temperatures than diesel fuel. The in-cylinder spray analysis indicated that the soybean methyl ester had slightly longer penetration than diesel fuel, but the yellow grease methyl ester had shorter penetration than diesel fuel. Fewer particle numbers were predicted for the two biodiesel fuels. Both soybean methyl ester and yellow grease methyl ester had more widespread high-temperature distribution areas than diesel fuel, which could account for the increases in NOX emissions typically measured for biodiesel fuels. © 2005 American Society of Agricultural Engineers.

AB  - The use of ethanol blended with regular diesel fuel was a subject of research in the 1980s. It was shown that such blends were technically acceptable for existing diesel engines without modifications. Biodiesel as well as ethanol-blended E-diesel yielded substantial reductions in urban emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), greenhouse gases (primarily CO2), sulfur oxides (SOx), and paniculate matter (PM). The major drawback of E-diesel is that ethanol is immiscible in diesel over a wide range of temperatures. This study attempts to use biodiesel as a potential amphiphile in the ethanol-biodiesel system. The study looks into the phase behavior of the ethanol-biodiesel-diesel ternary system in order to identify key areas within the phase diagram that are stable isotropic micro-emulsions that could be used as potential biofuelsfor compression-ignition engines. The instantaneous phase behavior indicated that the system formulates stable micro-emulsions over a fairly large region of the phase triangle, depending on the concentrations of different components. The single-phase area of the three-component system was widest at higher biodiesel concentrations. The phase diagram indicated that at higher diesel concentrations, in order to formulate a stable micro-emulsion, the ratio of biodiesel to ethanol in the system should be greater than 1:1. The results of the study suggested that biodiesel could be effectively used as an amphiphile in an ethanol-diesel blend. © 2005 American Society of Agricultural Engineers.

AB  - Biofuels, with a positive global carbon dioxide balance from the well to the wheel, provide a solution of interest to the problem of climate warming. To be used in large quantity, numerous problems exist, notably in the chemical compounds themselves and upgrading the co-products. To reduce energy dependence on petroleum and to respond to the objectives of the Kyoto protocol, the European directive of 5/8/2003 anticipates increasing the biofuel share in the motor fuel pool from 2% in 2005 to 5.75% in 2010, in terms of energy content. Used pure, the gains in terms of greenhouse gas emissions is an estimated 60-90% for ethanol from cane sugar. In addition to cost and production capacity considerations there are problems to resolve in the use of biofuels. Today, ETBE and ethanol can be incorporated into gasoline. Produced from sugar cane or beet fermentation or from wheat, corn, and potato starch, after hydrolysis the ethanol can be incorporated into gasoline to as much as 5%. In France, ethanol is rarely used as such and more often as ETBE obtained by reaction of ethanol on isobutene, the rate of incorporation of which is limited to 15 vol %. Ethanol can form azeotropes in light gasoline fractions, increasing the vapor pressure and in the presence of water migrates to the bottom of the fuel tank. If the light fraction of gasoline is withdrawn, azeotropes do not form. Addition of co-solvents would impede ethanol from migrating to the bottom of the fuel tank. If light gasoline fractions are removed, use has to be found for them. Biofuels for diesel engines come from rapeseed and sunflower oil, soya, and palm oil. Reacted with methanol, they form EMHV (methylated vegetable oils) called biodiesel with the commercial name of Diester in France. Diesel motor fuel specifications (EN590) authorize incorporation of EMHV to 5 vol % in diesel fuel. The impact of this incorporation will become significant when the amount is increased to 30%. EMHV also reduces the amount of sulfur and aromatics in diesel fuels and increases the lubricating power of diesel motor fuels that are strongly desulfurized. Because of these incontestable advantages, research turns to the use ofEEHV (ethylated vegetable oil) to find an outlet for ethanol in biodiesel. In EMHV and EEHV there are storage problems in terms of stability and oxidation with time. There is also the question of valorizing glycerine which is a co-product. There is the approach of biomass-to-liquids in which biomass is converted to gas at high temperature and then to diesel by the Fischer-Tropsch process. Ethanol can also be converted to paraffins and integrated as such into diesel motor fuel. The composition of gasoline and the definition of bio fuels are cited and discussed.

AB  - Enzymatic transesterification of soybean oil with methanol and ethanol was studied. Of the nine lipases that were tested in the initial screening, lipase PS from Pseudomonas cepacia resulted in the highest yield of alkyl esters. Lipase from Pseudomonas cepacia was further investigated in immobilized form within a chemically inert, hydrophobic sol-gel support. The gel-entrapped lipase was prepared by polycondensation of hydrolyzed tetramethoxysilane and iso-butyltrimethoxysilane. Using the immobilized lipase PS, the effects of water and alcohol concentration, enzyme loading, enzyme thermal stability, and temperature in the transesterification reaction were investigated. The optimal conditions for processing 10 g of soybean oil were: 35°C, 1:7.5 oil/methanol molar ratio, 0.5 g water and 475 mg lipase for the reactions with methanol, and 35°C, 1:15.2 oil/ethanol molar ratio, 0.3 g water, 475 mg lipase for the reactions with ethanol. Subject to the optimal conditions, methyl and ethyl esters formation of 67 and 65 mol% in 1 h of reaction were obtained for the immobilized enzyme reactions. Upon the reaction with the immobilized lipase, the triglycerides reached negligible levels after the first 30 min of the reaction and the immobilized lipase was consistently more active than the free enzyme. The immobilized lipase also proved to be stable and lost little activity when was subjected to repeated uses. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The presence of small amounts of free glycerol in fatty acid methyl esters used as diesel fuel or as heating fuel may represent the reason for some failures in engines and heating systems as well. Several methods are actually available for the determination of free-glycerol traces in biodiesel, and most on them are based on gas-chromatographic techniques. After a review of the existing methods, a new procedure based on periodate oxidation of glycerol, leading to the preparation of formaldehyde, on reaction with acetylacetone and on spectrophotometric measurement at 410nm is illustrated. This method is simple, quick and economic and seems to be sufficiently reliable. Data related to recovery tests and analyses of real samples are shown, also in correlation with the existing reference method. © 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - When transesterifying alcohols with fats and oils to produce biodiesel, the phase behavior and respective distribution of catalyst and alcohol between liquid phases can significantly impact both reaction rates and product workup. To better understand this phase behavior, the distribution of methanol and catalysts, potassium hydroxide and sulfuric acid, between the biodiesel and alcohol phases was experimentally investigated and modeled. Experimental vapor-liquid equilibrium data were modeled by using the Wilson activity coefficient model and two temperature-independent model parameters are used to obtain good agreement between calculated and experimental data. The distribution coefficients of methanol between biodiesel and glycerin phases were accurately predicted by the VLE activity coefficients and Wilson model. © 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Vegetable oils pose some problems when subjected to prolonged usage in compression ignition engines because of their high viscosity and low volatility. The common problems are poor atomization, carbon deposits, ring sticking, fuel pump failure, etc. Converting the high viscosity vegetable oil into its blends or esters can minimize these problems. The various blends of rubber seed oil and diesel were prepared and its important properties such as viscosity, calorific value, flash point, fire point, etc. were evaluated and compared with that of diesel. The blends were then subjected to engine performance and emission tests and compared with that for diesel. It was found that 50-80% of rubber seed oil blends gave the best performance. Long run tests were conducted using optimized blend and diesel. It was found that blend fueled engine has higher carbon deposits inside combustion chamber than diesel-fueled engine. Utilization of blends requires frequent cleaning of fuel filter, pump and the combustion chamber. Hence, it is recommended that rubber seed oil-diesel blend fuel is more suitable for rural power generation. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In particular, heavy-duty gas turbines can operate on a large number of primary fuels that are available in many branches of the industry. These accessible fuels include natural gas (NG) and diesel fuel (DF), as well as a number of industry byproducts generated by the refining and petrochemical sectors, coal and oil and gas activities, steel and mining branches, and by the agricultural industry (biofuels). This fuel flexibility enhances the existing qualities demonstrated by gas turbines, such as efficiency, reliability, versatility in applications [mechanical drive, simple and combined cycle, combined heat and power (CHP)], strong integration potential [integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), gas to liquid (GTL)], and low emissions. As a result, gas turbines that use local fuel resources, synfuels or industrial byproducts - and are deployed in simple or combined cycles or in CHP units - can play a prominent role in the creation of reliable, clean, and energy-efficient power systems. This article provides the energy community with comprehensive information about alternative gas turbine (GT) fuels, covering volatile fuels [naphtha, natural gas liquid (NGL), condensates], weak gas fuels from the coal/iron industry [coalbed gas, coke oven gas (COG), blast furnace gas (BFG)], ash-forming oils, and hydrogen-rich byproducts from refineries or petrochemical plants. The main technical considerations essential to the success of alternative fuel applications are reviewed and key experience milestones are highlighted. A special emphasis is placed on the combustion of hydrogen in gas turbines. © IMechE 2005.

AB  - The ability of immobilized lipase from Candida antarctica (Novozym 435) to catalyze the alcoholysis of canola oil and methanol was investigated. Response surface methodology (RSM) and five-level-five-factor central composite rotatable design (CCRD) were employed to evaluate the effects of synthesis parameters, such as reaction time, temperature, enzyme concentration, substrate molar ratio of methanol to canola oil, and added water content on percentage weight conversion of canola oil methyl ester by alcoholysis. Reaction temperature and enzyme concentration were the most important variables. High temperature and superabundant methanol inhibited the ability of Novozym 435 to catalyze the synthesis of biodiesel. Based on the analysis of ridge max, the optimum synthesis conditions were as follows: reaction time 12.4 h. temperature 38.0°C, enzyme concentration 42.3%, substrate molar ratio 3.5:1, and added water 7.2%. The predicted value was 99.4% weight conversion, and the actual experimental value was 97.9% weight conversion. © 2004 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Biodiesel has attracted considerable attention as an alternative fuel during the past decades. The main hurdle to the commercialization of biodiesel is the cost of the raw material. Use of an inexpensive raw material such as rice bran oil is an attractive option to lower the cost of biodiesel. Two commercially available immobilized lipases, Novozym 435 and IM 60, were employed as catalyst for the reaction of rice bran oil and methanol. Novozym 435 was found to be more effective in catalyzing the methanolysis of rice bran oil. Methanolysis of refined rice bran oil and fatty acids (derived from rice bran oil) catalyzed by Novozym 435 (5% based on oil weight) can reach a conversion of over 98% in 6 h and 1 h, respectively. Methanolysis of rice bran oil with a free fatty acid content higher than 18% resulted in lower conversions (<68%). A two-step lipase-catalyzed methanolysis of rice bran oil was developed for the efficient conversion of both free fatty acid and acylglycerides into fatty acid methyl ester. More than 98% conversion can be obtained in 4-6 h depending on the relative proportion of free fatty acid and acylglycerides in the rice bran oil. Inactivation of lipase by phospholipids and other minor components was observed during the methanolysis of crude rice bran oil. Simultaneous dewaxing/degumming proved to be efficient in removing phospholipids and other minor components that inhibit lipase activity from crude rice bran oil. © 2005 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - For biodiesel-fuel production by methanolysis of plant oils, Rhizopus oryzae cells producing a 1,3-positional specificity lipase were cultured with polyurethane foam biomass support particles (BSPs) in a 20 l air-lift bioreactor, and the cells immobilized within BSPs were used as whole-cell biocatalyst in repeated batch-cycle methanolysis reaction of soybean oil. The whole-cell biocatalyst had a higher durability in the methanolysis reaction when obtained from air-lift bioreactor cultivation than from shake-flask cultivation. Following repeated methanolysis reaction using the whole-cell biocatalyst, analysis of the reaction mixture composition indicated that monoglycerides (MGs) decreased and free fatty acids (FFAs) increased with increasing water content in the reaction mixture, and that MGs, diglycerides (DGs), and triglycerides (TGs) increased with increasing number of reaction cycles. The isomers of MGs and DGs generated during the 20th methanolysis reaction cycle consisted of 2-MGs and 1,2(2,3)-DGs, respectively. The hydrolytic activity of the whole-cell biocatalyst, on the other hand, was stable regardless of the number of reaction cycles. It was demonstrated thus that the whole cell biocatalyst promotes acyl migration of partial glycerides, and that the facilitatory effect is increased by increase in the water content of the reaction mixture but it is lost gradually with increasing number of reaction cycles. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this study was to characterise particle emissions from district heating units operating on three commonly used biofuels: forest residues, pellets and sawdust. Boilers used in the three district heating units were of moving grate type, with the maximum thermal output between 1 and 1.5 MW. The measurements were done after multicyclones, the only particle removal devices installed, therefore the direct emissions to ambient air were characterised. Number and mass size distributions were determined. Elemental composition of the particles was determined by particle induced X-ray emissions analysis (PIXE) and thermal-optical analysis. Particles' morphology was assessed on the basis of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Total number concentration of emitted particles with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 5 μm (PM5) at medium operation load ranged from 6.3 to 7.7×10 7 particles/cm n 3, with the slightly higher values from combustion of forest residues. PM5 mass concentration at medium load from low pressure impactor measurements ranged between 51 and 120 mg/m n 3, with the highest values from unit operating on forest residues. Both PM5 mass and total number concentrations were dominated by fine mode contributions i.e. particles with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 1 μm (PM1). Elements determined by PIXE (Z&gt;12) contributed to 21-34% of PM1 mass, of which K, S, Cl and Ca contributed to 18-33% of PM1 mass, and Zn, Mn, Fe, Cr, Pb and Cd to 1-3%. Emitted concentrations of heavy metals depended on type of the fuel and operating load. Particulate organic (OC) and elemental (EC) carbon contribution to PM1 ranged from 1-19% and 0-56%, respectively. Particulate OC concentrations strongly depended on the operation load regardless the type of the fuel, while EC concentrations seemed to depend both on load and the type of the fuel. Considering the potential public health implications of the obtained results, further research is needed to carefully assess the impact of particle emissions from biofuels combustion on human health and environment. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ethanol is an attractive alternative fuel because it is a renewable bio-based resource and it is oxygenated, thereby providing the potential to reduce particulate emissions in compression-ignition engines. In this review the properties and specifications of ethanol blended with diesel fuel are discussed. Special emphasis is placed on the factors critical to the potential commercial use of these blends. These factors include blend properties such as stability, viscosity and lubricity, safety and materials compatibility. The effect of the fuel on engine performance, durability and emissions is also considered. The formulation of additives to correct certain key properties and maintain blend stability is suggested as a critical factor in ensuring fuel compatibility with engines. However, maintaining vehicle safety with these blends may entail fuel tank modifications. Further work is required in specifying acceptable fuel characteristics, confirming the long-term effects on engine durability, and ensuring safety in handling and storing ethanol-diesel blends. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Policies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions are likely to increase energy prices. Higher energy prices raise farmer costs for diesel and other fuels, irrigation water, farm chemicals, and grain drying. Simultaneously, renewable energy options become more attractive to agricultural producers. We consider both of these impacts, estimating the economic and environmental consequences of higher energy prices on U.S. agriculture. To do this we employ a price-endogenous agricultural sector model and solve that model for a range of carbon-tax-based energy price changes. Our results show mostly positive impacts on net farm income in the intermediate run. Through market price adjustments, fossil fuel costs are largely passed on to consumers. Additional farm revenue arises from the production of biofuels when carbon taxes reach $30 per ton of carbon or more. Positive environmental benefits include not only greenhouse gas emission offsets but also reduced levels of nitrogen leaching.

AB  - Our investigation took place at the Technical University of Budapest - TUB - where we looked for possible uses of ethanol or an ethanol-diesel mixture in agricultural engines in Hungary. First we examined the international and the Hungarian experiments and as a second step we selected the appropriate engine and procedure. In this first article we show the preparation of the dyno measurements and the pre-calculations. In the second one the results of the investigations and the added calculations will be described. The main aspect of the engine selection was to find an engine that is current in Hungary, and to find a procedure which implies only minimal changes on this engine. The procedure - the combination of the possible useful fuels and solutions - was selected through technical, economical and environmental investigations.

AB  - This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation into the wear and lubrication characteristics of a diesel engine using ordinary coconut oil (COIL)-blended fuels. The blended fuels consisted of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% COIL with diesel fuel (DF2). Pure DF2 was used for comparison purposes. The engine was operated with 50% throttle setting at a constant speed of 2000 rpm for a period of 100 h with each fuel. The same lubricating oil, equivalent to SAE 40, was used for all fuel systems. A multi-element oil analyser was used to measure wear metals (Fe, Cr, Cu, Al, and Pb), contaminant elements (Si, B, and V), and additive elements (Zn, Ca, P, and Mg) in the used lubricating oil. Fourier transform infrared analysis was performed to measure the degradation products (soot, oxidation, nitration, and sulphation products) in the used lubricant. Karl Fischer (ASTMD 1744) and potentiometric titrations (ASTM D 2896) were used to measure water concentration and total base number (TBN), respectively. An automatic viscometer (ASTM D 445) was used to measure lubricant viscosity. The results show that wear metals and contaminant elements increase with an increasing amount of COIL in DF2. An increasing amount of COIL in the blends reduces additive elements, with the reduction for blends of up to 30% COIL being quite similar to that for DF2. Soot and sulphation decrease with increasing COIL in the blended fuels due to reduced aromatics and sulphur in comparison to DF2. The water concentration increases for blended fuels with more than 30% COIL. The TBN and viscosity changes are found to be almost normal. The engine did not appear to have any starting and combustion problems when operating with the COIL-blended fuels. The lubricating oil analysis data from this study will help in the selection of tribological components and compatible lubricating oils for coconut oil- or biofuel-operated diesel engines.

AB  - Following the EU directives which aim at developing biofuels up to 5.75% of the total fuels used for terrestrial transportation purposes, the French government has announced that a supplementary 800 000 tons' agreement of biofuels will be produced by 2007. Rapeseed Methyl Ester (RME, mixed with diesel oil) will then be produced up to nearly 1 Million tons. Particular emphasis is dedicated in this article to the competition between food and energy rapeseed. Thanks to a linear programming model, insights can be given about the evolutions between the different rapeseed areas. Four different scenarios are developed in order to enlighten some aspects of this competition.

AB  - The impacts of biodiesel on gaseous and particulate matter (PM) emissions of a JP-8–fueled T63 engine were investigated. Jet fuel was blended with the soybean oil-derived methyl ester biofuel at various concentrations and combusted in the turbine engine. The engine was operated at three power settings, namely ground idle, cruise, and takeoff power, to study the impact of the biodiesel at significantly different pressure and temperature conditions. Particulate emissions were characterized by measuring the particle number density (PND; particulate concentration), the particle size distribution, and the total particulate mass. PM samples were collected for off-line analysis to obtain information about the effect of the biodiesel on the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content. In addition, temperature-programmed oxidation was performed on the collected soot samples to obtain information about the carbonaceous content (elemental or organic). Major and minor gaseous emissions were quantified using a total hydrocarbon analyzer, an oxygen analyzer, and a Fourier Transform IR analyzer. Test results showed the potential of biodiesel to reduce soot emissions in the jet-fueled turbine engine without negatively impacting the engine performance. These reductions, however, were observed only at the higher power settings with relatively high concentrations of biodiesel. Specifically, reductions of ∼15% in the PND were observed at cruise and takeoff conditions with 20% biodiesel in the jet fuel. At the idle condition, slight increases in PND were observed; however, evidence shows this increase to be the result of condensed uncombusted biodiesel. Most of the gaseous emissions were unaffected under all of the conditions. The biodiesel was observed to have minimal effect on the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons during this study. In addition to the combustion results, discussion of the physical and chemical characteristics of the blended fuels obtained using standard American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) fuel specifications methods are presented. © 2006 Air & Waste Management Association.

AB  - Coconut oil in Pacific islands countries is increasingly used in both transport and electricity generation through its lower cost. The widespread use of coconut oil to replace diesel has a range of potential environmental benefits such as decrease of emissions of poisonous gases and particulate matters and use of coconut oil can be considered as CO2 neutral. However, The copra oil industry in Pacific islands is suffering mainly because of a relatively small size and little opportunities for economics of scale. Widespread utilization of alternative fuels will require active involvement of engine manufacturers and local mechanics.

AB  - The Biofuels Directive places an onus on EU member states to ensure biofuels are available on their markets. This paper investigates the use of ethanol derived from biomass type 1 (residues and wastes) and biomass type 2 (energy crops). The technology involved in generating ethanol from energy crops is mature; the same cannot be said for generation of ethanol from residues; many proposals are mooted to generate ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass, but they are not at a commercial scale. Literature is available however on expected yields and economics of ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass. This paper investigates three options which produce ethanol: 50 million Lpa of ethanol from sugar beet, 50 million Lpa of ethanol from waste paper and 200 million Lpa of ethanol from waste paper. The economics of ethanol production from sugar beet were the worst of the three due to the requirement to buy the sugar beet. Economies of scale are significant: larger plants produce cheaper ethanol. Indeed it was found that for the large plant, the production cost was zero if a gate fee of €100/t was charged for waste paper. The three options were applied to Ireland. It was found that an investment in an ethanol industry of €561 million would produce 5.7% of the energy value of petrol and diesel in Ireland; the reference value for the minimum portion of biofuels placed on the market in 2010 is 5.75%. The greenhouse-gas savings would equate to 18% of the 1990 transport emissions. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A novel concept of fuelling a diesel engine with biofuels - rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) and ethanol was proposed, developed, and investigated. The idea of the concept depends on standard fuelling with RME and additional injection of ethanol into the inlet port during the inlet stroke. After ignition from burning RME droplets, the ethanol-air mixture burns very quickly and promotes combustion of the main fuel droplets. This results in a shorter combustion period. Experiments were carried out with the use of a one-cylinder direct injection diesel engine adapted to ethanol injection at three speeds and two loads: low and high and for three injection timings. At each experimental point the proportion of ethanol to RME was changed from zero to the value at which diesel knock occurred in such a way that the engine load was kept constant. This showed the influence of the ethanol energy to total fuel energy ratio (ΩE) on efficiency and emissions (ΩE was a main independent variable parameter). A considerable decrease in CO 2 and the smoke level was obtained and, for high loads also CO and HC emissions. At low loads the NOX emissions were reduced. The optimum ratio of ethanol energy to total fuel energy, in terms of brake fuel conversion efficiency and benefit of emission decrease, was found to be about 25 per cent. © IMechE 2005.

AB  - This study assesses the fire safety risks associated with compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicle systems, comprising primarily a typical school bus and supporting fuel infrastructure. The study determines the sensitivity of the results to variations in component failure rates and consequences of fire events. The components and subsystems that contribute most to fire safety risk are determined. Finally, the results are compared to fire risks of the present generation of diesel-fueled school buses. Direct computation of the safety risks associated with diesel-powered vehicles is possible because these are mature technologies for which historical performance data are available. Because of limited experience, fatal accident data for CNG bus fleets are minimal. Therefore, this study uses the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) approach to model and predict fire safety risk of CNG buses. Generic failure data, engineering judgments, and assumptions are used in this study. This study predicts the mean fire fatality risk for typical CNG buses as approximately 0.23 fatalities per 100-million miles for all people involved, including bus passengers. The study estimates mean values of 0.16 fatalities per 100-million miles for bus passengers only. Based on historical data, diesel school bus mean fire fatality risk is 0.091 and 0.0007 per 100-million miles for all people and bus passengers, respectively. One can therefore conclude that CNG buses are more prone to fire fatality risk by 2.5 times that of diesel buses, with the bus passengers being more at risk by over two orders of magnitude. The study estimates a mean fire risk frequency of 2.2 × 10-5 fatalities/bus per year. The 5% and 95% uncertainty bounds are 9.1 × 10-6 and 4.0 × 10-5, respectively. The risk result was found to be affected most by failure rates of pressure relief valves, CNG cylinders, and fuel piping. © 2005 Society for Risk Analysis.

AB  - In the scenario of imminent energy crises fuelled by huge import bills and rising prices of petro-based products, biofuels seem to be options of the future. Some promising biofuel species like Jatropha and Pongamia are being used traditionally for domestic purposes in many parts of India. The Planning Commission of India has taken major initiatives in its Tenth Five-year Plan in various states for cultivation of biofuel species. In light of the above, this study was conducted in 15 villages and 12 villages, respectively, in the tribal-dominated areas of Jharkhand and Orissa to understand the scope for cultivation of these species. This paper looks at the existing availability of biofuel tree species and the quantity of seeds collected for local consumption and sale. It focuses on the scope of biofuel plantations and establishment of biofuel extraction units at the village level, and the livelihood and employment opportunities that could be created through the activities under the programme. The findings suggest that biofuel plantations in the rural areas could be strategic for generating employment and reducing migration in the villages. The paper also suggests that it can be beneficial to establish oil extraction units across a cluster of villages where density of biofuel species is high. It concludes by stating that the scope for biofuel plantation could be improved by adopting several variants of agro-forestry, such as agri-silviculture, silvi-horticulture, and silvi-pasture in unutilized areas such as farm boundaries and available wastelands, thus meeting both cash as well as subsistence requirements of farmers.

AB  - The fractional compositions of fatty acid methyl esters from rape and sunflower oils were determined by the method in GOST 2177-99. The data obtained can be used to calculate the characteristic temperatures and thermophysical parameters of biofuels. The difference in the boiling points of the esters and their vapors was established. The ingredients of the biofuels and their fractions were determined by gas-liquid chromatography. Fuels of plant origin evaporate in a narrow temperature range so that the fatty acid methyl esters are distributed very unevenly over all fractions. The results obtained can be used to create an adequate mathematical model of evaporation of biofuel in the diesel cylinder. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - Reducing and off-setting anthropogenic emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) are important strategies of mitigating the greenhouse effect. Thus, the need for developing carbon (C) neutral and renewable sources of energy is more than ever before. Use of crop residue as a possible source of feedstock for bioenergy production must be critically and objectively assessed because of its positive impact on soil C sequestration, soil quality maintenance and ecosystem functions. The amount of crop residue produced in the US is estimated at 367×106 Mg/year for 9 cereal crops, 450×106 Mg/year for 14 cereals and legumes, and 488×106 Mg/year for 21 crops. The amount of crop residue produced in the world is estimated at 2802×106 Mg/year for cereal crops, 3107×106 Mg/year for 17 cereals and legumes, and 3758×106 Mg/year for 27 food crops. The fuel value of the total annual residue produced is estimated at 1.5×1015 kcal, about 1 billion barrels (bbl) of diesel equivalent, or about 8 quads for the US; and 11.3×1015 kcal, about 7.5 billion bbl of diesel or 60 quads for the world. However, even a partial removal (30-40%) of crop residue from land can exacerbate soil erosion hazard, deplete the SOC pool, accentuate emission of CO2 and other GHGs from soil to the atmosphere, and exacerbate the risks of global climate change. Therefore, establishing bioenergy plantations of site-specific species with potential of producing 10-15 Mg biomass/year is an option that needs to be considered. This option will require 40-60 million hectares of land in the US and about 250 million hectares worldwide to establish bioenergy plantations. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Methyl esters obtained from the most interesting Spanish oleaginous crops for energy use - sunflower and Cynara cardunculus - were both used as diesel fuels, pure and in 25% blends with a commercial fuel which was also used pure. A stationary engine test bed, together with the instrumentation for chemical and morphological analysis, allowed to study the effect of these fuels on the engine emissions, soluble organic fraction of the particulate matter, origin of adsorbed hydrocarbons, sulphate content, particle number per unit filter surface, and mean particle diameter. Both the consideration of the thermochemical properties of the tested fuels and the computations of a chemical equilibrium model were helpful for the results analysis. These results proved that the use of these vegetable esters provides a significant reduction on particulate emissions, mainly due to reduced soot and sulphate formation. On the contrary, no increases in NOx emissions nor reductions on mean particle size were found. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The oilseed crop Camelina sativa (camelina) has lower production costs than oilseed rape in some climates. For this reason, the production of biodiesel-grade methyl ester from camelina oil was evaluated. The evaluation included quality assessment of esters produced in laboratory and pilot plant, an examination of methods of improving ester low-temperature properties, and vehicle trials. Laboratory esterifications gave ester yields similar to rape-seed oil. Six 350 kg batches of unrefined camelina oil with acid values from 3 to 6 were esterified in a pilot plant. Ester-specific properties were satisfactory with one exception; the iodine number of 155 far exceeded the value of 120 required by the relevant EU standard. Fuel-specific properties of the camelina methyl esters were largely within specification, though low-temperature behaviour could be a problem in some climates. This problem could be overcome by the use of suitable pour-point depressants or by blending with diesel oil. In vehicle tests, the reduction in fuel economy with camelina ester was similar to that with biodiesel from other feedstocks. The high iodine number of camelina methyl ester did not lead to a more rapid deterioration of the lubricating oil. However, it was concluded that further engine trials would be needed before the use of camelina ester as an undiluted vehicle fuel could be recommended. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper deals with the greenhouse gas emission and costs of transportation systems with biofuels - biodiesel, bioethanol, biogas, biohydrogen and biomethanol - in combustion engine, hybrid systems (e.g. combustion engine and electric engine) and electric engine with fuels cell. The greenhouse gas emissions based on a life cycle analyses including production, use and disposal are calculated for the different transportation systems. Trans portation systems with future biofuels have significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions than transportation systems with diesel and gasoline. In terms of low greenhouse gas emission biodiesel made from rape seed, sunflower and recycled vegetable oil, bioethanol from sugar beet and maize, biogas from animal manure and biohydrogen from wood chips are most favourable. The fulfilment of the EU-Biofuel Directive might lead in year 2010 to a greenhouse gas reduction of up to 1,2 Mio. t CO2-equivalents with mitigation costs between 180∈ and 1.400 ∈ per tonne of CO2-equivalent avoided.

AB  - Selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) has been used to analyse on-line and in real time the exhaust gas emissions from a Caterpillar 3304 diesel engine under different conditions of load (idle and 50% of rated load) and speed (910, 1500 and 2200 rpm) using three types of fuel: an ultra-low-sulphur diesel, a rapeseed methyl ester and gas oil. SIFT-MS analyses of the alkanes, alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons in the headspace of these fuels were also performed, but the headspace of the rapeseed methyl ester consists mainly of methanol and a compound with the molecular formula C 4H8O. The exhaust gases were analysed for NO and NO 2 using O2 reagent ions and for HNO2 using H3O+ reagent ions. The following aldehydes and ketones in the exhaust gases were quantified by using the combination of H 3O+ and NO+ reagent ions: formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propenal, propanal, acetone, butanal, pentanal, butanone and pentanone. Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and pentenal, all known respiratory irritants associated with sensitisation to asthma of workers exposed to diesel exhaust, are variously present within the range 100-2000 ppb. Hydrocarbons in the exhaust gases accessible to SIFT-MS analyses were also quantified as total concentrations of the various isomers of C3H4, C 3H6, C4H6, C5H 8, C5H10, C6H8, C 6H10, C7H14, C6H 6, C7H8, C8H10 and C 9H12.

AB  - With a population of ≈ 1.3 billion, China has more than four times as many potential customers as the US, the world's largest car market. However, the number of individually owned cars is < ≈ for every 100 people, compared with almost one for every two people in the US. A discussion on China's car market covers China's economic expansion; variables influencing mass car ownership; increases in car purchases; efforts of oil companies to realize business opportunities, e.g., retail fuel; joint ventures between foreign oil companies and Chinese firms; China's accession to the WTO; distribution of gasoline and diesel in the country; concerns on a possible shortage in gasoline; and China's biofuels program.

AB  - A naturally aspirated compression ignition (CI) engine was operated successfully with mutifuel (fossil-diesel, Karanja oil &amp; producer gas from a wood gas jfIer). Emission characteristics and performance of diesel engine in fossil-diesel and mixed fuels mode (with Karanja oil and Producer gas) at djfferent engine load conditions are presented in this paper. The emission concentration CO2 and of the pollutants carbon monoxide (CO), oxide of nitrogen (NOx) and hydrocarbon (HC) were monitored. It was observed that the relative concentration of emissions depends on the engine load, fuels conditions and engine conditions. However NOx concentration decreases in mixed fuels mode compared to fossil-diesel and Karanja oil and fossil-diesel mixture. In addition to the findings on environmental aspects, the study also proved that the diesel engine could be run in mixed fuel mode (70 to 830 Producer gas, rest karanja oil andfossil diesel at the ratio of]: 5 and heated 80 °C).

AB  - A continuation of DGMK Research Report 611 "Biofuels - Properties and Experiences with their Use", published in 2002 is presented. Since that time, the plans of the European Commission (EC) to promote the use of biofuels have been put in concrete terms. Directive 2003/30/EC sets targets for the period 2005-2010, to which extent biofuels are to be marketed. In the case of diesel fuels, this will be accomplished mainly by blending of ≤ 5% fatty acid methyl esters and not by their use as a pure compound. Ethanol and ETBE are available as blending components for petrol. For both diesel fuel and petrol the existing standards limit the addition of the oxygen containing compounds. Among the many tested methods for the determination of the storage stability, the Rancimat method got the broadest acceptance. There are a few diesel fuels, which appear to be poorly suitable for blending of even the small quantity of 5% biodiesel. For such diesel fuels, an especially small Rancimat induction period seems to be characteristic. Not all proven antioxidants for hydrocarbons are also equally effective in blends with biodiesel. ASTM D 4625, with storage at 43°C, is generally considered to be the most reliable test method for the determination of the storage stability of middle distillates. Tests with blends of 5% rape seed methyl ester and diesel fuel from different German refineries showed, that obviously there are a few fuels that appear to be poorly suitable for the blending with FAME. According to previous experiences, there are no problems with the use of fuels containing biodiesel in cars, if the biodiesel content does not exceed 5%, water is absent and the storage time does not exceed 6 mo. The biodiesel must meet the requirements of standard EN 14214.

AB  - The aim of this study was the determination of optimal conditions of free fatty acid esterification by methanol using acid catalyst, and the calculation of the kinetic parameters of this process. It was found that the reaction rate depends on the amount of the catalyst and the acidity of the reaction mixture. The reaction rate changes also depending on the reaction duration, especially during the first 15 min. Establishing the above mentioned parameters proved the effect of the agents on the reaction rate. Such dependence is characteristic to many heterogeneous processes. The data suggest that having excluded diffusion, the reaction order is about 1. Within the limits of the experimental conditions (free fatty acids 0.162 mol//L-1.948 mol/L, temperature 20-60°C, constant mixing speed -850 min-1, 1% of catalyst (H2SO4)) the apparent energy of activation Et is ≈ 13.3 kJ/mol, while pre-exponent A = 1.27. These parameters allow the assumption that diffusion restrictions are characteristic to the entire range of the concentrations and the reaction duration studied.

AB  - Concerning their environmental impact, native based fuels and lubricants show immense potential. In fact, these products are highly exposed to oxidative processes during storage or application [1, 2]. One way to raise oxidative stabilities is the addition of synthetic antioxidants. Another way may be the modification of the fatty acid composition, since polyunsaturated fatty acids show a much higher proneness to autoxidation. In order to decrease the content of polyunsaturated and to raise the content of saturated components, experiments for fractional distillation and crystallisation as well as for hydrogenation of fatty acid methyl esters have been carried out. In distillation experiments with separation columns the methyl esters performed good separation of the lower-boiling esters with a chain-length up to 16C-atoms, from the C-18 fraction, causing a degree of saturation up to 75 wt-% in the distillate. In tests with fractional crystallisation, the rate of saturation could be raised up to 92.8 wt-%. Using the process of catalytic hydrogenation, a rate of saturation up to 100 wt-% could be achieved, depending on the duration of the hydrogenation process. By partial hydrogenation of the polyunsaturated components, products with high oxidation stability and low pour point could be produced within relatively short hydrogenation time.

AB  - Natural gas and vegetable oils have long been established as alternative energy sources suitable for road transport vehicles and power generation using conventional engines. However, the use of these fuels for commercially-operated high-speed marine craft in inland waterways and harbours is not common. In this investigation, the performance and emission levels in the operation of a single-cylinder spark-ignition engine using natural gas are compared with data for diesel, gasoline and emulsified vegetable oil under simulated propeller-load and near lean-misfire limit conditions for high-speed craft. The brake specific fuel consumption with natural gas operation was found to be higher when compared with those of diesel and emulsified vegetable oil. The NOX exhaust emissions from operation with these fuels were found to be lower than the limit set in Annex VI of International Maritime Organization (IMO) MARPOL 73/78: Regulations for prevention of air pollution from ships.

AB  - The first three-dimensional global model in which time-dependent spectral albedos and emissivities over snow and sea ice are predicted with a radiative transfer solution, rather than prescribed, is applied to study the climate response of fossil fuel plus biofuel black carbon plus organic matter (ff+bf BC+OM) when BC absorption in snow and sea ice is accounted for. The model treats the cycling of size-resolved BC+OM between emission and removal by dry deposition and precipitation from first principles. Particles produce and enter size-resolved clouds and precipitation by nucleation scavenging and aerosol-hydrometeor coagulation. Removal brings BC to the surface, where internally and externally mixed BC in snow and sea ice affects albedo and emissivity through radiative transfer. Climate response simulations were run with a ff+bf BC+OC emission inventory lower than that used in a previous study. The 10-year, globally averaged ff+bf BC+OM near-surface temperature respouse due to all feedbacks was about +0.27 K (+0.32 in the last 3 years), close to those from the previous study (5-year average of +0. 3 K and fifth-year warming of +0.35 K) and its modeled range (+0.15 to +0.5 K) because warming due to soot absorption in snow and sea ice here (10-year average of +0.06 K with a modeled range of +0.03 to +0.11 K) offset reduced warming due to lower emission. BC was calculated to reduce snow and sea ice albedo by ∼0.4% in the global average and 1% in the Northern Hemisphere. The globally averaged modeled BC concentration in snow and sea ice was ∼5 ng/g; that in rainfall was ∼22 ng/g. About 98% of BC removal from the atmosphere was due to precipitation; the rest was due to dry deposition. The results here support previous findings that controlling ff+bf BC+OM and CO 2 emission may slow global warming. Copyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.

For the investigations reported in this article, a two-phase system consisting of rape oil and methanol was chosen. The goal of the experiments was to investigate whether ultrasound had a significant influence on the conversion rate of the reaction and the reaction mechanism, or if more intensive mixing of the reaction mixture was required to cause an increase reactivity. © 2004 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The world energy demand has, for the last two decades, witnessed uncertainties in two dimensions. Firstly, the price of conventional fossil fuel is too high and has added burden on the economy of the importing nations. Secondly, combustion of fossil fuels is the main culprit in increasing the global carbon dioxide (CO2) level, a consequence of global warming. The scarcity and depletion of conventional sources are also cases of concern and have prompted research world-wide into alternative energy sources for internal combustion engines. Biofuels appear to be a potential alternative "greener" energy substitute for fossil fuels. The problem of using neat vegetable oils in diesel engines relates to their high viscosity. Experiments were designed to study the effect of reducing viscosity by increasing the inlet temperature of vegetable oil fuel on combustion and emission characteristics of diesel engine. The test results showed that the CO production with heated fuel is a little higher than the diesel fuel at higher loading conditions. The CO concentrations in the exhaust were higher for unheated oil operation compared to other fuels. The heated oil showed marginal increase in CO2 emissions compared to diesel fuel. The hydrocarbon emissions were significantly reduced when running on plant oils. The fuel consumption was a little worse when running on plant fuel. The ignition delay was longer for unheated plant fuel operation. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study deals with the transesterification of Pongamia pinnata oil by means of methanol to study the feasibility of methanolysis process by using potassium hydroxide catalysts. The yield of biodiesel obtained was >97 per cent by using oil/methanol molar ratio 12:1, potassium hydroxide as catalyst, at 65°C and stirring at 360 rpm in 3 h. The biodiesel was characterized by TLC and HPLC analysis to determine the fatty acid methyl esters, mono-, di- and triglycerides and glycerol. The properties like viscosity, flash point, cloud point, and pour point have been determined for accessing the fuel quality of karanja based biodiesel.

AB  - Biodiesel is one of the environmentally friendly alternative liquid biofuels that has proven itself commercially, with international standards all around the world. Industrial and scientific studies on reducing biodiesel production costs are one of the major contributions that have strengthened the position of biodiesel commercially. The type of vegetable oil used for biodiesel production is the parameter that has the greatest effect on biodiesel production cost. For this reason, investigations on the types of no-to-low-cost vegetable oils become crucial. In this study, the optimum conditions for biodiesel production from restaurant-originated used cooking oil (which is composed primarily of oleic and linoleic acids) and the refining procedure were investigated. A refining method of "washing with hot water" was used for biodiesel refinement. One of the properties of biodiesel that has an influence on biodiesel purity is glycerin content. In the refining studies, the effects of glycerin amount, used washing water amount, and the number of washing steps were discussed and biodiesel that meets EN 14214 standards was produced. © 2004 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Oxygenated diesel fuel blends have advantages over regular diesel. Oxygenation significantly reduces particulate matter (PM) and reduces toxic gases such as CO, sulfur oxides (SOx), and, at times, nitrogen oxides (NOx) from tailpipe emissions. Ethanol, which is the oxygenate in E-diesel, is a renewable fuel that reduces the dependency of non-oil-producing countries on foreign petroleum. However, a major drawback with E-diesel is that ethanol is immiscible in diesel over a wide range of temperatures. Studies have revealed that biodiesel, which is another renewable fuel, can be used successfully as an amphiphile (a surface-active agent) to stabilize ethanol and diesel. Research also has revealed that ethanol-biodiesel-diesel (EB-diesel) fuel blend micro-emulsions are stable well below sub-zero temperatures and have shown equal or superior fuel properties to regular diesel fuel. Microemulsions of certain component concentrations have shown substantially increased lubricity without compromising the cetane numbers and energy values. Despite ethanol having a considerably lower energy value, cetane number, and lubricity value than biodiesel or diesel fuel alone, the heat of combustion and cetane numbers of the EB-diesel blends remained steady, without significant reduction. The minimal change of the heat of combustion suggested that microemulsions may be contributing to the overall combustion process in a positive way. This work has paved the way to formulate a new form of biofuel blend from renewable material-a blend that has energy values comparable to those of fossil fuels but also has superior lubricity and environmentally friendly characteristics. © 2004 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The Institute for Energy and Environmental Research Heidelberg (Heidelberg, Germany) was commissioned to analyze and compare published information on biofuels worldwide, including, bio-diesel, bio-ethanol, and synthetic biomass, to liquid (biomass-to-liquid or BTL) fluids. It was concluded that biofuels for transportation have ecological advantages in resource conservation and climate protection as compared to fossil fuels. These advantages outweigh their disadvantages in contributing to acidification, the eutrophication of lakes and other bodies of water, and ozone depletion. However, limitation in land for food production and other purposes indicates that biofuels from agricultural biomass will probably substitute a small portion of fossil fuels.

AB  - We present measurements of trace gases and fine aerosols obtained from a rural site in eastern China during 18 February to 30 April 2001. The field program aimed to characterize the variations in aerosol and gaseous pollutant concentrations and the emission signatures from the inland region of eastern China in the spring season. The data included O3, CO, NO, NOy*, SO2, methane, C2-C8 nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), C 1-C2 halocarbons, and the chemical composition of PM2.5. The average hourly mixing ratios (±standard deviation) of CO, SO2, and NOy* were 677 (±315) ppbv, 15.9 (±14.6) ppbv, and 13.8 (±7.2) ppbv, respectively. The mean daytime ozone mixing ratio was 41 (± 19) ppbv. The most abundant NMHC was ethane (3189 ± 717 pptv), followed by ethyne (2475 ± 1395 pptv), ethene (1679 ± 1455 pptv), and toluene (1529 ± 1608 pptv). Methyl chloride was the most abundant halocarbon (1108 ± 653 pptv). The average concentrations of particulate organic matter (POM, as organic carbon, OC, times 1.4) and elemental carbon (EC) in PM2.5 were 21.5 (±7) μg/m3 and 2.5 (±0.7) μg/m3, respectively, and sulfate and nitrate levels were 17.3 (±6.6) and 6.5 (±4) μg/m3, respectively. CO showed moderate to good correlation with NOy* (r2 = 0.59), OC (r2 = 0.65), CH3Cl (r2 = 0.59), soluble potassium (r2 = 0.53), and many NMHCs, indicating contributions from the burning of biofuel/biomass. CO also correlated with an industrial tracer, C2Cl4, indicative of some influence from industrial sources. SO2, on the other hand, correlated well with EC (r2 = 0.56), reflecting the contribution from the burning of coal. Ammonium was sufficiently abundant to fully neutralize sulfate and nitrate, indicating that there were strong emissions of ammonia from agricultural activities. Silicon and calcium had poor correlations with iron and aluminum, revealing the presence of source(s) for Si and Ca other than from soil. Examination of C2H2/CO, C3H8/C 2H6, nitrate/(nitrate + NOy* , and sulfate/(SO2 + sulfate) suggested that relatively fresh air masses had been sampled at the study site in the spring season. Comparison of the observed ratios/slopes with those derived from emission inventories showed that while the observed SO2/NO y* ratio (1.29 ppbv/ppbv) in March was comparable (within 20%) to the inventory-derived ratio for the study region, the measured CO/NOy* slope (37 ppbv/ppbv) was about 200% larger. The observed slope of CO relative to NMHC (including ethane, propane, butanes, ethene, and ethyne) also indicated the presence of excess CO, compared to the ratios from the inventories. These results strongly suggest that emissions of CO in eastern China have been underrepresented. The findings of this study highlight the importance of characterizing trace gases and aerosols within source regions of the Asian continent. The springtime results were also compared with data previously collected at the site in 1999-2000 and with those obtained on the Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific (TRACE-P) aircraft and from a coastal site in South China for the same study period.

AB  - To stabilize the lipase activity of Rhizopus oryzae cells as whole-cell biocatalysts, the effect of cell membrane fatty acid composition on biodiesel-fuel production was investigated. The fatty acid composition of the cell membrane was easily controllable by addition of various fatty acids to the culture medium. Oleic or linoleic acid-enriched cells showed higher initial methanolysis activity than saturated fatty acid-enriched cells, among which palmitic acid-enriched cells exhibited significantly greater enzymatic stability than unsaturated fatty acid-enriched cells. It was assumed that fatty acids significantly affect the permeability and rigidity of the cell membrane, and that higher permeability and rigidity lead to increases in methanolysis activity and enzymatic stability, respectively. When the optimal fatty acid ratio of 0.67, indicated by Rf [=oleic acid/(oleic acid + palmitic acid)], was adopted for repeated methanolysis reactions, both methanolysis activity and enzymatic stability were maintained at significantly elevated levels, with methyl ester content of around 55% even in the 10th batch cycles. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The recommendations of Brussels are that the European member states bring to 2% and later to 5.75% their share of bio motor fuels in gasoline. To comply with these recommendations, the French government asks for the tripling between now and 2007 the production of bio motor fuels in France. This means the construction of four plants that each produces 200,000 ton/yr. The two pathways will be in terms of ethanol and vegetable oils. A million hectares and a staff of 6000 will be dedicated to this plan. This will mean 3 million ton of avoided CO2. The costs to society will be minimal, less than a euro centime per liter. If the petroleum industry sees no inconvenience in the increased use of the methyl ester of rapeseed oil mixed with diesel motor fuel, the production of which is deficient in France, it is more reserved with respect to the incorporation on a larger scale of ethanol in gasoline of which France has an over capacity. The discussion covers the triple objective of the government with respect to the environment, economy, and agriculture; the satisfaction of the Union of Renewable Energies; and the prudent stance of the petroleum industry. The Total company is the leading consumer of biofuels in Europe through the use of ETBE and the leading buyer of rapeseed methyl ester. For their development, they need stable and durable tax incentives, according to M. Vettier (Total).

AB  - Biomass burning releases gases (e.g., CO2, CO, CH4, NOx, SO2, C2H6, C2H4, C3H8, C3H6) and aerosol particle components (e.g., black carbon, organic matter, K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, NH4 +, H+, Cl-, H2SO4, HSO4-, SO42-, NO3 -. To date, the global-scale climate response of controlling emission of these constituents together has not been examined. Here 10-yr global simulations of the climate response of biomass-burning aerosols and short-lived gases are coupled with numerical calculations of the long-term effect of controlling biomass-burning CO2 and CH4 to estimate the net effect of controlling burning over 100 yr. Whereas eliminating biomass-burning particles is calculated to warm temperatures in the short term, this warming may be more than offset after several decades by cooling due to eliminating long-lived CO2, particularly from permanent deforestation. It is also shown analytically that biomass burning always results in CO2 accumulation, even when regrowth fluxes equal emission fluxes and in the presence of fertilization. Further, because burning grassland and cropland yearly, as opposed to every several years, increases CO2, biofuel burning, considered a "renewable" energy source, is only partially renewable, and biomass burning elevates CO2 until it is stopped. Because CO2 from biomass burning is considered recyclable and biomass particles are thought to cool climate, the Kyoto Protocol did not consider biomass-burning controls. If the results here, which apply to a range of scenarios but are subject to uncertainty, are correct, such control may slow global warming, contrary to common perception, and improve human health. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - From the point of view price and available capacity used frying oils or fats (UFO) represent an attractive raw material for the production of methyl esters (ME) of higher fatty acids as alternative fuels for diesel engines. If they are treated such that the required quality, with an acidity number up to 3.0 mg KOH/g and a water content up to 0.1 wt%, is achieved they can be processed to ME using standard techniques of alkali-catalysed transesterification with methanol which are utilized for production of the ME from new oils/fats. The problematic waste can thus be converted to an ecologically friendly fuel. Vacuum distillation of free fatty acids in a film evaporator is an effective method for simultaneously decreasing the content of FFA and water in UFO. Final distillation of raw ME in a film vacuum evaporator results in practically all parameters required by the standard, in the final ME being achieved. Undesirable low-temperature properties of ME derived from UFO, due to higher fraction of saturated acyls, can be adjusted by the addition of depressants - flow improvers for winterization. Some simplified methods for the quality control of UFO and ME are discussed. The conversion of acylglycerols to ME is monitored by GLC with a packed column, where the peak areas of ME in the sample before and after the reaction with an effective methylation agent are compared. The method for the determination of the water content in esters utilizes the reaction of calcium carbide with water, the volume of acetylene being measured. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We present a global tabulation of black carbon (BC) and primary organic carbon (OC) particles emitted from combustion. We include emissions from fossil fuels, biofuels, open biomass burning, and burning of urban waste. Previous "bottom-up" inventories of black and organic carbon have assigned emission factors on the basis of fuel type and economic sector alone. Because emission rates are highly dependent on combustion practice, we consider combinations of fuel, combustion type, and emission controls and their prevalence on a regional basis. Central estimates of global annual emissions are 8.0 Tg for black carbon and 33.9 Tg for organic carbon. These estimates are lower than previously published estimates by 25-35%. The present inventory is based on 1996 fuel-use data, updating previous estimates that have relied on consumption data from 1984. An offset between decreased emission factors and increased energy use since the base year of the previous inventory prevents the difference between this work and previous inventories from being greater. The contributions of fossil fuel, biofuel, and open burning are estimated as 38%, 20%, and 42%, respectively, for BC, and 7%, 19%, and 74%, respectively, for OC. We present a bottom-up estimate of uncertainties in source strength by combining uncertainties in particulate matter emission factors, emission characterization, and fuel use. The total uncertainties are about a factor of 2, with uncertainty ranges of 4.3-22 Tg/yr for BC and 17-77 Tg/yr for OC. Low-technology combustion contributes greatly to both the emissions and the uncertainties. Advances in emission characterization for small residential, industrial, and mobile sources and top-down analysis combining field measurements and transport modeling with iterative inventory development will be required to reduce the uncertainties further.

AB  - The chemical and toxicological characteristics of emissions from an urban bus engine fueled with diesel and biodiesel blend were studied. Exhaust gases were produced by a turbocharged EURO 2 heavy-duty diesel engine, operating in steady-state conditions on the European test 13 mode cycle (ECE R49). Regulated and unregulated pollutants, such as carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitrated derivatives (nitro-PAHs), carbonyl compounds and light aromatic hydrocarbons were quantified. Mutagenicity of the emissions was evaluated by the Salmonella typhimurium/mammalian microsome assay. The effect of the fuels under study on the size distribution of particulate matter (PM) was also evaluated. The use of biodiesel blend seems to result in small reductions of emissions of most of the aromatic and polyaromatic compounds; these differences, however, have no statistical significance at 95% confidence level. Formaldehyde, on the other hand, has a statistically significant increase of 18% with biodiesel blend. In vitro toxicological assays show an overall similar mutagenic potency and genotoxic profile for diesel and biodiesel blend emissions. The electron microscopy analysis indicates that PM for both fuels has the same chemical composition, morphology, shape and granulometric spectrum, with most of the particles in the range 0.06-0.3 μm. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The IFP researches biofuels. The IFP discussion covers biofuels as a contribution to the diversification of energy and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; the sequence from biomass to ethanol; the sequence from biomass to diesel motor fuel; synthesis motor fuels as another alternative; and biofuels as a solution of interest in the energy countryside in future years. The European goal of biofuels having a 5.75% share in the motor fuel mix by 2010 seems ambitious. To achieve this in satisfactory economic and environmental conditions, much remains to be done. The principal groups concerned in this field in France (Ademe, CEA, CNRS, IFP, INRA, and industry) work to start up a national "biofuel" program in the image of the one existing in the US or Sweden. Without a doubt their part of the market will be more significant in the future. The biofuels will probably be a part, beside other motor fuels such as LPG and NGV, hybrid vehicles, and fuel cells, on which IFP also works, of the energy panorama of future years. Biofuels today comprise in Europe 0.5% of the motor fuels used in transport. Until 2001 France was the principal producer and consumer of biofuels (about 1%). Spain and Germany now exceed France in their production. In 2002, France produced about 200,000 ton of ETBE starting from 90,000 ton of ethanol mainly from beet cultivation. The leading producer in 2001, France then was passed by Spain that produces 176,500 ton of ethanol in 2002 from wheat and barley. In 2003, France produced about 360,000 ton of esterified vegetable oil, a small part of which was exported to Germany. Germany is now the main European producer of esterified vegetable oil with 450,000 ton produced in 2002 and about 715,000 ton in 2003.

AB  - Modelling of soot and SOF emissions from a typical European turbocharged diesel engine has been made. The model consists of a detailed kinetic mechanism with 472 reactions (120 chemical species) and data from the thermodynamic diagnostic procedure of the combustion process of the engine. The forward kinetic constants were obtained from literature and the background constants from a self-developed non-linear fitting routine based on the Marquardt algorithm. The dilution and mixing processes inside the engine are represented by a simple Wiebe function. The system of ordinary differential equations is solved with the Rosenbrock method for rigid systems and using the interpolating Lagrange polynomials to calculate the heat capacity of each species at the corresponding temperature. The kinetic model has been implemented in Digital Visual Fortran 6.0. The model has been executed for five different fuels and three mixtures of biodiesel and reference diesel operating under three diverse conditions from the European transient urban/extraurban Certification Cycle and the results of soot and SOF predicted are compared with experimental data. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Production of rape methyl ester (RME) can be carried out with different systems solutions, in which the choice of system is usually related to the scale of the production. The purpose of this study was to analyse whether the use of a small-scale RME production system reduced the environmental load in comparison to a medium- and a large-scale system. To fulfil this purpose, a limited LCA, including air-emissions and energy requirements, was carried out for the three plant sizes. For small plants and physical allocation, the global warming potential was 40.3 g CO2-eq/MJfuel, the acidification potential 236 mg SO2-eq/MJfuel, the eutrophication potential 39.1 mg PO43--eq/MJ fuel, the photochemical oxidant creation potential 3.29 mg C 2H4-eq/MJfuel and the energy requirement 295 kJ/MJfuel. It was shown that the differences in environmental impact and energy requirement between small-, medium- and large-scale systems were small or even negligible. The higher oil extraction efficiency and the more efficient use of machinery and buildings in the large-scale system were, to a certain degree, outweighed by the longer transport distances. The dominating production step was the cultivation, in which production of fertilisers, soil emissions and tractive power made major contributions to the environmental load. The results were, however, largely dependent on the method used for allocation of the environmental burden between the RME and the by-products meal and glycerine. This indicates that when different biofuels or production strategies are to be compared, it is important that the results are calculated with the same allocation strategies and system limitations. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Carbon dioxide inventory implications of a biodiesel program in the Philippines are assessed. Biodiesel is assumed to be the methyl ester of coconut oil. Different scenarios for the use of agricultural residues as fuel for heat or power generation are analyzed. Reduction in net CO2 emissions are estimated at 77-104 g/MJ of diesel displaced by biodiesel. These benefits are found to be particularly sensitive to the extent to which residues are utilized. The predicted reductions in CO2 emissions are much greater than values reported in recent studies on biodiesel derived from other vegetable oils, due both to the large amount of potential fuel in the residual biomass and to the low-energy inputs in traditional coconut farming techniques. However, agricultural productivity constraints suggest that by 2010, the maximum level of biodiesel substitution for the entire country is only 8%. At this level of utilization reductions of 2.85-3.85% in the Philippines' projected 130×106 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per annum can be realized. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Results are presented on tests on a single-cylinder direct-injection engine operating on diesel fuel, jatropha oil, and blends of diesel and jatropha oil in proportions of 97.4%/2.6%; 80%/20%; and 50%/50% by volume. The results covered a range of operating loads on the engine. Values are given for the chemical and physical properties of the fuels, brake specific fuel consumption, brake power, brake thermal efficiency, engine torque, and the concentrations of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and oxygen in the exhaust gases. Carbon dioxide emissions were similar for all fuels, the 97.4% diesel/2.6% jatropha fuel blend was observed to be the lower net contributor to the atmospheric level. The trend of carbon monoxide emissions was similar for the fuels but diesel fuel showed slightly lower emissions to the atmosphere. The test showed that jatropha oil could be conveniently used as a diesel substitute in a diesel engine. The test further showed increases in brake thermal efficiency, brake power and reduction of specific fuel consumption for jatropha oil and its blends with diesel generally, but the most significant conclusion from the study is that the 97.4% diesel/2.6% jatropha fuel blend produced maximum values of the brake power and brake thermal efficiency as well as minimum values of the specific fuel consumption. The 97.4%/2.6% fuel blend yielded the highest cetane number and even better engine performance than the diesel fuel suggesting that jatropha oil can be used as an ignition-accelerator additive for diesel fuel. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The protection of the environment and human health puts forth a stringent demand to the quality of contemporary fuels - their composition should be free of components causing the appearance of harmful emissions: SOx, NOx, polycyclic arenes, alkenes, active oxygen forms (ozone, singlet oxygen, peroxides), soot, metal-containing aerosols, oxygen-containing organic compounds, etc. Recently particular attention is directed to the problems of the greenhouse effect. For this purpose, emission limits for CO2 are implemented. These problems can be solved by using ultra-clean fuels for internal combustion engines. This type of fuel does not practically contain sulphur (below 10 ppm), the aromatics in the diesel fuels are reduced to below 11 vol. %, and in gasoline - below 35 vol. %, the content of benzene and alkenes is limited to 1 and 18 vol. %, respectively, the content of oxygen-containing compounds is also reduced. In addition, the implementation of efficient systems for complete fuel combustion results in removal of some definite noxious emissions such as hydrocarbons, oxygen-containing compounds and NOx. The production of ultra-clean modern fuels requires large investments in the oil refining. It should be also noted that their performance does not automatically lead to complete reduction of CO2 emissions. For this reason, other ways for the reduction of emissions during the exploitation of internal combustion engines are also looked for. Applying biofuels and alternative fuels nearly complete absence of SOx emissions, particles and soot, and reduction in polycyclic arene hydrocarbons emissions can be achieved. The use of biofuels - methyl esters of saturated fatty acids of vegetable origin and of molasses ethanol - does not affect the CO2 balance in the atmosphere. The exploitation of liquefied gas propane/butane and pressurised natural gas - methane leads to decrease of the relative fuel consumption and correspondingly to CO2 emission reduction. A particular attention is paid to the stability of biofuels and other alternative fuels during their storage and exploitation. It is known that the esters of unsaturated fatty acids are particularly unstable and unresisting to the action of light, catalytic systems and atmospheric oxygen. The use of alcohols causes also problems both with fuel storage and their specific action on the combustion units in the internal combustion engines. Some possibilities for the improvement of biofuels stability by their chemical modification or by applying special additives are discussed.

AB  - The phenomenon of cool flames can be used for mixing, evaporation, and overheating of a mixture of fuel, air, and steam. This method is used to provide a homogeneous mixture preparation. This study investigates the existence of cool flames running a stationary cool flame reactor under autothermal reforming conditions. It particularly characterizes the thermal limits of the cool flame reaction at high steam-to-carbon ratios. The experiments show that a cool flame vaporizer can be combined with an autothermal reformer leading to a homogeneous temperature profile in the front of the catalyst bed. This results in a good conversion of the fuel in the reforming process. © 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - A discussion gazes at possible future developments in the technology of the automobile. Topics include the doubling of the world automobile fleet in 30 yr; working on the engines and the fuels; downsizing; query whether diesel or gasoline; bio motor fuels as an alternative; query what the future holds for the hybrid; and hydrogen as a long term vision. Today the world fleet of automobiles comprises 500 million vehicles. In 30 yr it should increase by 80%, with the increase due basically from developing countries like China and India. The automobile manufacturers will have to limit fuel consumption and this in the face of increasing car weight by 15 kg/yr avg. It will also be necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in which carbon dioxide will have to be limited to 140 g/km in 2008 and 120 g/km in 2012 and to improve the logistics of energy supply. Petroleum reserves are estimated to last 40 yr. There will be a transition from petroleum to alternative solutions such as natural gas, synthetic motor fuels, and combination of several energy sources including hydrogen. The limit on sulfur will be 50 ppm in 2005 and 10 ppm between 2005 and 2009 in Europe. IFP proposes the Narrow Angle Direct Injection concept to reduce pollution. This is based on the principle of premixed combustion at low temperature. Also, by reducing cylinder size and maintaining performance, motor fuel consumption can drop by 21%. The difference between the gasoline and diesel engine in terms of emissions will decrease. Diesel engines have 47% share in Europe. The infatuation with the diesel engine is due to the "common rail" direct injection and the presence of a turbo. Fine particles are being eliminated by use of particle filters. PSA Peugeot Citroën has already equipped 600,000 vehicles with particle filters. Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Opel, Toyota, and Volkswagen have also adopted them. Liquid motor fuels will remain preponderant in the future. LPG will be an alternative to gasoline. There are now 190,000 LPG vehicles in France. Biofuels are of interest. Biodiesel has a good carbon dioxide balance from the well to the wheel. Biofuels will also be made from grain, beets, wood, and wastes. Synthetic fuels will be made from natural gas or coal by the Fischer-Tropsch process. The hybrid vehicle will offer the most interesting results in terms of fuel consumption reduction. There are two on the market now, Toyota Prius and Honda Civic IMA. By 2008 light hybrids should appear with an electric motor that assists the traditional engine and by 2015 the electric and thermal outputs should be comparable. Hybridization is not limited to gasoline. Diesel, biofuels, natural gas, and LPG are suitable. Hydrogen remains a long term vision because it takes much energy to make it and in the process can be a gross emitter of carbon dioxide if it is made from fossil fuels. Safety and hydrogen storage on vehicles are a concern.

AB  - With the prospect of continuous growth in energy consumption tied to world economic growth, the struggle against the greenhouse effect by the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere constitutes a major engineering challenge in coming years. For the hydrocarbons, the goals include the reduction of energy consumption, notably by engines, by the progressive use of fossil fuels with lower carbon content and by non-fossil fuels low in carbon, and by the capture and sequestration of CO2. Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP) is involved nationally and internationally all along the petroleum chain in these three areas. In transport, the manufacturers have taken on CO2 emissions reduction from 140 g/km in 2008 to 120 g/km in 2012. IFP works on the optimal design of gasoline and diesel engines, on new modes of combustion such as homogeneous combustion to reconcile higher performance with very low emission levels. With respect to alternative fuels, the most interesting avenues appear to be NGV (natural gas vehicles), biofuels, and, in the long term, hydrogen, despite the obstacles to its development. In making a CO2 balance for the different types of fuels, it is important to make a complete analysis of the life cycle from the well to the wheel, taking into account the ensemble of the steps of production and use of the fuel. It is thus for example that the use of hydrogen, seemingly satisfactory, can be penalizing if its production is accompanied by elevated emissions of CO2. The capture and sequestration of CO2 underground is a promising solution in terms of the impact of carbon dioxide emissions. However, the problems to overcome are significant. It is a question of being able to store significant amounts of CO2, to reduce the costs, still high, and to be able to guarantee the security and integrity of the storage in the long term. CO2 can be stored in exhausted oil and gas fields, in deep saline aquifers, and in non exploited coal veins. The storage potential for depleted oil and gas fields is 920 billion ton. In the case of saline aquifers, it seems to be 400-10,000 billion ton. In coal veins, the potential is 5-150 billion ton. These estimates are to be compared with annual CO2 emissions that are now 23 billion ton.

AB  - Biodiesel is composed of monoalkyl esters of long-chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils or animal fats. It does not contain any petroleum products, but it may be blended with conventional diesel to provide a biofuel that can replace petroleum diesel. Thus, the present production of biodiesel is based mainly on plant oils.

AB  - Volatile organic compounds (VOC) play a significative role on the process of formation of photochemical smog. Photooxidants are formed in the atmosphere when VOC react with nitrogen oxides (NOx), in the presence of sunlight and OH radicals. In urban areas, vehicle fuels constitute an important source of VOC and NOx emissions to the atmosphere, either by burning or evaporative losses. This work is concerned with a comparative study of two types of light-duty vehicular fuels presently used in Brazil - namely gasohol (a mixture 22-24% of anhydrous ethanol in gasoline) and hydrated ethanol (95% v/v) - as potential precursors for ozone formation in the atmosphere of urban cities. The experiments were conducted during the spring and summer of 2001/2002. In each one, two Teflon chambers were filled, respectively, with each fuel, at high initial [VOC] to [NO] ratios and exposed to the sunlight. Ozone formation, as well as NOx concentration profiles were measured directly using ozone and NO/NO2/NOx continuous analyzers. The results showed that, for the same initial volumes of the two fuels into the bags, the ozone peak concentrations are in average 28% higher for alcohol than for gasohol. In addition, the ozone formation process showed a tendency to start earlier for gasohol but, once started, the formation rate was two times faster for alcohol than for gasohol. These observations indicate a need for more detailed studies, regarding the role of unburned fuel emissions and evaporative losses of alcohol and gasohol on the formation process of atmospheric photochemical oxidants in urban sites, with special attention to kinetics aspects. This conclusion is particularly important in the case of Brazil, considering the substantial contribution of that emissions on the total hydrocarbons (HC) and VOC inventories from mobile sources and a possible resume of the Brazilian Biofuels Program, which would increase the atmospheric concentrations of ethanol.

AB  - This article focuses on the directives of the European Union on the promotion of (1) electricity produced from renewable energy sources (the RES-E Directive) and (2) the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transportation (the RF Directive). First an overview is given of the broader policy perspectives and the political process that led to their adoption. Next these directives are briefly described and an assessment is made of their implementation. This sets the stage for a contribution to the debate on whether or not further steps to EU-wide harmonisation of national renewables support systems should be made. This debate is quite relevant to the drafting of the evaluation report by the European Commission on the implementation of the RES-E directive due in October 2005. Some major near-term priorities for implementation of the RES-E and RF Directives are identified. It is argued that requirements for the emergence of a single energy market, improvement of the international competitiveness of the EU economy, and accelerating cost-reducing innovations in the renewables-related industries all point in the direction of Union-wide harmonisation. This approach should allow, though, for technology-specific cost considerations. However, an EU-wide choice for one specific type of support scheme might not be realisable in the near term. A first step in reducing market fragmentation could be compatible accounting systems for guarantees of origin (GOs), which consequently may assume a key role in facilitating trade. © 2004 International Energy Initiative, Inc.

AB  - SYNOPSIS: In recent years, the issue of environmental pollution has been a cause of great concern world-wide. Researchers have shown that combustion of fossil fuel is a major cause of increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) content of the atmosphere, with the consequence of global warming. Flood and land slide disasters resulting in loss of lives and properties are also linked to increases in ambient temperature. Research efforts have been geared towards identifying greener alternative energy sources for internal combustion (IC) engines. Biofuels appear more attractive as they absorb CO2 while growing thus neutralising CO2 emissions from combustion. The test results indicate that vegetable oils exhibit longer ignition delay with slow diffusion combustion stage, though advanced injection timing is expected to compensate in part for these problems. This work investigates the effect of advanced injection timing on emission characteristics of an unmodified diesel engine running on vegetable oil fuel. The test results show that the lowest carbon monoxide (CO) and CO2 emissions were obtained with the advanced injection unit. The hydrocarbon (HC) emissions of the engine running on vegetable oil fuels were significantly reduced compared to the test results on baseline diesel fuel. The advanced injection system showed a slight increase in fuel consumption. The exhaust temperatures were high and delay period was reduced with the advanced injection unit. © 2004 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Vaporization and oxidation of liquid fuel droplets are basic mechanisms in spray combustion for various industrial applications. In this work, coupled effects of temperature and pressure on n-alkane droplet vaporization are investigated in experiments conducted in a high-pressure and high-temperature gasification facility equipped with the fiber-suspended droplet technique. The influence of temperature and pressure on n-heptane and n-decane vaporization rates is particularly emphasized with regard to critical conditions of the liquid fuel. Characteristics of n-alkane droplet vaporization, and heating and vaporization times are compared with those of vegetable oil methyl esters - biofuels used in diesel engines. Finally, chemical species formed during the oxidation of these biofuels are identified by gas chromatography in oxidation experiments performed in a jet-stirred reactor. The influence of temperature, pressure, and equivalence ratio on regulated and unregulated pollutants is discussed. Emissions of pollutants obtained during biofuels oxidation are compared with those identified during the oxidation of a synthetic diesel fuel.

Commercialization of biomass refining is imminent but the wild claims of those who think that bioenergy can replace much of our dependence on foreign oil are appalling. It is naive to view biomass as the panacea for the coming energy crisis because there is not enough in practical locations and the costs involved in retrieving and refining it will be relatively high. The world will not run out of energy, but cheap energy might disappear, with its economics clouded by a myriad of subsidies for the competing energy sources and by world politics. This assessment of biomass supply and conversion technologies provides global perspectives and exposes some alternatives to be so impractical that they are almost fraudulent.

AB  - The most common catalysts for biodiesel production are homogeneous basic catalysts. In the present paper, a comparison is made of different basic catalysts (sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide) for methanolysis of sunflower oil. All the reactions were carried out under the same experimental conditions in a batch stirred reactor and the subsequent separation and purification stages in a decanter. The analytical methods included gas chromatography and the determination of fat and oil conventional parameters. The biodiesel purity was near 100 wt.% for all catalysts. However, near 100 wt.% biodiesel yields were only obtained with the methoxide catalysts. According to the material balance of the process, yield losses were due to triglyceride saponification and methyl ester dissolution in glycerol. Obtained biodiesel met the measured specifications, except for the iodine value, according to the German and EU draft standards. Although all the transesterification reactions were quite rapid and the biodiesel layers achieved nearly 100% methyl ester concentrations, the reactions using sodium hydroxide turned out the fastest. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper analyzes the possibility of producing bio-fuel in the Amazon degraded lands. The aim here is to combine environmental concerns with an improvement of local people well-being. Firstly, a historical analysis is conducted in order to figure out the major deforestation driving forces in Amazon and to help to arrive at a feasible energy choice. Secondly, the geographical area is chosen. It is the spatial boundaries of Carajás Iron Ore Program in the southeastern Amazon where most of the deforestation has taken place in the last few decades. For this specific context, palm oil is chosen as a technological energy alternative due to its social production structure, its environmental benefits and its productivity. A quantified analysis is realized in terms of income generation (2000-3000 US$/family/yr), job creation (200,000-300,000 families settled), land required and restored (2-3.2 million ha), and carbon emission from fossil fuel avoided (13.1 Mt C). Some recommendations related to institutional and economic barriers are proposed in order to encourage the technology penetration in the market. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Essential requirements for biofuel are that (a) it should be produced from renewable raw material, and (b) it should have a lower negative environmental impact than that of fossil fuels. Apart from direct assessment of the engine emissions, environmental impact is also determined by performing life cycle analysis. Life cycle energy balance depends on specific climatic conditions and the agro- and processing technologies used. Rapeseed oil methyl ester life cycle energy ratios in Lithuanian conditions have been calculated as a function of rapeseed productivity, oil pressing and transesterification technologies used. Opportunities to improve biodiesel fuel life cycle energy efficiency, by implementing new technologies in agriculture as well as in industrial processing, were reviewed. The effectiveness of new technologies was evaluated on the basis of energy balance comparison. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A catalyst-free biodiesel production method with supercritical methanol has been developed that allows a simple process and high yield because of simultaneous transesterification of triglycerides and methyl esterification of fatty acids. From these lines of evidence, we expected that similar results would be attained with the use of various alcohols by the supercritical treatment. However, it still remains unclear which type of reaction, transesterification or alkyl esterification, is faster. This parameter would be important in designing the optimum reaction conditions of the supercritical alcohol method. Therefore, we studied the effect of transesterification of triglycerides and esterification of fatty acids in rapeseed oil. Reaction temperature was set at 300°C, and methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol or 1-octanol was used as the reactant. The results showed that transesterification of triglycerides (rapeseed oil) was slower in reaction rates than alkyl esterification of fatty acids for any of the alcohols employed. Furthermore, saturated fatty acids such as palmitic and stearic acids had slightly lower reactivity than that of the unsaturated fatty acids; oleic, linoleic and linolenic. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the conventional transesterification of fats/vegetable oils for biodiesel production, free fatty acids and water always produce negative effects, since the presence of free fatty acids and water causes soap formation, consumes catalyst and reduces catalyst effectiveness, all of which result in a low conversion. The objective of this study was, therefore, to investigate the effect of water on the yield of methyl esters in transesterification of triglycerides and methyl esterification of fatty acids as treated by catalyst-free supercritical methanol. The presence of water did not have a significant effect on the yield, as complete conversions were always achieved regardless of the content of water. In fact, the present of water at a certain amount could enhance the methyl esters formation. For the vegetable oil containing water, three types of reaction took place; transesterification and hydrolysis of triglycerides and methyl esterification of fatty acids proceeded simultaneously during the treatment to produce a high yield. These results were compared with those of methyl esters prepared by acid- and alkaline-catalyzed methods. The finding demonstrated that, by a supercritical methanol approach, crude vegetable oil as well as its wastes could be readily used for biodiesel fuel production in a simple preparation. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A series of laboratory experiments were carried out to test the potential of vegetable oil biodiesel for the cleaning of oiled shorelines. In batch experiments, biodiesel was shown to have a considerable capacity to dissolve crude oil, which appears to be dependent on the type of biodiesel used. Pure vegetable oil biodiesels (rapeseed and soybean) were significantly more effective in the cleanup of oiled sands (up to 96%) than recycled waste cooking oil biodiesel (70%). In microcosm and mesocosm experiments, oiled sediments were sprayed with biodiesel and subjected to simulated tides. Microcosm experiments revealed that, of those tested, the highest ratio of biodiesel to crude oil, had the highest effectiveness for cleaning fine sands, with ratios of 2:1 (biodiesel:crude oil) giving the best results, In the mesocosm experiments a ratio 1: 1 of soybean biodiesel to crude oil removed 80% of the oil in cobbles and fine sands, 50% in coarse sand and 30% in gravel. Most of the oil was removed with the surface water, with only a small amount being flushed through the sediments. Particle size and pore size were important determinants in the cleanup and mobility of crude oil in the sediments in these static systems. It is expected that the biodiesel effectiveness should improve in the natural environment particularly in exposed beaches with strong wave action. However, more laboratory and field trials are required to confirm the operational use of biodiesel as a shoreline cleaner. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biofuels are being investigated as potential substitutes for current high pollutant fuels obtained from the conventional sources. In the past, fuels were generally selected on the basis of lowest cost relating to the requirements of the engine, and no attention was given to the possible effects of their use on the environment. Recent concerns over the environment, increasing liquid fuel prices and scarcity of supply in the last decade have promoted interest in the development of alternative sources of liquid energy. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the potential of rapeseed methyl ester (RME) as a liquid fuel for diesel engines in relation to meeting emission requirements. The test results showed that RME and its blends with diesel fuel emitted high CO2 compared to test results on diesel fuel. A very significant reduction in emissions of hydrocarbon (HC) were recorded when running on RME and the blends. HC emissions were noted to increase with increased amount of diesel fuel in the blend. The fuel economy was a little worse when running on RME due to its low energy content. There were no marked difference noted for the exhaust temperatures of the blends, RME and diesel fuel at high speed operation. However, the diesel fuel operation produced high exhaust temperatures at low engine speed. Lubricating oil analysis showed reduction in viscosity indicating oil dilution. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As the use of biodiesel becomes more widespread, researchers have shown a strong interest in modeling the combustion processes in the engine in order to understand the fundamental characteristics of biodiesel combustion. In the early phase of the simulation, accurate prediction of the physical properties of biodiesel is critical in the representation of spray, atomization, and combustion events in the combustion chamber. The objective of this article is to present methods for predicting key physical properties including critical properties, vapor pressure, latent heat of vaporization, density, surface tension, and liquid viscosity for biodiesel that can be used for combustion modeling. Predicted results were compared with published data where available, and for some properties, errors were less than 1%. While no published data were available at temperatures above 373 K to check the accuracy of the predictions from the models at the higher temperatures, the trends in the fuel properties were regarded as representative of what would be expected in the combustion chamber. These models could be used in a detailed combustion model such as KIVA to make relative comparisons between fuels.

AB  - Biodiesel manufactured from canola oil was blended with diesel and used as fuel in two diesel vehicles. This study aimed to test the emissions of diesel engines using blends of 100%, 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% biodiesel and 100% petroleum diesel, and characterise the particulate matter and gaseous emissions, with particular attention to levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which are harmful to humans. A real time dust monitor was also used to monitor the continuous dust emissions during the entire testing cycle. The ECE(Euro 2) drive cycle was used for all emission tests. It was found that the particle concentration was up to 33% less when the engine burnt 100% biodiesel, compared to 100% diesel. Particle emission reduced with increased percentages of biodiesel in the fuel blends. Reductions of NOx, HC and CO were limited to about 10% when biodiesel was burned. Levels of CO2 emissions from the use of biodiesel and diesel were similar. Eighteen EPA priority PAHs were targeted, with only 6 species detected in the gaseous phase from the samples . 9 PAHs were detected in particulate phases at much lower levels than gaseous PAHs. Some marked reductions were observed for less toxic gaseous PAHs such as naphthalene when burning 100% biodiesel, but the particulate PAH emissions, which have more implications to adverse health effects, were virtually unchanged and did not show a statistically significant reduction. These findings are useful to gain an understanding of the emissions and environmental impacts of biodiesel. © 2003 Selper Ltd.

AB  - The paper presents a feasibility study for applying biodiesel in recreational boats in the United Kingdom for the purpose of rational utilization of energy resources and environmental protection. Biodiesel has been widely used to fuel diesel engines for onshore vehicles, particularly for agriculture machinery. Application of biodiesel for merchant ship propulsion on a large scale has been seen as not an option in the near future due to the lack of availability and supply chains of the fuel. However, there has been interest in the possibility of powering recreational boats with biodiesel in order to pursue marine environmental protection. The study reviews the current status of using biodiesel in recreational boats and analyses the market in the United Kingdom. Results on fuel availability for the sector, economic aspects and environmental benefits are presented. © 2003, Institution of Mechanical Engineers. All rights reserved.

AB  - Palm oil, a renewable source, has been cracked at atmospheric pressure, a reaction temperature of 450°C, and a weight hourly space velocity of 2.5 h-1 to produce biofuel in a fixed-bed microreactor. The reaction was carried out over microporous HZSM-5 zeolite, mesoporous MCM-41, and composite micromesoporous zeolite as catalysts in order to study the influence of catalyst pore size and acidity over biofuel production. The products obtained were gas, organic liquid product, water, and coke. The organic liquid product was composed of hydrocarbons corresponding to gasoline, kerosene, and diesel boiling point range. The maximum conversion of palm oil, 99 wt%, and gasoline yield of 48 wt% was obtained with composite micromesoporous zeolite.

AB  - Biofuels, including bioethanol, biodiesel, ETBE, biogas, biomethanol, and biodimethylether are high-profile solutions to resolve long-term fuel supply issues. Biodiesel can be incorporated in the existing fuel distribution with the least consequence. As more biodiesel is blended into the diesel, more tailpipe emission reductions are attainable. Air toxin emissions are substantially reduced at high biodiesel concentrations. Biodiesel is completely biodegradable; so spills are not a consequence. However, NOx emissions actually increase when combusting higher-concentration biodiesel blends. Within the past year, two German biodiesel facilities based on Lurgi's transesterification process have come onstream - a 100,000-ton/yr unit at Marl, and a 37,000-ton/yr facility at Malchin. In Germany, biodiesel consumption is expected to increase to 2 million ton/yr by 2010. The largest US biodiesel plant is under construction in Bakersfield, CA. The 35-million-gal/yr facility should be fully operational this year and significantly increase domestic biodiesel supplies.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to assess fuel choices in the transportation sector under stringent global carbon constraints. Three key questions are asked: (i) when is it cost-effective to carry out the transition away from gasoline/diesel; (ii) to which fuel is it cost-effective to shift; and (iii) in which sector is biomass most cost-effectively used? These questions are analyzed using a global energy systems model (GET 1.0), with a transportation module, where vehicle costs (fuel cell, reformer and storage tank), infrastructure and primary energy availability are treated explicitly. The model is run under the assumption that atmospheric concentrations of CO2 should be stabilized at 400 ppm. Three main results emerge: (i) despite the stringent CO2 constraints, oil-based fuels remain dominant in the transportation sector over the next 50 years; and (ii) once a transition towards alternative fuels takes place, the preferred choice of fuel is hydrogen, even if we assume that hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are substantially more costly than methanol fuel cell vehicles. There may, under some circumstances, be a transient period of several decades with a significant share of methanol in the transportation sector. (iii) Biomass is most cost-effectively used in the heat and process heat sectors. If carbon sequestration from biomass is allowed, biomass is primarily used for hydrogen generation since small-scale heat applications are not suitable for carbon sequestration. Detailed sensitivity analyses show that these results are robust with respect to several parameters. Some policy conclusions are drawn. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were analysed in weathered bottom ash from municipal solid waste incineration, fly ash from a mixed heating plant and an ash mixture from different kinds of biofuels. Although of different origin and age, all three ashes are evaluated in different small-scale fill applications. The ultimate goal is the usage of these ashes on a larger scale. The samples were Soxhlet extracted and analysed using GC/MS in the full scan mode. The sum of the 16 US EPA PAHs was found to vary from 140 μg/kg up to more than 77000 μg/kg. Total amounts of PAHs were similar in bottom ash and in fly ash. The concentration in the mixed biofuel ash was more than 10 times higher, and exceeded the generic guidelines for PAHs in soil set by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. The patterns of the individual PAHs normalised to the total concentration of PAHs were found to be very similar for all the three ashes. Naphthalene and phenanthrene were the dominating PAHs for all ash samples, but the mixed biofuel ash also contained high levels of fluoranthene and pyrene. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - It has been proposed that biodiesel liquids be used in blends with middle distillate ground transportation fuels by the various services in the Department of Defense. The U.S. Navy is considering allowing up to 20% biodiesel to be added as a blending stock to petroleum diesel fuels. It is important for operational considerations to examine the many problems this could present. Among the more important considerations are storage stability, filterability, fuel solubility, oxidative stability, and induced instability reactions. This paper reports on two different soybean-derived fuel liquids. The first is a fuel liquid that contains an antioxidant, and the second is a fuel liquid that was derived from recycled restaurant cooking oil with no added antioxidant. We compare both biodiesels in blends of 10% and 20% with both stable and unstable petroleum middle distillate fuels for storage stability, oxidative stability, solubility, and chemical instability results.

AB  - Biodiesel, an alternative diesel fuel, fatty acid alkyl ester, is made from renewable biological sources such as vegetable oils and animal fats. Two processes for biodiesel synthesis, enzymatic lipase catalytic esterification from fatty acid and transesterification from oils and fats, was investigated. The effects of various lipases, enzyme amount and purity, solvent, water absorbent, inhibition of short chains alcohol, specificity of substrate, molar ratio of substrate on esterification were studied in detail. The esterification degree with the optimal parameter and process can reach up to 92%. The purity of biodiesel obtained by separation and purification is up to 98%, and the half-life of the immobilized lipase for the esterification process can be up to 360hr, Moreover, the preliminary studies of the transesterification including the amount of methanol and mode of adding methanol into reaction system were made. The transesterification degree with adding methanol stepwise can reach 83%.

AB  - The search for alternative fuels, such as methyl ester from vegetable oils or water-oil emulsions, has become even more pertinent in the current context of fossil fuel shortage, the diesel vehicle population explosion and the new environmental policies. In this paper, the results of experimental research on particulate emissions from a typical indirect injection (IDI) diesel engine running under five operating conditions and tested with fourteen types of conventional and alternative fuel are reported. The chemical analysis of the emitted particulate matter showed, for example, that the total mass of particulate emissions decreases when using biofuels owing to a reduction in their insoluble fraction. Moreover, composition analysis made it possible to identify the hydrocarbons adsorbed on the soot surface, to quantify their proportion with respect to the total particulate mass and to distinguish between their origins. The results of surface analysis using scanning electron microscopy showed for all the fuels that the number of particles detected per filter surface increased with load. This analysis also showed the effect of some fuel specifications (aromatic and sulphur content) on certain parameters related to the particle size distribution obtained from the filter images.

AB  - The economic feasibilities of four continuous processes to produce biodiesel, including both alkali- and acid-catalyzed processes, using waste cooking oil and the 'standard' process using virgin vegetable oil as the raw material, were assessed. Although the alkali-catalyzed process using virgin vegetable oil had the lowest fixed capital cost, the acid-catalyzed process using waste cooking oil was more economically feasible overall, providing a lower total manufacturing cost, a more attractive after-tax rate of return and a lower biodiesel break-even price. On the basis of these economic calculations, sensitivity analyses for these processes were carried out. Plant capacity and prices of feedstock oils and biodiesel were found to be the most significant factors affecting the economic viability of biodiesel manufacture. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Goal, Scope and Background. Assessing future energy and transport systems is of major importance for providing timely information for decision makers. In the discussion of technology options, fuel cells are often portrayed as attractive options for power plants and automotive applications. However, when analysing these systems, the LCA analyst is confronted with methodological problems, particularly with data gaps and the requirement of an anticipation of future developments. This series of two papers aims at providing a methodological framework for assessing future energy and transport systems (Part 1) and applies this to the two major application areas of fuel cells (Part 2). Methods. To allow the LCA of future energy and transport systems forecasting tools like, amongst others, cost estimation methods and process simulation of systems are investigated with respect to the applicability in LCAs of future systems (Part 1). The manufacturing process of an SOFC stack is used as an illustration for the forecasting procedure. In Part 2, detailed LCAs of fuel cell power plants and power trains are carried out including fuel (hydrogen, methanol, gasoline, diesel and natural gas) and energy converter production. To compare it with competing technologies, internal combustion engines (automotive applications) and reciprocating engines, gas turbines and combined cycle plants (stationary applications) are analysed as well. Results and Discussion. Principally, the investigated forecasting methods are suitable for future energy system assessment. The selection of the best method depends on different factors such as required ressources, quality of the results and flexibility. In particular, the time horizon of the investigation determines which forecasting tool may be applied. Environmentally relevant process steps exhibiting a significant time dependency shall always be investigated using different independent forecasting tools to ensure stability of the results. The results of the LCA (Part 2) underline that principally, fuel cells offer advantages in the impact categories which are typically dominated by pollutant emissions, such as acidification and eutrophication, whereas for global warming and primary energy demand, the situation depends on a set of parameters such as driving cycle and fuel economy ratio in mobile applications and thermal/total efficiencies in stationary applications. For the latter impact categories, the choice of the primary energy carrier for fuel production (renewable or fossil) dominates the impact reduction. With increasing efficiency and improving emission performance of the conventional systems, the competition regarding all impact categories in both mobile and stationary applications is getting even stronger. The production of the fuel cell system is of low overall significance in stationary applications, whereas in automotive applications, the production of the fuel cell power train and required materials leads to increased impacts compared to internal combustion engines and thus reduces the achievable environmental impact reduction. Recommendations and Perspectives. The rapid technological and energy economic development will bring further advances for both fuel cells and conventional energy converters. Therefore, LCAs at such an early stage of the market development can only be considered preliminary. It is an essential requirement to accompany the ongoing research and development with iterative LCAs, constantly pointing at environmental hot spots and bottlenecks.

AB  - In this study, the non-food use of Brassica carinata oil for biodiesel production was investigated. B. carinata, a native plant of the Ethiopian highlands widely used as food by the Ethiopians, has recently become object of increasing interest. This is due to its better agronomic performances in areas such as Spain, California and Italy that are characterized by unfavorable environmental conditions for the cultivation of Brassica napus (by far the most common rapeseed cultivated in continental Europe). The agronomic performance and the energetic balance described here confirmed that B. carinata adapted better and was more productive both in adverse conditions (clay- and sandy-type soils and in semi-arid temperate climate) and under low cropping system when compared with B. napus. The biodiesel, produced by transesterification of the oil extracted from the B. carinata seeds, displayed physical-chemical properties suitable for the use as diesel car fuel. A comparison of the performance of B. carinata oil-derived biodiesel with a commercial biodiesel and petroleum diesel fuel was conducted as regards engine performance, regulated and unregulated exhaust emissions. These results make B. carinata a promising oil feedstock for cultivation in coastal areas of central-southern Italy, where it is more difficult to achieve the productivity potentials of B. napus, and could offer the possibility of exploiting the Mediterranean marginal areas for energetic purposes. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The paper addresses case studies of a low temperature and a high temperature industrial heat requirement being met using biomass gasification. The gasification system for these applications consists of an open top down draft reburn reactor lined with ceramic. Necessary cooling and cleaning systems are incorporated in the package to meet the end use requirements. The other elements included are the fuel conveyor, water treatment plant for recirculating the cooling water and adequate automation to start, shut down and control the operations of the gasifier system. Drying of marigold flower, a low temperature application is considered to replace diesel fuel in the range of 125-150 l h-1. Gas from the 500 kg h-1, gasifier system is piped into the producer gas burners fixed in the combustion chamber with the downstream process similar to the diesel burner. The high temperature application is for a heat treatment furnace in the temperature range of 873-1200 K. A 300 kg h-1 of biomass gasifier replaces 2000 1 of diesel or LDO per day completely. The novelty of this package is the use of one gasifier to energize 16 burners in the 8 furnaces with different temperature requirements. The system operates over 140 h per week on a nearly nonstop mode and over 4000 h of operation replacing fossil fuel completely. The advantage of bioenergy package towards the economic and environmental considerations is presented. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents the results of experimental work carried out to evaluate the exhaust emissions characteristics of ordinary Malaysian coconut oil (COCO) blended with conventional diesel oil (OD) fueled in a diesel engine. This project complies with Malaysian Government strategy on biofuel research activity. The results showed that the addition of 30% COCO with OD produced higher brake power and net heat release rate with a net reduction in exhaust emissions such as HC, NOx, CO, smoke and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). Above 30% COCO blends, such as 40 and 50% COCO blends, developed lower brake power and net heat release rate were noted due to the fuels lower calorific value; nevertheless, reduced emissions were still noted. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Immobilized lipase from Candida antarctica was employed to convert triglycerides to biodiesel using alcohol. Immobilized lipase is frequently deactivated by lower alcohols with deactivation being caused by the immiscibility between triglycerides and methanol or ethanol. When the lower alcohol is adsorbed to the immobilized enzyme, the entry of triglycerides is blocked, which causes the reaction to stop. An alcohol with three or more carbon atoms, preferably 2-butanol or tert-butanol, can regenerate the deactivated immobilized enzyme. The present work established that the activity of immobilized lipase could be significantly increased when such alcohols were used for an immersion pretreatment of the enzyme. The activity of the commercially available immobilized enzyme, Novozyme 435, increased about tenfold in comparison to the enzyme not subjected to any pretreatment. Following complete deactivation of the enzyme by methanol, washing with 2-butanol and tert-butanol successfully regenerated the enzyme and restored it to about 56% and 75% of its original activity level, respectively.

AB  - Biodiesel prepared by catalyzed mild transesterification has become of much current interest for bioenergy. The ability of a commercial immobilized lipase (Novo Industries - Bagsvaerd, Denmark) from Rhizomucor miehei (Lipozyme IM-77) to catalyze the transesterification of soybean oil and methanol was investigated in this study. Response surface methodology and 5-level-5-factor central composite rotatable design were employed to evaluate the effects on reaction time, temperature, enzyme amount, molar ratio of methanol to soybean oil, and added water content on percentage weight conversion to soybean oil methyl ester by transesterification. Based on ridge max analysis, the optimum synthesis conditions giving 92.2% weight conversion were: reaction time 6.3 h, temperature 36.5°C, enzyme amount 0.9 BAUN (Batch Acidolysis Units NOVO), substrate molar ratio 3.4:1, and added water 5.8%. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - A light commercial road vehicle fitted with a heated fuel line and tank was run on cold pressed and filtered camelina sativa seed oil and unheated mineral diesel fuel. It was found that the seed oil produced a maximum power at the road wheels of 43.25 kW and returned 12.57 km/l compared to 38.50 kW and 14.03 km/l for the mineral fuel. At an engine speed &gt; 2000 rpm and high loading, both smoke opacity and CO emitted from the exhaust was found to be approximately 50% lower with the seed oil than with the mineral fuel, however, NO was higher for the seed oil by almost 6% at engine speeds &gt; 3500 rpm, but similar &lt; 3500 rpm. The CO2 and O2 emissions were similar and NO2 emitted was negligible for both fuels. The effect of heating at 170 °C on the camelina sativa seed oil was investigated and a significant increase in viscosity was observed which coincided with a reduction in the iodine value of the oil. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Vegetable oils are produced from numerous oil seed crops. While all vegetable oils have high-energy content, most require some processing to assure safe use in internal combustion engines. Some of these oils already have been evaluated as substitutes for diesel fuels. With the exception of rape seed oil which is the principal raw material for biodiesel fatty acid methyl esters, sunflower oil, corn oil and olive oil, which are abundant in Southern Europe, along with some wastes, such as used frying oils, appear to be attractive candidates for biodiesel production. In this paper, fuel consumption and exhaust emissions measurements from a single cylinder, stationary diesel engine are described. The engine was fueled with pure marine diesel fuel and blends containing two types of biodiesel, at proportions up to 50%. The two types of biodiesel appeared to have equal performance, and irrespective of the raw material used for their production, their addition to the marine diesel fuel improved the particulate matter, unburned hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide emissions. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Using catalytic steam reforming of biofuels to produce hydrogen for energy systems based on fuel cells is an option that may help to reduce the net emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere. Vegetable oils are some of the most interesting options because of their high potential yield of hydrogen. They are, however, more difficult to reform than the light hydrocarbon feedstocks that are used for producing hydrogen industrially by steam reforming. Catalysts prepared from hydrotalcite-like materials are promising for use in the steam reforming of vegetable oils, since their catalytic activity is significantly higher than that of commercial catalysts for hydrocarbon steam reforming. In this paper, a study is made of how the nickel content of HT-derived catalysts affects their activity for steam reforming of sunflower oil. Three catalysts were prepared with Ni/Al atomic ratios of 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The samples were characterized by various techniques to correlate their activity with the structural characteristics of the catalysts: X-ray diffraction (XRD), BET, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and hydrogen chemisorption. The results showed that the catalyst activity increased as the nickel content in the material decreased. The support and its properties seemed to play a key role in the performance of the HT-derived catalysts. This is probably because a decrease in the Ni content produces a better dispersion of the metal and higher BET areas, which leads to a higher capacity for water adsorption. With the most active catalyst (Ni/Al of 1), 2.2 mol H 2/(gcath) was produced at 575 °C, 2 bar, and a steam-to-carbon ratio of 3.

AB  - Recent literature publications are used to estimate the energy and greenhouse gas balance of the most relevant biofuels in Europe, i.e., ethanol and rapeseed methyl ester (RME). The potential for biofuels to substitute conventional fuels on the basis of available land is discussed. RME represents on average a saving of 37% of the energy contained in the fuel. Ethanol from beet or wheat produces on average no energy saving, since the production energy is virtually equal to the energy in the ethanol produced. In reality, the savings are somewhat larger, since production of gasoline or diesel also consumes energy, which is saved if a biofuel is substituted. On this basis, the energy saving for RME becomes 47% and there is a saving of 17% on average for ethanol. The CO2 emitted during combustion of the biofuel does not enter into the balance, because it was absorbed from the atmosphere by the growing crop. CO2 emissions arising from changes in land use can be significant for long periods of time and should also be taken into account.

Stepwise as well as continuous methanol feeding was applied to avoid strong substrate inhibition. Glycerol was found to cause strong product inhibition on the enzymatic reaction, therefore glycerol removal by dialysis was investigated using a flat sheet membrane module.

AB  - This study was designed to determine the mutagenicity in extracts of aerosols generated from biofuel combustion in household cooking devices commonly used in India. Wood, dung cake and biofuel briquette were used as fuel in various stoves, including both traditional and improved stoves made of mud, fired clay and metal. The combustion aerosols of particle diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) were collected, and their organic extracts were tested for mutagenicity using the Ames Assay test with TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and studies were performed both with and without metabolic activation to account for direct and indirect acting mutagens. The measured mutagenicity emission factors, i.e., number of revertants per kg of fuel burnt, indicate that wood demonstrates significantly lower mutagenicity compared to dung cake and briquette. No significant stove effect was observed across all the fuels studied. The contribution of direct-acting mutagens was found to be greater than 70% in all cases. Such a high relative contribution of direct-acting mutagenicity has not been previously reported for biomass combustion aerosols. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Methylester production from rapeseed and sunflower oils or Diester™ is over 300 000 t/year in France, the first producer and user of Diester as biofuel mixed in diesel oil. Germany and Italy are among the main other European countries using such a biofuel. Methanolysis is a process which could be applied to a lot of other vegetable oils such as those extracted from soja, palm, cotton and coprah. A very strong increase in the production of this kind of biofuel is expected in the near future. In this paper, are presented some different processes of vegetable oils methanolysis operated in batch mode or in continuous way, using homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis, and the technical specifications required for the methyl esters as diesel oil blend. The economic impact of the over produced glycerol, the main by-product from vegetable oil methanolysis is covered. Finally, the main conclusions related to the implementation of this new use of vegetable oils are summarized.

AB  - The development of biomass for heat, power, as a liquid fuel supplement or substitute for diesel oil or petroleum is technically feasible but is governed by several over-riding factors which control the pace of change. In terms of agricultural and forestry potential there are a number of sources of wastes or purpose-grown material that would be appropriate for use. The wastes exist already and with current production and demand levels for conventional food crops there seems to be opportunity to re-allocate some land for specific biomass production. Whilst the decline in price of primary agricultural produce and identification of its co-products as potential feedstocks has been useful in encouraging energy/fuel uses of crops the declining price of crude oil tends to hamper progress. However, decisions at the international political level - the Kyoto agreement - and at EC/EU-15 level - the White Paper on Renewable Energy and the more recent outline for a proposal on renewable biofuels offer stabilising forces in the developing biomass markets. Clearly these will be activated at individual state level by national legislative procedures. Nonetheless there is a need to recognise the true economic value of biomass in the marketplace; defiscalisation or aid-driven incentives need to be complemented with full "valourisation" of the entire basic crop for success.

AB  - A comparison of the performance of Brassica carinata oil-derived biodiesel with a commercial rapeseed oil-derived biodiesel and petroleum diesel fuel is discussed as regards engine performance and regulated and unregulated exhaust emissions. B. carinata is an oil crop that can be cultivated in coastal areas of central-southern Italy, where it is more difficult to achieve the productivity potentials of Brassica napus (by far the most common rapeseed cultivated in continental Europe). Experimental tests were carried out on a turbocharged direct injection passenger car diesel engine fueled with 100% biodiesel. The unregulated exhaust emissions were characterized by determining the SOOT and soluble organic fraction content in the particulate matter, together with analysis of the content and speciation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, some of which are potentially carcinogenic, and of carbonyl compounds (aldehydes, ketones) that act as ozone precursors. B. carinata and commercial biodiesel behaved similarly as far as engine performance and regulated and unregulated emissions were concerned. When compared with petroleum diesel fuel, the engine test bench analysis did not show any appreciable variation of output engine torque values, while there was a significant difference in specific fuel consumption data at the lowest loads for the biofuels and petroleum diesel fuel. The biofuels were observed to produce higher levels of NOx concentrations and lower levels of PM with respect to the diesel fuel. The engine heat release analysis conducted shows that there is a potential for increased thermal NOx generation when firing biodiesel with no prior modification to the injection timing. It seems that, for both the biofuels, this behavior is caused by an advanced combustion evolution, which is particularly apparent at the higher loads. When compared with petroleum diesel fuel, biodiesel emissions contain less SOOT, and a greater fraction of the particulate was soluble. The analysis and speciation of the soluble organic fraction of biodiesel particulate suggest that the carcinogenic potential of the biodiesel emissions is probably lower than that of petroleum diesel. Its better adaptivity and productivity in clay and sandy-type soils and in semiarid temperate climate and the fact that the performance of its derived biodiesel is quite similar to commercial biodiesel make B. carinata a promising oil crop that could offer the possibility of exploiting the Mediterranean marginal areas for energetic purposes.

AB  - Pure palm oil may be employed in diesel engines as an alternative fuel. Engine performance and emissions were influenced by basic differences between diesel fuel and palm oils such as mass based heating values, viscosity, density and molecular oxygen content. The high viscosity of palm oil resulted in poor atomisation, carbon deposits, clogging of fuel lines and starting difficulties in low temperatures. When heated at 100°C palm oil presented lower viscosity, better combustion and less deposits. Tests were conducted in a naturally aspirated MWM 229 direct injection four-stroke 70 kW diesel-generator fueslled with 100% palm oil. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, researchers have intensified efforts in a bid to identify greener alternative fuels for internal combustion (i.c) engines. Combustion of fossil fuel is the main culprit in raising the carbon dioxide (CO2) content of the atmosphere. This contributes up to 60% of greenhouse gases whose consequence is global warming. The combustion of biofuels has fewer adverse effects and the effects are more localised than those of fossil fuels. Many energy sources (natural gas, bio-derived gas and liquids) are now being investigated as potential substitutes for the present conventional fossil fuels. Natural gas is more attractive alternative fuel for i.c engines due to its high octane number and environmental friendly nature. The pilot fuels used are diesel fuel, rapeseed methyl ester (RME) and neat rapeseed oil. This paper investigates the emission characteristics of a diesel engine running on natural gas using these pilot fuels as a means of initiating combustion. The test results show that the rape oil pilot injection system produced the lowest carbon monoxide (CO) concentration in the exhaust, whereas the diesel fuel pilot produced the highest values of CO. The results showed very significant increases in CO2 concentrations when running on RME pilot injection. The RME pilot system produced the lowest hydrocarbon (HC) emissions at light loading conditions. The rapeseed oil pilot system exhibited the longest delay period at light load and produced the lowest at high loading conditions. The fuel consumption was higher when running on the RME pilot system. © 2002 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biofuels are a part of the European strategy for energy supply. Biofuels are renewable liquid energy sources and can be divided into biodiesel and bioethanol. The advantages of biofuels are described. Biofuels can be produced from several raw materials and can be used in different ways as fuel for transport. The reducing of excise duties on biofuels or fuels containing biofuels would be a big chance for the development of the bioethanol market in the EU.

AB  - In order to use microalgae as a fuel the algae should be of high calorific value and must be capable of growth in large volumes. Chlorella vulgaris and C. emersonii have been shown to grow in a 230 1 pumped tubular photobioreactor in Watanabe's medium and a low nitrogen medium. The low nitrogen medium induces higher lipid accumulation in both algae, which increased their calorific value. The highest calorific value was obtained with C. vulgaris (28 kJ g-1) grown in low nitrogen medium. However, the biomass productivity was 24 mg dry wt l-1 d-1 in the low nitrogen medium which was lower than in Watanabe's medium (40 mg dry wt l-1 d-1) and represents a reduced energy recovery. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The main purpose of this research work is to determine the influence of fuel viscosity on the performance of diesel injection pumps of different design in order to clear up some of the changes in fuel feeding when running them in accordance with governor characteristics on the biofuel derived from vegetable oil. The given fuel temperature/viscosity relationships and dependencies of fuel feeding on its viscosity applying biofi1el on different injection pumps can be practicalJy useful for adjusting them for the work on bio-diesel. According to the analysis of the got results the in-line diesel injection pumps are more suitable for their adaptation for the work on bio-diesel. In this case only small adjustments ofbiofuel feeding rate are needed. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - Data uncertainty issues have constrained the widespread acceptance of life-cycle analysis (LCA) and related methods. This is particularly important in the LCA of fuels due to the wide range of available feedstocks and processing options. Despite recent attempts at standardization, there remain persistent doubts about the general validity of LCA results, often due to uncertainties about data quality. This paper demonstrates the application of possibility theory as a tool for handling life-cycle inventory data imprecision for the case of the net energy balance of coconut methyl ester (CME) as a biodiesel transport fuel. Results derived using a possibilistic computation are contrasted with those arrived at by probabilistic (Monte Carlo) simulation. The two approaches yield comparable results but possibilistic modelling offers significant advantages with respect to computational efficiency. The net energy balance of CME is estimated to be approximately 36 MJ kg-1, significantly higher than the 28 MJ kg-1 net energy typical of rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) relevant to the U.K. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - With a view to utilizing Rhizopus oryzae cells immobilized within biomass support particles (BSPs) as a whole-cell biocatalyst for biodiesel fuel production, an investigation was made of the effect of cross-linking treatment with glutaraldehyde (GA) on the stability of lipase activity. Although the lipase activity of the BSP-immobilized cells decreased considerably in the presence of the methyl esters produced by methanolysis, the activity of cells treated with 0.1% GA solution showed no significant decrease during six batch cycles, with the methyl ester content of the reaction mixture reaching 70-83% in each cycle. In contrast, without GA treatment, activity decreased gradually with each cycle to give a methyl ester content of only 50% at the sixth batch cycle. These findings indicate that, given the simplicity of the lipase production process and the long-term stability of lipase activity, the use of whole-cell biocatalysts immobilized within BSPs and treated with GA solution offers a promising means of biodiesel fuel production for industrial application. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Several forces seem to be simultaneously coalescing in a manner that will give a significant impetus to the production, use, and importance of biofuels. The first of these factors is the demise of MTBE as the oxygenate of choice for gasoline blends in non-attainment areas. Despite all the political wrangling and publicity in ethanol, total annual production is just over 2 billion gal, which is ∼ 1% of the gasoline market. While the demise of MTBE certainly would spur ethanol production, it is difficult to see how ethanol could entirely replace MTBE without any adjustment of the oxygenates requirement. Biodiesel research has demonstrated that B100 can reduce cancer-causing emissions by 94% while B20 reduces these emissions by 27%. The DOE reports that B100 reduces greenhouse gas emissions from diesel by ≤ 78%, declaring it the single most effective existing method for reducing diesels contribution to global warming. Although World Energy is the only biodiesel company at this time to have rolled out biodiesel availability on a national scale, the attractiveness of the program and growing realization of the usefulness of the product is positioning the industry for significant growth. Although there are 75 working ethanol plants in the US currently, fully a third of them are < 10 million gal/yr in capacity, which is inefficient. With cheaper natural gas and better availability of water, allowing the production of ethanol to concentrate in the Midwest is good public policy.

AB  - Leading vegetable oil producing countries in the Asia-Pacific region signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the formation of an Asian Biofuel Council to promote cooperative partnerships among member countries to develop sustainable biofuel development programs. Member countries are expected to meet annually to review progress in developing a biofuel industry spurred by vegetable oil producers seeking new markets for their products and the global move to using clean energy. Although biofuel has not produced headline news, interest is growing in using vegetable oils for energy purposes as vegetable oil is considered a green fuel and reportedly creates less pollution than some traditional fuels.

AB  - Projected economic benefits of renewable energy derived from a native prairie grass, switchgrass, include nonmarket values that can reduce net fuel costs to near zero. At a farm gate price of $44.00/dry Mg, an agricultural sector model predicts higher profits for switchgrass than conventional crops on 16.9 million hectares (ha). Benefits would include an annual increase of $6 billion in net farm returns, a $1.86 billion reduction in government subsidies, and displacement of 44-159 Tg/year (1 Tg = 1012 g) of greenhouse gas emissions. Incorporating these values into the pricing structure for switchgrass bioenergy could accelerate commercialization and provide net benefits to the U.S. economy.

AB  - Vegetable oil fuels can be considered a renewable energy resource. Waste vegetable oil-diesel fuel blends can recycle used frying oil, which is essentially a waste product. The objective of this work was to determine the feasibility of running a 10% waste vegetable oil-90% diesel fuel blend during a 500-h period in a 3-cylinder direct-injection, 2500 cm3 Diter diesel engine. Periodically, several tests were carried out to evaluate the performance and implications of such an approach. The long-term performance of this fuel was monitored by measuring the viscosity of the lubricating oil, abnormal functioning of the engine, power loss, and excessive smoke output compared to straight diesel fuel. The results revealed an approximately 12% power loss, slight fuel consumption increase, and normal smoke emissions. Combustion efficiency dropped slightly during the testing period. It can be concluded from this field study that the Diter diesel engine, without any modifications, ran successfully on a blend of 1O% waste oil-90% diesel fuel without externally apparent damage to the engine parts. Nevertheless, it appears that the long-term use of waste oil blended with diesel fuel may need further testing before use as a viable energy solution.

AB  - Vegetable oil used for deep-frying processes becomes a contaminating waste product after use. It represents a problem for disposal and for wastewater systems. Among the possibilities for recycling of used vegetable oil, conversion into biofuel is very interesting and promising. In this work, a comparison between biofuels from waste vegetable oils from several countries was carried out. The raw materials used were the most common waste oils from Brazil (palm oil and hydrogenated fat), Spain (olive oil), and Germany (mixture of several vegetable oils). The transesterification process was carried out in two steps, using a stoichiometric amount of methanol and the necessary amount of KOH, supplemented with the exact amount of KOH to neutralize acidity. Both reactions were completed in 30 min. The temperature was in the range of 40°C to 60°C. Several parameters were analyzed, including density, viscosity, water content, and energy content. Results revealed that free fatty acid (FFA) content is a key parameter for determining the viability of the waste vegetable oil transesterification process. To carry the reaction to completion, an FFA value lower than 3% is needed; the higher the acidity of the oil, the smaller the conversion efficiency. Both excess as well as insufficient amount of catalyst may cause soap production. All methyl esters had adequate density values, but slightly higher viscosity values, which could contribute to incomplete combustion. Results showed that higher heat values (HHV) were 14% lower for biodiesel samples than for diesel fuel, which can be tolerated. Finally, we conclude that the two-step transesterification process (without any costly purification step) is an economic method for biofuel production using the waste vegetable oils tested.

AB  - Chassis dynamometer tests were performed on seven light heavy-duty diesel trucks comparing the emissions of a California diesel fuel with emissions from four other fuels: ARCO emissions control diesel (EC-D) and three 20% biodiesel blends (one yellow grease and two soy-based). The EC-D and the yellow grease biodiesel blend both showed significant reductions in total hydrocarbons (THC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions over the test vehicle fleet. EC-D also showed reductions in particulate matter (PM) emission rates. NOx emissions were comparable for the different fuel types for most of the vehicles tested. The soy-based biodiesel blends showed smaller emissions differences over the test vehicles, including some increases in PM emissions. This is somewhat in contrast to previous studies that have shown larger reductions in THC, CO, and PM for biodiesel blends. The possible influence of different fuels, fuel properties, and engine load on emissions is also discussed.

AB  - Inventories of emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) in China are reported for the years 1990, 1995, 2000, 2010, and 2020. For 1990 and 1995, historical activity data were assembled for more than 70 processes that lead to the release of NMVOC. Appropriate emission factors were developed, based on Western, Asian and Chinese experience. It is estimated that emissions were 11.1Tg in 1990 and 13.1Tg in 1995, principally from the combustion of biofuels and coal in small combustors. All emissions are presented at provincial level. Using appropriate growth factors derived from anticipated economic, population, and lifestyle changes, and factoring in regulatory changes and technology improvements, we estimate that emissions could grow to 15.6Tg in 2000, 17.2Tg in 2010, and 18.2Tg in 2020. Though activity growth rates are much higher than these increases would imply, technology improvements mediate the increases. Emissions from solvent use, paint use, and transport become increasingly important as time goes on. The sectoral distribution and per capita level of China's emissions are compared with those of other countries. Finally, gridded NMVOC emission fields are presented at 1°×1° resolution, and speciation of the emissions into 16 chemical types is reported. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper quantifies the expected pre-combustion and combustion emissions of greenhouse gases from Australian heavy vehicles using alternative fuels. We use the term exbodied emissions for these full fuel-cycle emissions. The fuels examined are low sulfur diesel (LSD), ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULS), compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), ethanol (from lignocellulose), biodiesel and waste oil. Biodiesel and ethanol have the lowest exbodied greenhouse gas emissions (in grams greenhouse gases per kilometre travelled). Biodiesel reduces exbodied greenhouse gas emissions from 41% to 51% whereas ethanol reduces emissions by 49-55%. In fact, both emit larger quantities of CO2 than conventional fuels, but as most of the CO2 is from renewable carbon stocks that fraction is not counted towards the greenhouse gas emissions from the fuel. The gaseous fuels (LPG, CNG) come next with emissions that range from 88% to 92% of diesel. The emissions of greenhouse gases from diesel are reduced if waste oil is used as a diesel extender, but the processing energy required to generate LSD and ULS in Australia increase their greenhouse gas emissions compared to diesel fuel. The extra energy required liquefy and cool LNG means that it has the highest exbodied greenhouse gas emissions of the fuels that were considered. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We measured carbonaceous material and water-soluble ionic species in the fine fraction (Dp < 1.3 urn) of aerosol samples collected on NCAR's C-130 aircraft during the intensive field phase (February-March 1999) of the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX). Polluted layers were present over most of the study region north of the equator at altitudes up to 3.2 km. The estimated aerosol mass (sum of carbonaceous and soluble ionic aerosol components) of fine-mode particles in these layers was 15.3 ± 7.9 μg m-3. The major components were particulate organic matter (POM, 35%), SO 42- (34%), black carbon (BC, 14%), and NH4 + (11%). The main difference between the composition of the marine boundary layer (MBL, 0 to ∼1.2 km), and the overlying residual continental boundary layer (1.2 to ∼3.2 km) was a higher abundance of SO 42- relative to POM in the MBL, probably due to a faster conversion of SO2 into SO42- in the MBL. Our results show that carbon is a major, and sometimes dominant, contributor to the aerosol mass and that its contribution increases with altitude. Low variability was observed in the optical properties of the aerosol in the two layers. Regression analysis of the absorption coefficient at 565 nm on BC mass (BC < 4.0 ug C m-3) yielded a specific absorption cross section of 8.1 ± 0.7 m2 g-1 for the whole period. The unusually high fraction of BC and the good correlation between the absorption coefficient and BC suggest that BC was responsible for the strong light absorption observed for the polluted layers during INDOEX. High correlation between BC and total carbon (TC) (r2 = 0.86) suggest that TC is predominantly of primary origin. Good correlations were also found between the scattering coefficient at 550 nm and the estimated aerosol mass for the fine fraction. These yielded a specific scattering cross section of 4.9 ± 0.4 m2 g -1. The observed BC/TC, BC/OC, SO42-/BC, and K+/BC ratios were fairly constant throughout the period. These ratios suggest that between 60 and 80% of the aerosol in the polluted layers during INDOEX originated from fossil fuel and between 20 and 40% from biofuel combustion.

AB  - Solubilizations of methanol and ethanol in crude palm oil (CPO) and red palm oil (RPO) were studied by using different hydrocarbon chain-length alkanols (C4-C12) as solubilizers. Ternary phase diagrams of oil/methanol/alkanol and oil/ethanol/alkanol were constructed to determine the solubilization (isotropic) region. Results showed that the solubilization of methanol and ethanol is more favourable in unsaturated RPO than in saturated CPO in the presence of long-chain alkanols. The relatively large isotropic regions were formed with long-chain alkanols in both the methanol and ethanol systems. The order of decreasing isotropic regions in both methanol and ethanol systems was dodecanol &gt; decanol &gt; octanol &gt; octan-2-ol &gt; hexanol &gt; pentanol &gt; butanol &gt; t-butanol. The branched chain alkanols and mixed oleyl alcohol/alkanol do not promote solubilization. Cold-stability test has shown all isotropic solutions were stable at 24°C for both methanol and ethanol systems. Kinematic viscosity of the selected isotropic solutions increased with the increase in both the chain length and percentage of alkanols. Long-chain alkanols (dodecanol, decanol and octanol) showed a steady increased in kinematic viscosity with increasing alkanol content. Solubilization of RPO/methanol/mediumchain alkanols (butanol, pentanol and hexanol) systems significantly reduced the kinematic viscosity of RPO from 43.7 mmV to the range allowable for No. 2 diesel fuel (1.9-4.1 mmV at 40.0°C). © 2002, Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - The recorded changes in 8 different samples of biodiesel (from 4 different feedstocks, both undistilled and distilled) during accelerated ageing are shown in this paper. ASTM D 4625 method for quick ageing of common diesel fuels, carried out at 43°C, allows to simulate the changes taking place in fuel during a long-term storage. All quality parameters of biodiesel are changing during time, according to the storage stability of different samples. The changes in other parameters not included in CEN tentative specification such as polymer content and peroxide value were recorded and plotted against storage time. Samples were also evaluated in terms of insoluble formation (filterable + adherent) but in any case significant insoluble formation was observed. The conclusion was that polymers formed during storage of biodiesel in controlled conditions are soluble in oxidised biodiesel, thanks to its high polarity and become insoluble only when oxidised biodiesel is mixed with diesel fuel.

AB  - This paper presents the results of experiments carried out to evaluate the effect of adding an anticorrosion additive to blended biofuel and lubricating oil on emissions, engine component wear and lubrication characteristics. The blended biofuels consist of 7.5 and 15 per cent palm olein (PO) with ordinary diesel oil (OD). Pure OD was used for comparison purposes. Exhaust emission gases such as NOx, CO and hydrocarbons (HCs) were measured by an exhaust emission analyser for engine operation on 50 per cent throttle at speeds of 800-3600 r/min. To measure engine component wear and lubricating oil characteristics, the engine was operated at 50 per cent throttle at a speed of 2000 r/min for a period of 100 h with each of the fuel samples. The same lubricating oil, conventional SAE 40, was used in all the fuels. A multielement oil analyser (MOA) was used to measure the increase in wear of metals (Fe, Cu, Al, Pb) and the decrease in lubricating oil additives (Zn, Ca) in the lubricating oil used. An ISL automatic Houillon viscometer (ASTM D445) and potentiometric titration (ASTM D2896) were used to measure viscosity and total base number (TBN) respectively. The results show that the addition of anticorrosion additive with biofuel and lubricating oil improves the emission and engine wear characteristics; both the exhaust emission gases (NOx, CO and HCs) and the wear of metals (Fe, Cu, Al and Pd) decrease with the blended fuels in comparison with the base fuel OD. Detailed results, including engine brake power, are discussed.

AB  - A report covers the 3rd World Refining Association (WRA) European Fuels Conference (Paris 3/19-20/2002) that presented a complete panorama of the present situation of European refining in face of the evolution of motor fuel specifications. The impact of the new forthcoming standards for sulfur, in particular, the consequences for the refineries, available technological solutions, impact of the management of the flows of hydrogen, and possibilities to optimize the refineries were reviewed. The discussion covers the calendar such as the introduction of biofuels in 2005; deficit in middle distillates; strategy for the refineries; quality of motor fuels in the world; point of view of the manufacturers such as ACEA insisting that no metallic additives be added to motor fuels in vehicles equipped with catalytic converters; range of technologies to counter the sulfur challenge; and hydrogen management, the demand for which increases because of the demands to limit sulfur in motor fuels. A section is devoted on how to remove sulfur from gasoline and diesel fuels. Motor fuels without sulfur are defined as those with < 10 ppm sulfur.

AB  - One of today's most important environmental issues is the pollution caused by traffic and transport. There is no doubt that engine emissions, particularly from cars and trucks, have been linked with severe damages to the environment and human health. The substitution of conventional fuels (gasoline, diesel) by biofuels is considered to be a potential way to reduce pollution and support sustainable agriculture. The two most common biofuels are biodiesel and ethanol. The use of biofuels is considered to be environmentally friendly. The production of biofuels, however, might cause pollution. Life-cycle assessment is the scientific evaluation method to investigate the net environmental impacts of biofuels. By means of this method it is possible to determine whether the use of biofuels or the use of conventional fuels trigger more pollution to the environment. Biofuel policy might capitalize on the production of biofuels supporting rural economic development and sustainable agriculture.

AB  - The use of renewable energy sources is becoming increasingly necessary, if we are to achieve the changes required to address the impacts of global warming. Biomass is the most common form of renewable energy, widely used in the third world but until recently, less so in the Western world. Latterly much attention has been focused on identifying suitable biomass species, which can provide high-energy outputs, to replace conventional fossil fuel energy sources. The type of biomass required is largely determined by the energy conversion process and the form in which the energy is required. In the first of three papers, the background to biomass production (in a European climate) and plant properties is examined. In the second paper, energy conversion technologies are reviewed, with emphasis on the production of a gaseous fuel to supplement the gas derived from the landfilling of organic wastes (landfill gas) and used in gas engines to generate electricity. The potential of a restored landfill site to act as a biomass source, providing fuel to supplement landfill gas-fuelled power stations, is examined, together with a comparison of the economics of power production from purpose-grown biomass versus waste-biomass. The third paper considers particular gasification technologies and their potential for biomass gasification. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, new concepts for methanol and hydrogen production from wood-based biomass were evaluated and the climate benefits that could be achieved from the use of these fuels in advanced vehicles were estimated. In the process concepts chosen for the techno-economic assessment, methanol or hydrogen production is integrated to CHP production of an existing pulp mill. The production of methanol from biomass requires a fairly advanced gasification and gas cleaning process in order to meet the requirements of the synthesis process. The hydrogen production process is somewhat simpler. However, the evaluation of the hydrogen production processes was, due to priorities set in the project, based on a more shallow evaluation. Two methanol production concepts were selected for evaluation: methanol production integrated to an existing pulp mill in Finland and in the Far East. Performance and costs of corresponding hydrogen production were also estimated roughly for the Finnish case. The fast growth of wood would allow higher capacities for fuel production in the Far East than in Europe. The capacities were selected based on the availability of the raw material at a moderate price. In the Finnish case (fuel input 100 MW) the raw material was forest residues (pine) and in the Far East case (500 MW) short rotation coppices (eucalyptus). The methanol production would be 83 400 t/a in the Finnish case and 439 400 t/a in the Far East case. The production costs in the Finnish case were estimated at around 16 EUR/GJ methanol. In the Far East case the methanol production costs were lower, approximately 10 EUR/GJ methanol. Recently, the world market price of methanol has been about 4.7 EUR/GJ. The scale of the plant has a considerable effect on the fuel production costs. Currently, the largest natural gas based methanol plants have a capacity of &gt; 800 000 t methanol/a. By combining the fuel, power, and heat production a high total efficiency can be achieved. In this study, it was estimated that by integrating the methanol production to the power plant of the pulp mill, the total efficiency of the methanol plant could be increased to 67-69% (LHV). Reductions of about 20% were identified in the methanol production costs by utilising the existing equipment of the pulp mill. Further improvements in the total efficiency and consequent production cost reductions could be achieved by process optimisation (optimised gasification temperature, minimised oxygen consumption, high carbon conversion in gasification, small hydrocarbon content in the gasification gas, optimised methanol synthesis). Possibilities of using low-grade waste heat in district heating would increase the total efficiency. The greenhouse gas emissions from the use of the biomass-based methanol or hydrogen in specified vehicle types were estimated and compared to corresponding emissions from the use of gasoline, diesel, methanol made from natural gas, hydrogen derived from electrolysis of water and those of electric vehicles. The estimated greenhouse gas emissions included emissions from the production, distribution and use of the fuels in vehicles. All the energy demand of the biomethanol and biohydrogen production processes is met with energy produced by biomass. No CO2 emissions are therefore allocated to the production processes as the biomass is assumed to be of sustainable origin. The total greenhouse gas emissions from the fuel chain (emissions from fuel production and distribution + emissions from the use in the vehicles) are significantly lower (approximately 80-90%) for the biomass-based methanol and hydrogen fuels than for the other alternatives. Only battery electric vehicles using electricity produced from biomass have emissions that are as low. Extensive use of battery-electric vehicles using biomass electricity would, however, require even larger biomass resources, as the energy efficiency of electricity production is lower than that of methanol production. The implementation of biomass-based methanol and hydrogen as transportation fuels involves barriers. The biomass resources are limited and the amount of biomass needed for the substitution of the conventional fuels with the biofuels would be large. Estimates on the availability of raw material (forest residues or eucalyptus) for the concepts studied showed that the entire fuel demand of light-duty vehicles would be difficult to meet by the concepts considered, even if the fuels were used in advanced vehicles. The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions achievable by methanol or hydrogen produced from forest residues in Finland, considering the limited availability of the resources, was estimated for the years 2010-2020. The forest residue resources were estimated to suffice for methanol or hydrogen production that would give reductions of the order of 10-20% when used in LDVs of family car type compared to use of only gasoline. The use of the methanol in fuel cell or hybrid-ICE vehicles was estimated to give almost equal reductions (∼15%), whereas the use in ICE-SI vehicles gave smaller reductions (∼10%). The use of hydrogen in fuel cell vehicles gave a few percentage units higher emission reductions than methanol. In a vehicle fleet with a large share of urban commuter type cars using biomethanol or biohydrogen the total emissions would be much smaller. Methanol from biomass could also be used for MTBE production. In Finland, the whole LDV vehicle fleet could be supplied with MTBE using methanol made from forest residues. The emission reduction achieved would, however, be much less, only one tenth of what could be achieved by using methanol in fuel cell or hybrid vehicles. The cost of wood-based methanol and hydrogen production is, depending on the concept chosen (fuel input 100-500 MWth), of the order of 2 to 4 times higher than that of gasoline or methanol made from crude oil and natural gas. Subsidies or tax incentives would be needed to introduce the wood-based fuels to the market. Fuel cell vehicles will likely be introduced to the market within a few years. The market share of the vehicles will be minor for many years, partly because of the time lags in the renewal of the vehicle fleet. The availability of sustainable hydrogen and hydrogen carrier fuels is scarce, and could in the long run become the main obstacle for the success of the fuel cell vehicles. Sustainable hydrogen production technology based on chemical or biological processes or electrolysis utilising renewable energy, or production of hydrogen from fossil fuels combined with CO2 recovery and disposal, are not expected to be commercial technology until the mid of the century, if even then. Biomass-based methanol, or hydrogen, could enhance the introduction of the fuel cell vehicles to the market before other sustainable concepts for, e.g., hydrogen production are developed. The foreseen growth in the transportation volume and decreasing oil resources could also increase the attractiveness of biomass-based methanol, or hydrogen, as transportation fuels in the future. Environmental benefits are seen especially in urban transportation, where the use of these fuels in fuel cell vehicles could also improve the local air quality substantially.

AB  - Black carbon (BC) is an important aerosol species because of its global and regional influence on radiative forcing and its local effects on the environment and human health. We have estimated the emissions of BC in China, where roughly one-fourth of global anthropogenic emissions is believed to originate. China's high rates of usage of coal and biofuels are primarily responsible for high BC emissions. This paper pays particular attention to the application of appropriate emission factors for China and the attenuation of these emissions where control devices are used. Nevertheless, because of the high degree of uncertainty associated with BC emission factors, we provide ranges of uncertainty for our emission estimates, which are approximately a factor of eight. In our central case, we calculate that BC emissions in China in 1995 were 1342Gg, about 83% being generated by the residential combustion of coal and biofuels. We estimate that BC emissions could fall to 1224Gg by 2020. This 9% decrease in BC emissions can be contrasted with the expected increase of 50% in energy use; the reduction will be obtained because of a transition to more advanced technology, including greater use of coal briquettes in place of raw coal in cities and towns. The increased use of diesel vehicles in the future will result in a greater share of the transport sector in total BC emissions. Spatially, BC emissions are predominantly distributed in an east-west swath across China's heartland, where the rural use of coal and biofuels for cooking and heating is widespread. This is in contrast to the emissions of most other anthropogenically derived air pollutants, which are closely tied to population and industrial centers. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Studies show that the combustion of fossil fuel is the main cause of increasing global atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, which is the cause of the greenhouse effect. This has promoted increased research world-wide in a bid to source a greener alternative fuel substitute for conventional fossil fuel. Biofuel appears to be an alternative energy source for diesel engines. Although the combustion of biofuels produces CO2, the same quantity is absorbed by plants during photosynthesis, hence CO2 levels are kept in balance. The sulphur content of plant fuels is also low and less than 0.01% by weight compared to 0.05% by weight for diesel fuel. The effect of acid rain is therefore reduced or ameliorated. High viscosity is one of the major problems relating to the direct use of neat vegetable oils as fuels. One method of reducing viscosity is by blending with a low viscosity and volatile fuel. This paper investigates the emission characteristics of neat rapeseed oil and its blend with diesel fuel in a single cylinder unmodified diesel engine. Tests were also conducted on pure diesel fuel so that a comparative assessment could be made. Test results showed reduced hydrocarbon (HC) emissions when running on biofuels. The CO production was higher when running on biofuel at high engine speed and was significantly reduced at low speed operations. The CO2 emissions were similar for all fuels. The analyses of lubrication oil after the runs on plant fuels showed a net reduction in viscosity. © 2001 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper describes in detail a fast pyrolysis process that converts a solid biomass waste, such as bagasse, into a liquid biofuel that can be used as a substitute for diesel oil to produce power in gas turbine engines and boilers. This technology has been developed and successfully demonstrated for more than 3,000 hours operation in DynaMotive Technologies' pilot plant. The process utilises a deep bubbling fluidised bed design combined with a novel BioOil recovery system. The properties of BioOil produced from agriculture biomass waste feedstocks including bagasse and forest residues such as bark and wood will be given in detail, particularly in reference to their application as a fuel for gas turbine engines. Economics of a combined cycle power generation plant utilising pyrolysis liquid (BioOil) from biomass in a gas turbine engine is presented.

AB  - This study reports emission factors of carbon monoxide and size-resolved aerosols from combustion of wood, dung cake, and biofuel briquette in traditional and improved stoves in India. Wood was the cleanest burning fuel, with higher emissions of CO from dung cake and particulate matter from both dung cake and briquette fuels. Combustion of dung cake, especially in an improved metal stove, resulted in extremely high pollutant emissions. Instead, biogas from anaerobic dung digestion should be promoted as a cooking fuel for public health protection. Pollutant emissions increased with increasing stove thermal efficiency, implying that thermal efficiency enhancement in the improved stoves was mainly from design features leading to increased heat transfer but not combustion efficiency. Compared to the traditional stove, the improved stoves resulted in the lower pollutant emissions on a kW h-1 basis from wood combustion but in similar emissions from briquette and dung cake. Stove designs are needed with good emissions performance across multiple fuels. Unimodal aerosol size distributions were measured from biofuel combustion with mass median aerodynamic diameters of 0.5-0.8 μm, about a factor of 10 larger than those from fossil fuel combustion (e.g. diesel), with potential implications for lung deposition and health risk.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative fuel consisting of the alkyl monoesters of fatty acids from vegetable oils or animal fats. Previous research has shown that biodiesel-fueled engines produce less carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, and particulate emissions compared to diesel fuel. One drawback of biodiesel is that it is more prone to oxidation than petroleum-based diesel fuel. In its advanced stages, this oxidation can cause the fuel to become acidic and to form insoluble gums and sediments that can plug fuel filters. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of oxidized biodiesel on engine performance and emissions. A John Deere 4276T turbocharged DI diesel engine was fueled with oxidized and unoxidized biodiesel and the performance and emissions were compared with No. 2 diesel fuel. The neat biodiesels, 20% blends, and the base fuel (No. 2 diesel) were tested at two different loads (100 and 20%) and three injection timings (3° advanced, standard; 3° retarded). The tests were performed at steady-state conditions at a single engine speed of 1400 rpm. The engine performance of the neat biodiesels and their blends was similar to that of No. 2 diesel fuel with the same thermal efficiency, but higher fuel consumption. Compared with unoxidized biodiesel, oxidized neat biodiesel produced 15 and 16% lower exhaust carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between the oxides of nitrogen and smoke emissions from oxidized and unoxidized biodiesel. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - A report on the uses of biofuels, produced or adapted from by-products of other processes, was presented. Various short rotation coppice (SRC), like willow and poplar, are used to produce heat and /or electricity or a diesel substitute. Farming by-products such as wet biomass feedstocks or residues from livestock farming and food production could be recycled into methane biogas to be burnt in a gas boiler to generate heat and into bio-ethanol for use as transport fuel.

AB  - Biofuels feature strongly in scenarios predicting future energy supplies because they can be produced anywhere plants grow, they are not intermittent and they can supply liquid fuels to the transport sector without major modifications to the existing infrastructure. Sweet sorghum can be used to supply both electricity and liquid fuels (i.e., ethanol) and recent agronomic and industrial trials in Europe, Asia and Africa have demonstrated its productive potential. The potential for the production of bioenergy in southern Africa using sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) is evaluated in this paper. The evaluation is based on eight years of agronomic trials at the Lowveld Research Station and two full-scale industrial processing trials in 1999 and 2000 at Triangle Sugar Mill in southeast Zimbabwe. Under the existing conditions in SE Zimbabwe, varieties and technologies, sweet sorghum can produce 60 fresh weight t of above-ground biomass per hectare in 120 days growth. The resulting 46 t of fresh weight stems can produce 3000 l per hectare of anhydrous ethanol and 12.6 GJ electricity (3.5 MWhe at 15% conversion efficiency). Whilst roughly 10% of the land area of sugarcane estates would theoretically be available for sweet sorghum growth at any one time, in the future, the main potential for the use of sweet sorghum is in the villages and small-holder farms. The remote and small-scale nature of this type of production poses a considerable challenge to identifying appropriate technologies and markets for the use of the products. Significant quantities of both liquid fuels and electricity could be produced from sweet sorghum in southern Africa, calculated here to be about 3% of the region's electricity consumption and one-third of the liquid fuel consumption (gasoline and diesel). This level of bioenergy production would require that the equivalent of 1% of existing cropland (arable + permanent) was dedicated to the growth and processing of sweet sorghum. © 2001 International Energy Initiative, Inc.

AB  - A relatively cheap and promising method of producing biofuel from renewable vegetable source, rapeseed oil, was substantiated. Etherification of rapeseed oil produced a mixture of methyl ethers of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (MERO). Chromatographic analysis of MERO determined methyl ether composition and low heat value of biofuel. Physical characteristics of diesel fuel, MERO, and their mixtures were determined as well as the effect of these characteristics on injection, atomization, and carburetion processes in diesel cylinder.

AB  - Decision making to determine government support policy for agro-energy industry can be assisted by mathematical programming and Multiple Criteria procedures. In this case study, tax credit policy in the French bio-fuel industry producing ethanol and esters is determined. Micro-economic models simulate the agricultural sector and the bio-fuel industry through multi-level mixed integer linear programming. Aggregate supply of energy crops at the national level is estimated using a staircase model of 450 individual farm sub-models specialising in arable cropping. The government acts as a leader, since bio-fuel chains depend on subsidies. The model provides rational responses of the industry, taking into account of the energy crops' supply, to any public policy scheme (unitary tax exemptions for bio-fuels subject to budgetary constraints) as well as the performance of each response regarding total greenhouse gases emissions (GHG), budgetary expenditure and agents' surpluses. Budgetary, environmental and social concerns will affect policy decisions, and a multi-criteria optimisation module projects the decision maker aims at the closest feasible compromise solutions. When public expenditure is the first priority, the best compromise solution corresponds to tax exemptions of about 2 FF1-1 [FF: French Franc (1Ε equivalent to 6.559 FF)] for ester and 3 FF1-1 for ethanol (current tax exemptions amount at 2.30 FF-1 for ester and 3.30 FF1-1 for ethanol). On the other hand, a priority on the reduction of GHG emissions requires an increase of ester volume produced at the expense of ethanol production (2.30 FF1-1 for both ester and ethanol chains proposed by the model). © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this study was to provide background information on biomass pyrolysis oils (bio-oils) regarding their use as a liquid fuel for gas turbine applications. The bio-oil was obtained by vacuum pyrolysis of softwood bark residues. Alkali metal content, viscosity, solid content, heating value, surface tension, moisture content and density of the bio-oil were investigated. The effect of the addition of methanol and/or a pyrolytic aqueous phase on the physicochemical properties of the bio-oils was also investigated. The pyrolytic aqueous phase is the sum of the water contained in form of moisture in the feedstock plus the water formed during biomass pyrolysis reactions. The results indicated that the bio-oil sample investigated is a valuable gas turbine fuel: it has a relatively low Na+K+Ca content (21 ppm), a low viscosity (5.3 cSt@90°C), a high net heating value (32MJ/kg, as-received basis) and a low solid content (0.34 wt‰). The addition of methanol to the oil was beneficial. It was also found that the pyrolytic aqueous phase addition had no significant effect on the viscosity, but that its 'flowability' effect was beneficial for other properties. A concentration of 10-15‰ of the aqueous phase in the bio-oil seemed to be optimal. The second phase of this study investigated the storage and thermal stability of bio-oils and their mixtures. This was carded out using a method performed in our laboratory. The results are presented in Part II of this study. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) seed oil was extracted, and its physical and chemical characteristics determined. The crude oil was bleached and the ester-fuel (methyl-ester) was prepared by trans-esterification with 6-molar excess of methanol using sodium hydroxide as a catalyst. Methyl ester yield and fuel properties of the oil (crude and bleached) and its methyl ester were determined and compared to that of commercial diesel fuel. The analysis of the properties in comparison to commercial diesel fuel showed that trans-methylation improved the fuel properties of the oil. The viscosity was substantially reduced from 37.85 to 6.29 cSt. Calculated cetane index (increased from 34.00 to 44.81), other fuel properties were also found to improved. The results supports the choice of monosters, in place of straight rubber seed oil, as having better potential for use as alternative diesel fuel. However, oxidative stability was reduced by trans-methylation. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

The ignition properties of these types of biodiesel were evaluated calculating the cetane index of the transesterification products, and the blending cetane number of the amide biodiesel blended with conventional diesel. Amide biodiesel enhances the ignition properties of the petrochemical diesel fuel, and it could account for the 5% market share that should be secured to biofuels by 2005.

AB  - Engine results using biofuels have varied considerably in the reported literature. This article addresses two potential sources of this variation, atomization differences and impurities due to lack of quality control during production. Atomization is the first process encountered during the combustion of fuels in a compression ignition engine and is largely determined by the fuel's viscosity and surface tension. Previous work using five experimentally produced methyl ester biodiesel fuels showed that the viscosity and surface tension could be predicted from their fatty acid ester composition, and the atomization characteristics in turn could be predicted from their viscosity and surface tension. This article utilizes the results of that work to give a quantitative comparison of the atomization characteristics of fifteen biodiesel fuel types using the fuel's viscosity and surface tension, predicted directly from the fatty acid composition of the fuels. Except for coconut and rapeseed biodiesel fuels, all of the rest of the 15 biodiesel fuels had similar atomization characteristics. Since the most likely contaminant in the fuel from the processing was residual glycerides, their effect on viscosity and surface tension was studied experimentally and their effect on the atomization characteristics was computed.

AB  - As more refiners consider higher hydrotreating severity to meet low-sulfur specifications, problems with diesel stability and lubricity could increase. In some cases, lubricity improvement and corrosion protection could be restored with corrosion inhibitor and conductivity additives. A discussion covers the era of low sulfur gasoline (0-50 ppm) where the use of alternative fuels such as alcohols (MTBE, ETBE, etc.) and biofuels have very different properties from conventional fuels and need special additive treatments; extensive blending changes associated with production of various low-sulfur gasoline grades; low-sulfur diesel, which reportedly increase fuel jelling, requiring the use of additive systems capable of reducing the pour point and cold filter plugging temperature by 10 or even 30°; and the economic penalties of inefficient unit operations.

AB  - To characterise the mechanisms occurring in the deposit formation during the combustion of vegetable oils used as biofuels in Diesel engines, it is necessary to investigate the vaporisation of vegetable oil droplets under various flow, pressure and temperature conditions. In the current work, experimental results about the vaporisation of rapeseed and sunflower oil methyl ester droplets at high temperatures are presented. The fibre-suspended droplet technique is used and the time evolution of droplet diameter during vaporisation is observed by imaging technique. Average and instantaneous vaporisation rates have been estimated from the d2-curves at temperatures between 473 and 1020 K and at atmospheric pressure. The droplets of vegetable oil methyl esters evaporate like mono-component droplets with a very significant heating phase. A comparison with experimental results obtained with n-alkanes droplets (from n-pentane to n-decane) and prediction of the quasi-steady theory is also presented and discussed. © 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - LPG motor fuel, natural gas vehicles (NGV), AquazoleTM, cleaner diesel, hybrid vehicle, fuel cell: There is no lack of solutions to respond to the exigencies of the public domain which, by the 1996 Law of the Atmosphere, obliged the state, public establishments, and territorial collectivities with fleets of &gt; 20 vehicles, to convert ≥ 20% of them into clean vehicles when they are turned in for new vehicles to take their place. As a reference establishment with its 4000 buses and a cycle of renewal of 300 buses annually, Regie Autonome des Transports Parisiens (RATP) put into service at the end of 1999 57 LPG vehicles and 53 NGV. There are also 126 buses operating on Aquazole, the clean diesel motor fuel commercialized by Elf Antar France, and 10 electric drive buses. RATP is also thinking about the hybrid vehicle, which some believe will be the solution 5 yr from now and of the fuel cell, which is perceived as a solution further down the road. Diester biofuels are no longer considered an environmental solution because their environmental balance is not significant. Biofuels are no longer taken seriously.

AB  - Throughout the 1990s, Swedish towns and cities made considerable efforts to promote a shift to environmentally benign bus traffic and municipal vehicle fleets. This paper examines measures taken by the cities of Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmo, and, where public buses are concerned, the greater regions of these three cities. (This paper is based on some of the results of Kageson 1999.) The aim was to analyse to what extent the measures have been cost-effective and to identify how the local and regional authorities implicitly value reductions of carbon emissions from cars and buses. The analysis points to good profitability for particle filters and biogas buses and to a slight economic deficit for natural gas buses. Stockholm's investment in ethanol buses is seen to be socio-economically unprofitable. The training of bus drivers in gentle and economical driving has the highest profitability of all the measures studied. The commitment to alternative cars appears to be less successful. The cities in question have neglected the negative side-effects of the transition to new fuels, such as increased use of primary energy and excessive costs. Vehicle size and specific fuel consumption appear more important parameters for reducing carbon emissions than a shift to biofuels.

AB  - We examine the life cycles of gasoline, diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), and ethanol (C2H5OH)-fueled internal combustion engine (ICE) automobiles. Port and direct injection and spark and compression ignition engines are examined. We investigate diesel fuel from both petroleum and biosources as well as C2H5OH from corn, herbaceous bio-mass, and woody biomass. The baseline vehicle is a gasoline-fueled 1998 Ford Taurus. We optimize the other fuel/powertrain combinations for each specific fuel as a part of making the vehicles comparable to the baseline in terms of range, emissions level, and vehicle lifetime. Life-cycle calculations are done using the economic input-output life-cycle analysis (EIO-LCA) software; fuel cycles and vehicle end-of-life stages are based on published model results. We find that recent advances in gasoline vehicles, the low petroleum price, and the extensive gasoline infrastructure make it difficult for any alternative fuel to become commercially viable. The most attractive alternative fuel is compressed natural gas because it is less expensive than gasoline, has lower regulated pollutant and toxics emissions, produces less greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and is available in North America in large quantities. However, the bulk and weight of gas storage cylinders required for the vehicle to attain a range comparable to that of gasoline vehicles necessitates a redesign of the engine and chassis. Additional natural gas transportation and distribution infrastructure is required for large-scale use of natural gas for transportation. Diesel engines are extremely attractive in terms of energy efficiency, but expert judgment is divided on whether these engines will be able to meet strict emissions standards, even with reformulated fuel. The attractiveness of direct injection engines depends on their being able to meet strict emissions standards without losing their greater efficiency. Biofuels offer lower GHG emissions, are sustainable, and reduce the demand for imported fuels. Fuels from food sources, such as biodiesel from soybeans and C2H5OH from corn, can be attractive only if the co-products are in high demand and if the fuel production does not diminish the food supply. C2H5OH from herbaceous or woody biomass could replace the gasoline burned in the light-duty fleet while supplying electricity as a co-product. While it costs more than gasoline, bioethanol would be attractive if the price of gasoline doubled, if significant reductions in GHG emissions were required, or if fuel economy regulations for gasoline vehicles were tightened. © 2000 Air &amp; Waste Management Association.

AB  - The performance of a constant speed, stationary diesel engine using ethanol-diesel blends as fuel has been evaluated experimentally. The experiments were performed using 5, 10, 15 and 20% ethanol-diesel blends. Diesel fuel was used as a basis for comparison. The effect of using different blends of ethanol-diesel on engine horsepower, brake specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency, the exhaust gas temperature and lubricating oil temperature were studied. The results indicate no significant power reduction in the engine operation on ethanol-diesel blends (up to 20%) at a 5% level of significance. Brake specific fuel consumption increased by up to 9% with an increase of ethanol up to 20% in the blends as compared to diesel alone. The exhaust gas temperature, lubricating oil temperatures and exhaust emissions (CO and No(x)) were lower with operations on ethanol-diesel blends as compared to operation on diesel.

AB  - In this study the rape seed oil methyl ester (RME) production chain was analysed with respect to its energy- and exergy efficiencies. The differences between results from an ordinary energy analysis and an exergy analysis of the production were also quantified and discussed. The sensitivity of the results to changes in some of the most important input parameters were then analysed in order to find production strategies that increase the exergy efficiency. The study was applied to rape seed cultivation situated in southern Sweden. The rape seed oil was hot pressed in a large-scale plant, and the RME was esterfied in the same factory as that in which in the rape seed oil was pressed. Both direct and indirect energy and exergy flows used for RME production were included. The analysis showed that a large part of the energy and exergy used to produce RME was related to nitrogen fertilizers and diesel fuels. Another important conclusion was that the exergy efficiency of the production in general is higher than the energy efficiency. A third conclusion was that it is possible, by using alternative production strategies, to improve the exergy efficiency without decreasing the energy efficiency.

AB  - In the last few years the potential of the drought resistant tropical tree Jatropha curcas L. (Euphorbiaceae) for the production of biofuels and industrial products has been assessed by several groups. Various novel methods for the cultivation and generic improvement of J. curcas have been presented. A trans-esterification process of the seed oil for its use as a biofuel was evaluated on an industrial scale (1500 t/a). Various biologically active substances have been isolated and characterized from all parts of the plant. Their mechanisms of action have been studied in relation to a great number of applications of J. curcas in traditional medicine. Substances such as phorbol esters, responsible for the toxicity of J. curcas to animals and humans, have been isolated and their molluscicidal, insecticidal and fungicidal properties have been demonstrated in lab-scale experiments and field trials. Newly developed biotechnological processes related to the exploitation of J. curcas include the genetic improvement of the plant, biological pest control, enzyme-supported oil extraction, anaerobic fermentation of the press cake and the isolation of antiinflammatory substances and wound-healing enzymes.

AB  - The performances of a 2984-kW (4,000-hp) gas turbine-powered passenger locomotive fueled with different biofuels are compared with the performance of the same locomotive fueled with Diesel #2. The process of selecting a small number of biofuels from a detailed evaluation of 13 readily available biofuels is explored. A simulation of operation in an actual high-speed corridor is used to develop exhaust emission values in terms of tonnes (tons)/year for a complete service, and then in terms of g (lb)/trip of primary smog-producing pollutants. Energy use and cost per trip are developed from the same simulation. All of these values are compared with Diesel #2 values developed in previous research. Biofuel use in respect to turbine maintenance costs is discussed. Explored are the implications of carrying and delivering the biofuels on a locomotive in terms of (a) projected range with a given fuel tank size and (b) the minimum fuel tank size required to serve a typical corridor.

AB  - This analysis estimates potential US biodiesel demand in three specific markets that the US biodiesel industry has identified as likely candidates for commercialization: federal fleets, mining, and marine/estuary areas. If a 20% biodiesel blend becomes a competitive alternative fuel in the future, these markets could demand as much as 379 M1 of biodiesel. The Food and Agricultural Policy Simulator, an econometric model of US agriculture, was used to estimate the impacts of 76, 189, and 379 M1 of soybean-oil-based biodiesel production on the agricultural sector of the United States. The results indicate that the increased demand for soybean oil would increase US soybean oil price by as much as 14.1%, Corresponding to this price change, US soybean price would rise 2.0% and soybean meal price would fall by 3.3%. US net farm income would increase by as much as 0.3%.

AB  - A genetically altered plant strain (Cuphea viscosissima VS-320) was identified which produces an oil with elevated levels of medium- and short-chain triglycerides. Previous studies have suggested that such an oil may be appropriate for use as a substitute for diesel fuel without chemical conversion of component triglycerides to methyl esters. This oil is also of interest for other industrial applications. This paper discusses the oil composition of C. viscosissima VS-320 and presents the analysis of several important alternative fuel screening properties of this oil: dynamic viscosity for shear rates of 1.617-64.69 s-1 at temperatures of 25-80°C, boiling point at atmospheric pressure, temperature dependence of vapor pressure (from 40 to 760 mmHg for the 300-400°C temperature range), and heat of vaporization (ΔH(v)). These properties have been established as indicators of fuel performance and can be used for initial screening of possible diesel fuel substitutes. These properties are compared to those of diesel, biodiesel, and vegetable oils. Analysis of these properties suggests that further genetic development of this plant as a source of diesel fuel is warranted.

AB  - The objective set by the EC in 1995 was that 5% of the fuel for transportation in France should be produced from renewable energy by 2005. Experimental work on liquid biofuels started to develop in France when the setaside rules and tax incentives came into force in 1991. Out of the two routes originally considered for development: bioethanol and its ETBE derivative, and vegetable oils and their methyl ester derivatives, priority has now been given to two possible liquid biofuels. These are: ETBE produced from sugar beet and wheat and from sub-products of starch industry blended with gasoline for use in spark ignition engines; and rapeseed methyl ester (RME) for use in diesel engines at various blend rates.

AB  - Onboard hydrogen generation using compact plasmatron devices could provide important new possibilities for reducing pollution from motor vehicles, making use of alternative fuels, and increasing engine efficiency. These improvements would involve the use of the plasmatron as a very small, rugged, rapid response and highly flexible means of electrical heating of gases. Plasmatron heating could be used to facilitate conversion of a wide range of hydrocarbon fuels into hydrogen-rich gas onboard a vehicle. Use of combinations of fuels is possible through potential transformation of a variety of fuels into hydrogen-rich gas. Another advantage of use of onboard plasmatron generation of hydrogen is that it could be used only when required and could be readily turned on and off. Preliminary experimental studies of plasmatron conversion of difficult-to-use alternative fuels (biofuels), iso-octane (representative of gasoline), and diesel fuel are described. Concepts for application to trucks and other heavy duty vehicles, sport utility vehicles and automobiles are discussed.

AB  - The steam cracking of methyl oleate has been studied in a tubular reactor between 500 and 650°C and for flow times between 350 and 600 ms. Methyl oleate-CH3-(CH2)τCH=CH-(CH 2)τCOOCH3 - is obtained by transesterification of rapeseed oil mainly composed of oleic acid. Rapeseed oil methyl esters are currently used as biofuel (called diester) of substitution of the diesel oil but have a cost price higher than that of the diesel oil. The objective of this study is the optimization of the production of biomolecules (essentially C10-C14 alpha-olefins) that have outlets in lubricant and detergent fields. A temperature of 600°C and a flow time between 350 and 600 ms allow to obtain maximal yields in target products while avoiding a too great high production of C1-C4 hydrocarbons.

AB  - The modification and testing of a compression ignition engine using diesel and vapourized ethanol as fuel has been carried out. Tests on the engine fuelled with diesel only were made, and the performance evaluated to form a basis for comparison for those of ethanol-diesel dual fuelling. Modifications were made in the introduction of the ethanol and air. A carburettor was used to vapourize aqueous ethanol into the engine. The effect of preheating the intake ethanol-air mixture was also investigated. Performance was evaluated in terms of engine horsepower, brake specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency, the exhaust gas temperature, lubricating oil temperature and exhaust emissions. The vapourized ethanol partially reduced diesel fuel consumption but also increased total fuel delivery. Vapourization increased power output, thermal efficiency and exhaust emissions but lowered exhaust temperature and lubricating oil temperatures.

AB  - In nutrition physiology, rapeseed oil is one of the most valuable edible oils due to its high oleic acid content, the alpha-linoteic acid (an ω3-fatty acid) and the high concentration of vitamin E. Despite a lower market volume the cold pressed, not raffinated oils with their high prices realize high proceeds and more profit also for the oilseed producer. Quality standards and their maintenance as well as the marketing of these special, i.e. cold pressed, rapeseed oils should be oriented on olive oil. Rapeseed (press) cake is produced by pressing of rapeseed grown on set aside area. Feed value and price are defined for this relatively new feed with its varying fat content (from <10 to 20 %). Rapeseed cake with at least 17 % fat content reaches the metabolizable energy pig of barley. A lower press grade increases the price due to higher concentration of crude fat and energy. If the oil press operator presses and sells more oil, the feed value and price of residue will consequently decrease. A glucosinolate content of more than 20 mmol/kg increases the risk of feed intake depression, particularly in pigs. This results in price reductions. Therefore, any price calculation is based not only on determination of crude fat but also on glucosinolate analysis. Rapeseed press cake without certification of analyses may only realize a price on the level of rapeseed meal solvent extracted. Rapeseed and high fat rapeseed press cake modify the fat of the produced food. A milk fat with a higher content of oleic acid and win less palmitic acid is desired in respect of health prophylaxis and better butter spreadability. Pig fat with more ω3-fatty acids although in better respect of nutrition physiology is more sensitive to oxydation or spoilage. Rapeseed oil and rapeseed feeding for meat products like cured sausages and ham with aroma stability for long-term storage must be limited. In dry feed for pigs the permissible content of 3 % rapeseed oil is markedly higher than for soya oil. This limitation is not relevant for rapeseed press cake also in case of high fat content, because the tolerated glucosinolate dose is reached already with 50-100 g rapeseed press cake/kg feed, corresponding only to 1-2 % rape fat. Rapeseed lecithin and the crude glycerine obtaining by reesterification of rapeseed oil to fatty acid methylesters ("Biofuel") have to investigate also in animal feeding.

AB  - The biodegradability of various biodiesel fuels was examined by the CO2 evolution method (EPA 560/6-82-003), BOD5 (EPA 405.1), COD (EPA 410), and gas chromatography (GC) analyses in an aquatic system. The fuels examined included the methyl- and ethyl-esters of rapeseed oil and soybean oil, neat rapeseed oil, neat soybean oil and Phillips 2-D low sulfur, reference petroleum diesel. Blends of biodiesel/petroleum diesel at different volumetric ratios, including 80/20, 50/50, and 20/80, were also examined. The results demonstrate that all the biodiesel fuels are 'readily biodegradable'. Moreover, in the presence of REE, the degradation rate of petroleum diesel increased to twice that of petroleum diesel alone. The pattern of biodegradation in the blends and reasons why biodiesel is more readily degradable than petroleum diesel are discussed. The biodegradation monitoring results from both CO2 evolution and GC methods are compared.

AB  - A study on the possible atmospheric factors reponsible for visibility reduction in Hong Kong has been carried out using time-matched sets of data on the important meteorological parameters and on the chemical species in aerosol matter over the 1990-1992 period. Careful observations on the correlations as well as rotated principal components obtained from the original and screened (< 80% RH) data sets suggest that (i) visibility is highest in the summer and lowest in the winter halves of the year; (ii) mixing height is the most important meteorological variable and (iii) ammonium, sulphate, nitrate and potassium are the primary chemical species, among those considered, that affect visibility. It is suggested that sulphates and nitrates of ammonium formed through gas-to-particle conversion reactions, and a fine particulate component containing potassium, possibly from some unknown biomass combustion source(s) are involved in the visibility reduction through scattering in the urban Hong Kong atmosphere. However, additional scattering by organics and absorption by elemental carbon from combustion of biofuels, especially automotive (diesel) emission is quite likely, and needs to be investigated, as is the question of local and foreign contributions of pollutants to visibility reduction.

AB  - Methyl and ethyl esters, prepared from various vegetable oils by the process of transesterification, have shown much promise as fuels for all types of diesel engines. Very limited information is available on possible deterioration of biodiesel in storage. This project was designed to determine the extent of deterioration of Rape Methyl Ester (RME) and Rape Ethyl Ester (REE) in storage. The study involved triplicate samples of RME and REE stored in glass and steel containers at room temperature (inside) and at the local ambient outdoor temperatures (outside). The study was conducted for 24 months. At the beginning of the study and at three-month intervals, samples were taken for measurement of peroxide value, acid value, density, viscosity, and heat of combustion. At the conclusion of the study, engine performance tests were conducted with the two year stored REE and RME, new REE and RME, and low sulfur diesel reference fuel. On the average, the esters increased over time in all of the previously mentioned properties with the exception of heat of combustion, which decreased. Regression models are presented to predict the deterioration with time. Engine power varied less than 2% for both Biodiesel fuels compared to the stored counterparts while smoke density decreased 3.2% for the stored RME and increased 17.5% for stored REE.

AB  - The production of fatty acid methyl esters, to be used as a diesel substitute (biodiesel), has been studied. The reaction of refined sunflower oil and methanol was carried out over different types (acid and basic, homogeneous and heterogeneous) of catalysts. The catalyst that led to largest conversions was sodium hydroxide. No methyl esters were detected when zirconium-based catalysts and an immobilized lipase were used. The process of biodiesel production was optimized by application of the factorial design and response surface methodology. Temperature and catalyst concentration were found to have a positive influence on conversion, concentration effect being larger than temperature effect. A second-order model was obtained to predict conversions as a function of temperature and catalyst concentration. Optimum conditions for the production of methyl esters were found to be mild temperatures (20-50°C) and large catalyst concentrations.

AB  - Rape methyl ester (RME) is a suitable substitute for mineral diesel in existing compression-ignition engines. Its use as an alternative transport fuel will result in decreased emissions of atmospheric pollutants (particularly SO2, hydrocarbons and smoke) from this source. However, to encourage such a trend in the UK, the Government needs to adopt the European Union's recommendation of a reduction of excise duties on biofuels to 10% of the rate applied to lead-free petrol to ensure its economic short-term competitiveness in the UK market. Such a subsidy will not be required by the year 2004. The available resource base for rape-seed oil in the UK limits the production of RME, so it could satisfy only up to 4% of demand on fuel by road vehicles powered by diesel engines in the UK. This suggests that it should be used preferentially in urban areas and waterways where its environmental benefits would be maximized.

AB  - Agriculture currently contributes significantly to the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere, primarily through the conversion of native ecosystems to agricultural uses in the tropics. Yet there are major opportunities for mitigation of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions through changes in the use and management of agricultural lands. Agricultural mitigation options can be broadly divided into two categories: (I) Strategies to maintain and increase stocks of organic C in soils (and biomass), and (ii) reductions in fossil C consumption, including reduced emissions by the agricultural sector itself and through agricultural production of biofuels to substitute for fossil fuels. Reducing the conversion of new land to agriculture in the tropics could substantially reduce CO2 emissions, but this option faces several difficult issues including population increase, land tenure and other socio-political factors in developing countries. The most significant opportunities for reducing tropical land conversions are in the humid tropics and in tropical wetlands. An important linkage is to improve the productivity and sustainability of existing agricultural lands in these regions. Globally, we estimate potential agricultural CO2 mitigation through soil C sequestration to be 0.40.9 Pg C y-1, through better management of existing agricultural soils, restoration of degraded lands, permanent 'set-asides' of surplus agricultural lands in temperate developed countries and restoration of 10-20% of former wetlands now being used for agriculture. However, soils have a finite capacity to store additional C and therefore any increases in C stocks following changes in management would be largely realized within 50-100 years. Mitigation potential through reducing direct agricultural emissions is modest, 0.01-0.05 Pg C y-1. However, the potential to offset fossil C consumption through the use of biofuels produced by agriculture is substantial, 0.5-1.6 Pg C y-1, mainly through the production of dedicated biofuel crops with a smaller contribution (0.2-0.3 Pg C y-1) from crop residues. Many agricultural mitigation options represent 'win-win' situations, in that there are important side benefits, in addition to CO2 mitigation, that could be achieved, e.g. improved soil fertility with higher soil organic matter, protection of lands poorly suited for permanent agriculture, cost saving for fossil fuel inputs and diversification of agricultural production (e.g. biofuels). However, the needs for global food production and farmer/societal acceptability suggest that mitigation technologies should conform to: (I) The enhancement of agricultural production levels in parts of the world where food production and population demand are in delicate balance and (ii) the accrual of additional benefits to the farmer (e.g., reduced labor, reduced or more efficient use of inputs) and society at large.

AB  - Turkey, like most of the developing countries of the world has vast agricultural potential, yet the country a highly dependent on oil imports, which satisfy 90% of its crude oil demand. Since Turkey has an economy based on agriculture, the usage of national resources in the energy field is extremely important. In the first yeas of the Turkish Republic, in 1931, the usage of national resources as an alternative to conventional fuels became a subject of increasing interest. Since then a lot of research has been conducted, but only a limited amount of application has been realized. Alcohol has always occupied an important place among the alternative fuel studies. The subject has been the scope of some research institute projects and university and government development planning studies. In Turkey, one of the most important studies in this area has been undertaken by our research group in our university. This study is a general review of alcohol usage as an alternative automotive fuel in Turkey. This review includes a short history of the subject, the approach of the government, the research results, possible developments on the subject in the near future, and finally, it concludes with our proposals.

AB  - Results of performance, exhaust emissions and lube oil analysis of a diesel engine fueled with Malaysian palm oil diesel (POD) and ordinary diesel (OD) emulsions containing 5% and 10% of water by volume are compared with those obtained when 100% POD and OD fuel were used. Very promising results have been obtained. Neither the lower cetane number of POD fuel nor its emulsification with water presented obstacles to the operation of the diesel engine during steady state engine tests and the twenty-hour endurance tests. Polymerization and carbon deposits on fuel injector nozzles were monitored. Engine performance and fuel consumption for POD and its emulsions were comparable with those of OD fuel. Accumulations of wear metal debris in crank-case oil samples were lower with POD and emulsified fuels compared with baseline OD fuel. Both OD and POD emulsions with 10% water by volume showed promising tendency for wear resistance. The exhaust emissions for POD and emulsified fuels for both OD and POD were found to be much cleaner, containing less CO, CO2 and HC; the absence of black smoke from the exhaust is an advantage. Theoretical aspects of diesel combustion are used to aid the interpretation of the observed engine behaviour.

AB  - Measurements of the combustion performance of biofuel oils, blends with diesel fuel and emulsions with water have been made, using a variety of experimental techniques. Photographic examination of single droplets demonstrated similar burning rates to diesel fuel. High speed records revealed the explosive combustion of oil-water emulsion droplets. Spray-flame photography showed up the poor combustion efficiency at atmospheric pressure, of the seed oils compared with diesel fuel. Combustion of sprays at elevated pressure, in a steady-flow combustor, of fuels, blends and emulsions showed improved combustion under these conditions though still poorer for vegetable oil than for diesel fuel. Soot formation levels were also higher, though these were reduced by emulsification with water. Under the more extreme conditions of the environment in a diesel engine combustion chamber, the performance of a commercially available biofuel matched more closely that of diesel fuel. In single-cylinder engine tests at relatively low power and speed, the ignition delay was longer for the biofuel. The difference became less at higher loads and speeds and also in a production line multi-cylinder engine under normal operating conditions. Soot levels were generally higher than for diesel fuel and oxides of nitrogen lower. Unlike most operating modifications which result in a trade-off between these species, emulsification of the biofuel with water reduced levels of both soot and oxides of nitrogen. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Used sunflower oil was blended with grade No. 2-D diesel fuel at a ratio of 20 / 80 (v / v). The fuel blend was tested in a diesel engine with a precombustion chamber at speeds between 1200 and 2100 rpm. The fuel blend and the diesel fuel were rated according to standard test methods. It was found that for short-term use the fuel blend has characteristics similar to those of the baseline diesel fuel and that it displayed less smoke emission than the diesel fuel.

AB  - Biomass fuels currently (1994) supply around 14% of the world's energy, but most of this is in the form of traditional fuelwood, residues and dung, which is often inefficient and can be environmentally detrimental. Biomass can supply heat and electricity, liquid and gaseous fuels. A number of developed countries derive a significant amount of their primary energy from biomass: USA 4%, Finland 18%, Sweden 16% and Austria 13%. Presently biomass energy supplies at least 2 EJ year-1 in Western Europe which is about 4% of primary energy (54 EJ). Estimates show a likely potential in Europe in 2050 of 9.0-13.5 EJ depending on land areas (10% of useable land, 33 Mha), yields (10-15 oven-dry tonnes (ODt) ha-1), and recoverable residues (25% of harvestable). This biomass contribution represents 17-30% of projected total energy requirements up to 2050. The relative contribution of biofuels in the future will depend on markets and incentives, on continuous research and development progress, and on environmental requirements. Land constraints are not considered significant because of the predicted surpluses in land and food, and the near balance in wood and wood products in Europe. There is considerable potential for the modernisation of biomass fuels to produce convenient energy carriers such as electricity, gases and transportation fuels, whilst continuing to provide for traditional uses of biomass; this modernisation of biomass and the industrial investment is already happening in many countries. When produced in an efficient and sustainable manner, biomass energy has numerous environmental and social benefits compared with fossil fuels. These include improved land management, job creation, use of surplus agricultural land in industrialised countries, provision of modern energy carriers to rural communities of developing countries, a reduction of CO2 levels, waste control, and nutrient recycling. Greater environmental and net energy benefits can be derived from perennial and woody energy cropping than from annual arable crops which are short-term alternative feedstocks for fuels. Agroforestry systems can play an important role in providing multiple benefits to growers and the community, besides energy. In order to ameliorate CO2 emissions, using biomass as a substitute for fossil fuels (complete replacement, co-firing, etc.) is more beneficial from social and economic perspectives than sequestering the carbon in forests. Case studies are presented for several developed countries and the constraints involved in modernising biomass energy along with the potential for turning them into entrepreneurial opportunities are discussed. It is concluded that the long term impacts of biomass programmes and projects depend mainly on ensuring income generation, environmental sustainability, flexibility and replicability, while taking account of local conditions and providing multiple benefits, which is an important attribute of agroforestry-type systems. Biomass for energy must be environmentally acceptable in order to ensure its widespread adoption as a modem energy source. Implementation of biomass projects requires governmental policy initiatives that will internalise the external economic, social and environmental costs of conventional fuel sources so that biomass fuels can become competitive on a 'level playing field'.

AB  - The environmental impact of bioenergy carriers can be determined with the help of life cycle analysis. The present study shows that bioenergy carriers offer some clear ecological advantages over fossil fuels, such as conserving fossil energy resources or reducing the greenhouse effect, but they also have some definite disadvantages in particular regarding certain airborne pollutants-when the overall life cycle is considered. The paper first discusses the methodological approach for conducting a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) for biofuels; this approach is then used for a case study of Rape Methyl Ester (RME) compared with diesel fuel. The same approach is then applied for some bioenergy routes discussed currently in Germany. For the different bioenergy routes the results of the LCA for Energy. CO2 equivalents, N2O emissions, SO2 equivalents, SO2 emissions and NO, emissions are given and discussed.

AB  - Biomass is an often abundant, renewable, low ash and low sulfur fuel. Due to these properties, biofuels are promising alternatives for traditional petroleum-based fuel applications; however, traditional biofuels for internal combustion engines are not cost competitive with gasoline, diesel or fuel oils. One method to reduce the cost of biofuels is to use slurry fuels which have a potential lower cost than liquid biofuels due to high conversion efficiencies. Slurry biofuels, such as a mixture of corn and water, could provide a biofuel alternative for diesel engines, pressurized gasifiers and heating oil applications such as burners or gas turbines. Use of these biomass slurries poses important questions about their stability and suitability for practical applications in internal combustion engines and combustors. This work reports rheology data for stable corn-starch water slurries (CSWS) which used a polyacrylic acid thickener to eliminate settling of the slurry and to provide desirable shear-thinning behavior for most of the compositions evaluated. The effect of shear rate on the viscosity of the CSWS was studied using a BOHLIN-controlled stress (CS) rheometer. The well-known Ostwald-de Waele power law and Sisko models for viscosity fit the data. The effect of corn starch content, thickener content and temperature on the viscosity of CSWS was also studied. The favorable shear thinning properties were observed for starch contents up to 45% starch and should aid pumping, injection and spraying. The lower heating values of the slurries, however, are undesirably low. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Rapeseed oil methyl esters are important alternative diesel fuels based on renewable sources. A discontinuous plant production of methyl esters (ME) is described using two-stage low-temperature transesterification of cold-pressed rapeseed oil with methanol at temperatures up to 70°C. The total methanol:acyls molar ratio is 4:3, with an optimum distribution of methanol between the two stages. Four percent NaOH in methanol is used as the catalyst The final treatment of ME with phosphoric acid and ammonia provides for an exchange of ashy soap forms in ME for ashless forms, thus rendering ME non-corrosive.

AB  - The use of biofuels can only be supported, if their effects on environment and human health are well known. So the exhaust gases of seven different Diesel engines fueled with rape seed oil or RME were analyzed and compared to those from Diesel fuel (DF). As motor test procedure the 5-mode cycle was chosen, which simulates the typical load of agricultural tractors. Besides the determination of the regulated and nonregulated exhaust gas compounds, some engines were examined with regard to the cytotoxic and mutagenic potentials of their particulates as well. The result of all investigations shows that RME has definite advantages when it is used in rural areas.

AB  - In the long term, depletion of easily recoverable petroleum resources will make presently uneconomic automotive energy sources competitive. Natural gas, which can be used directly or converted to methanol, is projected to outlast petroleum. The even greater energy storehouse of solid feedstocks like coal can be transformed into liquid automotive fuel. Depletion of fossil fuels is not foreseen before the latter half of the 21st century. Potentially significant non-fossil replacements include both biofuels, and nuclear and solar electricity. Electricity can either power battery-electric vehicles or be used to produce electrolytic hydrogen for combustion engines or fuel cells. The pros and cons of these options are discussed. Combustion engines, which are being improved continually, remain technically viable into the foreseeable future. Battery-electric vehicles, which are being developed aggressively because of their freedom from local emissions, are not necessarily pollution-free on regional and global scales. Some of their current shortcomings can be overcome by electric/combustion-engine hybrids. Fuel cells for general-purpose automotive use are still quite immature and await further development to establish their role in the spectrum of automotive power. The timing for these many options to impact the automotive field depends on evolving technology and economics, and may be further influenced by government policy.

AB  - The Agricultural Engineering Department at the University of Missouri-Columbia has fueled a 1991 and a 1992 Dodge pickup 5.9 L (360 in. 3) Cummins engine with methyl-ester soybean oil (soydiesel) for more than 80 467 km (50,000 mile). The 1991 pickup has been driven approximately 48 280 km (30,000 mile) and the 1992 pickup has been driven approximately 32 187 km (20,000 mile). Fueling the engines with 100% soydiesel increased engine power by 3% (1991 engine) and reduced power by 7% (1992 engine). The pickups averaged more than 6.9 km/L (16.7 mile/gal). Analysis of engine lubrication oil suggested that the engines were wearing at a normal rate. The black exhaust smoke, normally observed when a diesel engine accelerates was reduced by 86% when the diesel engine was fueled with 100% soydiesel. Increased EPA exhaust emissions requirements for diesel engines have created much interest in the use of soydiesel as a fuel for diesel engines. © 1995 American Society of Agricultural Engineers.

AB  - Results are presented of tests on a single-cylinder direct-injection diesel engine operating on diesel fuel and also a commercial seed-based oil in emulsions containing 5, 10 and 15% vol water. The tests covered a range of loads at two speeds. Values are given for ignition delay, specific fuel consumption, thermal efficiency and equivalence ratio, and the concentrations of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and smoke particulates in the exhaust gases. At the lower speed, ignition delay was longer for the vegetable oil and its emulsions. At the higher speed the neat fuels had similar ignition delays, but for the emulsions the delays were longer. Carbon dioxide emissions were similar for all fuels (although vegetable oil, a renewable energy source, may be a lower net contributor to atmospheric levels). Emissions of oxides of nitrogen were lower and smoke levels were higher for vegetable oil. Emissions of both were lower for the emulsified fuels.

AB  - Abstract: This paper presents challenging opportunities for production of liquid and gaseous fuels by biotechnology. From the liquid fuels, ethyl alcohol production has been widely researched and implemented. The major obstacle for large scale production of ethanol for fuel is the cost, whereby the substrate represents one of the major cost components. Various scenarios will be presented for a critical assessment of cost distribution for production of ethanol from various substrates by conventional and high rate processes. The paper also focuses on recent advances in the research and application of biotechnological processes and methods for the production of liquid transportation fuels other than ethanol (other oxygenates; diesel fuel extenders and substitutes), as well as gaseous fuels (biogas, methane, reformed syngas). Potential uses of these biofuels are described, along with environmental concerns which accompany them. Emphasis is also put on microalgal lipids as diesel substitute and biogas/methane as a renewable alternative to natural gas. The capturing and use of landfill gases is also mentioned, as well as microbial coal liquefaction. Described is also the construction and performance of microbial fuel cells for the direct high‐efficiency conversion of chemical fuel energy to electricity. Bacterial carbon dioxide recovery is briefly dealt with as an environmental issue associated with the use of fossil energy. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The biodiesel that is considered as a possible substitute or extender of conventional automotive diesel fuel is commonly composed of fatty acid methyl esters that are prepared from the glycerides in vegetable oils by transesterification with methanol. This form of biodiesel is compatible with diesel fuel but offers no improvement in its ignition quality. This work describes the results of a series of experiments aimed at assessing other common fatty acid derivatives that could provide the desired biofuel component and, at the same time, improve the performance of the fuel. It was found that tertiary fatty amines and amides are significantly more effective than methyl esters in enhancing the ignition quality of the finished diesel fuel without having any negative effect on its cold flow properties. © 1995, American Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - Energy ratios were calculated for production of the rapeseed-oil-based diesel substitute rape methyl ester (RME) from winter oilseed rape. The energy ratio of a biofuel can be defined as the ratio of the non-renewable energy used in its production to the energy value of the fuel and any utilised by-products, i.e. energy input:energy output. For each energy input and output, a range of energy values was calculated to account for different soil and weather conditions and variation in yield. In addition, the range of energy inputs calculated accounted for variation in published estimates of the amount of energy required for various processes. The range of inputs and outputs included values calculated for worst-case (i.e. lowest seed yield, highest pesticide applications, etc.) and best-case scenarios, and two intermediate values, which represented inputs and outputs expected under typical conditions in Scotland. From this data, energy ratios were calculated for rape methyl ester production under best-case, worst-case and intermediate scenarios, with and without the inclusion of by-products. The results indicated that RME production is sustainable under all but the worst conditions. Utilisation of rapemeal greatly improved the energy ratio, but there remained a net loss in energy under the worst-case scenario. Glycerol utilisation had relatively little effect on the energy ratio, while the use of straw resulted in a net energy gain from the production of RME under all scenarios. © 1995.

AB  - A number of transportation fuels can be produced from renewable resources. The major fractions of lignocellulosic biomass, cellulose and hemicellulose, can be broken down into sugars that can be fermented into ethanol. Biomass can also be gasified to a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen for catalytic conversion into methanol. Algae could consume carbon dioxide from power plants and other sources to produce lipid oil that can be converted into a diesel fuel substitute. Through anaerobic digestion, a consortium of bacteria can break down lignocellulosic biomass to generate a medium-energy-content gas that can be cleaned up for pipeline-quality methane. Catalytic processing of pyrolytic oils from biomass produces a mixture of olefins that can be reacted with alcohols to form ethers, such as methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), for use in reformulated gasoline to reduce emissions. Each of these technologies is briefly described. The costs have been reduced significantly for biofuels, and the potential exists for them to be competitive with conventional fuels. An analysis of energy flows is presented for ethanol production as an example of these technologies, and a carbon dioxide balance is provided for the fossil fuels used. This analysis includes consideration of fuel utilization performance and assignment of carbon dioxide to coproducts. Biofuels technologies are shown to require little, if any, fossil fuel inputs. As a result, most or all of the carbon is recycled through their use, reducing substantially the net release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. © 1994 Humana Press Inc.

AB  - The primary problems associated with the use of pure vegetable oils as fuels in compression ignition (Diesel) engines are caused by high fuel viscosity. Transesterification of the oil with short-chain alcohols (such as methanol or ethanol) to corresponding fatty esters is the most promising solution to the high-viscosity problem. In this work, the transesterification method was applied to crude safflower seed oil of Turkish origin using methanol. The variables affecting the monoester yield, such as: 1. Molar ratio of alcohol to vegetable oil; 2. Reaction temperature; and 3. Type and amount of alkali catalyst used were investigated. In the presence of 1.0 wt% KOH as the reaction catalyst, 97.7% ester yield was achieved within 18 min at a reaction temperature of 69 ± 1‡C using 1:7 vegetable oil-alcohol molar ratio. A significant improvement was observed in viscosity and other physical properties with the ester product compared to the parent vegetable oil. ASTM fuel properties of the methyl ester product were in accordance with those obtained for commercial Grade No.2-D diesel fuel. © 1994 Humana Press Inc.

AB  - A review is presented of the current state of the art with regard to the production and characteristics of gaseous and liquid biofuels. Energy balances are given for gaseous biofuels such as producer gas and biogas, and liquid fuels such as ethanol and plant oils including their methylesters. In many cases, energy crops have potential not only for energy production, but sometimes also offer useful by-products in the form of animal feedstuffs, fertilizers and industrial feed stocks. The net energy gain depends on the extent to which all these products can be used, but is often positive for energy use alone. There may also be social and environmental benefits to be derived from the use of biofuels. © 1994 Silsoe Research Institute.

AB  - Biodiesel is a comparative latecomer to the alternative fuels scene. These are esters derived from oils and fats from renewable biological sources. Essentially this means certain oils, to date primarily modified vegetable oils, made from a process called transesterification. Transesterification involves mixing an alcohol with a catalyst, mixing that with vegetable oil and letting the glycerin settle out. The soaps made during processing are washed out with water leaving a methyl ester and glycerin as the resulting products.

AB  - Bioenergy will be the most significant renewable energy source in the next few decades until solar- or wind-power production offers an economically attractive large-scale alternative. Structural changes are required in power production in the near future owing to concern for global warming. Separate power production from fossil fuels should be replaced as extensively as possible by a new highly efficient power-generation structure. In Scandinavia, as well as to some extent elsewhere in Europe, combined heat and power production (CHP) is widely used and is an efficient way to reduce CO2 emissions. In CHP, the additional power capacity can be produced by using IGCC and diesel techniques, and a potentially double amount of electricity is obtained with a constant heat load. The Finnish JALO research programme focuses on these techniques in a wide spectrum of the thermochemical conversion programme. Basic and applied research as well as pilot activities has been carried out in research organizations and in industry in Finland. A sum of about ECU 9 million has been invested in the programme over the past five years. The first pilot and demonstration plants with solid-biomass IGCC technology will be put into operation by private enterprises in 1993. If the price of biofuels is competitive, these new technologies will probably be commercialized by the end of the 1990s. International co-operation within ECE JOULE and IEA has played an important role in the JALO programme. © 1993.

AB  - Biomass encompasses agricultural and forestry residues, woody and her baceous energy crops, municipal solid waste, and underutilized traditional forests. The contribution of biomass to the nation's energy supply stands at 3.1 quads per year and is continuing to grow. Increasing our use of fuels derived from biomass can improve air quality, mitigate global warming, reduce dependency on foreign oil imports, and strengthen a weak farm economy. The U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Biofuels and Municipal Wfaste Technology Program has focused mainly on liquid fuels such as ethanol, methanol, biocrude-derived gasoline, and plant-oil-derived dieselfuel, with some emphasis on gaseous fuels such as biogas. Researchers have improved the economics of the wood to ethanol process to approximately $1.35/ gal by developing a method to ferment ethanol from the xylose fraction of wood with greater than 70% efficiency. The program goal of $0.60/gal would provide ethanol at a competitive cost without tax credits. DOE has increased the emphasis on cooperative ventures with industry and is developing plans for a cost-shared project to scale up gasification technologies for both syngas and methanol fuel production testing. Development of successful methods for cleaning and conditioning the raw syngas from the gasifier is expected to reduce methanol costs from $0.75/gal to $0.55/gal. Scientists have made substantial progress in testing process concepts for hydrotreat-ing and zeolite catalyst upgrading of pyrolysis oils to produce gasoline. The cost of gasoline from biomass by this process is currently projected at $1.60/gal with a goal of $0.85/gal. With adequate research and development investments, biofuels can have a much greater impact on the liquid transportation fuels sector in the future, even without legislation or federal regulations to stimulate the industry. Therefore, biofuels costs are projected to be competitive with oil costs at $25-$30/bbl within the next 5-10 years; however, the development time frame depends on the research and development investment level. © 1991 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Cogeneration, where gasified wood, peat or municipal refuse provide the fuel for diesel generator sets, offers the promise of high thermal efficiencies and low generation costs. For this promise to be realized, a number of problems have to be solved, in particular, the production of tar-free gas, suitable for combustion in diesel engines, and control of emissions. This article describes the development of a pilot project (2MW), incorporating catalytic tar-cracking, which is intended to demonstrate the feasibility of diesel-based cogeneration with high overall thermal efficiencies and low emissions from an integrated system.

AB  - This paper evaluates emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O, and other greenhouse gases from the use of gasoline and diesel fuel, electricity, methanol, natural gas, and hydrogen in highway vehicles. Emissions from initial resource extraction to end use are estimated. It is found that the use of coal to make any highway fuel would substantially accelerate greenhouse warming relative to the base-case use of petroleum. The use of natural gas as a feedstock would result in a small reduction. Significant reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases can be achieved only by greatly increasing vehicle efficiency or by using biofuels, electrolytic hydrogen, or nonfossil-fuel-based electricity as the fuel feedstock. Emissions of gases other than CO2 are likely to contribute appreciably to the warming, but better data are needed.

AB  - The gradual and then rapid reduction of crude oil prices, the impact of U.S. Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation (to reduce budget deficits) on R&D (research and development) budgets, the partial elimination of renewable-energy tax credits, and the possible elimination of all energy tax credits and forgiveness via tax reform, are all taking their toll on energy research and commercialization ventures. However, it appears that "biofuels" will survive and continue to exhibit modest increases in contributions to primary energy demand. A comprehensive assessment of renewable-technology options has shown that biofuels is the only option capable of making significant contributions to all energy sectors. The total contribution of renewable energy to primary energy demand in the U.S.A. is about 7.2EJ/y (6.8 quad/y); biofuels provide about 40% of the total. Research on short-rotation intensive-culture (SRIC) trees and herbaceous and aquatic biomass has identified specific species for development. Some of these species appear to be near economic feasibility as energy crops now. Commercialization of biomass and waste combustion systems has shown a spurt in growth because of the business opportunities offered by laws encouraging cogeneration. Thermochemical gasification research on advanced technology systems has reached the point where scale-up is being considered. Commercialization of state-ofthe-art technologies has slowed, but applications for small-scale producer gasifiers, particularly in developing countries, continue to expand. Thermochemical liquefaction research has concentrated mainly on high-temperature pyrolytic conversion methods that can increase yields and selectivities. Significant research achievements have been made in anaerobic digestion, but whatever its future as a large-scale source of methane, it is clear that digestion capacity will have to increase many-fold before biological methane can attain its potential. The mandated reduction in lead content of gasolines presents substantial marketing opportunities to alcohol-fuel producers. If projections for ethanol-fuel markets materialize, conversion of low-cost lignocellulosic materials will be necessary. Research to develop this technology is now in progress. © 1987.

AB  - Biofuel production systems will have to be competitive with existing agricultural enterprises if they are to be adopted on farms. Mixed-integer linear programming models were constructed from farm management data, therefore, to examine the viability of biofuel production systems on four typical U.K. farm types. Real increases in energy prices would seem likely to improve the competitive position of biofuel production systems. The impact of such increases was studied by parametric programming using estimates of the energy intensity of agricultural inputs to determine relative price changes with increasing energy prices. Of the biofuel production systems considered, direct combustion of cereal straw in the arable farm model, anaerobic digestion of pig wastes in the pig farm model, and energy forestry in the upland farm model entered the optimal solution under the conditions studied. The management of woodland (where it was available on the farm) for fuel wood production also appeared to be a viable enterprise. © 1986.

AB  - A total energy census has been obtained for the isolated island of Eigg (56 °53′N, 6 °9′W), with 27 permanently occupied houses and a resident population of 64. Detailed energy audits for every property and energy-consuming activity have been summed to find total island use. Accuracy is checked by 1. (a) obtaining other independent sums for the island supply and intermediate transactions, and 2. (b) obtaining a redundancy of information from studying both supply and enduse. Domestic and economic activities on the island require an average per capita power supply of 2.2 kW (19,000 kWh/yr). The 12 types of primary supply (including biofuels, hydro and wind supplies), 10 end-uses (including local transport and agriculture), household diesel electricity generation (average efficiency 17%), and all intermediate transformations have been studied. © 1985.

AB  - This chapter discusses the impact of biofuels on three regions: the United Kingdom, the European Economic Community (EEC), and the world in general. Different technologies for energy conversion are reviewed and the products and efficiencies are assessed with emphasis on integration. Crop and animal residues, forestry thinnings and residues, industrial and domestic wastes, widespread areas of natural vegetation, and catch crops (fast-growing and autumn-germinating species used on agricultural land after the harvest of a main crop) are all examples of “opportunity energy crops.” These are biomass sources, which can be collected without significant disruption to conventional patterns of agriculture and forestry. “Dedicated energy crops,” on the other hand, involve plantations of productive species whose purpose is to provide a biofuel feedstock. A wide range of useful fuels and chemicals can be produced through the biological processes of anaerobic digestion and fermentation or physical processes involving partial combustion, at a variety of temperatures and pressures. © 1984, Academic Press.

AB  - In many parts of the world, alternative energy sources are already needed or will be needed to augment fossil fuel supplies. 'Biogas', methanol, ethanol and hydrogen are all potentially useful in this respect, as they can be obtained (biologically or thermochemically) from renewable resources like biomass (trees, crops, etc.) and organic wastes (sewage, domestic refuse, animal manure). Some aspects of biofuel research and development in Member States of the European Community are highlighted, and estimates of the contributions that these fuels might make to current and future energy demands are reviewed. Some of the potential uses of biogases and liquid biofuels in a gas industry context are described. In the author's opinion, production of biogases and other biofuels will ultimately play a significant but relatively small rôle in conserving supplies of natural gas and other fossil fuels, and in alleviating or preventing environmental pollution. © 1983.
