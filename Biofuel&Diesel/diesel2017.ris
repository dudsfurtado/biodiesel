AB  - Reducing meat consumption by humans and shifting to more efficient plant and animal protein sources could potentially free up large areas of pasture and feedcrop agricultural land for restoration or conversion to low-input high-diversity (LIHD) grasslands. LIHD grasslands improve biodiversity, carbon sequestration, erosion control, water storage, while also providing opportunities to produce biofuels. We examined the potential of converting pastures globally, and animal feedstock agricultural lands in the USA and Brazil, to LIHD biomass sources and the capacity of these systems to meet national energy demands via (1) cellulosic ethanol and (2) integrated gasification and combined cycle technology with Fischer-Tropsch hydrocarbon synthesis (IGCC-FT) processing. Our analyses, which we argue are conservative, indicate that large amounts of energy, far in excess of many country's current demands, can potentially be produced from IGCC-FT processing of grassland biomass grown on converted pastures, especially in tropical developing countries. Over 40 countries could meet ≥ 100% of their domestic demands for electricity, gasoline, and diesel. If energy products were shared between countries, the 95 countries with positive energy production yields could meet 46%, 28%, and 39% of their combined electricity, gasoline, and diesel demands, respectively. While it is clearly unrealistic to propose a 100% conversion of pasture lands to biofuel production, these analyses highlight the potential gains in ecosystem services and energy production that could theoretically be achieved on already-managed lands. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this proposed action, the EPA is providing an opportunity to comment on an analysis of the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with certain biofuels that are produced from grain sorghum oil extracted at dry mill ethanol plants at any point downstream from sorghum grinding, also known as distiller sorghum oil. EPA seeks comment on its proposed assessment that using distillers sorghum oil as feedstock results in no significant agricultural sector GHG emissions and that biodiesel and heating oil produced from distillers sorghum oil via a transesterification process, and renewable diesel, jet fuel, heating oil, naphtha, and LPG produced from distillers sorghum oil via a hydrotreating process, would meet the lifecycle GHG emissions reduction threshold of 50% required for advanced biofuels, and biomass-based diesel under the Renewable Fuel Standard program. Based on these analyses, EPA is proposing to amend the RFS program regulations to define the term "distillers sorghum oil". It is also being proposed to add to the regulations approved pathways from the production of biodiesel and heating oil from distillers sorghum oil via a transesterification process, and renewable diesel, jet fuel, heating oil, naphtha, and LPG produced from distillers sorghum oil via a hydrotreating process. Comments must be received on or before 1/26/2018.

AB  - Using a continuous flow reactor, bio-oil prepared by the pyrolysis of sawdust was upgraded to produce petroleum-like deoxygenated hydrocarbon fuels. Dispersed tiny bio-char particles in the raw bio-oil were removed by extraction using diethyl ether to suppress solid-particle-nucleated coking. Noble metal catalysts, instead of molybdenum-based catalysts, were selected to avoid the continuous addition of sulfur compounds. Among the catalysts, tungstate-zirconia-supported Ru catalysts (Ru/WZr) exhibited high hydrodeoxygenation activity and less formation of cokes, which characteristics are important in the development of feasible upgrading processes. The investigation of catalysts used in this study demonstrates that the larger quantity of Brønsted acid sites compared to Lewis acid sites suppresses the formation of cokes. © 2017

AB  - Background: Microalgal strain development through genetic engineering has received much attention as a way to improve the traits of microalgae suitable for biofuel production. However, there are still some limitations in application of genetically modified organisms. In this regard, there has been recent interest in the isolation and characterization of superior strains naturally modified and/or adapted under a certain condition and on the interpretation of phenotypic changes through the whole genome sequencing. Results: In this study, we isolated and characterized a novel derivative of C. reinhardtii, whose phenotypic traits diverged significantly from its ancestral strain, C. reinhardtii CC-124. This strain, designated as CC-124H, displayed cell population containing increased numbers of larger cells, which resulted in an increased biomass productivity compared to its ancestor CC-124. CC-124H was further compared with the CC-124 wild-type strain which underwent long-term storage under low light condition, designated as CC-124L. In an effort to evaluate the potential of CC-124H for biofuel production, we also found that CC-124H accumulated 116 and 66% greater lipids than that of the CC-124L, after 4 days under nitrogen and sulfur depleted conditions, respectively. Taken together, our results revealed that CC-124H had significantly increased fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yields that were 2.66 and 1.98 times higher than that of the CC-124L at 4 days after the onset of cultivation under N and S depleted conditions, respectively, and these higher FAME yields were still maintained by day 8. We next analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletions (indels) based on the whole genome sequencing. The result revealed that of the 44 CDS region alterations, 34 resulted in non-synonymous substitutions within 33 genes which may mostly be involved in cell cycle, division or proliferation. Conclusion: Our phenotypic analysis, which emphasized lipid productivity, clearly revealed that CC-124H had a dramatically enhanced biomass and lipid content compared to the CC-124L. Moreover, SNPs and indels analysis enabled us to identify 34 of non-synonymous substitutions which may result in phenotypic changes of CC-124H. All of these results suggest that the concept of adaptive evolution combined with genome wide analysis can be applied to microalgal strain development for biofuel production. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Blending petroleum fuels with biofuels is likely to become increasingly important over the years to come. Butyl butyrate has promising characteristics as a blend component in diesel and can be synthesized by lipase-catalyzed esterification of 1-butanol and butyric acid, which both can be derived from fermentation technologies. In the current study, the enzyme load and reaction temperature were optimized for the production of butyl butyrate with Novozyme 435 (immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B) directly in diesel at a substrate concentration of 1 m using a molar ratio of 1:1 between n-butanol and butyric acid. Optimum conditions were found by using a central composite design at an enzyme load of 12 % of substrate weight and a temperature of 57 °C, giving 90 % yield conversion in 30 min, corresponding to a butyl butyrate productivity of 1.8 mol L−1 h−1. Diesel blended with 5, 10, and 30 % butyl butyrate was tested in a heavy-duty diesel engine under two load cases. The ignition properties of the blended fuels were very similar to pure diesel, making butyl butyrate an interesting diesel substitute. The emission analysis demonstrated lower soot and CO emissions, similar hydrocarbons levels and slightly increased NOx levels compared with using pure diesel. The high activity of lipase in diesel and the compatibility between diesel and butyl butyrate opens up the possibility to develop fuel blending systems where the synthesis of the blend-in component occurs directly in the fuel. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Isocyanic acid (HNCO) is a known toxic species and yet the relative importance of primary and secondary sources to regional HNCO and population exposure remains unclear. Off-road diesel fuel combustion has previously been suggested to be an important regional source of HNCO, which implies that major industrial facilities such as the oil sands (OS), which consume large quantities of diesel fuel, can be sources of HNCO. The OS emissions of nontraditional toxic species such as HNCO have not been assessed. Here, airborne measurements of HNCO were used to estimate primary and secondary HNCO for the oil sands. Approximately 6.2 ± 1.1 kg hr-1 was emitted from off-road diesel activities within oil sands facilities, and an additional 116-186 kg hr-1 formed from the photochemical oxidation of diesel exhaust. Together, the primary and secondary HNCO from OS operations represent a significant anthropogenic HNCO source in Canada. The secondary HNCO downwind of the OS was enhanced by up to a factor of 20 relative to its primary emission, an enhancement factor significantly greater than previously estimated from laboratory studies. Incorporating HNCO emissions and formation into a regional model demonstrated that the HNCO levels in Fort McMurray (∼10-70 km downwind of the OS) are controlled by OS emissions; &gt; 50% of the monthly mean HNCO arose from the OS. While the mean HNCO levels in Fort McMurray are predicted to be below the 1000 pptv level associated with potential negative health impacts, (∼25 pptv in August-September), an order of magnitude increase in concentration is predicted (250-600 pptv) when the town is directly impacted by OS plumes. The results here highlight the importance of obtaining at-source HNCO emission factors and advancing the understanding of secondary HNCO formation mechanisms, to assess and improve HNCO population exposure predictions. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, the effect of gasoline fumigation on the energy and exergy balance of a DI diesel engine fueled with waste cooking oil biodiesel and diesel blend (B20) is experimentally investigated and theoretically studied. To have a comprehensive analysis, diesel and B20 were considered as two baseline fuels and gasoline fumigation was induced at two different ratios. The obtained results reveal that gasoline fumigation increases the energy and exergy efficiency at medium and high loads to about 5% for diesel baseline fuel, while the energy and exergy efficiency decreases slightly in case of B20 fuel with gasoline fumigation. For all operating points, the percentage of energy and exergy transfer through the exhaust gases decreases by an average of 2.6% and 6.4%, respectively in case of using gasoline fumigation for both diesel and B20 fuels. Moreover, the destructed exergy of the engine operating on B20 and the fumigated gasoline was higher than that of diesel and B20 by about 2.4% on the average. It could be concluded that the combination of B20 and gasoline fumigation might be used as a substitute for diesel fuel in diesel engines under high loads, with higher exergy efficiency and lower exhaust exergy losses. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel from non-edible vegetable oil is considered as a monetarily doable source among the conceivable sources. It can be used as a replacement of the fossil diesel without any modification of engine design. In this study, “Millettia pinnata" (MP) which is known as Karanja and “Croton megalocarpus” (CM), non-edible biodiesel feedstock sources used for biodiesel production. 20% (v/v) of each M. pinnata (MP20) and C. megalocarpus (CM20) and their combined blends were evaluated in a single-cylinder diesel engine with variable load and speed condition in the context of performance, combustion and emission characteristics. For speed test condition, MP20 and CM20 reduced the brake power by 3.70% and 0.53%, brake thermal efficiency by 3.36% and 1.41%, carbon dioxide emission by 18.46% and 6.20%, hydrocarbon emission by 9.00% and 2.89% respectively compared to neat diesel but increased the brake specific fuel consumption by 7.63% and 4.64%, NOX emission by 17.15% and 8.16%, respectively. Beyond diesel, a mixture of 5% MP and 15% CM biodiesel with 80% diesel (MP5CM15) provides higher in-cylinder peak pressure (77.44 bar), better heat release rate (39.26 J/°CA), shorter ignition delay and combustion duration. Thus MP5CM15 found to be a substitutable alternative to neat diesel except for NOX emission. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study investigated the production procedure and combustion characteristics of a bio-oil produced through the slow pyrolysis of pinewood. The combustion properties of droplets with different butanol/bio-oil proportions were thus determined and compared. The droplets containing bio-oil varied irregularly in size during combustion and left considerable residue that was also combusted. The duration of combustion was revealed to increase when the bio-oil concentration was increased. The TGA indicated a two-stage weight loss during combustion. The first stage occurred at 30-160 °C, corresponding to the endothermic evaporation of the light fraction of the compounds after heating. The second stage occurred at 450-650 °C, indicating pyrolytic exothermic residue combustion fed by the macromolecular residue of the interactions between bio-oil constituents. The activation energy was demonstrated to gradually decrease during the evaporation stage and also during the residue combustion stage. The aromatics in the bio-oil polymerized under the intense heat, leading to the formation of residue and soot. The burning rate of the droplet decreased when the bio-oil concentration was increased, whereas the residue burning rate increased with an increase in bio-oil concentration. The volatiles released during residue combustion enhanced the burning rate of residue. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel policies in the U.S. and Brazil can influence two-way ethanol trade, in which the countries export to and import from each other simultaneously. A multi-market, multi-region partial equilibrium economic model is used to assess the interactions of the biofuel policies and markets of these two countries. The market effects are converted to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission effects using calculations that include the emissions associated with the transportation of ethanol between Brazil and the U.S. Results show that under certain conditions ethanol and feedstock producer prices decrease in a “No Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS)” scenario, while GHG emission could rise. If the RFS is maintained in the U.S., but Brazilian gasoline prices are allowed to move freely with rising global crude oil prices, then ethanol and feedstock prices increase and GHG emissions decrease as the use of ethanol increases. We find that two-way ethanol trade can have important, if moderate, GHG emission impacts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The objective of this article is to design and plan sustainable bio-ethanol supply chain. Modeling supply chains that achieve economic, social and environmental feasibility through production, process and energy efficiency is a challenge. Life cycle assessment that is coupled with techno-economic optimization of bio-ethanol supply chain is an alternative solution to achieve sustainability. A simulation of the biomass conversion is used to find process parameters of the conversion technology. The results show that the unified model is capable of minimizing both CO2 emissions and energy and utility consumptions. In addition, the supply chain is capable of contributing to local economy through jobs creation. While the model is quite comprehensive, the future research recommendation on energy integration and global sustainability is proposed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - High energy demand along with large capital costs have been the main drawbacks of Fischer-Tropsch plants, which may call into question the economic viability of the Fischer-Tropsch process. The second issue is the focus of this paper, which presents a techno-economic assessment of biofuels production by a low-temperature Fischer-Tropsch synthesis with electricity as a co-product from supercritical water reforming of the bio-oil aqueous phase. A plant size of 60 t/h was considered and a heat-integrated process was designed to be energy self-sufficient, which includes syngas production and upgrading, as well as liquid fuels production by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and refining. The simulation and optimization was performed with the aid of Aspen Plus, and some case-studies were performed. Using a feeding concentration of 25 wt%, 2.74 t/h biofuels and 5.72 MWe were obtained. In this case, by performing a discounted cash flow analysis, with 10% rate of return and 100% equity financing, the minimum selling prices for the refined FT-gasoline, FT-diesel and FT-jet fuel were 1.20, 0.93 and 0.26 €/kg (0.84, 0.75 and 0.20 €/L), respectively, which are competitive prices with respect to the market values of the equivalent fossil fuels. Likewise, the decrease in the selling prices as the plant capacity increases was also analyzed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable and substitute fuel to diesel engines. The main limit for adoption of biodiesel on industrial scale as an alternative fuel is the high cost of its synthesis process using raw methanol during transesterification reaction. Using bio-refinery approach and inexpensive high-quality oil feedstock is an effective means to produce low-cost biodiesel. In this study Saussurea heteromalla a novel non-edible seed with high oil contents (30 wt%) was subjected first time to integrated synthesis of biodiesel and ethanol. Transesterification and simultaneous saccharification along with fermentation process was applied to produce biodiesel and ethanol respectively. Alkaline pretreatment with sodium hydroxide (8% w/v) at 100 °C was used to enhance ethanol yield from 30% to 80%. A highest biodiesel yield of 99% was achieved via optimized parameters of 6:1 alcohol to oil ratio with 0.26 wt% catalyst in 55 min time at 65 °C temperature using Response Surface Methodology. It was observed that 112.2 ± 1.6 g of biodiesel and 42.0 ± 0.5 g of ethanol were produced using 1 kg of Saussurea heteromalla seed oil. In addition, the fuel properties of prepared biodiesel were in accordance to ASTM D 6751 and EN 14214 standards. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Combined heat and power systems (CHPs) have received much attention in recent years due to increasing use of bio-fuels and distributed generation (DG). Conventionally, they are connected to the power grid to balance electrical demands and supplies. This research investigated an off-grid (stand-alone) biofuel micro CHP system with hybrid energy storage (HES) (including battery banks and super-capacitors) by developing an energy management strategy based on dynamic programming (DP). DP is an optimization strategy which has been applied to energy systems in recent years. However, they suffer from dimension problems when the number of variables increases. This work is the first attempt to apply the decision tree (DT) to multi-dimension DP solutions in energy systems. The energy efficiency is improved from 45.77% to 57.97% using diesel-biofuels and the system has a potential for commercial applications. The experimental test results validate its feasibility and effectiveness. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel production process encourages use of heterogeneous catalyst over homogeneous catalysts. The major problems associated with the use of homogeneous catalysts are its non-renewable nature, separation and washing which can be overcome by the use of heterogeneous catalysts. Therefore, in this work use of Musa balbisiana Colla peels, a waste biomass material has been used for preparing eco-friendly and highly effective heterogeneous base catalyst for sustainable biodiesel production. The peels of Musa balbisiana Colla have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), powder X-ray diffractograms (XRD), Energy Dispersive Analysis of X-ray (EDAX), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. The conversion of the waste cooking oil into biodiesel was confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC–MS) techniques. The peels of Musa balbisiana Colla furnished 100% conversion of waste cooking oil into biodiesel. Low cost, renewable heterogeneous catalyst from banana (Musa balbisiana Colla) peels can be developed for fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) production providing a new route for sustainability of fuels. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Variability in growth and reproductive characteristics, seed traits, quality and oil content of six accessions of Jatropha curcas growing in Murcia (Spain) under greenhouse conditions were analysed. Differences were found among accessions in branch length, ratio female to male flowers (F/M), productions, seed weight, endosperm weight, percentage of endosperm and percentage of aborted seeds oil contents, fatty acids composition and quality indexes of the biodiesel. Two genotypes (8-8 and 6-3) have shown a good vigor plant, the best F/M ratio, and appropriate average productions. In addition, these accessions showed the highest average single seed weights, and the best average endosperm weights. The highest total seed oil percentages were observed in the accessions 4-5 (42.42 ± 0.26), 6-3 (41.51 ± 0.20), and 8-8 (40.41 ± 0.73), whereas percentages lower than 30% were recorded in the others. The percentage of endosperm oil ranged from 42.72 ± 0.98% to 65.71 ± 0.36%. In relation to the fatty acids composition, the highest monounsaturated fatty acids percentages with the highest concentration of oleic acid and the lowest concentration of linolenic acid were observed in three genotypes (4-5, 8-8 and 6-3). The biodiesel obtained from these accessions presented high cetane number and low iodine value, which indicates the good ignition quality and stability of the oil. The knowledge of plant growth parameters and oil quality of the studied genotypes could be useful to choose the appropriate ones to be grown under subtropical climatic conditions or to be used as parents in a breeding program. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Second generation biofuels offer the opportunity to mitigate emissions from the growing transportation sector while respecting the scarcity of arable land in agriculture. Biomass-to-liquid (BtL) concepts based on large-scale gasification are capable of using low-quality residual feedstock, such as wheat straw or forest residues, for the production of transportation fuels. However, large amounts of biomass feedstock are required to achieve the economic capacity of a synthesis plant. Depending on the steepness of the terrain and the role of feedstock owners, biomass potentials can only be utilized to a large extent at increasing costs per ton. Such diseconomies of scale are particularly problematic in the presence of already established value chains consuming the easily accessible and low-cost feedstock. As a result, second-generation biofuel supply chains face steep supply curves with sharply increasing unit costs. This article investigates the impact of established utilization paths on a large-scale biofuel production value chain. To do so, a mixed-integer linear model is presented which first determines the allocation of biomass resources to CHP plants and domestic consumers. Based on the resulting costs and supply curves, the model then determines the optimum configuration of the synfuel supply chain including locations and capacities of conversion plants, feedstock procurement and transportation. The model is applied to a case study covering six regions in south-central Chile. The total supply chain cost for the production of synthetic gasoline is estimated to amount to 0.8–0.9 € per liter. Feedstock costs of the synfuel supply chain are 20–50% higher in comparison to the price paid by CHP plants and households. The results indicate that both torrefaction and fast pyrolysis can be applied beneficially to utilize remote biomass resources which are less in demand by established consumers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The success and sustainable operation of a commercial cellulosic biorefinery are highly dependent on price, quality, and availability of feedstocks. Currently, corn stover is a primary feedstock choice for cellulosic ethanol production and the same feedstock can be used for butanol production, which is a potential alternative biofuel. However, butanol production requires different levels of feedstock and logistical resources when compared to ethanol due to about 20% lower theoretical yield. A thorough analysis of cost, life-cycle energy use and life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with a feedstock supply logistics system for butanol production is yet to be done. Additionally, quality standards for corn stover feedstock are yet to be determined, which could determine cost of the feedstock for commercial applications. Thus, this study aimed to fulfill these research gaps using techno-economic analysis and life-cycle assessment methodologies. Variability in logistical resources and other input parameters gathered from recent literature were used for analyses in this study. Average corn stover supply logistics cost ($/metric ton(t), dry), life-cycle energy use (MJ/t, dry) and life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions (kg CO2e/t, dry) were 86.9, 1073.7 and 83.8, which could increase at 95% certainty to 159–504, 1672–3817 and 138–271, respectively, depending on the types of probability distributions of the input parameters. However, the mode value of logistics cost ($/t, dry), life-cycle energy use (MJ/t, dry) and life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions (kg CO2e/t, dry) of 80–120, 913–1231 and 79–120, respectively, closely represents the results of the static model. The average estimated feedstock cost for butanol production was about 1.3 times and the minimum 95% certainty value is about 2 times more than the targeted feedstock cost ($/metric ton, dry) of 66.4, excluding preprocessing. Overall, the location of the biorefinery, quality of corn stover, sustainable agricultural practices, and optimum utilization of transportation resources were key factors that enable a sustainable feedstock supply logistics system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work demonstrates that cork used as oil-spill sorbents, contaminated with liquid hydrocarbons, herein demonstrated with hexadecane, can be biologically treated by Rhodococcus opacus B4 with concomitant lipids production. R. opacus B4 consumed up to 96% of hexadecane (C16) impregnated in natural and regranulated cork sorbents after 48 h incubation, producing 0.59 ± 0.06 g of triacylglycerol (TAG) g− 1 of C16 consumed with a TAG content of 0.60 ± 0.06 g g− 1 of cellular dry weight (CDW) and 0.54 ± 0.05 g TAG g− 1 of C16 consumed with a TAG content of 0.77 ± 0.04 g g− 1 (CDW), respectively. TAG was mainly composed by fatty acids of 16 and 18 carbon chains demonstrating the feasibility of using it as raw material for biodiesel production. In addition, the obtained lipid-rich biomass (whole cells) can be used for biomethane production, at a yield of 0.4 L CH4 g− 1 (CDW). The obtained results support a novel approach for management of oil-spill contaminated cork sorbents through its valorisation by producing bacterial lipids, which can be used as feedstocks for biofuels production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: As a major lignocellulosic biomass, which represented more than half of the world's agricultural phytomass, crop residues have been considered as feedstock for biofuel production. However, large-scale application of this conventional biofuel process has been facing obstacles from cost efficiency, pretreatment procedure, and secondary pollution. To meet the growing demands for food, feed, and energy as the global population continues to grow, certain kinds of insects, many of which are voracious feeders of organic wastes that may help address environmental, economic, and health issues, have been highlighted as a source of protein and fat. Results: The biorefinery studied includes initial corn stover degradation by yellow mealworm (Tenebrio molitor L.), followed by a second stage that employs black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens L.), to utilize the residues produced during the first stage. These two insect-based biorefinery yielded 8.50 g of insect biomass with a waste dry mass reduction rate of 51.32%, which resulted in 1.95 g crude grease from larval biomass that produced 1.76 g biodiesel, 6.55 g protein, and 111.59 g biofertilizer. The conversion rate of free fatty acids of crude grease into biodiesel reached 90%. The components of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin contained in corn stover hydrolyzed harmoniously, resulting in declines of 45.69, 51.85, and 58.35%, respectively. Moreover, fluctuations in lipid, protein, and reducing sugar were also analyzed. Conclusion: The investigation findings demonstrated that successive co-conversion of corn stover by insects possessing different feeding habits could be an attractive option for efficient utilization of lignocellulosic resources, and represents a potentially valuable solution to crop residues management, rise of global liquid energy, and animal feed demand.

AB  - Biofuels represent an alternative solution to petroleum-based fuels. In particular, biodiesel is very interesting, especially if it is produced from waste vegetable oil. Biodiesel can be used in diesel engines. The aim of this work is to implement a 2D numerical analysis in Comsol Multiphysics in order to verify an uniform temperature field within a non-isothermal batch mixed micro-reactor. An immersion heater system has been studied as a suitable solution to increase the temperature of WVO (Waste Vegetable Oil) before the start of the transesterification reaction. Thus, the efficiency of the immersion heating system has been investigated. The results show that the temperature field is not uniform within the fluid domain, because of the convective flux with the external environment. These conditions could lead to a low overall conversion rate. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - In the recent decades, the energy demand for transport and industrial sector has increased considerably. Fossil fuels which were the major fuel source for decades are no more sustainable. Biodiesel is an efficient alternative compared to depleting fossil fuels. The prospect of biodiesel as the best alternative fuel is a reliable source compared to depleting fossil fuels. Hydrogen is also considered as an attractive alternative fuel producing low emission with improved engine performance. This paper investigates the performance and emission characteristics of a single cylinder compression ignition engine using hydrogen as an inducted fuel and biodiesel, aka Pongamia pinnata as injected fuel. The experiments are conducted for different quantities of hydrogen induction through the intake manifold in order to improve the performance of the engine. The performance parameters such as brake thermal efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption, exhaust temperature and emission quantities like HC, NOX, CO, CO2 of biodiesel fueled CI engine with variable mass flow rate of hydrogen are investigated. The performances of biodiesel combined with hydrogen at varying mass flow rates are also compared. The 10 LPM hydrogen induction with biodiesel provided 0.33% increase of brake thermal efficiency compared with diesel and increase of 3.24% to biodiesel at 80% loading conditions. The emission of HC decreased by 13 ppm, CO decreased by 0.02% by volume and CO2 decreased by 3.8% by volume for biodiesel with induction of hydrogen at 10 LPM to that of neat biodiesel for 80% load conditions. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biofuel blends produced from Jatropha (Jatropha curcas) and Karanja (Pongamia pinnata) oil were evaluated for their combustion properties. Two kinds of blends (regular diesel with Jatropha and Karanja oil) were prepared at 20% volume to the diesel and tested as alternative fuels in single cylinder (vertical), water-cooled, direct injection diesel engine at the rated speed of 1500 rpm. The performance of the engine in terms of thermal efficiency at full load for diesel was 30%. For Jatropha and Karanja biodiesel blends, the thermal efficiencies were 29.0% and 28.6%, respectively. The maximum cylinder pressure and ignition delay for biodiesel fuel blends are very close to that of regular diesel. Prolonged combustion was observed for Karanja oil blend in comparison to Jatropha oil blend. The combustion pattern also reveals the slow burning characteristics of vegetable oils and this study indicates that the blended biofuels have combustion characteristics that are similar to regular diesel fuels. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Sapindus mukorossi is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical areas of southern China; the seed kernel oil is potential biodiesel material, and the saponins extracted from fruit pericarp are very valuable efficient natural surfactants. Therefore, S. mukorossi is an ideal tree species for developing forestry bioenergy and multiple other products. In this study, 42 S. mukorossi fruits from mother trees were collected from 39 distinct locations in 12 Chinese provinces to infer fruit and seed trait responses to environmental factors. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was conducted using 21 horticultural fruit traits and 10 environmental factors that represented different climatic and geographic conditions throughout southern China. CCA revealed well-developed patterns of natural phenotypic variation, and insight into the ecological factors that are potentially important in shaping this variation. The results presented here further elucidate the natural distribution and ecological adaptations of wild S. mukorossi resources, which will be valuable for S. mukorossi cultivation by helping identify ideal planting areas. The germplasm resources with extensive morphological variation can also contribute to S. mukorossi breeding in the future by helping develop new cultivars with high saponin yield. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Partial load operation of SI engines is conventionally achieved by the use of a throttle to control the airflow or air-fuel mixture into the engine. When the engine operates at partial load the throttle causes high pumping losses which has an effect on decrease of the engine efficiency. One of the possible ways to decrease the pumping losses during partial loads is to operate the engine under lean mixture condition. The limitation in this case can be misfiring of used fuel. The combustion limits can be extended by addition of hydrogen to the regular fuel. This work presents an analysis of use of hydrogen-methane taking into account aspects related to the efficiency and emission of pollutants. To carry out this study an experimental system composed of a SI engine was used. Two important differentials were used. First, the engine was supplied with simulated biofuels according to the typical biogas composition of the Brazilian landfills (Bio60); second, the system was operated in partial load, with the addition of H2, forming the HBio60 blend, in an attempt to increase efficiency and reduce pumping losses by increasing lambda value and variation in trottle position. The same aspects were evaluated with the engine operating with biogas composed of 95% of methane (Bio95) and in mixture with hydrogen (HBio95). The tests were performed at different ignition angles and air/fuel ratio. The results showed that adding H2 allows the combustion limits to be extended, with an effective increase of indicated efficiency. On the other hand, the reduction of NOx emissions was greater than 95% in the lean mixture provided by the presence of H2. The idea is to encourage change in the control algorithm of SI engines typically fueled with natural gas and use the H2-methane blends as fuel. Furthermore, diesel-powered buses in Brazil could be converted to SI gas engines without the loss of efficiency. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Taiwan is an island in East Asia that strongly depends on imported fossil fuels. To reduce emissions and pollutants, there is interest in wind and solar energy. The current solar energy systems convert solar energy into electricity with high capital cost because of their low efficiency and high operational costs. This paper presents the position of renewable energy methods in Taiwan and the benefits of its expansion. This research suggests that the use of Photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) collectors and wind turbines can provide appropriate solutions for electricity production due to the benefits of the long duration of insolation of solar collectors and the energy density of wind turbines. However, there are several challenges and problems that must be solved (land conditions and geographical positions are not appropriate for PV/T installation and wind energy system, respectively). Finally, a series of suggestions is presented to solve the economic problems associated with wind and solar energy systems. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The goal of this study is to investigate the cause of a growing food price volatility. We analyse whether food price volatility is mainly induced by transfer of the oil price shock or if it is the consequence of a rising and competitive biofuel production. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of biofuels on land use as well. Food prices have lately surged and declined sharply and become more volatile. High fuel prices combined with a rising biofuel production created a link between crude oil and food prices. We investigated the impact of a biofuel production on an increased volatility in oil and food prices, and found correlations between cereals, sugar and vegetable oil price index and crude oil prices from 2003 to 2016. Our results show that the main driver for food price fluctuation is mainly the oil price shock. The increasing biofuel output has been associated with a rising protein-rich animal feed production. The use of co-products as animal feed has land use implications including GHG emission savings because co-products reduce land and the demand for chemical inputs required in the feed production. © 2017 Journal of Competitiveness.

AB  - Biomass is a crucial energy resource used for the generation of electricity and transportation fuels. Microalgae exhibit a high content of biocomponents which makes them a potential feedstock for the generation of ecofriendly biofuels. Biofuels derived from microalgae are suitable carbon-neutral replacements for petroleum. Fermentation is the major process for metabolic conversion of microalgal biocompounds into biofuels such as bioethanol and higher alcohols. In this review, we explored the use of all three major biocomponents of microalgal biomass including carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids for maximum biofuel generation. Application of several pretreatment methods for enhancement the bioavailability of substrates (simple sugar, amino acid, and fatty acid) was discussed. This review goes one step further to discuss how to direct these biocomponents for the generation of various biofuels (bioethanol, higher alcohol, and biodiesel) through fermentation and transesterification processes. Such an approach would result in the maximum utilization of biomasses for economically feasible biofuel production. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - The need of the hour is to look forward to alternative fuels to swipe out the dependence on fossil fuels, as biofuels from various feedstocks are being experimented worldwide. However, it is difficult to implement biodiesel from a single feedstock to replace the existing fossil fuels. It is reliable to obtain biodiesel from local feedstock and to make multiple biodiesel mixtures blended with diesel. The present work relies more on biofuels and acts as a step towards fossil fuel-free engine or at least to snatch the lion's share of the fossil fuels. In this contest, the experiment was carried out by using treble biofuels i.e., WCOBD + PSBD + Bio-hydrogen at different injection pressures (i.e., 200bar, 225bar and 250bar) and compared them with a similar engine that utilised fossil fuel as the stand-alone fuel. The mixture ratios were B10, B20 and B30 and the enrichment of hydrogen was done at 4lpm, 6lpm and 8lpm. The results showed that the brake thermal efficiency of dual biofuel blended diesel decreased as compared to that of the base fuel and increased with hydrogen enriched biodiesel. Hence, the brake specific energy consumption decreased for the hydrogen enriched fuel and the exhaust emissions of CO and CO2 were reduced, however, NOx showed an increasing trend as usual. © 2017 Universiti Malaysia Pahang Publishing.

AB  - The interdependences between the structure of fatty acid and biofuel characteristics obtained from these fatty acids were briefly reviewed. The fatty acid compositions of the lipids of yeasts and phototrophic microorganisms were analyzed. The main parameters of the biodiesel (iodine value, cetane number, and kinematic viscosity) that can be made from the lipids of these microorganisms were calculated based on the data and compared to the current standards. The lipids of the yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides VKPM Y-3349 were shown to be the most suitable for biofuel production due to the composition and content of fatty acid. The possibilities of a decrease in the prime cost of microbial lipids (along with plant oils) that would make them competitive raw material for biofuel production were considered. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

AB  - The Finnish transportation sector is the second biggest greenhouse gas emitting sector in Finland. Despite large-scale investment and government commitments to promote biofuels for transport sectors in Finland, little is known about the public acceptance of this alternative transport fuels. Public's opinion, awareness and knowledge can contribute to social acceptance of new renewable energy and to the overall improvement of consumers' energy behaviour. This study examines public acceptance in terms of public's opinion and knowledge about biofuels and their consumer patterns of transportation fuels by designing a multiple-choice questionnaire with four groups of questions: background information, community perspective, social perspective, and market perspective. The analysis of 90 respondents’ survey shows that 50% of the respondents think that there is a direct effect of biofuel production on food prices and would not buy biofuels derived from food crops. Only 60% of them are willing to switch towards purchasing biofuels; however, the lack of information about biofuels prevents them to use biofuels for their transports. Finally, 63 respondents of the car owners, their ideal fuel would be hydrogen (20%), electricity (60%), and other (20%), which meant hybrid. Study findings have important policy implications related to the public acceptance of biofuels in the transport sector. © 2017

AB  - The present study is focused on conversion of non-edible Jatropha seeds biomass to biofuels i.e., liquid, solid and gaseous fuels via solar thermochemical pyrolysis process. All the three products namely; (i) bio-oil (liquid) (ii) biochar (solid) and (iii) pyrolytic gas were characterized by means of TG (Thermo-gravimetric), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared), GC–MS (Gas chromatography mass spectroscopy), proximate and ultimate analysis; and assessed their feasibility as fuel candidates. It is explored that 20% maximum bio-oil yield was obtained with the average reactor temperature of 250–320 °C. The pyrolytic zone for the biomass was identified in the range of 203–508 °C. The ultimate analysis of the bio-oil revealed that the oil is rich in carbon (58.3%) and hydrogen (8.7%) with an average chemical composition of CH1.79N0.05O0.40. Relatively lower oxygen content in the bio-oil favors for high heating value. Higher H/C ratio (1.79) and lower O/C ratio (0.4) of the bio-oil indicates its suitability as petroleum fuel for engine applications. The carbon compounds present in the bio-oil are from C7 to C28 which may represent the mixture of diesel and gasoline fuels. Finally, it is emerged from the study that all the three products are exibiting various favorable conditions to be employed as fuel candidates for different applications such as engines and boilers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The nutrient cycling from microalgae-based processes is a potential technological route to be applied in wastewater treatment plants. The pollutants conversion in parallel with microalgal sludge formation results in a renewable feedstock for bioproducts production that potentially reduces the cost of wastewater treatment. The experiments have been performed in a bubble column bioreactor, operating at 25ºC, pH 7.5, 100 mg/L of initial inoculum, absence of light and flow rate per unit volume (Q/V) of 1.0 VVM (volume of air per volume of culture per minute). Thereby, the kinetic parameters of cell growth, substrate consumption, analysis of microalgal sludge composition and the biodiesel quality properties have been realized. The nutrient cycling by Phormidium autumnale in wastewater has presented high removal efficiencies of pollutants. The generated microalgal sludge shows predominance of saturated fatty acids, indicates the potential of its use as a suitable lipid input for biodiesel synthesis. The lip-id-extracted microalgae (LEM) showed high content of free amino acids, minerals and pigments. The heterotrophic microalgae cultivation in wastewater has demonstrated to be capable of removing pollutants and, simultaneously, producing biofuel and being a potential source for animal feeding from microalgal sludge, contributing, therefore, to the multi-purpose microalgal bioprocess development. © 2017 Desalination Publications.

AB  - Present study experimentally investigates the use of biodiesel prepared from two potential non-edible oil (Karanja and Jatropha) and waste cooking oil in compression ignition engine. Keeping in view the low temperature operability and other durability issues found in pure biodiesel, B-20 blends were experimented in diesel engine. The performance and emission parameter were observed and analyzed. All the B-20 blends showed performance and emission characteristics similar to that of high speed diesel. WCB-20 showed highest NOx emission at full load. Karanja biodiesel blend showed good performance characteristics compared to Jatropha and waste cooking biodiesel blend. The results reveal that all the 20% blending test fuel can be used in compression ignition engine as a supplementary fuel.

AB  - The nickel (Ni) and phosphotungstic acid (HPW) supported on carbon nanotubes (CNT) were prepared by impregnation method for hydroprocessing of Jatropha oil. The Ni-HPW/CNT catalyst was characterized by XRD, XPS, FT-IR, N2 adsorption-desorption, SEM, NH3-TPD, and TGA. The effects of reaction parameters, such as reaction temperature (280-400°C), time-on-stream (0-100h), types of support, the amount of added HPW, and coking deposition were investigated. The cracking performance was evaluated by gas chromatography (GC). The yield of C15-C18 alkanes was 88.5wt.%, Iso/n ratio was 0.8 and conversion was 97.7% at 320°C, 3.0MPa and 1.0/h over the Ni-HPW/CNT catalyst, while the yield of &lt;C15 alkanes reached 51.9wt.% at 400°C. The distribution of products could be adjusted by reaction temperature. The cracking performance was elevated by the addition of HPW and the electrical conductivity. The C15-C18 alkanes were further cracked through two cracking circulations. Meanwhile, the catalyst was used without sulfurization and the cracking process was green. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Volatile organic compound (VOC) production from an endophytic fungus was quantified at four oxygen concentrations (0, 1, 13 and 21 %) throughout culture growth phases. The filamentous fungus, a Nodulisporium sp. (designated TI-13), was grown in a solid-state reactor with an agricultural byproduct, beet pulp, as the solid substrate. The VOCs, with potential applications as biofuels, natural flavour compounds and bioactive mixtures, were measured with a recently introduced platinum catalyst and proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry quantification system. The highest-specific production rates of carbon number four and higher VOCs were observed under microaerophilic conditions, which is the expected environment within the plant host. Specific production rates of two ester compounds increased by at least 19 times under microaerophilic conditions compared with those under any other oxygen concentration studied. Total VOC production, including small molecules such as ethanol and acetaldehyde, increased by 23 times when compared between aerobic and anoxic conditions, predominately due to increased production of ethanol. Additionally, total specific production for all 21 compounds quantified was highest under reduced oxygen conditions. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Algal biofuels have been offered as an alternative to fossil fuels, based on claims that microalgae can provide a highly productive source of compounds as feedstocks for sustainable transport fuels. Life cycle analyses identify algal productivity as a critical factor affecting commercial and environmental viability. Here, we use mechanistic modelling of the biological processes driving microalgal growth to explore optimal production scenarios in an industrial setting, enabling us to quantify limits to algal biofuels potential. We demonstrate how physiological and operational trade-offs combine to restrict the potential for solar-powered algal-biodiesel production in open ponds to a ceiling of ca. 8000 L ha−1 year−1. For industrial-scale operations, practical considerations limit production to ca. 6000 L ha−1 year−1. According to published economic models and life cycle analyses, such production rates cannot support long-term viable commercialisation of solar-powered cultivation of natural microalgae strains exclusively as feedstock for biofuels. The commercial viability of microalgal biofuels depends critically upon limitations in microalgal physiology (primarily in rates of C-fixation); we discuss the scope for addressing this bottleneck concluding that even deployment of genetically modified microalgae with radically enhanced characteristics would leave a very significant logistical if not financial burden. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - The finite natures of fossil fuels and their contributions to anthropogenic climate change are driving the development of biofuels. However, because of the inherent issues with current biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, innovative replacements are being increasingly sought. Recently, four esters produced from fermentation, namley diethyl succinate, dibutyl succinate, dibutyl fumarate and dibutyl malonate, were reported to have suitable physical properties as a substitute for conventional diesel fuel. Although the physical properties are indicative of the fuel behaviour, the determination of the combustion emissions and the performance of a fuel using controlled engine testing is vital. In this investigation, the engine performance and emissions produced from the most viable fuel, namely diethyl succinate, were examined. Diethyl succinate was blended with diesel in a 20 vol % blend, owing to the low cetane number of diethyl succinate, and the emissions established in pseudo-steady-state conditions using a 2.0 L turbocharged direct-injection EURO 3-compliant light commercial vehicle equipped with a direct-injection common-rail diesel engine. When using the diesel–20 vol % diethyl succinate blend, the fuel demand and the wheel force were higher for the majority of engine speeds than those of diesel, whereas the exhaust gas temperatures were lower. The difference between the exhaust gas temperature for the diesel–20 vol % diethyl succinate blend and that for diesel increased with increasing pedal demand. In comparison with the carbon monoxide emissions from petroleum-derived diesel, the carbon monoxide emissions obtained when using the diesel–20 vol % diethyl succinate blend were reduced, most probably because of more complete combustion due to the increased oxygen content. However, the total hydrocarbon emissions and the mono-nitrogen oxide emissions were shown to increase on using the diethyl succinate blend. Both of these factors were presumably due to the lower cetane number of the fuel, although the increase in the total hydrocarbon emissions was deemed negligible because of the low amount produced by both fuels. © 2017, © IMechE 2017.

AB  - The thermal stability of bio-oil influences its application in industry and is, therefore, a very important factor that must be taken into consideration. In this study, the stability of low and high molecular weight (Mw) fractions of bio-oil obtained from the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of lignin in subcritical water was studied at an elevated temperature (80 °C) for a period of 1 h, 1 day and 1 week. The changes in molecular weight (gel permeation chromatography (GPC)) and chemical composition (gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and 2D heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) NMR (18.8 T, DMSO-d6)) of low and high Mw fractions of the HTL bio-oil (i.e. light oil (LO) and heavy oil (HO)) were evaluated before and after ageing. It was found that only a slight formation of high Mw insoluble structures was obtained during ageing at elevated temperature for 1 week: 0.5% for the LO and 3.1% for the HO. These higher Mw moieties might be formed from different polymerisation/condensation reactions of the reactive compounds (i.e. anisoles, guaiacols, phenols, methylene (–CH2–) groups in phenolic dimers and xanthene). The high Mw insolubles in both the LO and the HO were analysed for structural composition using 2D HSQC NMR to obtain a better understanding of the changes in the composition of bio-oil fractions during the accelerated ageing process. In addition, a chemical shift database in DMSO-d6 was analysed for a subset of phenolic model compounds to simplify the interpretation of the 2D HSQC NMR spectra. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - Recent studies have addressed the social and environmental impacts of biofuel crops but seldom the question as to why rural producers engage in their production. It is particularly unclear how governments worldwide, especially in middle-income countries such as Brazil, Thailand, and Mexico, could enroll so many smallholders in biofuel cropping projects. Conventional views see yields and economic returns as main drivers for smallholder participation in biofuel production but ignore the role played by power and politics. This paper analyses the rapid biofuel expansions (oil palm, jatropha) in the southern Lacandon rainforest in Chiapas (Mexico) and their partial failure (jatropha) from a political ecology perspective. Our findings indicate that biofuel expansions in this region not only occurred for productive reasons, but also because biofuel programmes provided prospects for political gains through strengthened rural organisations. In contrast with emphasis on state coercion and local resistance—common in political ecology—the biofuel expansion relied, in this case, upon a ‘politics of consent’ in which both the state and rural organisations, albeit in a power-laden relationship, sought to achieve their own goals by supporting the planting of biofuel crops. These findings suggest the need to rethink how particular approaches within political ecology apply Gramsci's notions of power and hegemony and, more broadly, to consider the importance of politics in explaining why certain forms of agricultural production become dominant. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Questions of ecology in the area of transport are always very topical because the newest emission standards concerning the piston combustion engines are very hard with regard to protection of the environment and human health. Nowadays the most often used driving units that are applied within the road transport as well as in the marine transport are the diesel engines. In the last period occurred information about a fact that in some of the motorcars was installed a software, which enabled to hide the over-limit values of the nitrogen oxides during the emission testing process. This affair is called “dieselgate”. It is a well-known fact that the actual emission limits are very hard and there is arising a serious problem for automobile factories to meet the demanding emission requirements. Therefore it was elaborated an ecological analysis or study concerning the gaseous emissions produced in the road transport. This analysis is based on application of the experimental fuels. As the experimental combustion engine it was chosen just such kind of the motorcar engine, which is relevant to the cause “dieselgate”, i.e. the diesel piston combustion engine. The testing fuels were created by mixing of the biodiesel and the ULSDF (Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel Fuel), using various mutual ratios between these fuels. The individual measurements were performed at the various engine loading levels and engine speeds in order to investigate an influence of the experimental fuels on the real operational characteristics of the given testing engine. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The United States biofuels industry has experienced significant growth since its inception in the early 1990s due to concerns regarding climate change, energy security, and oil price volatility. Corn (maize) ethanol has served as an alternative to petroleum-based gasoline over the past few decades and currently accounts for nearly 90% of total U.S. renewable biofuels. In recent years, research interests have transitioned to biofuels recovered from lignocellulosic biomass due, in part, to the food-fuel controversy and the “ethanol blend” wall issue. However, the sustainable development of the U.S. lignocellulosic biofuels industry faces a variety of challenges, including feedstock costs and availability, high production and capital costs, and policy and market fluctuations. Literature suggests that buyer–supplier relationship management has the potential to solidify the supply chain and bring stability to commercialization plans. This study conducted semi-structured interviews with three lignocellulosic biofuel producers to explore relationships with their ethanol biofuel customers. Results show that refiners and blenders of gasoline were the primary customers of corn ethanol with fuel marketing companies as secondary intermediaries. Meanwhile, communication, trust, commitment, and power between participating parties were identified as important relationship attributes. To strengthen biofuel buyer–supplier relationships, this study identified manufacturing of consistent and regulated products and communication regarding logistics and environmental benefits of biofuels as key relationship management activities.

AB  - Usually, traditional poly (ionic liquid)s are prepared to nanoparticles with high surface areas for achieving a quasi-homogeneous reaction system. In this work, a novel poly (ionic liquid) P(VB-VS)HSO4, synthesized by simply using ionic liquids immobilized on the 1-vinylimidazole-based crosslinked copolymer microsphere, was used as heterogeneous catalyst for transesterification of a novel non-edible feedstock soapberry oil to biodiesel. The structure, thermal stability and wetting property characteristics of the crosslinked copolymer microsphere particles and poly (ionic liquid) microspheres were investigated. The results indicated that ionic liquids were successfully functionalized on crosslinked copolymer microsphere, and P(VB-VS)HSO4 possessed high surface areas (100.1 m2/g), abundant meso-macropores (with diameter of ∼18.9 nm), good mechanical strength (81 N) and superior thermal stability. Benefiting from the unique structure features, these poly (ionic liquid) microspheres manifested excellent catalytic performance for transesterification of soapberry oil with methanol. A maximum fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) yield of 95.2% could be obtained under the response surface methodology (RSM) optimized conditions of 8.0 h reaction time, 29.1 methanol to oil molar ratio, and 8.7 wt% catalyst amount. Impressively, it was also efficient for the esterification of oleic acid, giving methyl oleate yield of 97.5%. Catalytic tests exhibited that P(VB-VS)HSO4 presented high catalytic activity and good reusability in comparison with traditional acid catalysts. The main physicochemical of the obtained soapberry biodiesel met the biodiesel standard ASTM D6751. Therefore, this work provides a cheap and facile route to the synthesis of size-controlled poly (ionic liquid) microspheres (the diameter of the catalyst was about 500 μm) for catalyzing the production of clean biofuels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The increased use of small molecular weight alcohols such as ethanol and potentially butanol isomers as biofuels has raised questions about the fate of these compounds in the environment once emitted. In order to address these questions, a method for the simultaneous determination of nanomolar concentrations of ethanol, n-butanol, and iso-butanol in aqueous environmental matrices is presented. The method consists of static headspace gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer/mass spectrometer (GC-MS/MS) analysis with detection limits of 28 nM for ethanol and 9 nM for each butanol isomer. Accuracy of the new method was verified by comparing ethanol concentrations in authentic environmental samples by an independent technique utilizing solid phase microextraction (SPME). Results of an intercomparison study between the static headspace GC-MS/MS and SPME analyses produced a trend line with a slope of unity demonstrating that the methods produced statistically equivalent ethanol concentrations. Spiked additions of each alcohol in a variety of aqueous environmental matrices gave recoveries greater than 90% validating the accuracy of the headspace GC-MS/MS analysis. The new static headspace GC-MS/MS analysis represents the first methodology available with demonstrated accuracy in an array of environmental matrices with the requisite limit of detection capable of quantifying several alcohols in one analysis with minimal sample preparation and sample size requirement. © 2017 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography

AB  - The correlation between oxides of nitrogen emission and in-cylinder temperature of diesel engine fueled with various alternative fuels has been investigated in this research paper. Experimentations were performed in engine without any modifications using pure high-speed diesel fuel, used cooking oil biodiesel (UCO20), animal fat residue biodiesel (AFR20) and camphor oil (CMR20) at 20% volume concentration of biodiesel each. From combustion analysis, the heat release rate and peak cylinder pressure of biodiesel blends were about 13.487% lower and 4.819% higher than those of diesel fuel on an average, respectively. Longer combustion duration has been observed for all biodiesel blends at all load conditions. Oxides of nitrogen emission level show 16.405, 10.352 and 7.524% increment for UCO20, AFR20 and CMR20, respectively. Noteworthy NOx reduction of about 43.8% was recorded for diesel blended with camphor oil when compared to other biodiesel blends. The relationship between in-cylinder temperature and NOx emission concentration was premeditated through thermal imager. The result depicted that the increase in NOx concentration depends on augmented in-cylinder temperature for all test fuels. © 2017, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - The consumption of fossil and especially alternative fuels from renewable sources is supposed to rise in the future. Biofuels as well as fossil fuels often contain alkali and alkaline earth metal impurities that are potential poisons for automotive exhaust catalysts. The impact of these contaminations on the long-time performance of the exhaust aftertreatment system is a major concern. However, engine test bench studies consume considerable amounts of fuel, manpower and time. The purpose of this research project was to examine whether accelerated engine tests can be achieved by a modified diesel aftertreatment system in a test bench and contamination of biodiesel with known amounts of elements potentially poisoning automotive catalysts. A variety of potentially harmful elements (sodium (Na), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S) and phosphorous (P)) were added all at once to enhance the contamination level in biodiesel. A diesel oxidation catalyst and a catalyst for selective catalytic reduction reaction were placed in a stream of exhaust gas generated with a single cylinder engine. For reference purposes, a second test series was performed with a commercially available biodiesel. Catalysts were analyzed post-mortem using a bench flow reactor and X-ray fluorescence regarding their activity and deposition of the harmful elements. For both diesel oxidation catalyst and selective catalytic reduction catalysts, significant deactivation and decrease in conversion rates could be proven. For diesel oxidation catalyst, linear correlations between mass fractions of added elements and aging time were observed. © Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - Life cycle assessments (LCAs) of algal biofuels have typically ignore direct land use change impacts (DLUC), although a few papers have recently shown that the carbon lost from removing the original biomass and disrupting soil organic carbon (SOC) during pond construction can significantly contribute to the climate change impacts. In this study, LCA methods were developed to integrate climate change impacts of DLUC associated with cultivation of microalgae in open ponds and the effects of temporal and geographic variables on algal growth. In addition to direct land use change impacts due to loss of original biomass and the disruption of SOC, this study presents DLUC impacts caused by changing the surface albedo of an area and changing the carbon flux on the land. The methodology is presented with two LCA cases for the production of renewable gasoline from microalgae in climatically similar regions: the Everglades ecoregion and the Tamaulipas-Texas Semi-Arid Plain ecoregion. These were chosen to isolate the differences in DLUC impacts that are created by different land cover types, equalizing the life cycle impacts caused by temperature and solar radiation on algal growth. The DLUC impacts arising from albedo change and carbon flux change contributed significantly to the life cycle climate change impacts and differed between the two climatically similar regions. The baseline life cycle climate change impacts with DLUC impacts in the Everglades are 46.7% higher than those of conventional gasoline, while production in the Tamaulipas-Texas Semi-Arid Plain leads to a 3.0% reduction. The inclusion of albedo change impacts into the DLUC impacts contributed 10.2% of the life cycle climate change impacts in the Everglades and 36.4% in the Tamaulipas. This methodology can help assess the geographically specific sustainability of algal biofuels on a life cycle basis and can guide siting decisions for algal biofuel feedstock production. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A variety of bio-based chemicals and biofuels have been produced from residual biomass including 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, levulinic acid and ethyl levulinate. In this study, Bronsted-Lewis acidic ionic liquids, which made up of an eco-friendly indium trichloride and a noncorrosive ionic liquids, 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate, was developed for a cleaner production of ethyl levulinate from biomass conversions. This coupling catalyst was used for the first time without the corrosive alkyl sulfonic acid functionalised group in the ionic liquids. The conversions involve a sequential depolymerisation and esterification. The depolymerisation was conducted at ionic liquids-to-biomass ratio of 5:1 (w/w), 0.15 mmol indium trichloride, 20% (w/w) water and temperature of 160 °C for 5 h, whereas, the esterification was conducted at the temperature of 90 °C for 10 h in excess ethanol. The coupling catalyst gave ethyl levulinate yields of 13.1% and 14.7%, with process efficiencies of 44.3% and 55.1%, for oil palm empty fruit bunch and oil palm mesocarp fiber conversions, respectively. The coupling catalyst also exhibited minimal losses of <17% of ethyl levulinate yields for the consecutive three runs in reutilisation tests, signifying its potential recycling ability. The experimental results confirm that the proposed non-corrosive coupling catalyst provides a uniquely suitable catalytic system for the conversion of renewable biomass feedstocks into useful products under mild operating conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Diatoms hold great promise as potential sources of biofuel production. In the present study, the biomass and lipid production in the marine diatom Navicula phyllepta, isolated from Cochin estuary, India and identified as a potential biodiesel feedstock, were optimized using Plackett-Burman (PB) statistical experimental design followed by central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology (RSM). The growth analyses of the isolate in different nitrogen sources, salinities and five different enriched sea water media showed the best growth in the cheapest medium with minimum components using urea as nitrogen source at salinity between 25 and 40 g kg−1. Plackett-Burman experimental analyses for screening urea, sodium metasilicate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, ferric chloride, salinity, temperature, pH and agitation influencing lipid and biomass production showed that silicate and temperature had a positive coefficient on biomass production, and temperature had a significant positive coefficient, while urea and phosphate showed a negative coefficient on lipid content. A 24 factorial central composite design (FCCD) was used to optimize the concentration of the factors selected. The optimized media resulted in 1.62-fold increase (64%) in biomass (1.2 ± 0.08 g L−1) and 1.2-fold increase (22%) in estimated total lipid production (0.11 ± 0.003 g L−1) compared to original media within 12 days of culturing. A significantly higher biomass and lipid production in the optimized medium demands further development of a two-stage strategy of biomass production followed by induction of high lipid production under nutrient limitation or varying culture conditions for large-scale production of biodiesel from the marine diatom. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Rapid depletion of fossil fuels and stringent emission regulations compel the scientific community to search for alternative energy sources for the internal combustion engines. Among many alternative biofuels, ethanol is getting worldwide attention for compression ignition engine either in the form of partial substitute or complete replacement for diesel fuel. Ethanol fuel has certain undesirable properties like poor flammability limit which results in cold starting issues and higher hydrocarbon emission which restricts their use in compression ignition engine. This issue can be easily overcome by preheating of ethanol fuel before it gets admitted inside the engine cylinder. In the present study, a standard preheating device is designed and fabricated in accordance with engine specifications and simulations were carried out under various operating conditions to evaluate its performance. Furthermore, experimental investigations were carried out in a compression ignition engine fueled with ethanol blends of 20 and 30% with diesel by volume and the fuel blends were preheated using burned exhaust gases. In addition, a comparative study has been carried out for preheated and non-preheated blends of E20 (20% of ethanol and 80% of diesel) and E30 with baseline diesel. The experimental results show that the preheated E20 (20% of ethanol and 80% of diesel) blend has higher brake thermal efficiency of 36.28% with a significant reduction in brake specific fuel consumption when compared with all the other blends. Moreover, the preheated E20 blend reduces the carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbon and smoke emissions by 49, 48 and 10%, respectively. However, the NOx emission is increased by 6% as compared to the non-preheating effect. It is also noted that the preheating of ethanol blends produced better combustion results with a significant reduction in the ignition delay period. Hence, it can be concluded that the ethanol fuel can be effectively used in a diesel engine by means of preheating using exhaust gases and could be a viable option for diesel engine applications. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Continuous in-situ transesterification of Chinese tallow tree seeds into methyl esters using a resonant focusing cavity microwave coupled with a CSTR system was investigated. High production yield of 90% with 97% conversion rate was obtained in 24 min CSTR residence time at a methanol/hexane/Chinese tallow tree seed mass ratio of 47.5:39.3:20, a continuous microwave heating power of 290 W and 14 s exposure time, reaction temperature of 60 °C in presence of sodium hydroxide catalyst (4 g NaOH per 100 g oil). The experimental data fits first order reaction kinetics. The values of rate constants at different temperatures and the corresponding activation energy were found out to be 0.08–0.084 min−1 and 2057.4 J mol−1, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters values such as Gibbs free energy (ΔG), enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy of activation (ΔS) were also determined. The positive values of ΔG and small negative value of ΔH indicated that the reaction has an unspontaneous/endergonic nature and is slightly exothermic. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity is frequently used to assess the mitigation potential of biofuels; however, failure to quantify other environmental impacts may result in unintended consequences, effectively shifting the environmental burden of fuel production rather than reducing it. We modeled production of E85, a gasoline/ethanol blend, from forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor cv. photoperiod LS) grown, processed, and consumed in California's Imperial Valley in order to evaluate the influence of nitrogen (N) management on well-to-wheel (WTW) environmental impacts from cellulosic ethanol. We simulated 25 N management scenarios varying application rate, application method, and N source. Life cycle environmental impacts were characterized using the EPA's criteria for emissions affecting the environment and human health. Our results suggest efficient use of N is an important pathway for minimizing WTW emissions on an energy yield basis. Simulations in which N was injected had the highest nitrogen use efficiency. Even at rates as high as 450 kg N ha−1, injected N simulations generated a yield response sufficient to outweigh accompanying increases in most N-induced emissions on an energy yield basis. Thus, within the biofuel life cycle, trade-offs across productivity, GHG intensity, and pollutant loads may be possible to avoid at regional to global scales. However, trade-offs were seemingly unavoidable when impacts from E85 were compared to those of conventional gasoline. The GHG intensity of sorghum-derived E85 ranged from 29 to 44 g CO2 eq MJ−1, roughly 1/3 to 1/2 that of gasoline. Conversely, emissions contributing to local air and water pollution tended to be substantially higher in the E85 life cycle. These adverse impacts were strongly influenced by N management and could be partially mitigated by efficient application of N fertilizers. Together, our results emphasize the importance of minimizing on-farm emissions in maximizing both the environmental benefits and profitability of biofuels. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Achieving high degree of active metal dispersions at the highest possible metal loading andhigh reducibility of the metal remains a challenge in Fischer Tropsch synthesis (FTS) as well as in hydrogeoxygenation (HDO).This study therefore reports the influence of oxalic acid (OxA) functionalization on the metal dispersion, reducibility and activity of Co supported ZSM-5 catalyst in FTS and HDO of oleic acid into paraffin biofuel. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) results showed that cobalt oxalate supported ZSM-5 catalyst (CoOx/ZSM-5) synthesized from the incorporation of freshly prepared cobalt oxalate complex into ZSM-5 displayed increase in surface area, pore volume and average pore size while the nonfunctionalized cobalt supported on ZSM-5 (Co/ZSM-5) catalyst showed reduction in those properties. Furthermore, both XRD and XPS confirmed the presence of Coformed from the decomposition of CoOx during calcination of CoOx/ZSM-5 under inert atmosphere. The HRTEM showed that Co species average particle sizes were smaller in CoOx/ZSM-5 than in Co/ZSM- 5, and in addition, CoOx/ZSM-5 shows a clear higher degree of active metal dispersion. The FTS result showed that at CO conversion over Co/ZSM-5 and CoOx/ZSM-5 catalysts were 74.28% and 94.23% and their selectivity to C5+ HC production were 63.15% and 75.4%, respectively at 4 h TOS. The HDO result also showed that the CoOx/ZSM-5 has higher OA conversion of 92% compared to 59% over Co/ZSM-5. In addition CoOx/ZSM-5 showed higher HDO and isomerization activities compared to Co/ZSM-5. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector could be reduced by using biofuels. To avoid competition with the food chain, second generation biofuels produced from lignocellulosic biomass are of major interest. The interaction of second generation biofuels and water needs to be studied since water is known to have major impacts for first generation biofuels. In this work, we explore the water solubility and phase stability for second generation biofuels from catalytic conversion of biomass. Tetrahydrofurans are potential biofuels for compression ignition engines. We find that the water solubility in tetrahydrofurans is increased by a factor 200 compared to Diesel. In furans, suitable as fuels for spark ignition engines, the water solubility is 4 orders of magnitude larger than in gasoline. In blends of biofuels, water solubility can either be increased or decreased depending on the blend component. Water can strongly influence the miscibility of biofuel-blends: adding small amounts of water to a γ-valerolactone – di-n-butyl ether blend leads to phase separation resulting in two organic phases with different combustion behavior. At the same time, the biofuels studied dissolve much better in water, which is relevant for potential environmental impacts. The phase behavior with water is thus shown to be an important key performance indicator for the development of biofuels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Air pollution is a topic discussed all over the world and the search for alternatives to reduce it is of great interest to many researchers. The use of alternative energy sources and biofuels seems to be the environmentally safer solution. In this work, the deleterious effects on the respiratory system of mice exposed to PM4.0 or TSP, present in exhaust gases from the combustion of CNS were investigated, through data from respiratory system mechanics, oxidative stress, histopathology and morphometry of the parenchyma pulmonary. The results show changes in all variables of respiratory system mechanics, in oxidative stress, the histopathological analysis and lung morphometry. The results provide experimental support for epidemiological observations of association between effects on the respiratory system and exposure to PM4.0 or TSP from CNS combustion exhaust gases, even at acute exposure. It can serve as a basis for regulation or adjustment of environmental laws that control the emissions of these gases. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The biofuels are receiving considerable attention as a substitute for petro diesel. For microalgae, the cell density or biomass and lipid contents are key components for biodiesel production. This study was conducted to develop favorable culture conditions for Dunaliella salina to maximize its biomass and lipid accumulation. The effect of salinity (0.5 to 2.5 M NaCl) on the cell population, biochemical composition, and lipid output of Dunaliella salina was examined under a controlled environment for 21 days. Maximum growth (6.57 × 107 to 7.17 × 107cells mL-1) potentials were observed at 1.5 to 2 M NaCl. The photosynthetic pigments and carbohydrates also showed trends similar to growth. The maximum carotenoid level (5.16 mg L-1) was recorded at 2 M NaCl. Almost all physicochemical parameters increased with increases in salinity, biomass (1231.66 ± 1.26 mg L-1) and lipid content (248.33 mg L-1), as recorded at 2 M NaCl. Based on fluorescence intensity, the highest values (11.84 × 107cells/ml) of neutral lipids and total lipids (22.28%) were recorded at optimum salinity levels. The present study suggests that a high biomass and lipid accumulation of Dunaliella salina SA 134 could be obtained at the 2 M NaCl level. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - In recent years, renewable energy resources have become more important due to the limited number of regions for production of petroleum-based fuels, which are continuously depleting. The aviation sector in terms of commercial and cargo transportation has an increasing need for conventional, as well as, alternative fuels. Derivatives of petroleum fuels used in aviation have negative impacts on air quality. Factors causing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in the aviation sector must be reduced. However, such fuels used in the aviation sector are not sustainable. Biofuels which have the potential to replace petroleum fuels and help with emissions are heavily investigated in developed countries for independency, creating a better environment and sustainability. Biofuels which are already used for ground vehicles could also be implemented in the aviation sector to reduce fuel cost and emissions. Overall, aviation fuels made of sustainable resources would also support social and economic development. Numerous industrial initiatives have emerged to find alternative ways to attain bio-aviation fuels. Therefore, there is an increasing level of research with regards to alternative aviation fuels made of biomass in recent years. It is important to obtain basic feedstocks and to develop biofuel production processes in a cost-effective way. This study examines the necessity and the types of biofuels in the aviation sector. By designing unique fuel systems for air vehicles, it is possible to formulate biofuels which can be used for both air and ground vehicle applications. This type of consensus would help with sustainability and a better environment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Despite ethanol's penetration into urban transportation, observational evidence quantifying the consequence for the atmospheric particulate burden during actual, not hypothetical, fuel-fleet shifts, has been lacking. Here we analyze aerosol, meteorological, traffic, and consumer behavior data and find, empirically, that ambient number concentrations of 7-100-nm diameter particles rise by one-Third during the morning commute when higher ethanol prices induce 2 million drivers in the real-world megacity of São Paulo to substitute to gasoline use (95% confidence intervals: +4,154 to +13,272 cm-3). Similarly, concentrations fall when consumers return to ethanol. Changes in larger particle concentrations, including US-regulated PM2.5, are statistically indistinguishable from zero. The prospect of increased biofuel use and mounting evidence on ultrafines' health effects make our result acutely policy relevant, to be weighed against possible ozone increases. The finding motivates further studies in real-world environments. We innovate in using econometrics to quantify a key source of urban ultrafine particles. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - This study addresses the uncertainties related to potential changes in land use and management and associated impacts on hydrology and water quality resulting from increased production of biofuel from the conventional and cellulosic feedstock. The Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to assess the impacts on regional and field scale evapotranspiration, soil moisture content, stream flow, sediment, and nutrient loadings in the Ohio River Basin. The model incorporates spatially and temporally detailed hydrologic, climate and agricultural practice data that are pertinent to simulate biofuel feedstock production, watershed hydrology and water quality. Three future biofuel production scenarios in the region were considered, including a feedstock projection from the DOE Billion-Ton (BT2) Study, a change in corn rotations to continuous corn, and harvest of 50% corn stover. The impacts were evaluated on the basis of relative changes in hydrology and water quality from historical baseline and future business-as-usual conditions of the basin. The overall impact on water quality is an order of magnitude higher than the impact on hydrology. For all the three future scenarios, the sub-basin results indicated an overall increase in annual evapotranspiration of up to 6%, a decrease in runoff up to 10% and minimal change in soil moisture. The sediment and phosphorous loading at both regional and field levels increased considerably (up to 40–90%) for all the biofuel feedstock scenario considered, while the nitrogen loading increased up to 45% in some regions under the BT2 Study scenario, decreased up to 10% when corn are grown continuously instead of in rotations, and changed minimally when 50% of the stover are harvested. Field level analyses revealed significant variability in hydrology and water quality impacts that can further be used to identify suitable locations for the feedstock productions without causing major impacts on water quantity and quality. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Synthesis of biodiesel from a non-edible source as Pistacia khinjuk seed oil via ultrasonic cavitation (UC) system is reported in this study. A heterogeneous catalyst sulphated tin oxide impregnated with silicon dioxide (SO42-/SnO2–SiO2) was employed during the transesterification reaction in an UC reactor. Parametric optimisation results revealed the maximum Pistacia khinjuk methyl ester (PiKME) yield was 88 wt.% at reaction time of 50 min, amplitude of 50%, catalyst amount of 3.5 wt.% and molar ratio of 13:1 (alcohol:oil). Performance of UC at optimised values was compared with mechanical stirring (MS). UC proved advantageous over MS with 3 times more time efficient. Hence, the superiority of UC over MS was established. About 3.2 fold higher reaction rate constant using UC (0.029 min−1) compared to MS (0.009 min−1). PiKME production via UC can potentially subsidise the overall cost of production by having 3.2 fold higher reaction rate constant than MS. PiKME met most of the fuel properties enlisted in EN14214 and ASTM D6751 standards. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel is increasingly used in transportation and heating as an alternativeto diesel fuel, furthering sustainability by reducing fossil fuel use and posinglower risks when spilled. The bioremediation of soil contaminated with a 20% fishbiodiesel blend or heating diesel (HD) was studied in laboratory microcosms. Freshfuel and artificially weathered fuel were compared by placing activated carbon (AC)in the microcosms to remove volatile fuel fractions, accelerating hydrocarbonweathering. After a brief lag phase, during which all microcosms behaved similarly,microbial respiration increased exponentially. In general, biodiesel blend was biodegradedfaster than HD and high degradation rates were sustained substantiallylonger for biodiesel blend than for HD. Cumulative mineralization was considerablyhigher for biodiesel blend than for HD fuel. The weathering induced by activatedcarbon suppressed mineralization rates for the first three weeks, resulting inlower cumulative mineralization and nitrogen use. As calculated from nitrogen consumption,about 10% of the carbon from hydrocarbons was incorporated into biomass.After four weeks, approximately only half of the fuel hydrocarbons remainedin the soil. Overall, accelerated fuel weathering, caused by AC addition, especiallywhen frequently changed, resulted in decreased fuel mineralization, decreasednitrogen use, and lower respiration values during the exponential phase comparedwith controls without AC. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - This work describes the economic feasibility of hydroprocessed diesel fuel production via catalytic decarboxylation of rubber seed oil in Malaysia. A comprehensive techno-economic assessment is developed using Aspen HYSYS V8.0 software for process modelling and economic cost estimates. The profitability profile and minimum fuels selling price of this synthetic fuels production using rubber seed oil as biomass feedstock are assessed under a set of assumptions for what can be plausibly be achieved in 10-years framework. In this study, renewable diesel processing facility is modelled to be capable of processing 65,000 L of inedible oil per day and producing a total of 20 million litre of renewable diesel product per annual with assumed annual operational days of 347. With the forecasted renewable diesel retail price of 3.64 RM per kg, the pioneering renewable diesel project investment offers an assuring return of investment of 12.1% and net return as high as 1.35 million RM. Sensitivity analysis conducted showed that renewable diesel production cost is most sensitive to rubber seed oil price and hydrogen gas price, reflecting on the relative importance of feedstock prices in the overall profitability profile. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Using an air-liquid interface (ALI) device in dynamic conditions, we evaluated the efficiency of fuel after-treatment strategies (diesel oxidation catalysis, DOC, and diesel particulate filter, DPF, devices) and the impact of 7% and 30% rapeseed methyl esters (RME) blending on oxidative stress and genotoxicity induced in A549 lung cells after 3 h exposure to whole Diesel exhausts. Oxidative stress was studied using assays of ROS production, glutathione level, catalase and superoxide-dismutase (SOD) activities. No oxidative stress and no clear differences on cytotoxicity patterns between biodiesel and standard Diesel exhausts were found. A weak but significant genotoxicity (8-oxodGuo adducts) and, for standard Diesel only, a DNA damage response (DDR) as evidenced by ƔH2AX foci, remained after DOC + DPF flowing. All together, these data could contribute to the improvement of the after treatment strategies and to health risk assessment of current diesel exhausts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Since the early 2000s, biofuel production has been developed in West Africa with the encouragement and support of notably Europe, Brazil, and China. Yet the development of biofuels can also be viewed from the angle of West African interests. The principle arguments advanced in favor of biofuels pointed to their potential to reduce oil trade deficits and improve the populations’ access to ready, cheap energy. Biofuels consequently began to be put on the political agendas of West African countries. Ten years after the first Jatropha plantations for energy use were established in West Africa, and in the light of the uneven development of the biofuel sector across the region, we analyze the factors that surprisingly led to policy inaction in many of these countries. Methods: We used the concept of policy cycle stages to analyze the involvement of stakeholders in building biofuel policy and the factors behind incomplete public policies. The methods and tools that have been defined for the analysis of the relationships and interplay between actors are based on an analysis of the positions and interests of different stakeholders and on the comparison of their influence and importance in the design and implementation of projects, programs and policies. Our approach is inspired by the literature on Stakeholder Analysis, but also draws from the field of New Institutional Economics. We developed our own analytic framework (the “4C”) which breaks down the interplay between different types of stakeholders and into four types of relationships: coordination, concertation, cooperation and contractualization. Our research process was based on a ranging study conducted between 2011 and 2014. Multilevel approaches were used to understand multi-scale and multi-sector biofuel issues. The analysis employed a large range of methods, including the reading of reports and political texts and conducting interviews. The documentary analysis helped to identify stakeholder groups for the stakeholder analysis. We then carried out interviews with a panel of stakeholders. Results: The study shows that it was the energy ministries of West African countries, encouraged by international cooperation agencies, which stepped forward to establish biofuel strategies, paying little attention to the issues at stake for agricultural producers or local communities. Around the same time, increases in food prices on the international market began to damage the image of biofuels, which came to be perceived as a threat to the food security of populations in developing countries. In several countries dependent on outside technical and financial support, this shift in the international discourse influenced the position of agriculture ministries, which became lukewarm or even opposed to biofuels. An outstanding result of the study is that the double talk at the international level—favorable and unfavorable to biofuels—and power games inside the countries crippled the coordination of public action to support the sector, generated an institutional vacuum, led to conflicts between stakeholders, and hampered the sustainable development of biofuel projects and sectors in several West African countries. In conclusion, we then emphasize the need to turn inaction into action: regulation frameworks must be implemented if the biofuel sector is to survive in West Africa. Conclusions: The development of biofuels in the majority of West African countries suffers from an absence of a clear vision shared by all stakeholders and a lack of coordination between public actors. An institutional vacuum has taken hold which prevents investments in and the sustainable development of the biofuel sector and respectful of the interests of family farmers, who represent the majority of the population. The governments in these countries mainly worked through the ministries in charge of energy, which have become the leaders on the biofuel question. National biofuel policies are thus primarily focused on the energy potential of biofuels and on technical and economic dimensions of processing Jatropha seeds into oil and biodiesel rather than on upstream and downstream social objectives. If the biofuel sector is to survive in West African countries, the inaction of public actors has to be reversed by establishing the institutional frameworks needed to facilitate such development. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Crude rubber seed oil is a potential source for biofuel production. However it contains undesirable impurities such as peroxides and high oxidative components that not only affect the oil stability, colour and shelf-life but promote insoluble gums formation with time that could cause deposition in the combustion engines. Therefore to overcome these problems the crude rubber seed oil is refined by undergoing degumming and bleaching process. The effect of bleaching earth dosage (15–40 wt %), phosphoric acid dosage (0.5–1.0 wt %) and reaction time (20–40 min) were studied over the reduction of the peroxide value in a refined crude rubber seed oil. The analysis of variance shows that bleaching earth dosage was the most influencing factor followed by reaction time and phosphoric acid dosage. A minimum peroxide value of 0.1 milliequivalents/gram was achieved under optimized conditions of 40 wt % of bleaching earth dosage, 1.0 wt % of phosphoric acid dosage and 20 min of reaction time using Response Surface Methodology design. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work reports a case study for the industrialization of a biorefinery aimed at valorizing fish processing residues in order to obtain ω-3 concentrates for the nutraceutical sector. The biorefinery includes a series of processes: oil extraction from fish waste, fish oil transesterification with ethanol, ω-3 concentration based on supercritical CO2 fractionation. The biorefinery is at first designed and then modeled by Aspen Plus™: this allows for a comprehensive picture (mass and energy flows, processing costs and costs for investment) of the overall process. In accordance with the zero-waste concept, all the biorefinery by-products are valorized: fish proteins as fishmeal, and glycerol, saturated fatty acids and short chain unsaturated fatty acids as liquid biofuel. In addition, fish oil transesterification with ethanol is also experimentally tested in different operational conditions in order to maximize fish oil conversion to fatty acid ethyl esters. A trout processing company located in Trentino Province, Italy, represents the case study. The company produces 870 t/year of fish waste. Mass balances allow estimating a production of 26.6 t/year of ω-3 rich oil (income: 1.3 M€), 160 t/year of fish proteins (income: 0.27 M€), and 160 t/year of liquid biofuel. The biofuel, fed to a 100 kWel CHP unit, allows to produce 720 MWhe/year and 870 MWhth/year, covering the total electricity consumption of the plant and providing more than 45% of the thermal energy needs. This translates into a reduction in utility costs of about 0.12 M€ and avoids the emission of 416 t/year of CO2. Finally, the total investment costs for the whole biorefinery amount to about 3.34 M€. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the production of ω-3 rich fish oils in a bio-refinery concept could become a good opportunity for valorizing fish by-products and increasing the competitiveness of the fish processing industry. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - In order to reduce the harmful effect on the environment, European Union allowed using the biofuel blends as fuel for the internal combustion engines. Experimental studies have been carried on, dealing with the biodiesel influence on the emission concentrations, showing inconclusive results. In this paper numerical model for pollutant prediction in internal combustion engines is presented. It describes the processes leading towards the pollutant emissions, such as spray particles model, fuel disintegration and evaporation model, combustion and the chemical model for pollutant formation. Presented numerical model, implemented in proprietary software FIRE®, is able to capture chemical phenomena and to predict pollutant emission concentration trends. Using the presented model, numerical simulations of the diesel fuelled internal combustion engine have been performed, with the results validated against the experimental data. Additionally, biodiesel has been used as fuel and the levels of pollutant emissions have been compared to the diesel case. Results have shown that the biodiesel blends release lower nitrogen oxide emissions than the engines powered with the regular diesel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study we describe the heterologous expression of the recently identified cyanobacterial pathway for long chain alkane biosynthesis, involving the reduction of fatty acyl-ACP to fatty aldehyde and the subsequent conversion of this into alkanes, in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus carbonarius ITEM 5010. Genes originating from Synechococcus elongatus strain PCC7942, encoding acyl-ACP/CoA reductase and aldehyde deformylating oxygenase enzymes, were successfully expressed in A. carbonarius, which lead to the production of pentadecane and heptadecane, alkanes that have not been previously produced by this fungus. Titers of 0.2, 0.5 and 2.7 mg/l pentadecane and 0.8, 1.6 and 10.2 mg/l heptadecane were achieved using glucose, Yeast malt and oatmeal media, respectively. Besides producing alkanes, we found elevated levels of internal free fatty acids and triglycerides in the alkane producing transformant. These findings can indicate that a yet unidentified, native fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase channels back the fatty aldehydes into the fatty acid metabolism, thus competing for substrate with the heterologously expressed fatty aldehyde deformylating oxygenase. These findings will potentially facilitate the future application of robust, fungal cell factories for the production of advanced biofuels from various substrates. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Effects of different mass fractions of industrial alcohol additive (10% and 20%) and additive combination (ethanol: 6.58%, acetonitrile: 1.00%, methyl acetate: 2.42%) on the physicochemical characteristics of pine sawdust bio-oil aging for three months by fast pyrolysis of 1–5 kg/h bench-scale fluidized bed reactor with hot vapor filter were investigated. The results indicated that addition of industrial alcohol and additive combination had a significant effect on improving the physicochemical characterization of bio-oil. The additives could significantly lower the viscosity and instantly increase pH value of the bio-oil remarkably and also delay the aging rates of the bio-oil. Results showed that compared with the blank (bio-oil without additive), the pH values of the bio-oils with 10% industrial alcohol (10% IA bio-oil), 20% industrial alcohol (20% IA bio-oil), and additive combination (AC bio-oil) were immediately increased by 12%, 12%, and 21%, respectively when the additives were added. After stored for 90 days, viscosities of crude bio-oil, 10% IA bio-oil, 20% IA bio-oil and AC bio-oil were increased by 200%, 54%, 69%, and 62%, respectively. Two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-TOFMS) analysis indicated that the aged bio-oil after 90 days storage had a lower levels of phenols than that of the crude bio-oil and the contents of ketones and esters were increased. FT-IR analysis demonstrated that the structures of non-volatile residue of bio-oils were changed and polymerization occurred with other compounds such as alcohols and aldehydes during storage. © 2016 Energy Institute

AB  - To better understand pyrolysis mechanism and further develop selective pyrolysis technology, characteristics of volatile products in the pyrolysis of three main components (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) were investigated and compared by amplifying experiments in a tube furnace at 300–700 °C. Distribution of volatile products (including bio-oil and bio-gas), the influence of temperature and contributions of each single component were discussed in depth. It was found that, for each sample pyrolysis, pyrolysis temperature and their own chemical structures played an important role in the yields, composition of bio-oil and bio-gas. The optimal temperatures for production of bio-oil from cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin focused at 500 °C, 450 °C and 600 °C, respectively, and cellulose made greater contribution to bio-oil formation, and hemiellulose was the major contributor for bio-gas. Moreover, the more bio-gases from the three components generated at the higher temperature, but compositions of volatile products were different depending on their unique chemical structures. In the three components, cellulose produced the highest CO, hemicellulose owned the highest CO2, and lignin generated the highest CH4 characterized by the largest HHV. As for bio-oil, cellulose bio-oil displayed unique saccharides and higher furans, hemicellulose bio-oil contained higher acids and ketones, while phenols were the dominant composition of lignin bio-oil. © 2016 Energy Institute

AB  - The impact of water use in areas with abundant freshwater resources should not be the same as areas with limited resources. This impact is quantified as water scarcity footprint. The monthly water stress index with reference to environmental water requirement is proposed as a characterization factor. The biofuel policies of Thailand-cassava and sugarcane for bioethanol, and oil palm for biodiesel-were selected for the assessment based on land expansion and displacement scenarios. Cultivation was found to be the most water intensive phase in producing both biodiesel and bioethanol. Thus, the proposed index was applied for assessing and selecting areas having low values of the water scarcity footprint. The results showed low values for expanding oil palm plantations on abandoned land and displacing plantation areas with low yields of maize and pineapple with sugarcane and cassava. Additionally, shifting the crop calendar could be considered to reduce the stress situation such as the central region can avoid the water scarcity footprint by 38% from shifting sugarcane cultivation. Consequently mitigating this potential impact and threats to the ecosystem based on specific circumstances and context would be achieved through applying the proposed index in water resource and land suitability planning. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - In this paper we provide an assessment of the water–energy nexus for Greece. More specifically, the amount of freshwater consumed per unit of energy produced is determined: for both conventional (lignite, diesel and fuel oil-fired) and advanced (combined operation of gas turbine) thermal power plants in the electricity generation sector; for extraction and refining activities in the primary energy production sector; and for the production of biodiesel that is used as a blend in the ultimately delivered automotive diesel fuel. In addition, the amount of electricity consumed for the purposes of water supply and sewerage is presented. In view of the expected effects of climate change in the Mediterranean region, the results of this study highlight the need for authorities to prepare a national strategy that will ensure climate resilience in both energy and water sectors of the country. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Bio-oil is the main product of biomass pyrolysis, which is considered as a promising replacing fuel for fossil oil. But the high oxygen, high viscosity, low heat value and poor stability of bio-oil make it difficult to apply directly. Thus study on the improvement of bio-oil quality is very necessary. Different mass fractions (5%~25%) of methanol, ethanol, octanol and its two mixed alcohols were used to improve the heavy oil quality which was pyrolysed from pine nut. The physical and chemical properties and storage time of heavy oil with alcohol additive were investigated. The results showed that the addition of alcohol additives could significantly reduce the viscosity, water content and pH value of heavy oil, and enhance its heat value. Simultaneously, the contents of phenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ketones in the heavy oil were decreased, and the contents of aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and alcohols were increased. The heavy oil adding mixed alcohol showed a better stability, and its viscosity and water content were only increased slightly after 56 d. After adding methyl-octanol mixture and stored for 56 d, the viscosity of the heavy oil was 980 mPa·s, and water content was 21.02%. The growth rate was only a half of the original heavy oil. With the increase of methyl-octanol mixture additive amount, the heat value of heavy oil was increased. When the addition amount was 25%, the heat value was 32.66 MJ/kg. However, it was found that the combustion performance was the best when adding 20% of methyl-octanol mixture; the weight loss rate of combustion section was the largest and the amount of ash after combustion was minimal. © 2017, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

AB  - Biofuels play an important role as alternate fuel in diesel engines. In this paper, alcohol fumigation on a constant speed single-cylinder diesel engine is experimentally investigated. Fumigation is a method by which volatile fuels are injected into the intake manifold. Previously carburation and injection arrangements have been used for fumigation. In this work, computer control injection using LabVIEW software is attempted for alcohol fumigation and common rail is used to inject at same pressure always. Ethanol and methanol at different rates are used as fumigation fuels. The performance and emission characteristics are studied with and without fumigation. Fumigation increases specific fuel consumption (SFC), carbon monoxide emission and hydrocarbon emission. Fumigation decreases brake thermal efficiency at low load, carbon dioxide and smoke. Fumigation increases SFC at medium and high load conditions. The results show that fumigation replaces diesel up to a certain percentage and reduces both nitrogen oxides and smoke. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The bioCRACK process is a promising technology for the production of second generation biofuels. During this process, biomass is pyrolized in vacuum gas oil and converted into gaseous, liquid and solid products. In cooperation with the Graz University of Technology, the liquid phase pyrolysis process was investigated by BDI – BioEnergy International AG at an industrial pilot plant, fully integrated in the OMV refinery in Vienna/Schwechat. The influence of various biogenous feedstocks and the influence of the temperature on the product distribution in the temperature range of 350°C to 390°C was studied. It was shown that the temperature has a major impact on the product formation. With rising temperature, the fraction of liquid products, namely liquid CHO-products, reaction water and hydrocarbons, increases and the fraction of biochar decreases. At 390°C, 39.8 wt% of biogenous carbon was transferred into a crude hydrocarbon fractions. The type of lignocellulosic feedstock has a minor impact on the process. The biomass liquefaction concept of the bioCRACK process was in pilot scale compatible with oil refinery processes. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Polyoxymethylene dimethyl ethers (PODEn) are promising alternative biofuels with high cetane number and oxygen content. In this study, effects of PODE3-4 addition to diesel on the macroscopic spray characteristics were studied in a constant volume spray chamber under different injection pressures. The engine performance and emission characteristics of n-butanol/PODE3-4/diesel blends were investigated in a diesel engine under high injection pressures. The results indicate that the spray penetration of BD20 or PD20 was greater than that of D100; the addition of PODE3-4 to BD20 led to a further increase of the spray penetration without significant effects on the spray cone angle. Under an equal fuel injection pressure, the combustion of BD20 showed the greatest Maximum Pressure Rise rate (MPRR), which decreased after the addition of PODE3-4 to the blend. The soot and NOx emissions of BD20 were lower than that of pure diesel. Compared with BD20, the reduction of CO and HC emissions from the combustion of BDP20 were as high as 45.65% and 28.24%, respectively. The soot, NOx, CO and HC emissions of BDP20 were all lower than that of PD20. As the fuel injection pressure increased, a decreasing trend was observed in the number concentration as well as in the mass concentration of total particles. The lowest particle emissions in terms of total particle mass concentration were found for BDP20, followed by PD20, BD20 and D100. The ratio of sub-50 nm particles to total particles was highest for BD20 regardless of the injection pressure, and its value decreased upon adding PODE3-4 to BD20. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the spray and combustion phenomena of biodiesels were investigated in a constant volume combustion chamber (CVCC). Mineral diesel was used as a baseline fuel and biodiesels derived from waste cooking oil, Karanja oil, and Jatropha oil were utilized to investigate the effect of fuel properties on spray and combustion processes. Experiments were performed at high temperature and pressure conditions in order to simulate the atmospheric environment of a diesel engines. Test fuels were injected at an injection pressure of 80 MPa using a common-rail equipped solenoid injector. Macroscopic evaporation characteristics were analyzed by high-speed shadowgraphy technique under evaporating conditions. The representative droplet size distribution and Sauter mean diameter (SMD) were measured using the Phase Doppler Interferometry (PDI) technique, which was applied to study the spray atomization characteristics of the fuels. The air-fuel equivalence ratio in the spray was calculated using mathematical correlations. The quantitative estimations of soot generation in the spray flames were compared using Hue number analysis. From the shadowgraphy images, the biodiesels showed slower air-fuel mixing characteristics than the baseline diesel due to their inferior volatility. While diesel evaporated abruptly after the fuel injection, the biodiesels showed dense liquid regions in the center of the spray plume. Biodiesels also exhibited larger SMD than the baseline mineral diesel in the fuel spray because of their higher density, viscosity, and surface tension. Despite having poor spray atomization characteristics, the calculated equivalence ratio of biodiesels was lower than that of the baseline diesel. This trend was attributed to the oxygen content of biodiesel. The flame luminosity and visible spray flame duration of biodiesels were lower than those of diesel, while the biodiesel spray flames exhibited lower sooting tendency than the baseline diesel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Macaw palm is regarded as one of the most promising alternative raw materials for the production of oil for biofuels and other uses. The potential yield up to 6000 kg of oil per hectare, and the quality of the oil, makes it a suitable feedstock for biofuel production, whether for biodiesel or bio-kerosene. The diversification of oilseed crops consists in a goal not only for Brazil, but for many Latin American countries. While the palm oil is an important component of the food industry, it is not expected a significant destination of macaw palm oil for this purpose. Hence, its deployment for energy production would not compete directly with food production. Additionally, in comparison with oil palm, macaw palm has the advantage of a broader geographical distribution, being suitable for cultivation in different regions. However, in order to exploit this potential, a few short and long-term challenges must be overcome. In the short term, productivity gains are possible through improvements on fruit processing, which positively reflect on the quantity and quality of the oil extracted both from the pulp and the kernel. Moreover, properly characterization and study of all co-products in the chain is required, aiming at add value to the fractions and increase the efficiency of the process. Medium to long-term approaches include the development of new varieties of the palm need through a broad genomic selection for different regions, as a component of the domestication process. In a scenario of cultivation, the adoption of agroforestry systems should be studied and encouraged, though both food and energy can be produced at the same area, in a more sustainable way. Long term studies are also required to assess socio-economic and environmental impacts of different exploitation systems of macaw palm, whether through extractive activities or cultivation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The need for liquid fuels in the transportation sector is increasing, and it is essential to develop industrially sustainable processes that simultaneously address the tri-fold sustainability metrics of technological feasibility, economic viability, and environmental impacts. Biorefineries based on lignocellulosic feedstocks could yield high-value products such as ethyl acetate, dodecane, ethylene, and hexane. This work focuses on assessing biochemical and biomass to electricity platforms for conversion of Banagrass and Energycane into valuable fuels and chemicals using the tri-fold sustainability metrics. Results: The production cost of various products produced from Banagrass was $1.19/kg ethanol, $1.00/kg ethyl acetate, $3.01/kg dodecane (jet fuel equivalent), $2.34/kg ethylene and $0.32/kW-h electricity. The production cost of different products using Energycane as a feedstock was $1.31/kg ethanol, $1.11/kg ethyl acetate, $3.35/kg dodecane, and $2.62/kg ethylene. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the price of the main product, feedstock cost and cost of ethanol affected the profitability the overall process. Banagrass yielded 11% higher ethanol compared to Energycane, which could be attributed to the differences in the composition of these lignocellulosic biomass sources. Acidification potential was highest when ethylene was produced at the rate of 2.56 × 10-2 and 1.71 × 10-2 kg SO2 eq. for Banagrass and Energycane, respectively. Ethanol production from Banagrass and Energycane resulted in a global warming potential of - 12.3 and - 40.0 g CO2 eq./kg ethanol. Conclusions: Utilizing hexoses and pentoses from Banagrass to produce ethyl acetate was the most economical scenario with a payback period of 11.2 years and an ROI of 8.93%, respectively. Electricity production was the most unprofitable scenario with an ROI of - 29.6% using Banagrass/Energycane as a feedstock that could be attributed to high feedstock moisture content. Producing ethylene or dodecane from either of the feedstocks was not economical. The moisture content and composition of biomasses affected overall economics of the various pathways studied. Producing ethanol and ethyl acetate from Energycane had a global warming potential of - 3.01 kg CO2 eq./kg ethyl acetate. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Influence of catalyst calcination temperature on the catalyst characteristics and catalytic transesterification of Jatropha curcas oil for biodiesel production was studied by using sodium zirconate (Na2ZrO3) solid base catalyst. Na2ZrO3 catalysts were prepared by impregnation method followed by calcination at temperatures of 700, 800, and 900°C. The prepared catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Important parameters influencing the catalytic activity and fatty acid methyl ester yield were investigated. It was found that the increase in calcination temperature showed marked increase in activity due to the increased porosity and presence of tetragonal zirconia. Investigation of the reusability of the catalysts showed that the catalytic activity was retained even after five cycles of reaction. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: The light/dark cycle is one of the most important factors affecting the microalgal growth and lipid accumulation. Biomass concentration and lipid productivity could be enhanced by optimization of light/dark cycles, and this is considered an effective control strategy for microalgal cultivation. Currently, most research on effects of light/dark cycles on algae is carried out under autotrophic conditions and little information is about the effects under mixotrophic cultivation. At the same time, many studies related to mixotrophic cultivation of microalgal strains, even at large scale, have been performed to obtain satisfactory biomass and lipid production. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate cellular metabolism under autotrophic and mixotrophic conditions at different light/dark cycles. Even though microalgal lipid production under optimal environmental factors has been reported by some researchers, the light/dark cycle and temperature are regarded as separate parameters in their studies. In practical cases, light/dark cycling and temperature variation during the day occur simultaneously. Therefore, studies about the combined effects of light/dark cycles and temperature variation on microalgal lipid production are of practical value, potentially providing significant guidelines for large-scale microalgal cultivation under natural conditions. Results: In this work, cell growth and lipid accumulation of an oleaginous microalgal mutant, Scenedesmus sp. Z-4, were investigated at five light/dark cycles (0 h/24 h, 8 h/16 h, 12 h/12 h, 16 h/8 h, and 24 h/0 h) in batch culture. The results showed that the optimal light/dark cycle was 12 h/12 h, when maximum lipid productivity rates of 56.8 and 182.6 mg L-1 day-1 were obtained under autotrophic and mixotrophic cultivation, respectively. Poor microalgal growth and lipid accumulation appeared in the light/dark cycles of 0 h/24 h and 24 h/0 h under autotrophic condition. Prolonging the light duration was unfavorable to the production of chlorophyll a and b, which was mainly due to photooxidation effect. Polysaccharide was converted into lipid and protein when the light irradiation time increased from 0 to 12 h; however, further increasing irradiation time had a negative effect on lipid accumulation. Due to the dependence of autotrophically cultured cells on light energy, the light/dark cycle has a more remarkable influence on cellular metabolism under autotrophic conditions. Furthermore, the combined effects of temperature variation and light/dark cycle of 12 h/12 h on cell growth and lipid accumulation of microalgal mutant Z-4 were investigated under mixotrophic cultivation, and the results showed that biomass was mainly produced at higher temperatures during the day, and a portion of biomass was converted into lipid under dark condition. Conclusions: The extension of irradiation time was beneficial to biomass accumulation, but not in favor of lipid production. Even though effects of light/dark cycles on autotrophic and mixotrophic cells were not exactly the same, the optimal lipid productivities of Scenedesmus sp. Z-4 under both cultivation conditions were achieved at the light/dark of 12 h/12 h. This may be attributed to its long-term acclimation in natural environment. By combining temperature variation with optimal light/dark cycle of 12 h/12 h, this study will be of great significance for practical microalgae-biodiesel production in the outdoor conditions. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - In this study, a multi-objective optimization of sustainable integration of algal biofuel production using nutrient recycling technology, such as anaerobic digestion and hydrothermal liquefaction, is considered. Gross annual profitability and global warming potential (GWP) are the criteria chosen for the design of the algal biofuel production system. Three scenarios, such as full-scale (baseline), pilot-scale (conservative), and lab-scale (nominal), are chosen based on the expected maturity levels and nutrient demand. The results of the optimization produce Pareto sets of optimal solutions for acknowledging the trade-off between the economic and the environmental criteria of the integrated system. It is found that the anaerobic digestion (AD) technology shows better performance in terms of an environmental perspective, displacing the excessive fertilizer requirements due to its maturity in comparison with the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) process. However, HTL is a new, evolving, promising nutrient recycling technology which demonstrates economic preferences compared to the AD process due to its low cost of production. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, Botryococcus braunii algal oil has been converted into methyl ester with the aid of transesterification reaction. The samples B20 were prepared for each methyl ester obtained from Botryococcus braunii algal oil separately and then the cerium oxide nanoparticles were added to each B20 blend sample at the dosages of 50, 75, and 100 ppm with the aid of an ultrasonicator. Moreover, in the absence of any engine modifications, the emission characteristics of those blend samples have been investigated from the experimentally measured engine exhaust emissions of CO, CO2, O2, NO, and UHC. The experimental results reveal that the use of biodiesel blend with nano additives in diesel engine has exhibited a reduction in exhaust emissions. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This work compares the experimental results of the effects of drilled shale on the formulated oil-in-water emulsion drilling mud using biodiesel produced from waste vegetable oil (WVO) with white oil 5# at 140 °C. The concentration of drilled shale with particle sizes distribution between 80 and 100 mesh was varied from 0 to 16 wt./vol.%. The plastic viscosity, yield point, thixotropy, high-temperature–high-pressure (HTHP) filtration loss, coefficient of friction, and rate of drilled cuttings recovery were assessed. The biodiesel-in-water emulsion drilling mud (BEDM) exhibited better rheological behavior and stability compared to white oil-in-water emulsion drilling mud (WEDM) under the different conditions examined. BEDM demonstrated the lowest HTHP filtration volume with values ranging from 6 to13 cm3 compared to WEDM with 9–18 cm3 and water-based mud (WBM) of 12–25 cm3. Moreover, coefficients of friction of BEDM, WEDM, and WBM were 0.26, 0.35, and 0.75, respectively.

AB  - Biorefinery systems at combined heat and power (CHP) plants represent numerous technical, economic and environmental benefits by utilizing the existing biomass handling infrastructure and producing biofuels together with heat and power. This study evaluates the economic feasibility of integrating biomass gasification to an existing CHP plant. Integration includes biomass gasification with downstream processing of the synthesis gas to remove particles and tars, condense out water, remove CO2 and use membrane filtration (polyamide membrane) to extract hydrogen. The separated residual gas components are utilized as extra fuel to the boiler in the CHP plant. Approximately 58.5 MWth of synthesis gas can be produced from a 90 MWth plant that represents 16.4 MWth of hydrogen. The rest of the heating value of produced synthesis gas (in the form of methane and carbon monoxide) is utilized for heat and power production. From an economic perspective, the production cost of hydrogen is estimated to be 0.125–0.75 €/kg. This can be compared to the US governments goal that H2 produced by wind power plus electrolyzers should have a maximum cost of 2.8–3.4 €/kg. The lower cost is for a unit operating at 3 bar and assuming that the costs are split between H2 and the syngas residue that is combusted, while the higher prices assume an atmospheric gasifier and all costs are put on the H2 produced. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Depleting non-renewable energy sources combined with stringent environmental norms necessitate researchers to search for alternative energy sources. Hydrogen (H2) is one of the most promising alternatives if produced, stored and harnessed properly. Biomass derived bio-oil extracted through fast pyrolysis is an alternative source for sustainable H2 generation via the reforming process. This review summarizes recent work done in the field of H2 generation using steam reforming of bio-oil and the influence of operating parameters such as temperature, S/C ratio and type of catalyst used. Other than steam reforming, several other reforming techniques, such as oxidative steam reforming, aqueous phase reforming and partial oxidation, have also been discussed. Various catalytic systems with Ni, Pt and Ru on different supports have been investigated. Coke deposition on the catalyst surface over a long period of operation is the major shortcoming for reforming reaction which lowers the catalytic activity and requires frequent regeneration. Use of additives like MgO, K, Ca and addition of a small amount of O2 reduces coke formation as well as increases the catalytic activity. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Drawing on the literature on the market and normative power of the EU, we document and explain the limited success of the EU in transferring its environmental standards with respect to sustainable biofuels governance to the world's two largest biofuels producers – the US and Brazil – and to two international standard setting organizations, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the Global Bioenergy Partnership (GBEP). Our explanation highlights four factors: first, the extent to which EU strategies to strengthen its market power can undermine its normative power; second, the limits to EU policy influence posed by other actors' use of their own market and normative power resources; third, the diminished influence of a late policy-mover; and fourth, the difficulty of establishing normative leadership in a policy field subject to epistemic contestation. © 2017 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The internal turbulent flow and cavitation flow of the nozzle have effect on the fuel spray and atomization of diesel engine, and especially they have a great impact on the process of primary atomization. Biodiesel is a kind of renewable alternative fuel of diesel. Previous studies have shown that biodiesel has higher density, viscosity and surface tension. Compared with diesel, biodiesel is less likely to generate cavitation flow inside nozzle. Therefore, this paper intends to add ethanol to biodiesel so as to improve cavitation flow of biodiesel in nozzle and advance biodiesel atomization. The geometry of the actual nozzle is very small and visual experimental research on full-size jet nozzle is relatively difficult. Therefore, in this paper, the effects of the fuel properties on the internal flow characteristics of nozzle were studied by computational simulation approaches. A three-dimensional nozzle model was created by GAMBIT, in which, pressure distribution, velocity distribution and cavitation distribution of diesel, biodiesel and biodiesel/ethanol blended fuel in nozzle were simulated with the mixture multiphase model of FLUENT. During the simulation, for validating the mixture multiphase model, turbulence model and cavity model, the comparison between visual experiment and computational simulation results of diesel cavitation area was carried out under different injection pressures. These models were confirmed to be effective. The simulation results show that the pressure drops rapidly at the joint connecting the pressure chamber and nozzle entrance, and the pressure tends to be stable after entering the nozzle, while the pressure increases slightly near nozzle exit. The pressure decline range of biodiesel is the greatest. Compared with diesel, the pressure of biodiesel reduces by 23.91% at the different cross section of nozzle. The pressure decline range is comparable between diesel fuel and biodiesel/ethanol blended fuel. The fuel flow velocity increases rapidly at the entrance of the nozzle, and the flow velocity rises slowly after entering the nozzle, while the fuel flow velocity slightly decreases near the nozzle exit. From the nozzle center to the nozzle periphery, the fuel flow velocity gradually reduces owing to viscous force of the nozzle wall. At the different cross sections of the nozzle, the flow velocity of diesel is the fastest and its flow velocity reaches 229.8 m/s at the nozzle outlet. The flow velocity of biodiesel/ethanol blended fuel is slower than that of diesel and its flow velocity is 223.1 m/s at the nozzle outlet, while the flow velocity of biodiesel is the slowest among the 3 kinds of fuels, and its flow velocity is 214.9 m/s at the nozzle outlet. The cavitation first occurs at the corner of the nozzle entrance, and then it develops to nozzle exit and gradually weakens. At the different sections of nozzle, the gas volume fraction of diesel is the greatest and that of biodiesel is the smallest. The gas volume fraction of biodiesel drops on the average by 11.1% compared with that of diesel and the cavitation of biodiesel is relatively weaker than that of diesel. However, the gas volume fraction of biodiesel/ethanol blended fuel is nearly comparable with that of diesel and there is only 1.8% difference between blended fuel and diesel fuel. Adding ethanol to biodiesel can reduce fuel density, viscosity and surface tension, improve fuel flow characteristics and promote the cavitation of biodiesel in the nozzle. The cavitation in the nozzle can provide initial disturbance for the circular jet spray and promote fuel atomization. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - The one-step hydrotreatment of rubber seed oil to produce hydrocarbon fuels has been carried out via supported Pd-catalyst, and analyzed emphatically some elements affected catalytic cracking process, for example, temperature, hydrogen partial pressure and dosage of catalyst, etc. Through experimental research, the author found out the appropriate catalytic cracking conditions as follows: 310°C of reaction temperature, 2 MPa of hydrogen partial pressure, 15 of the ratio of oil to catalyst (m(oil)/m(catalyst)), 100 r/min of stirring speed. Under these conditions, effective component of hydrocarbon fuels in the converted oil accounts for 99.49%, and the proportion of C8-C16 can reach as high as 79.61%. The converted oil was similar to petroleum-based oil in chemical composition, and can be used for future the aviation biofuels development as the source of raw material because it contains a large amount of hydrocarbon in the range of C8-C16. © 2017, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - The application of biocatalysts in the transesterification process of triglycerides (TG) allows integrating the glycerol in the form of monoglyceride (MG), sharply increasing the yield and the environmental sustainability of the conventional biodiesel production process. This is known as Ecodiesel. To overcome the inconvenient of the high cost of the currently employed highly purified commercial enzymes, the use of scarcely purified extracts obtained from standard strains of the same species of commercial lipases currently applied in this process is being investigated. Thus, Candida antarctica type B (CALB) was chosen to determine the optimal conditions of culture of this yeast. The standard strain was obtained from the Spanish Type Microbial Cultures Collection (CECT) and has been used to carry out several studies to elucidate its optimum growth conditions. Through a process of lyophilization with prior dialysis of the liquid cultures, the enzymatic extracts were obtained. The different obtained cultures have been applied as biocatalysts in the 1,3-selective transesterification reaction of sunflower oil with ethanol to obtain Ecodiesel (FAEE + MG). Selectivity and reaction yields were obtained by gas chromatography. Acceptable yields are obtained during the reaction time as well as in successive reactions, demonstrating the feasibility of using these CALB enzymatic extracts as biocatalysts. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Emission of CH4 from landfills is a major cause of concern as CH4 is twenty four times more potent than CO2, as a greenhouse gas. However, landfills also harbor a group of bacteria called methanotrophs, which can oxidize CH4. They can be used for in situ bioremediation to reduce methane emissions. They can also be used for production of methanol or renewable diesel, utilizing methane in natural gas or biogas. Methanotrophs are a subgroup of methylotrophs. We used molecular techniques for detection of methylotrophs in samples from a landfill in New Delhi. We could detect five methylotrophs. Isolation and efficiency in methanotrophy of these bacteria is undergoing now. © 2017 Global NEST Printed in Greece. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesels and biomass EtOH are currently considered the most applicable and essential biomass fuels. Furthermore, MeOH and BuOH are also attracting attention as alternatives. These fuel types can be used to reduce exhaust emissions from gasoline engines because they are renewable oxygenated bioresources. Three biofuel additives, namely, MeOH (10%, M10), EtOH (10%, E10), and BuOH (10%, B10) were used to compare the engine performance properties and exhaust gas emission levels upon combustion of mixed biomass fuels and pure petroleum fuel (clean unleaded gasoline, E0). The engine combustion temperature dropped by 4.32%, O2 emission increased by 6.67%, NOx emissions decreased by 13.46%, CO emission decreased by 44%, and hydrocarbon emissions fell by 29% if biomass fuels were used. Therefore, mixed biofuel additives and gasoline could substantially reduce engine exhaust emissions, including oxides of C and N, hydrocarbons, etc., because the biofuels contain higher oxygen contents that facilitate complete combustion. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Like many small island states, a number of Pacific Island countries (PICs) have ambitious renewable energy programmes in place. In some cases, the programmes include the objective of electricity generated from “100% renewable energy” by 2020 or 2025. The motivations for these ambitious programmes are commendable: to reduce dependency on imported oil fuels and to be seen to contribute towards reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The paper reviews renewable electricity generation policy and programmes in four PICs – Cook Islands, Niue, Tonga and Tuvalu – and implementation of the programmes to date. To illustrate the broader relevance of the issue, these programmes are compared with those of Maldives and Seychelles. Concerns identified include the ambitious goals and almost total reliance on solar photo-voltaic (PV) technology to supply electricity in small and remote islands. Our central argument is that dependency on oil imports will be replaced with dependency on technical support given the complex nature of PV technology compared with diesel particularly where high PV fractions are proposed. The lack of interest in biofuel, particularly coconut oil, is seen as a missed opportunity to use an endogenous energy resource that could form a useful part of the renewable energy mix. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Co-pyrolysis characteristics of bio-oil distillation residue and bituminous coal were investigated through thermogravimetric analysis coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (TGA-FTIR). The addition of bituminous coal changed the behaviors and kinetics of pyrolysis reaction. With temperature increasing, synergistic effects rapidly increased at relatively low temperatures, and then kept a decreasing tendency with different rates until a relatively steady state. The results of the quantitative analysis of chemical functional group by the peak area of infrared spectroscopy indicated that the addition of bituminous coal had a positive effect on the production of CO2 and CO, and a negative effect on the functional groups containing C–H, C[dbnd]C and C–O bond. The co-pyrolysis mechanism and kinetics parameters were calculated by the Coats-Redfern and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa method, suggesting that the activation energy and the reaction order of co-pyrolysis increased with mixing ratio increasing in main step. The lowest activation energy (73.17 kJ/mol by Coast-Redfern method and 71.46 kJ/mol by Flynn-Wall-Ozawa method) was obtained by blending 20 wt% bituminous coal. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst, which was prepared by in situ temperature-programmed reduction and in the mixture with the inert (SiC, SiO2) or acidic (γ-Al2O3) material was studied in methyl palmitate hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). Methyl palmitate HDO was carried out at temperatures of 270–330 °C, H2/feed volume ratio of 600 Nm3/m3, and H2 pressure of 3.0 MPa. Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst, diluted with γ-Al2O3 showed a higher activity than Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst diluted with SiC or SiO2. The conversion of methyl palmitate increased significantly in the presence of γ-Al2O3 most probably due to the acceleration of the acid-catalyzed reaction of ester hydrolysis. The synergism of Ni2P/SiO2 and γ-Al2O3 in methyl palmitate HDO can be explained by the cooperation of the metal sites of Ni2P/SiO2 and the acid sites of γ-Al2O3 in consecutive metal-catalyzed and acid-catalyzed reactions of HDO. The obtained results let us conclude that the balancing of metal and acid sites plays an important role in the development of the efficient catalyst for the HDO of fatty acid esters over supported phosphide catalysts. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - The unprecedented use of fossil fuels necessitates the research community to find clean, safe, renewable and sustainable energy source. One such promising source is microalgal biofuel, which can mitigate the environmental concerns and energy crisis due to its closed carbon cycle. Selection of proper strain and optimization of the culture conditions to maximize the lipid productivity is very important for successful economical biodiesel conversion process. One such robust halophilic species identified was Aphanothece halophytica with rich lipid productivity. They were cultivated in different media and optimized on lab scale as well as in large scale using raceway ponds to produce sufficient biomass for algal oil extraction. The biodiesel conversion process parameters were then optimized by multi-variant response surface methodology (RSM). The free fatty acid (FFA) content of the raw algal oil was only 0.51% which enables direct conversion by transesterification. Eco-friendly, natural white clam shell was calcinated to obtain CaO, which was recovered and reused for three times effectively. The maximum biodiesel yield of around 99 vol% was obtained for the oil/methanol ratio of 0.32(v/v) using calcinated CaO for 6 wt% of raw feed while stirring at 400 rpm at a temperature of 70 °C for 85 min. The GC–MS analysis of the algal biodiesel confirmed the presence of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in balanced proportion to provide better oxidation stability and good combustion characteristics. Other biodiesel properties were analyzed and found to be within the standards specified by EN and ASTM for automotive application without any engine modification. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The objective of present study is to evaluate the combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of refined biodiesel (biofuel) such as rubber seed oil methyl ester with the partial addition of n-butanol (butanol) in it in a single cylinder four stroke diesel engine operated at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. Various characteristics of butanol–rubber seed oil methyl ester blends with varying volume percentage of butanol such as 5, 10, 15, and 20 in butanol–rubber seed oil methyl ester blends were compared with the characteristics of neat rubber seed oil methyl ester (100%) and neat diesel (100%) at various load conditions on engine (such as 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) for the compression ratio 18. It is found that brake specific fuel consumption was increased by 17% with an increase in butanol content from 5% to 20% in butanol–rubber seed oil methyl ester blends at full load condition. Brake thermal efficiency was decreased by 14% with an increase in butanol content from 5% to 20% in butanol–rubber seed oil methyl ester blends at full load condition. Carbon monoxide and HC emissions were found to be negligible, i.e. less than 0.1% and 35 ppm, respectively, for all selected fuels. NOx emissions were decreased by 10% with an increase in butanol content from 5% to 20% in butanol–rubber seed oil methyl ester blends at full load condition. Various characteristics were compared for six fuels (neat rubber seed oil methyl ester, four renewable butanol–rubber seed oil methyl ester blends, and neat diesel) in order to finalize the promising alternate sustainable renewable fuel in place of shortly diminishing conventional diesel fuel in order to provide the solution for increase in demand and price of conventional fuel (diesel) for power generation and to reduce the serious issues concerned with environmental pollution due to usage of neat diesel. © 2017, © IMechE 2017.

AB  - Two important problems for the food industry are oil oxidation and oil waste after frying. Sunflower seed oil is one of the vegetable oils most commonly used in the food industry. Two variables were applied to the low oleic sunflower seed oil in this work i.e. heating temperature (180-210-240℃ and time of heating (15-30-60-120 minutes, to study from the edible point of view the variations of its physico-chemical properties. After 120 minutes heating at 240°C the following was found: refractive index (1.476, free acidity (0.35%, K232 (2.87, K270 (3.71, antiradical activity (45.90% inhibition, total phenols (523 mg kg–1, peroxide value (17.00 meq kg–1, p-anisidine value (256.8 and Totox (271.7, all of which showed a constant deterioration. In relation to the use as a feedstock for bio-diesel production, after 120 minutes heating at 240℃ the following was found: acid value 0.70 mg KOH g–1 oil, iodine value 117.83 g I2 100 g–1 oil, oil stability index 0.67 h, kinematic viscosity (at 40℃ 77.85 mm2 s–1, higher heating value 39.86 MJ kg–1, density 933.34 kg/m3 and cetane number 67.04. The parameters studied in this work were influenced, in different ways, by the applied variables. Heating temperature between 180 and 210℃ and 120 min heating duration were found to be the most appropriate conditions for sunflower seed oil both from the deep frying point of view and from a subsequent use as feedstock for bio-diesel production. In light of the vegetable oils’ International standards for an edible use and for a bio-diesel production, findings of this work can be used to set heating temperature and heating duration to preserve as long possible the physico-chemical properties of a low oleic sunflower seed oil for both its edible use as a fat during cooking and for its re-use after frying. © 2017 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - To enhance the yield of alkyl levulinates, a mixed-acid catalyst system consisting of CrCl3 and H3PO4 was investigated for the transformation of furfuryl alcohol (FA). The CrCl3-H3PO4 system exhibited a positive synergistic catalytic activity for the synthesis of alkyl levulinates, which was especially obvious for n-butyl levulinate (BL) synthesis. The strongest synergic effect of mixed-acid system for BL production was achieved at the CrCl3 molar ratio of 0.3 (based on total moles of CrCl3 and H3PO4). Furthermore, the mixed-acid systems consisting of Cr-salts combined with H3PO4 and its salts in catalyzing FA conversion to BL were evaluated, and the evolution process of FA to produce BL was explored in the presence of CrCl3-H3PO4, sole CrCl3, and sole H3PO4. A possible synergistic catalytic pathway of CrCl3 combined with H3PO4 was proposed. Finally, the key process variables were examined. Under optimal conditions, a high BL yield of 95% was achieved from 99% FA conversion catalyzed by the synergy of CrCl3 and H3PO4.

AB  - Phenolic antioxidants have limited solubility in biodiesel, so this research developed new antioxidants by addition of hydroquinone and catechol on unsaturated fatty acid esters, which improved significantly the oxidative stability of rapeseed biodiesel. This new compound class is more soluble in biodiesel than hydroquinone and catechol, in same molar concentrations. The aging of biodiesel was studied using Metrohm model 743 Rancimat and PetroOxy devices and it was possible to observe an improvement on oxidation stability in both testing using these new antioxidants. Especially the additives 2MB3 and 4MB3 improved the induction period (IP) of rapeseed methyl ester (RME-B100), from 4 to 63 and 65 h, respectively, with 30 mmol/kg of additives, while hydroquinone in comparison improves the stability to 25 h in the same molar concentration. This new class of antioxidants is promising to enhance oxidative stability of biodiesel, showing the capability of such additives to be commercialized for this purpose. Practical applications: Biodiesel is obtained by different raw materials, so the composition is different according to the source. The biodiesel with higher amounts of unsaturated fatty acids is more susceptible to oxidation than those with higher saturation. To solve problems caused by oxidative deterioration of biodiesel, this research aimed to synthesize a new class of antioxidants as an alternative for preventing and minimize oxidative damage of biofuels. Rapeseed biodiesel without any addition of additive was out of specification according to EN 14214, which regulates oxidative stability greater or equal to 8 h. The additives herein obtained improved significantly the oxidation stability for rapeseed biodiesel by more than 100%. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate how the combination of extraction parameters, such as extraction temperature seeds preheating and screw rotation speed, influenced the yield and chemical quality of tobacco seed oil (TSO). For its peculiar properties, TSO can be used for several purposes, as raw material in the manufacturing of soap, paints, resins, lubricants, biofuels and also as edible oil. TSO was obtained using a mechanical screw press and the quality of the oil was evaluated by monitoring the free fatty acids (FFA), the peroxide value (PV), the spectroscopic indices K232, K270 and ΔK and the fatty acid composition. The maximum extraction yield, expressed as percent of oil mechanically extracted respect to the oil content in the seeds, determined by solvent extraction, was obtained with the combination of the highest extraction temperature, the slowest screw rotation speed and seeds preheating. Under these conditions yield was 80.28 ± 0.33% (w/w), 25% higher than the lowest yield obtained among investigated conditions. The extraction temperature and seed preheating showed a significant effect on FFA, on spectroscopic indices K232, K270 and ΔK values. The average values of these parameters slightly increased rising the temperature and in presence of preheating, the screw rotation speed did not affect the chemical characteristic tested. In the extraction conditions investigated no significant changes in PV and fatty acids composition of oil were observed. © 2017, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).

AB  - Two fungi from the genus Moniliella and Byssochlamys were isolated and identified from a water contaminated B20 biodiesel blend. The Moniliella and Byssochlamys isolates were able to metabolize both biodiesel and petroleum diesel individually. Further investigations with Moniliella wahieum Y12T grown using blended fuels as the carbon substrate show that the degradation of ULSD was enhanced by 33.3% when blended with 5% biodiesel. This amount decreased to 11.1% when blended with 20% biodiesel. This is the first report describing an enhanced ULSD degradation rate that was increased through a cometabolic processes induced by biodiesel using Moniliella wahieum Y12T. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance, emission and combustion characteristics of a four-cylinder common-rail turbocharged diesel engine fuelled with Jatropha curcas biodiesel-diesel blends. A kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM) model is developed in this study using MATLAB software in order to predict the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of the engine. To acquire the data for training and testing the KELM model, the engine speed was selected as the input parameter, whereas the performance, exhaust emissions and combustion characteristics were chosen as the output parameters of the KELM model. The performance, emissions and combustion characteristics predicted by the KELM model were validated by comparing the predicted data with the experimental data. The results show that the coefficient of determination of the parameters is within a range of 0.9805–0.9991 for both the KELM model and the experimental data. The mean absolute percentage error is within a range of 0.1259–2.3838. This study shows that KELM modelling is a useful technique in biodiesel production since it facilitates scientists and researchers to predict the performance, exhaust emissions and combustion characteristics of internal combustion engines with high accuracy. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - The present study deals with performance, emission and combustion studies in a single cylinder CI engine with lower and higher alcohol fuel synergies with biofuel blends and exhaust treatment system. Karanja oil methyl ester (KOME), widely available biofuel in India, and orange oil (ORG), a low carbon biofuel, were taken for this study, and equal volume blend was prepared for testing. Methanol (M) and n-pentanol (P) was taken as lower and higher alcohol and blended 20% by volume with KOME-ORG blend. Activated carbon-based exhaust treatment indigenous system was designed and tested with KOME-ORG + M20 and KOME-ORG + P20 blend. The tests were carried out at various load conditions at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. The study revealed that considering performance, emission and combustion studies, KOME-ORG + M20 + activated carbon are found optimum in reducing NO, smoke and CO2 emission. Compared to KOME, for KOME-ORG + M20 + activated carbon, NO emission is reduced from 10.25 to 7.85 g/kWh, the smoke emission is reduced from 49.4 to 28.9%, and CO2 emission is reduced from 1098.84 to 580.68 g/kWh. However, with exhaust treatment system, an increase in HC and CO emissions and reduced thermal efficiency is observed due to backpressure effects. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Epidemiological data indicate that exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) from traffic emissions is associated with higher risk of morbidity and mortality related to cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, accelerated progression of atherosclerotic plaques, and possible lung cancer. While the impact of DEPs from combustion of fossil diesel fuel on human health has been extensively studied, current knowledge of DEPs from combustion of biofuels provides limited and inconsistent information about its mutagenicity and genotoxicity, as well as possible adverse health risks. The objective of the present work was to compare the genotoxicity of DEPs from combustion of two first-generation fuels, 7% fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) (B7) and 20% FAME (B20), and a second-generation 20% FAME/hydrotreated vegetable oil (SHB: synthetic hydrocarbon biofuel) fuel. Our results revealed that particulate engine emissions from each type of biodiesel fuel induced genotoxic effects in BEAS-2B and A549 cells, manifested as the increased levels of single-strand breaks, the increased frequencies of micronuclei, or the deregulated expression of genes involved in DNA damage signaling pathways. We also found that none of the tested DEPs showed the induction of oxidative DNA damage and the gamma-H2AX-detectable double-strand breaks. The most pronounced differences concerning the tested particles were observed for the induction of single-strand breaks, with the greatest genotoxicity being associated with the B7-derived DEPs. The differences in other effects between DEPs from the different biodiesel blend percentage and biodiesel feedstock were also observed, but the magnitude of these variations was limited. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - In many countries, the biofuels sector was encouraged to expand its activities supported by public policies incentives, especially to achieve improvements in energy security and to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. The Brazilian government followed these initiatives and undertook some responsibilities against the international scenario related to climate change. One of the theses commitments concerning actions to reduce the GEE emissions by some 37% by 2020. The Sugarcane Agroecology Zoning provides technical subside to policy makers to direct sugarcane expansion to permitted areas and a sustainable production in Brazil and is considered a guideline to sustainable sugarcane production in Brazil. However, although aiming at a sustainable production, the zoning only considered natural aspects of the country, as soils and climate and an approach that consider all the dimensions of the sustainability is still missing. Hence, this paper aims to propose a framework to evaluate biofuel sustainability to support public policies, especially concerning improvements in Brazilian decision-supporting tools. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L., WOSR) is the major oil crop cultivated in Europe. Rapeseed oil is predominantly used for production of biodiesel. The framework of the European Renewable Energy Directive requires that use of biofuels achieves GHG savings of at least 50% compared to use of fossil fuel starting in 2018. However, N2O field emissions are estimated using emission factors that are not specific for the crop and associated with strong uncertainty. N2O field emissions are controlled by N fertilization and dominate the GHG balance of WOSR cropping due to the high global warming potential of N2O. Thus, field experiments were conducted to increase the data basis and subsequently derive a new WOSR-specific emission factor. N2O emissions and crop yields were monitored for three years over a range of N fertilization intensities at five study sites representative of German WOSR production. N2O fluxes exhibited the typical high spatial and temporal variability in dependence on soil texture, weather and nitrogen availability. The annual N2O emissions ranged between 0.24 kg and 5.48 kg N2O-N ha−1 a−1. N fertilization increased N2O emissions, particularly with the highest N treatment (240 kg N ha−1). Oil yield increased up to a fertilizer amount of 120 kg N ha−1, higher N-doses increased grain yield but decreased oil concentrations in the seeds. Consequently oil yield remained constant at higher N fertilization. Since, yield-related emission also increased exponentially with N surpluses, there is potential for reduction of the N fertilizer rate, which offers perspectives for the mitigation of GHG emissions. Our measurements double the published data basis of annual N2O flux measurements in WOSR. Based on this extended dataset we modeled the relationship between N2O emissions and fertilizer N input using an exponential model. The corresponding new N2O emission factor was 0.6% of applied fertilizer N for a common N fertilizer amount under best management practice in WOSR production (200 kg N ha−1 a−1). This factor is substantially lower than the linear IPCC Tier 1 factor (EF1) of 1.0% and other models that have been proposed. © 2017

AB  - This study laid an emphasis on the possible employment of biochar generated from pyrolysis of chicken manure to establish a green platform for producing biodiesel. To this end, the pseudo-catalytic transesterification reaction using chicken manure biochar and waste cooking oil was investigated. Compared with a commercial porous material (SiO2), chicken manure biochar generated from 350 °C showed better performance, resulting in 95.6% of the FAME yield at 350 °C. The Ca species in chicken manure biochar imparted strong catalytic capability by providing the basicity for transesterification. The identified catalytic effect also led to the thermal cracking of unsaturated FAMEs, which decreased the overall FAME yield. For example, 40–60% of converted FAMEs were thermally degraded. To avoid undesirable thermal cracking arising from the high content of the Ca species in chicken manure biochar, the fabrication of chicken manure biochar at temperatures ≥350 °C was highly recommended. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is an emerging trend of employing bio-derived alternative fuels in automobile and aircraft engines to meet the strict norms of environmental pollution. The present study deals with the impact dynamics of camelina-derived alternative jet fuel drops corresponding to Weber number, We in the range 28–886 on heated flat stainless steel surface at surface temperature, Ts ranging from 25 °C to 350 °C. The entire impact dynamics is captured using a high speed camera and analyzed to deduce the temporal variation of normalised drop contact diameter, β for the drop impact cases at different Ts. The high speed image sequences help to record the morphological behaviour of impacting alternative jet fuel drops on the heated surface at different combination of We and Ts and to arrive at phase diagram highlighting the broad regimes of biofuel drop impact dynamics. For the impact of high We drops, the average normalised spreading velocity increases in film boiling regime whereas it slightly decreases in the cases of un-heated surface, film evaporation, and nucleate boiling. The trend of maximum spread factor, βmax with We at different heat transfer regimes is presented. The sensitivity of βmax to We depends on the heat transfer regime and is the highest in the film boiling regime. Further the receding dynamics of impacting biofuel drop on the heated surface is significantly influenced by Ts. The observed trends are qualitatively explained through a temperature-dependent apparent contact angle in the available theoretical models as well as the presence of vapor flow and associated fingering at the rim of drop lamella. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - The green microalga Chlorella sp. TISTR 8990 was grown heterotrophically in the dark using various concentrations of a basal glucose medium with a carbon-to-nitrogen mass ratio of 29:1. The final biomass concentration and the rate of growth were highest in the fivefold concentrated basal glucose medium (25 g L−1 glucose, 2.5 g L−1 KNO3) in batch operations. Improving oxygen transfer in the culture by increasing the agitation rate and decreasing the culture volume in 500-mL shake flasks improved growth and glucose utilization. A maximum biomass concentration of nearly 12 g L−1 was obtained within 4 days at 300 rpm, 30°C, with a glucose utilization of nearly 76% in batch culture. The total fatty acid (TFA) content of the biomass and the TFA productivity were 102 mg g−1 and 305 mg L−1 day−1, respectively. A repeated fed-batch culture with four cycles of feeding with the fivefold concentrated medium in a 3-L bioreactor was evaluated for biomass production. The total culture period was 11 days. A maximum biomass concentration of nearly 26 g L−1 was obtained with a TFA productivity of 223 mg L−1 day−1. The final biomass contained (w/w) 13.5% lipids, 20.8% protein and 17.2% starch. Of the fatty acids produced, 52% (w/w) were saturated, 41% were monounsaturated and 7% were polyunsaturated (PUFA). A low content of PUFA in TFA feedstock is required for producing high quality biodiesel. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

AB  - Processing biomass into multifunctional products can contribute to food, feed, and energy security while also mitigating climate change. However, biorefinery products nevertheless impact the environment, and this influence needs to be properly assessed to minimize the burden. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is often used to calculate environmental footprints of products, but distributing the burdens among the different biorefinery products is a challenge. A particular complexity arises when the outputs are a combination of energy carrying no mass, and mass carrying no energy, where neither an allocation based on mass nor on energy would be appropriate. A novel hybrid mass–energy (HMEN) allocation scheme for dealing with multifunctionality problems in biorefineries was developed and applied to five biorefinery concepts. The results were compared to results of other allocation methods in LCA. The reductions in energy use and GHG emissions from using the biorefinery's biofuels were also quantified. HMEN fairly distributed impacts among biorefinery products and did not change the order of the products in terms of the level of the pollution caused. The allocation factors for HMEN fell between mass and economic allocation factors and were comparable to energy allocation factors. Where the mass or the energy allocation failed to attribute burdens, HMEN addressed this shortcoming by assigning impacts to nonmass or to nonenergy products. Under the partitioning methods and regardless of the feedstock used, bioethanol reduced GHG by 72–98% relative to gasoline. The GHG savings were 196% under the substitution method, but no GHG savings occurred for sugar beet bioethanol under the surplus method. Bioethanol from cellulosic crops had lower energy use and GHG emissions than from sugar beet, regardless of the allocation method used. HMEN solves multifunctional problems in biorefineries and can be applied to other complex refinery systems. LCA practitioners are encouraged to further test this method in other case studies. © 2017 The Authors. Global Change Biology Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The ester content is an important parameter to be monitored in biodiesel for evaluation of the transesterification reaction yield and for assessing the purity of the final product. This is also a relevant quality parameter in diesel/biodiesel blends to avoid frauds, because legislation establishes a minimum amount of biodiesel to be added to diesel. The official method EN14103 requires the addition of an alternative internal standard (methyl nonadecanoate) for analysis of biodiesel from bovine tallow because the methyl heptadecanoate is found in high amounts in this product. In this work, it is proposed a fast, simple, practical, and environmental friendly flow-based spectrophotometric procedure, which exploits the formation of the violet complex between Fe(III) and the hydroxamate generated by the reactions of the alkyl esters with hydroxylamine. All involved steps are carried out inside the syringe pump of a sequential injection analyzer (lab-in-syringe approach). A single phase is attained by using ethanol as mediator solvent between the organic sample and aqueous soluble reagents. Linear responses for biodiesel samples and diesel/biodiesel blends were obtained from 4–99%(v/v) to 2.0–40%(v/v) methyl esters, described by the equations: A = 0.342 + 0.00305C (r = 0.997) and A = 0.174 + 0.00503C (r = 0.999), respectively. The analytical curve can be obtained by in-line dilution of a methyl linoleate stock solution. For biodiesel samples, the coefficient of variation (n = 10), limit of detection (99.7% confidence level), and sampling rate were estimated at 0.8%, 0.36%(v/v), and 15 h−1, respectively, whereas the corresponding values for the blend samples were 0.20%, 0.03%(v/v), and 12 h−1, respectively. The procedure consumes only 860 μg of hydroxylamine, 366 μg of Fe2(SO4)3·H2O, and 2.0 mL ethanol and generates ca. 3.0 mL of residue per determination. The results agreed with those obtained by official methods EN14103/2011 e EN14078, at the 95% confidence level. © 2017

AB  - Purpose: The study aims to assess climate change mitigation potentials when using biomass-based fuels to replace fossil energy under consequential and attributional modelling approaches. The objectives are also to determine policy implications and to recommend the specific contexts suitable for each modelling choice by using specific illustrative cases on biofuels. Methods: Consequential and attributional modelling approaches are chosen for life cycle greenhouse gas emission assessment of several bioenergy options. The assessed functional unit is 1 MJ of energy from molasses-based ethanol, palm-based biodiesel and electricity production from rice straw. The fossil fuel comparators are gasoline (for molasses-based ethanol), diesel (for palm-based biodiesel) and coal and gas (for rice straw). The substituted and substituting product systems are modelled under the global and national markets depending on the market delimitation of each product. Results and discussion: The climate change mitigation potentials when using different approaches are dissimilar, because the affected product systems being included in the analysis are not the same. The palm biodiesel could reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The molasses-based ethanol and rice straw-based electricity may or may not mitigate the climate change, since it depends on the methodological choices as well as the baseline situations of the product systems being investigated. The main characteristics of consequential modelling as additionality and the inclusion of only actually affected processes under market-based mechanisms while those of attributional modelling as specification and attribution/allocation have limitations. The limitations lead to potential risks on unintended and undesirable consequences (for the attributional model), unfairness and sub-optimisation (for the consequential model) in policy recommendations. Conclusions: This research clearly illustrates how certain modelling choices affect the climate change mitigation potentials of biomass-based fuels in comparison with fossil energy. Specific questions and conditions which could be more suitable for each modelling choice are addressed. The attributional modelling is more suitable for national environmental taxation and emission labelling/accounting for import-export, while the consequential modelling is more appropriate for new production development and eco-design. Due to the potential environmental risks arising from the modelling limitations, the consideration of both the widely applied approaches could support decisions more comprehensively. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - The Ecuadorian Government has, since the end of 2011, promoted an initiative for using pure jatropha oil, derived from the seeds of Jatropha curcas L., to generate electricity to supply Floreana Island (one of the Galapagos Islands). In the present study, nine elite accessions of J. curcas from tropical dry forests in Ecuador were cultivated for the purpose of evaluating seed production in relation to the propagation method used (seed, cutting). A split-plot design with three replicates was applied. Seed production, measured over a period of 7 years (2009–2015) showed a large year-to-year variation. However, seed production varied significantly among accessions and depended on the propagation method (seeds or cuttings). Propagation by stem cuttings stabilized the variability in the vegetative and seed production components measured, increasing the strength of their relationships with seed yield. The three highest yielding accessions produced 0.28–0.30 kg of seeds tree−1 year−1. As seed yield was not correlated with annual precipitation, the year-to-year variation in production of accessions indicates the effect of other factors not considered here, such as agronomic practices. The study findings suggest that agroforestry practices could be developed that would enable J. curcas to play a predominant role in a strategy for tropical dry forests aimed at reducing poverty (also known as pro-poor growth strategy). © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - A new continuous-flow ultrasound assisted oxidative desulfurization (UAOD) process was developed in order to decrease energy and aqueous phase consumption. In this process the aqueous phase is injected below the horn tip leading to enhanced mixing of the phases. Diesel fuel as the oil phase with sulfur content of 1550 ppmw and an appropriate mixture of hydrogen peroxide and formic acid as the aqueous phase were used. At the first step, the optimized condition for the sulfur removal has been obtained in the batch mode operation. Hence, the effect of more important oxidation parameters; oxidant-to-sulfur molar ratio, acid-to-sulfur molar ratio and sonication time were investigated. Then the optimized conditions were obtained using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) technique. Afterwards, some experiments corresponding to the best batch condition and also with objective of minimizing the residence time and aqueous phase to fuel volume ratio have been conducted in a newly designed double-compartment reactor with injection of the aqueous phase to evaluate the process in a continuous flow operation. In addition, the effect of nozzle diameter has been examined. Significant improvement on the sulfur removal was observed specially in lower sonication time in the case of dispersion method in comparison with the conventional contact between two phases. Ultimately, the flow pattern induced by ultrasonic device, and also injection of the aqueous phase were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively by capturing the sequential images. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A 2-year study was conducted to elucidate land use change (LUC) impact on the distribution of aggregate size fractions and associated carbon (C) concentration involving natural forest (NF), degraded forest (DF), cropland (CL), and biofuel plantation (JP, Jatropha plantation) in the dry tropical region of India across the soil profile (0–10, 10–20, and 20–30 cm). Across the seasons and the land uses, the proportion of macro- and microaggregates was maximum at upper and minimum at lower layer whereas mesoaggregates increase with depth. The trend of macro- and microaggregate fractions through the soil profile was NF > JP > DF > CL whereas that of mesoaggregates was CL > DF < JP > NF. Dry mean weight diameter was highest at upper layer and decreased down the depth in all the land uses and followed the trend NF > JP > DF > CL. Aggregate associated organic carbon (OC) concentration in all the fractions decreased from NF to DF, CL, or JP indicates that macroaggregate associated OC concentration was more susceptible to loss than that of meso- and microaggregate associated OC concentration. LUC induced decline in macroaggregate associated OC stock and increase in meso- and microaggregate associated OC stock; indicated redistribution of OC stock among aggregate fractions. It may be concluded that JP in dry tropics can be an efficient strategy for rehabilitation of degraded land as it improves aggregate structure and stability in the whole profile and aggregate associated OC stock in upper layer of soil. © 2017 Society for Ecological Restoration

AB  - We build a tractable partial equilibrium model to study the interactions between the EU biofuel policies (mandate and double-counting of second-generation biofuels) and first- and second-generation biodiesel production. We find that increasing the biodiesel mandate results in a higher share of first-generation biodiesel in total diesel fuel, but leads to a lower share of second-generation biodiesel. The double-counting policy supports the production of second-generation biodiesel at the expense of a lower share of first-generation biodiesel, and increases the consumption of fossil diesel as compared to treating first- and second-generation biodiesel equally. Finally, improved collection of used cooking oil reduces the price of oilseeds and oils thereof, the prices of both biofuel types, and negligibly also the consumer fuel price. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to develop a valuation scheme for environmental impacts in Thailand. This would assist in integrating environmental concerns into economic assessment tools such as cost-benefit analysis (CBA), system of environmental-economic accounting (SEEA), etc., which could be used in policymaking. Methods: The damage categories considered are human health and ecosystem quality. The value of a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) measuring damage to human health is estimated using the budget constraint approach. The value of a biodiversity-adjusted hectare year (BAHY) measuring damage to ecosystems is calculated relatively to the value of a QALY. Results and discussion: Potential economic production per capita, which is considered as the willingness to pay (WTP) for a QALY, is in the range 458,000–566,000 Thai baht (THB) (equivalent to 14,000–18,000 USD where 1 USD ≈ 32 THB). The value of a BAHY, which is expressed in terms of the value of a QALY, is in the range 7900–9800 THB (or around 250–300 USD), based on the exchange rate between the protection targets for ecosystems and human well-being. These results are tested by applying to the monetization of potential environmental burdens from producing several biofuels and petroleum-based fuels in Thailand; the environmental externalities account for about 20–40 % of the retail price. Conclusions: The results can benefit policymakers in terms of decision-making on environmental management. Besides, the pathways to derive the monetary value of environmental impacts could be useful for other countries. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Purpose: Due to various environmental pressures such as climate change and scarcity of natural resources, as well as nontariff barriers from trade partners, Thailand has established the Thai national life cycle inventory (LCI) database in 2006. In the 1st phase (2006–2007), three working groups were developed for natural gas, refinery, and petrochemical products. Another seven working groups were established in the 2nd phase (2007–2010) for ferrous and non-ferrous metals, utilities and transportation, construction materials, agricultural materials and products, basic chemicals, recycling and waste management, and others. In the 3rd phase (2010 to present), expansion of the number of data sets from the previous phases has been carried out. The purpose of this paper is to present the experiences on national database development in emerging countries with the example of Thailand on both strategic and technical levels using refinery products as the case study. Methods: Data sets were developed according to ISO 14044:2006. The LCI data were managed and archived at the central facility known as the “central LCI database”. The Life Cycle Assessment lab (LCA lab) at MTEC, NSTDA, has been responsible for the central LCI database management. From 2008 to 2010, the “Thai national LCI database and its applications” project was granted a 3-year funding of over 50 million THB, and was operated under supervision of a steering committee set up by the Ministry of Industry (MoI). For this case study, to illustrate the development process, primary data of the refinery products were collected by Petroleum Institute of Thailand in the year 2005 from seven refineries covering more than 70 % of the production in the country. Attributional modelling has been used, with energy content as an allocation criterion. Results and discussion: During the initial phase of the “Thai National LCI Database Development Project”, two key barriers have been faced. One was the lack of awareness from stakeholders as LCI and LCA were quite new tools for most people in Thailand. This problem was tackled by collaborating with the right strategic partners to drive the LCI national project and educating stakeholders with the training supports from Japan. The other hindrance was the lack of expertise of local experts on LCA. It took several years to continually build the capacity through seminars and workshops in Thailand and Japan, including “on the job training” on some pilot projects. As of May 2016, there were more than 700 data sets in the Thai national LCI database, considering only the data that MTEC acted as the project commissioner. However, only 515 data were certified as the national database. The other 211 data were qualified merely as the data from pilot projects. More details of the database list and how to access the data can be viewed in Thai language at the URL: http://www.thailcidatabase.net. Because the Thai national LCI data were mostly primary data from a core set of products for the Thai economy with a very high representativeness (>60 %) of the actual Thai productions, the data have been treated carefully. Only C-to-G data and G-to-G data from literature were allowed to disclose to Thai delegates with some signing agreements. However, G-to-G data from the actual Thai productions were sometimes provided, only with the signing confidentiality contracts. For refinery products, seven average data sets were established as national LCI data sets, i.e. liquefied petroleum gas, sulfur, gasoline, kerosene/jet oil, naphtha, fuel oil and diesel, with the year 2005 as the reference year. The data representativeness was very high covering more than 70 % of the production in Thailand. Due to the positive feedback and engagement from industries, several LCI projects have been started after this initial phase. The national LCI data sets have been used in various national applications and policies such as sustainable biofuels, government green public procurement, green GDP, Thai carbon footprint, etc. However, some relevant limitations of the Thai LCI database were listed as follows. Similar to most surveyed national LCI database worldwide, the climate change impact category has been chosen as the main focus for these data sets. Nevertheless, there is a more growing demand to use the data for other applications. As a result, more data sets that cover other impact categories will be required in the near future. Regarding the nomenclature and format, the Thai data sets were technically unique and not fully compatible with any other database. Conclusions: The Thai national LCI database could be considered as the pioneer case for other countries in the South East Asia region. Thailand has further progressed in its LCI database development. Since 2009, the Thai national LCI database has been used as one of the key infrastructures of Thailand to support public policies and applications related to green growth. Many Thai stakeholders are well aware on LCI, LCA, and EcoDesign. Expertise of local experts has been increasingly improved. However, there are still more challenges to be faced to harvest the value of the Thai database in its full potential for better decision making in industry and policy, and for better positioning of Thai products on the global markets. From our experience, the following issues could be identified as “lessons learned”. At the onset of the project, it was crucial to get in expert advices from LCA-experienced countries to establish local expertise. Also, industry experts from abroad could help in clarifying the concept and addressing confidentiality concerns, as well as building awareness on LCA to Thai industries. Searching for some supporting programmes for capacity building, such as the GPP from Japan in our case, could provide great benefits to any emerging economies for national LCI initiatives. However, sustaining the trained human resources was also vital. Continual funding supports for LCI development and its applications were necessary to keep the momentum of active people in the field. Multiplying effect of the LCI knowledge to related organizations in the three main groups, i.e. government, academia, and industries, could help sustain the knowhow. Also, effective knowledge management through media such as books, guidelines, training courses, etc. would relief the turnover problem of trained staffs. Although it took a lot of time to develop local expertise, it was an essential step to have sufficient number of local experts to sustain the national database project. Moreover, a strong network of experts and researchers locally and internationally also strengthened the technical capacity to deal with any challenges during the project implementation. Furthermore, collaboration with the right strategic partners to drive the project was also very important in order to elevate it to the national level. It should be noted for any emerging economies aiming to initiate national LCI, the work plan for LCI database development (including the database management system) and its applications should be well balanced. Also, a well-designed database management system would enhance the database usage in the long run, especially when dealing with various impact categories like those in PEF. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the bioremediation of estuarine sediments contaminated with diesel oil. The following two experiments were performed: natural attenuation (NA) and stimulated natural attenuation (SNA), using rhamnolipid as biosurfactant. Sediment samples were accommodated into glass columns and then contaminated with diesel oil on the top. The column profiles were separated into surface, middle, and bottom for the analyses. The 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) prioritized by US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were monitored for 349 days. Those with three and four rings showed increasing concentrations through the operation period in the middle and bottom samples, particularly between days 111 and 338, and in the SNA experiment. Those with five and six rings were also detected in the deeper portions of the columns, suggesting the percolation of PAHs with a high molecular weight. Total organic carbon was reduced by 91 and 89 % in the NA and SNA samples, respectively, although no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) were found between the two treatments. The analyses by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis indicated a slight shift in the microbial community structure over the experiments. Microorganisms belonging to the γ-Proteobacteria phylum were the main bacteria involved. The archaeal community exhibited dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens, indicating the obligate anaerobic biodegradation of intermediate compounds from hydrocarbon degradation. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Oleaginous microorganisms such as microalgae, yeasts, bacteria and filamentous fungi are alternative sources of vegetal or animal fats for biodiesel production. This research evaluated the lipid production by the biomass Trichoderma koningiopsis MX1 with a non-stirring culture at room temperature, and fungal lipids were extracted through three techniques for biodiesel generation purposes. The three modified lipid extraction techniques yielded 18.4, 10.3 and 17.1 % of fungal lipids. The trans-esterification of lipids indicated that the controlling components for biodiesel were palmitic (40.8 %) and linoleic acids (ranging from 37.6 % to 41.2 %). Results show that fungal cultural conditions and the lipid extraction technique are determinants for producing biodiesel from fungal lipids. Therefore, the modification of some of these conditions could increase their efficiency and viability. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The intrinsic structural properties of branched long-chain fatty alcohols (BLFLs) in the range of C12 to C18 make them more suitable as diesel fuel replacements and for other industrial applications than their straight-chain counterparts. While microbial production of straight long-chain fatty alcohols has been achieved, biosynthesis of BLFLs has never been reported. In this work, we engineered four different biosynthetic pathways in Escherichia coli to produce BLFLs. We then employed a modular engineering approach to optimize the supply of α-keto acid precursors and produced either odd-chain or even-chain BLFLs with high selectivity, reaching 70 and 75% of total fatty alcohols, respectively. The acyl-ACP and alcohol-producing modules were also extensively optimized to balance enzyme expression level and ratio, resulting in a 6.5-fold improvement in BLFL titers. The best performing strain overexpressed 14 genes from 6 engineered operons and produced 350 mg/L of BLFLs in fed-batch fermenter. The modular engineering strategy successfully facilitated microbial production of BLFLs and allowed us to quickly optimize new BLFL pathway with high titers and product specificity. More generally, this work provides pathways and knowledge for the production of BLFLs and BLFL-related, industry-relevant chemicals in high titers and yields. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The "Jatropha for Galápagos" (JFG) project in Ecuador aims to progressively replace diesel with jatropha oil in the generation of electricity in The Galápagos Islands. Thus, understanding and motivating the participation of jatropha suppliers is a priority for the sustainability of JFG. For this reason, the factors influencing their decision-making to participate in the project have been identified and analyzed using a binomial logit model. The results show that factors found to positively influence the likelihood of participation include, amongst others, the supplier's experience within the project, their participation in local organizations, and the degree of satisfaction with the price of jatropha oil. In addition, children from producer families' collaboration in the harvest of jatropha increases the overall likelihood of participation within the project. Similarly, the distance to the collection center positively influences the chances of participation. Conversely, those suppliers with higher wages and those who declared that jatropha harvest starts in April have a reduced likelihood of participating in the project. The findings obtained from this project can help decision-makers develop new measures to improve the sustainability of the project through initiatives to motivate the participation of jatropha suppliers in the program. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Biorefineries have the potential to meet a significant part of the growing demand for energy, fuels, chemicals and materials worldwide. Indeed, the bio-based industry is expected to play a major role in energy security and climate change mitigation during the 21th century. Despite this, there are challenges related to resource consumption, processing optimization and waste minimization that still need to be overcome. In this context, microalgae appear as a promising non-edible feedstock with advantages over traditional land crops, such as high productivity, continuous harvesting throughout the year and minimal problems regarding land use. Importantly, both cultivation and microalgae processing can take place at the same site, which increases the possibilities for process integration and a reduction in logistic costs at biorefinery facilities. This review describes the actual scenario for microalgae biorefineries integration to the biofuels and petrochemical industries in Brazil, while highlighting the major challenges and recent advances in microalgae large-scale production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Present investigation was done to evaluate various algal genera found in water bodies of Varanasi city. The potential of any biomass for biofuels (bioalcohols, biohydrogen, etc.) production depends on the quantity of extractable sugar present in it. Acid (H2SO4) and alkali (NaOH) pretreatment were performed, and H2SO4 was chosen due to its nearly double yield as compared with alkaline pretreatment. Response surface methodology was utilized for the optimization of operating parameters such as treatment temperature, time, and acid concentration. Sugar yield up to 0.33 g/g of dry biomass was obtained using cyanobacterial biomass of Lyngbya limnetica, at 100°C, 59.19 min, and H2SO4 concentration of 1.63 M. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - ConspectusGrowing concern with the environmental impact of CO2 emissions produced by combustion of fuels derived from fossil-based carbon resources has stimulated the search for renewable sources of carbon. Much of this focus has been on the development of methods for producing transportation fuels, the major source of CO2 emissions today, and to a lesser extent on the production of lubricants and chemicals. First-generation biofuels such as bioethanol, produced by the fermentation of sugar cane- or corn-based sugars, and biodiesel, produced by the transesterification reaction of triglycerides with alcohols to form a mixture of long-chain fatty esters, can be blended with traditional fuels in limited amounts and also arise in food versus fuel debates. Producing molecules that can be drop-in solutions for fossil-derived products used in the transportation sector allows for efficient use of the existing infrastructure and is therefore particularly interesting. In this context, the most viable source of renewable carbon is abundantly available lignocellulosic biomass, a complex mixture of lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose. Conversion of the carbohydrate portion of biomass (hemicellulose and cellulose) to fuels requires considerable chemical restructuring of the component sugars in order to achieve the energy density and combustion properties required for transportation fuels - gasoline, diesel, and jet. A different set of constraints must be met for the conversion of biomass-sourced sugars to lubricants and chemicals. This Account describes strategies developed by us to utilize aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, furfurals, and carboxylic acids derived from C5 and C6 sugars, acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation mixtures, and various biomass-derived carboxylic acids and fatty acids to produce fuels, lubricants, and chemicals. Oxygen removal from these synthons is achieved by dehydration, decarboxylation, hydrogenolysis, and hydrodeoxygenation, whereas reactions such as aldol condensation, etherification, alkylation, and ketonization are used to build up the number of carbon atoms in the final product. We show that our strategies lead to high-octane components that can be blended into gasoline, C9-C22 compounds that possess energy densities and properties required for diesel and jet fuels, and lubricants that are equivalent or superior to current synthetic lubricants. Replacing a fraction of the crude-oil-derived products with such renewable sources can mitigate the negative impact of the transportation sector on overall anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change potential. While ethanol is a well-known fuel additive, there is significant interest in using ethanol as a platform molecule to manufacture a variety of valuable chemicals. We show that bioethanol can be converted with high selectivity to butanol or 1,3-butadiene, providing interesting alternatives to the current production from petroleum. Finally, we report that several of the strategies developed have the potential to reduce GHG emissions by 55-80% relative to those for petroleum-based processes. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - With the petroleum storage reduction and global warming, there is an increasing need to revolutionize the energy supply chain, especially in the transportation industry. Researches on the production of fuels derived from biological renewable feedstocks have been greatly intensified over the past decade. Sustained researches have been performed with biofuels, such as bioethanol which is the most commonly used in SI engines due to its renewable nature and high octane number. Apart from SI engines, bioethanol is also used in diesel engines. Our country population resources are numerous, it is impossible to popularize the bioethanol in large scale due to the limitation of the area of cultivated land. With the development of fuel production technology, more and more alternative fuel for diesel have been found, such as 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF). In the past, DMF did not draw extensive attention due to the limitation of production technology. Recently, some significant breakthroughs have been made in production methods for DMF, which makes it is possible to be widely applied as a major alternative fuel for diesel in compression ignition engine. Although DMF is a promising biofuel, little is known on its combustion and emission characteristics. The experiments were carried out on a modified four-cylinder, 4-stroke, water-cooled, DICI engine coupled with a common rail fuel injection system using blends of diesel and DMF. Conventional diesel fuel was used as the base fuel. Mixtures of 10% and 30% by mass fraction of DMF with the base diesel fuel were tested in the research, referred to as D10 and D30, respectively. Traditional pure diesel referred to as D0. The experimental conditions were constant engine speed of 1800 r min-1 and loads from 10% to 90% at an interval of 20%, corresponding to 0.13, 0.38, 0.63, 0.88 and 1.13 MPa BMEP, respectively. Unregulated emissions would severely harm the health of humans and other living beings. Some of the unregulated emissions, even in minor quantities into the air, can induce major health problems in large sections of the affected population. There is much research on the regulated emissions of DMF, but rarely on the unregulated emissions of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde or benzene. Airborne particulate matter (PM) is also associated with several severe health hazards. Thus, we studied the combustion and unregulated emission characteristics as well as PM emission from diesel engine on different DMF and diesel blends compared with baseline diesel. The results show that at 0.13 MPa BMEP, with the increase of DMF mass fraction in the mixtures, the peak cylinder pressure decreases significantly and the peak heat release rate (HRR) significantly increases. However, at 0.88 MPa BMEP, peak cylinder pressure and HRR are increased with the increase of DMF mass fraction. 1,3-butadiene, acetaldehyde and benzene emissions are decreased with the increase of engine load. The NOx emissions increases with the increase of engine load. In addition, DMF blending with diesel increased acetaldehyde emissions, whilst reduced 1,3-butadiene and benzene emissions. At 0.13 MPa BMEP, D30 has the lowest NOx emissions. For each tested fuels, the nucleation mode greatly dominates the particle size distribution. At 0.38 MPa BMEP, compared with diesel, the particle number concentration of blend fuels are lower in each test mode. However, at high load of 1.13 MPa BMEP, the particle number concentration of diesel is consistently the lowest within the entire range of diameters. At 0.88 MPa BMEP, D30 has 60.5% smaller nucleation-mode number and 232.2% smaller accumulation-mode mass than diesel. D30 has much smaller mean accumulation-mode diameter than diesel (50.9 vs. 60.1 nm). © 2017, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - Experimental studies on fermentative production of ethanol from renewable sugarcane juice as carbon source were carried out in a bench scale fermenter integrated with microfiltration, nanofiltration and membrane distillation units (MF-NF-MD) for downstream purification and concentration enrichment of ethanol. This new design is flexible, compact, eco-friendly, and modular and, operated in a cross flow module that ensures almost fouling-free membrane separation while overcoming the product inhibition of traditional batch fermenters. The system is blessed with steady and continuous ethanol production from sugarcane juice with comparatively high productivity 9.2 g L−1 h−1, yield 0.47 g g−1 and concentration 54.3 g L−1 using Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCIM 3205) vis-à-vis the existing technologies. The new system enables continuous product withdrawal, separation and recycle of the biomass as well as residual carbon source back to the fermenter under high cell density without product inhibition. Membrane distillation in the final stage, increases product purity and results in significant concentration enrichment. The study culminates in development of a green and sustainable process for a biofuel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As potential substitutes for precious metals, cobalt spinel has been considered as a promising alternative catalyst for the low-temperature catalytic oxidation of biofuels. This work reports the one-step synthesis of cobalt spinel by a more elaborated approach named pulsed-spray evaporation chemical vapor deposition with a new feedstock of Co(acac)3 and toluene. The obtained samples were comprehensively characterized in terms of structure and morphology (XRD, FTIR, Raman and SEM), chemical composition (XPS and EDS) and the redox properties (TPR/TPO). The structural and morphological analysis indicates that the synthesized thin films are pure cubic Co3O4 with homogeneous matrix with well-defined facets and straight edges. Compared to the commonly used feedstock of Co(acac)2/ethanol, Co(acac)3/toluene could result in a much higher growth rate, more lattice oxygen on the surface and better re-oxidation property. The Co3O4 film exhibits attractive performance towards the deep oxidation of n-butanol by preventing the formation of CO and acetaldehyde. The relationship between the peculiar structure and properties of Co3O4 is highlighted. The surface basic sites, specific morphology and the redox properties are proposed to play synergistic roles in the reaction sequence. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass continues to show promise in experimental and pilot scale tests for carbon partitioning toward desirable multi-phase organic products. Results from a techno-economic investigation are presented for a commercial scale stand-alone plant with primary production of renewable liquid fuels compatible with current transportation infrastructure. The plant feedstock was forest residues and the non-catalytic hydrothermal conditions were set to 330 °C and 210 bar. A sequential flowsheet was developed and simulated on Aspen Plus® that includes pre-treatment, hydrothermal liquefaction, fuel upgrading and residue recovery functional blocks. Different scenarios for the valorization of the liquefaction residue streams are examined to maximize organic recovery and eliminate process waste streams. The highest plant thermal efficiency on lower heating value basis was recorded for the polygeneration of renewable liquid fuels, Bio-char and hydrogen gas at 85.2%. The plant recorded a minimum selling price of 66 € per MWh of co-products. The break-even prices of the co-products under existing market conditions was found to be 1.03 € per kg of gasoline or 2.46 € per kg of hydrogen gas or 51.4 € per MWh of Bio-char. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass is an attractive renewable and stored energy that can be converted to transportation fuels, chemicals and electricity using bio-chemical and thermo-chemical conversion routes. Notably, biofuels have relatively lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to the fossil fuels. A biomass gasifier can convert lignocellulosic biomass such as wood into syngas, which can be used in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) to produce heat and electricity. SOFC has very good thermodynamic conversion efficiency for converting methane or hydrogen into electricity, and integration of SOFC with gasifier gives heat integration opportunities that allow one to design systems with electricity production efficiencies as high as 70%. Generally, process design and operational optimization problems have conflicting performance objectives, and Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) methods are applied to quantify the trade-offs among the objectives and to obtain the optimal values of design and operating parameters. This study optimizes biomass gasifier and SOFC plant for annual profit and annualized capital cost, simultaneously. A Pareto front has been obtained by solving MOO problem, and then net flow method is used to identify some optimal solutions from the Pareto front for the implementation into next phase. The constructed composite curves, which notify maximum amount of possible heat recovery, and first law efficiency also indicate better performance of the integrated plant. Uncertainty of market and operating parameters has been added to the optimization problem, and robust MOO of the integrated plant has been performed, which retains less sensitive Pareto solutions during the optimization. Finally, Pareto solutions obtained via normal and robust MOO approaches are considered for uncertainty analysis, and Pareto solutions obtained via robust MOO found to be less sensitive. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Raman spectroscopy and multivariate curve resolution with correlation constraint were used for the identification and quantification of biofuels and adulterants in petroleum diesel. Firstly, quantification of two biofuels present in petroleum diesel (biodiesel and hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA)) was performed. The developed models for biodiesel and HEFA presented RMSEPs equal to 0.70%, indicating the practical application of the proposed methodology. Additionally, the identification and quantification of six adulterants (ethanol, cyclohexane, gasoline, hexane, kerosene and an ethanol/gasoline blend) in petroleum diesel with 10% of biofuels (B-10) were performed. In this case, it was possible to identify the adulterant with high confidence based on the recovered spectra and to estimate its concentration with absolute errors below to 8%. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study argues that CO2 can be used to modify the composition of bio-oil generated from hydrothermal liquefaction of two different microalgae such as Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) and Nannochloropsis oceanica (N. oceanica). Prior to hydrothermal liquefaction, the lipid content of microalgae was quantified as ∼2 wt% of M. aeruginosa and ∼14.5 wt% of N. oceanica. In addition, the thermal degradation of M. aeruginosa and N. oceanica was characterized to evaluate the influence of CO2 via quantifying major pyrolytic gases (i.e., H2, CH4, and CO). Hydrothermal liquefaction of these two microalgae was performed using a high-pressure batch reactor in N2 and CO2 atmospheres. The composition of chemical species containing N and O in bio-oil was significantly decreased under hydrothermal liquefaction in CO2, which meant that the quality of microalgae-derived bio-oil was improved. In addition, the use of CO2 allowed the production of more petro-diesel like bio-oil. This study suggests a practical means for utilizing CO2 for the production of high-quality bio-oil from toxic and economic microalgal biomass. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass gasification for the release of a syngas and its use in combined heat and power (CHP) generation systems are attracting realities in the European market, due to the perspective to provide energy to remote districts by using local renewable sources, as residuals of forest practices or agro-food industries. The syngas produced from biomass gasification is a feasible alternative to traditional fuels in internal combustion engines at the micro and small power scales, although the quality of the produced gas is poorer in terms of calorific value and laminar flame speed. Therefore, as a direct consequence, proper modifications and optimizations of engines are needed to enhance energy efficiency and reduce the environmental impact. In the present work, a numerical model for the simulation of a compression ignition engine fueled in the dual-fuel mode with syngas and biodiesel is presented. The aim is to highlight the main influences on the combustion process related to the use of syngas and the effects of different biomass moisture contents on power output and main pollutants emission. The used extended coherent flamelet model for turbulent combustion is preliminary validated on the basis of experimental data of engine pressure cycles collected under only biodiesel fueling. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Interest in high-energy substituted furans has been increasing due to their occurrence in biofuel production and their versatility in conversion to other useful products. Methylfurans are the simplest substituted furans and understanding their reaction pathways, thermochemical properties, including intermediate species stability, and chemical kinetics would aid in the study of larger furans. Furan ring C-H bonds have been shown to be extremely strong, approximately 120 kcal mol-1, due in part to the placement of the oxygen atom and aromatic-like resonance, both within the ring. The thermochemistry and kinetics of the oxidation of 2-methyfuran radical at position 5 of the furan ring, 2-methyl-5-furanyl radical (2MF5j), is analyzed. The resulting chemically activated species, 2MF5OOj radical, has a well depth of 51 kcal mol-1 below the 2MF5j + O2 reactants; this is 4-5 kcal mol-1 deeper than that of phenyl and vinyl radical plus O2, with both of these reactions known to undergo chain branching. Important, low-energy reaction pathways include chain branching dissociations, intramolecular abstractions, group transfers, and radical oxygen additions. Enthalpies of formation, entropies, and heat capacities for the stable molecules, radicals, and transition-state species are analyzed using computational methods. Calculated ΔH°f 298 values were determined using an isodesmic work reaction from the CBS-QB3 composite method. Elementary rate parameters are from saddle point transition-state structures and compared to variational transition-state analysis for the barrierless reactions. Temperature- and pressure-dependent rate constants which are calculated using QRRK and master equation analysis is used for falloff and stabilization. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - For algal biofuels to be economically sustainable and avoid exacerbating nutrient pollution, algal cultivation and processing must maximize rates of biofuel production while simultaneously minimizing the consumption of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizers. We experimentally tested whether algal polycultures could be engineered to improve N and P nutrient-use efficiency compared to monocultures by balancing trade-offs in nutrient-use efficiency and biocrude production. We analyzed the flows of N and P through the processes of cultivation, biocrude production through hydrothermal liquefaction, and nutrient recycling in a laboratory-scale system. None of the six species we examined exhibited high N efficiency, P efficiency, and biocrude production simultaneously; each had poor performance in at least one function (i.e., <25th percentile). Polycultures of two to six species did not outperform the best species in any single function, but some polycultures exhibited more balanced performance and maintained all three functions at higher levels simultaneously than any of the monocultures (i.e., >67th percentile). Moreover, certain polycultures came closer to optimizing all three functions than any of the monocultures. By balancing trade-offs between N and P efficiency and biocrude production, polycultures could be used to simultaneously reduce the demand for both N and P fertilizers by up to 85%. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Forest-derived biofuels have been on the agenda for several decades. Despite extensive research and development efforts, forest biofuel concepts have nevertheless not yet been realized on any significant scale. The discrepancy between the expectations from the research community and the lack of momentum regarding biofuel production raises the question of if and how research results can be used to achieve such goals. Here, we report results from an interview study with the aim of evaluating how energy system models can be used to illustrate barriers and drivers for forest biofuels, with focus on Swedish conditions, using the BeWhere model as case. The study is framed as an example of expertise, and problematizes how energy system models are interpreted among expected users. While the interviews revealed some general scepticism regarding models, and what kinds of questions they can answer, the belief was also expressed that increased complexity might be an advantage in terms of being able to accommodate more barriers against forest biofuels. The study illustrates the complexity of this policy area, where an energy system model can answer some, but never all, 'what if.?' questions. The results reveal a need for reformation in energy system modelling in order to more explicitly make society the subject of the work, and also illustrate that the belief in expertise as a tool for consensus-building in decision-making should be questioned. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - As the decreasing availability of the fossil fuel is rising day by day, the search of alternate fuel that can be used as a substitute to the conventional fuels is rising rapidly. A new type of biofuel, chicha oil biodiesel, is introduced in this work for the purpose of fuelling diesel engine. Chicha oil was transesterified with methanol using potassium hydroxide as catalyst to obtain chicha oil methyl ester (COME). The calorific value of this biodiesel is lower, when compared to that of diesel. The COME and their blends of 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% with diesel were tested in a single cylinder, four stroke, direct injection diesel engine and the performance, combustion and emission results were compared with diesel. The test result indicates that there is a slight increase in brake thermal efficiency and decrease in brake-specific fuel consumption for all blended fuels when compared to that of diesel fuel. The use of biodiesel resulted in lower emissions of CO and HC and increased emissions of CO2 and NOx. The experimental results proved that the use of biodiesel (produced from chicha oil) in compression ignition engine is a viable alternative to diesel. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Horse manure, the improper disposal of which, imposes considerable environmental costs, constitutes an apt feedstock for conversion to renewable fuels and chemicals when tail gas reactive pyrolysis (TGRP) is employed. TGRP is a modification of fast pyrolysis that recycles its noncondensable gases and produces a bio-oil low in oxygen concentration and rich in naphthalene. Herein, we evaluate the coproduction of phenol as a value-added renewable chemical, alongside jet-range fuels within distributed TGRP systems using techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment. We investigate the metrics global warming potential (GWP), cumulative exergy demand (CExD), and cost for the conversion of 200 dry metric tons per day of horse manure to bio-oil and its subsequent upgrade to hydrocarbon fuel and phenolic chemicals. Assigning credits for the offset of the coproducts, the net GWP and CExD of TGRP jet fuel are 10 g of CO2 eq and 0.4 MJ per passenger kilometer distance traveled, respectively. These values are considerably lower than the GWP and CExD of petroleum-based aviation fuel. The minimum fuel selling price of the TGRP jet fuel ($1.35-$1.80 L-1) is estimated to be much greater than that of petroleum-based aviation fuel ($0.42 L-1), except under optimized fuel conversion and coproduct market conditions ($0.53-$0.79 L-1) when including a market price for carbon. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Physic nut (Jatropha curcas) is a valuable crop whose seeds contain a high percentage of oil and can be converted to high-quality biodiesel. Physic nut can grow in tropical and subtropical areas and has minimal requirements of its environment. Physic nut starts its production 9 mth after planting and its yield peaks in 2–3 yr. The major hurdle in harvesting its seeds is the extreme height of this crop. J. curcas plants often reach 1.5–2 m after the first year and continue to grow. Plant height control had been achieved by manipulating levels of gibberellic acid (GA). One possible way to accomplish GA manipulation is through the action of the SHORT INTERNODES (SHI) gene since it has been found to repress GA responses. The current study identified the SHI gene in J. curcas. Further characterization of the expression pattern and structure of the SHI gene revealed that JcSHI is a single copy gene that encodes 315 amino acid residues and is highly expressed in the shoot meristem and root. The phylogenetic tree showed a close relationship between JcSHI and PtSHI that are both in woody plants. The JcSHI protein contained a specific RING zinc finger (C3HC3H type) and the IGGH domain indicating the possible function of SHI as a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in plant growth and elongation. © 2018

AB  - This paper presents the utilization of the waste cooking oil (WCO) as fuel for diesel engine or also known as compression ignition (CI) engine. The WCO is an alternative biofuel to provide the receding supply of world crude oil as well as recycling the waste. The physiochemical properties of WCO are considered lower than conventional diesel fuel as its density is higher and volatility is lower. Thus the WCO is less prone to evaporate, diffuse and combust during the combustion process. As the matter of fact, the WCO cannot be used as it is because it will create clogging problem at the fuel filter and injector. Therefore, this project has mixes the WCO with conventional petrol fuel (RON95) which is lower density and higher volatility than WCO. The mixing ratio of the WCO and the RON95 was set in the range of 5 to 25 percent of volume based. Initially, the mixing fuel properties such as density and calorific value were investigated. Then, the mixes fuels were tested on the engine performance and the results are compared with the baseline diesel fuel. Based on the results found in this project, lower percentage of WCO (25% of RON95 and 75% of WCO) is suitable to be used for lower engine speed while higher percentage of WCO (5% of RON95 and 95% of WCO) produces a better result at higher engine speed. Nevertheless, the results of all fuel blends are poorer than the conventional diesel fuel. Hence, this project recommends further investigation to be made before WCO can fully utilise although it has potential to be used as fuel in diesel engine. © 2017 Faculty of Mechanical Engineering.

AB  - As fossil energy resources are depleting quick and energy security is playing a vital role in the world economy. Quest for alternative energy sources have turned researches investigation in waste foods for next generation fuel. Biodiesel is usually considered to be environmentally friendly as it reduces greenhouse gas emission. Fish wastes rich in fatty acids and can be used as the raw material to produce biodiesel through transesterification reaction. The results showed that the seven peaks are fatty acid methyl esters, indicating all the triglycerides were successfully methylated to methyl esters. Fish based biodiesel provided a significant reduction in carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions under engine loads of 15 (Nm) and required no engine modification. The viscosity of the produced biodiesel was within the range of international standards (ASTM). The biodiesel was found to contain a low base number and exhibited a lower specific fuel consumption compared to the conventional diesel. It can be concluded that biodiesel derived from waste fish oil can be considered as a potential source of commercial biodiesel.

AB  - This article reports an in-depth characterization and optimization of a fermentation process with the aim of increasing the production of high cell densities as a prerequisite for high productivity of lipids. The freshwater microalgae Chlorella protothecoides was grown heterotrophically in a bioreactor on aerated and stirred cultivation medium with glucose as a carbon source and yeast extract as a nitrogen source. The detailed effect of carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio on growth and lipid content of C. protothecoides was studied. Results show that with a C/N ratio lower than 12, the medium was carbon-limited, favoring cell proliferation, and under nitrogen-starvation conditions, (higher C/N ratios), lipid accumulation was enhanced. A two-stage, fed-batch process was developed and achieved a maximum of 255.3 g/L of biomass over 228 h of fermentation, from a low initial cell density (&lt; 2 g/L). The specific growth rate, measured when C/N ratio was low, was 0.078 h-1. The lipid productivity was 16.7 g/L/day, and the maximum lipid content was 58 % (w/w) of the dry cell weight. This is the first time that such a very high cell density and lipid productivity have been achieved. The results offer potential for the production of important algae-derived commercial products.

AB  - Renewable electrical energy production, such as wind power or photovoltaics, faces temporal fluctuations and spatial separation of source and sink creating the need for suitable storage and conversion technologies. Furthermore, a bio-based economy needs technologies allowing the on-demand and on-site conversion of biomass to platform chemicals and chemical energy carriers. This study combines microbial and electrochemical conversions, allowing production of chemicals from biomass and electricity. Carboxylic acids (CAs) are produced by anaerobic conversion of a renewable feedstock with reactor microbiomes. CAs are subsequently electrochemically upgraded to yield energy-dense alkanes. We present a proof-of-concept based on experimental data for each step in two independent case studies at laboratory scale. During continuous CA fermentation from corn beer, mainly n-caproic and n-caprylic acid were produced yielding in total 0.638 g COD g-1 COD [CA/corn beer]. A batch system fed with corn silage yielded mainly n-butyric acid (0.207 g COD g-1 COD [CA/corn silage]), and some n-caproic acid (0.030 g COD g-1 COD [CA/corn silage]). The CAs were removed from the fermentation broth using a pertraction system. Subsequently, the CAs were electrochemically converted via Kolbe reaction and other reaction pathways. Depending on the carbon chain length of the CAs, liquid alkanes (from medium-chain CAs) or gaseous alkanes and alcohols (from short-chain CAs) were gained. Coulombic efficiencies of up to 80% were achieved despite the alkaline (pH 9) electrolysis conditions that are dictated by the pertraction system. Remarkably, CAs with a carbon chain length of six or more C-atoms were successfully converted to liquid alkanes at a high yield (in total: 0.480 g COD g-1 COD [hydrocarbon/corn beer]). This was achieved at an energy input of only 0.100 kW h per mol of converted CA (considering the electrochemical half cell reaction). Noteworthily, the electrochemical CA conversion is much faster than the CA fermentation, allowing intermittent electrolysis during periods of excess electrical power. We demonstrate that the finally gained product is suitable as a drop-in fuel without any further downstream processing. The future general potential as well as requirements for the concept are discussed. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The hydroconversion of waste cooking oil into hydrocarbon fuel was investigated over the hierarchical USY zeolite-supported NiMo catalysts which were prepared by dealumination ((NH4)2SiF6)/desilication (NaOH). The physical and acidity properties of the hierarchical catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine (Py-IR), ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), and H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR). The Brønsted/Lewis (B/L) acid distribution was little affected by dealumination and the acid density decreased significantly. However, the highly-desilicated catalysts decreased the B/L ratio obviously. Therefore, many more Mo species in the NiMoO4− and MoO3 phases were produced in the AHFS-treated catalysts, while more high-valence-state Mo species in the NiMoO4− phase were formed in the NaOH-treated catalysts. The AHFS-treated catalysts showed higher catalytic activity and better DCO2 selectivity and selective cracking for jet fuel. The 42.3% selectivity of jet fuel and 13.5% selectivity of jet-range aromatics was achieved over the 8 wt % (NH4)2SiF6-treated catalyst with 67% DCO2 selectivity. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Brazil is using bio-diesel as an alternate fuel to run cars. Rapid growth of bio-fuels all around the world is mainly due to energy crisis and ecological concerns, and in this dynamic market mechanisms, lot of efforts are being made to facilitate the growth of bio-fuels. In India, the main Goal of the Biofuel Policy is to make sure that, a bare minimum level of bio-fuels turns out to be readily accessible in the marketplace, to meet up the requirement at any given time. A pinpointing objective of 20% blending of bio-fuels, by 2017 was to be achieved, but still we are far behind. Even though raw vegetable oils can also be used in compression ignition engines, however, their high viscosities, poor flow properties in cold and low volatilities have made them unsuitable. Consequently, we need to investigate various other derivatives. In this research, Biodiesel was prepared by the process of trans-esterification, from waste cooking refined soyabean oil. Thereafter, an experimental investigation was carried out on a 4 - stroke Compression ignition engine, with single cylinder which is fueled with blends of Biodiesel and petro diesel. 6 blends of biodiesel were taken for investigating performance characteristics of engine, under different conditions of load. Blend B20 of biodiesel was found most suitable among all blends of biodiesel and petro diesel. © TJPRC Pvt. Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is obtained from a renewable source and has been used as an alternative to fossil fuels. It has unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters that can degrade due to oxidation of the double bonds. The instability of biodiesel during storage may cause problems regarding the maintenance and operation of motors. This work evaluated the effect of several variables on the storage conditions of biodiesel:diesel blends. The study was performed using an experimental design, and the variables were water content in biodiesel (0.01, 0.05 and 0.09%), biodiesel content in diesel (5.0, 7.5 and 10.0%), time (15, 30 and 45 days) and temperature (30, 40 and 50 °C). The levels simulated actual Brazilian storage conditions. The degradation was evaluated based on direct measurement of methyl linoleate and methyl oleate in the blends by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. These unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters are target compounds in the oxidation process. All experiments were carried out in sealed flasks. The results suggest that the restriction of oxygen limited the degradation of biodiesel in blends with higher percentage of the biofuel. The variables temperature, time and water content in biodiesel individually did not affect the degradation process within the range investigated at 95% confidence interval. © 2017 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.

AB  - Nitrogen oxides and smoke are the substantial emissions for the diesel engines. Fuels comprising high-level oxygen content can have low smoke emission due to better oxidation of soot. The objective of the paper is to assess the potential to employ oxygenated fuel, i.e., n-butanol and its blends with the neat diesel from 0 to 30% by volume. The experimental and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation is carried out to estimate the performance, combustion, and exhaust emission characteristics of n-butanol-diesel blends for various injection timings (9°, 12°, 15°, and 18°) using modern twin-cylinder, four-stroke, common rail direct injection (CRDI) engine. Experimental results reveal the increase in brake thermal efficiency (BTE) by ~ 4.5, 6, and 8% for butanol-diesel blends of 10% (Bu10), 20% (Bu20), and 30% (Bu30), respectively, compared to neat diesel (Bu0). Maximum BTE for Bu0 is 38.4%, which is obtained at 12° BTDC; however, for Bu10, Bu20 and Bu30 are 40.19, 40.9, and 41.7%, which are obtained at 15° BTDC, respectively. Higher flame speed of n-butanol-diesel blends burn a large amount of fuel in the premixed phase, which improves the combustion as well as emission characteristics. CFD and experimental results are compared and validated for all fuel blends for in-cylinder pressure and nitrogen oxides (NOx), and found to be in good agreement. Both experimental and simulation results witnessed in reduction of smoke opacity, NOx, and carbon monoxide emissions with the increasing n-butanol percentage in diesel fuel. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Biodiesels derived from the mahua seeds are established as a promising alternative for the diesel fuel owing to its non-edible nature and improved properties. TiO2 nanoparticle in powder form is added to neat mahua oil biodiesel (BD100) to examine its effect on emission characteristics. TiO2 nanoparticle is chosen as an additive owing to its catalytic effect, higher surface energy, and larger surface to volume ratio. TiO2 nanoparticle with an average size of 60 nm was synthesized by sol-gel route. TiO2 nanoparticles are added with mahua biodiesel (BD100) at 100 and 200 ppm. Mahua oil biodiesel doped with 100 and 200 ppm of TiO2 nanoparticles are referred as BD100T100 and BD100T200. A constant speed diesel engine is employed for the experimental trail. Engine is fueled with diesel, BD100, BD100T100, and BD100T200, respectively. Experimental result confirmed that the modified fuels (BD100T200 and BD100T100) showed a significant reduction in all the emissions. Further, the addition of TiO2 nanoparticle (200 ppm) to mahua biodiesel gave respective reduction of 9.3, 5.8, 6.6, and 2.7% in carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxide, and smoke emissions when compared to neat mahua biodiesel. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - In this study, diesel (JIS#2) and various biodiesel fuels (BDF20, BDF50, BDF100) are used to operate the diesel engine at 100 Nm, 200 Nm and full load; while the engine speed is 1800 rpm. The system is experimentally studied, and the energy, exergy, sustainability, thermoeconomic and exergoeconomic analyses are performed to the system. The Engine Exhaust Particle Sizer is used to measure the size distribution of engine exhaust particle emissions. Also, the data of the exhaust emissions, soot, particle numbers, fuel consumptions, etc. are measured. It is found that (i) most of the exhaust emissions (except NOx) are directly proportional to the engine load, (ii) maximum CO2 and NOx emissions rates are generally determined for the BDF100 biodiesel fuel; while the minimum ones are calculated for the JIS#2 diesel fuel. On the other hand, the maximum CO and HC emissions rates are generally computed for the JIS#2 diesel fuel; while the minimum ones are found for the BDF100 biodiesel fuel, (iii) fuel consumptions from maximum to minimum are BDF100 &gt; BDF50 &gt; BDF20 &gt; JIS#2 at all of the engine loads, (iv) particle concentration of the JIS#2 diesel fuel is higher than the biodiesel fuels, (v) soot concentrations of the JIS#2, BDF20 and BDF50 fuels are directly proportional to the engine load; while the BDF100 is inversely proportional, (vi) system has better energy and exergy efficiency when the engine is operated with the biodiesel fuels (vii) sustainability of the fuels are BDF100 &gt; BDF50 &gt; BDF20 &gt; JIS#2, (viii) thermoeconomic and exergoeconomic parameters rates from maximum to minimum are JIS#2 &gt; BDF20 &gt; BDF50 &gt; BDF100. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper aims to investigate the effect of the addition of 5% alcohol (butanol) with biodiesel-diesel blends on the performance, emissions, and combustion of a naturally aspirated four stroke multi-cylinder diesel engine at different engine speeds (1200 to 2400 rpm) under full load conditions. Three types of local Australian biodiesel, namely macadamia biodiesel (MB), rice bran biodiesel (RB), and waste cooking oil biodiesel (WCB), were used for this study, and the data was compared with results for conventional diesel fuel (B0). Performance results showed that the addition of butanol with diesel-biodiesel blends slightly lowers the engine efficiency. The emission study revealed that the addition of butanol additive with diesel-biodiesel blends lowers the exhaust gas temperature (EGT), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) emissions whereas it increases hydrocarbon (HC) emissions compared to B0. The combustion results indicated that in-cylinder pressure (CP) for additive added fuel is higher (0.45–1.49%), while heat release rate (HRR) was lower (2.60–9.10%) than for B0. Also, additive added fuel lowers the ignition delay (ID) by 23–30% than for B0. Finally, it can be recommended that the addition of 5% butanol with Australian biodiesel-diesel blends can significantly lower the NOx and PM emissions. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - The increase in greenhouse gas emission due to the burning of fossil fuels since the last century has led to global warming. This has triggered numerous researches in green hydrocarbon alternatives from renewable oil. Microalgae is one of the potential sources of green hydrocarbon, which will reduce the dependency on fossil fuel. This is because microalgae have a high oil or lipid content, rapid growth rate, and high ability to sequester carbon dioxide. Besides that, their cultivation does not require arable land and will, therefore not compete with global food production. The current biofuel production is based on the transesterification of triglyceride to biodiesel which suffered from several drawbacks such as high acidity, high viscosity, and low heating value, etc. A more efficient reaction route needs to be developed to produce biofuel which possesses similar properties as the fossil-derived fuel. Therefore, this review aims to encompass the conversion of microalgae oil towards green hydrocarbons via various catalytic reactions. The fundamental chemistry and mechanisms involved in the conversion of microalgae oil to useful chemical products are also discussed in detail. © 2017 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - In East Africa, charcoal and firewood will remain the main sources of energy for cooking for the next two to three decades. Corresponding energy policies are needed that set proper priorities and improve the sustainability of the biomass energy sector. In this paper, we assess the supply potentials of wood-based and non-woody biomass fuels in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania, and formulate recommendations to support sustainable biomass energy strategies in East Africa. We differentiate between tree types of potentials: the supply potential, the access potential, and the production potential. In order to calculate these potentials, we use a spatial Bayesian network that specifically enables accounting for uncertainties in the data and model. The main results show: (1) that agroforestry and small-scale mixed farming are the land use types with the highest potentials, (2) that firewood, charcoal, and biogas have substantial potential, whereas crop residue briquettes and Jatropha oil have only minor potentials, and (3) that such estimates can be subject to substantial uncertainties. Based on these results, we recommend that biomass energy strategies in East Africa consider the specific assets and limiting factors of the various fuel types and land use types in order to improve the supply of sustainable biomass cooking fuels. © 2017 International Energy Initiative

AB  - Biomass energy is considered a clean and sustainable energy source that can reduce the amount of greenhouse gases. Among the different varieties of biomass, the algae can provide a number of different biofuel sources and reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Botryococcus braunii is especially rich in lipids, which can be converted into bioenergy, but it typically grows more slowly. The aim of this study was to optimize the cultivation conditions in order to obtain high growth rates, biomass productivity, and lipid productivity. The effects of illumination and CO2 were studied in 21-day intervals. The cultured B. braunii in this work reached the maximum specific growth rate of 0.553 d−1, and can tolerate CO2 concentrations of up to 10%. An illumination intensity of 6000 lux was identified as the optimum for both biomass and lipid productivities. Compared to the results of other studies, the major components of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) obtained in this study had shorter carbon chains. The percentage of C14:0 and C16:0 in the FAMEs was greater than 70%, indicating potential applications for biojet fuel. © 2017 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Utilization of biofuels in autoignition engines is important but it is an exciting challenge to invent technologies that will harness the unique chemico-physical characteristics of these novel fuels. This study aims to investigate combustion phases (e.g., start of combustion and autoignition duration) along with emission characteristics of a residue-based biodiesel in autoignition engines. The fuel has been successfully derived from residue of a cooking-oil production process and two blends (B10 and B20, referring to 10 and 20% in volume of the biodiesel in the biodiesel-diesel mixture, respectively) along with fossil diesel (B0) were tested in a common-rail single-cylinder engine operating under a range of speeds (1,400, 1,800, and 2,400 revolutions per minute), loads (25-100%), and injection timing conditions (16-24° before top dead center). Combustion phases were extensively analyzed employing different approaches including in-cylinder pressure derivatives, heat release rate, and engine vibration signals, while particle and NOx formation, two major issues of autoignition engines, are also investigated. Equivalent timing between local maximum and minimum values of in-cylinder pressure derivative observed for B0, B10, and B20 [1.5° of crank angle (DCA) approximately] may suggest a minimal effect of blending ratio on autoignition duration, albeit the start of combustion occurs earlier for B10 and B20 (1-2 DCA) with respect to B0. Particle concentration of B20 decreases up to 30% compared with that of its fossil counterpart, and this is one of the major benefits of utilizing biodiesel in autoignition engines. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The application of solid acid catalyst in biodiesel production eliminates the tedious pretreatment of feedstock and eradicates generation of high volume of wastewater. A novel acid catalyst was prepared via sulfonation of incompletely carbonized coconut shell using concentrated sulfuric acid. The design of experiments were performed using four factor-three-level central composite design coupled with response surface methodology to evaluate the interaction between two factors in order to determine the optimum process conditions. A quadratic model was suggested for the prediction of biodiesel yield. The F-value and p-value of the model were 4.02 and 0.0129, respectively, indicate that the model was statistically significant at 95 per cent confidence interval. In addition, R2 value of the model was 0.8364, which indicates the acceptable accuracy of the model. From the optimization study, it was found that the carbonization temperature, carbonization time, sulfonation temperature and sulfonation time were 422 °C, 4 h, 100 °C and 15 h, respectively. At these optimum conditions the predicted and observed biodiesel yield were 88.15 per cent and 88.03 per cent, respectively, which experimentally verified the accuracy of the model. The use of coconut shell-derived solid acid catalyst in biodiesel production promotes the sustainable and green way of operations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) refers to a heterogeneous mixture composed of plastics, paper, metal, food and other miscellaneous items. Local authorities commonly dispose of this waste by either landfill or incineration which are both unsustainable practices. Disposing of organic wastes via these routes is also becoming increasingly expensive due to rising landfill taxes and transport costs. The Thermo-Catalytic Reforming (TCR®) process, is a proposed valorisation route to transform organic wastes and residues, such as MSW, into sustainable energy vectors including (H2 rich synthesis gas, liquid bio-oil and solid char). The aim herein, was to investigate the conversion of the organic fraction of MSW into fuels and chemicals utilising the TCR technology in a 2 kg/h continuous pilot scale reactor. Findings show that MSW was successfully processed with the TCR after carrying out a feedstock pre-treatment step. Approximately, 25 wt.% of the feedstock was converted into phase separated liquids, composed of 19 wt.% aqueous phase and 6 wt.% organic phase bio-oil. The analysis of the bio-oil fraction revealed physical and chemical fuel properties, higher heating value (HHV) of 38 MJ/kg, oxygen content &lt;7 wt.% and water content &lt;4 wt.%. Due to the bio-oil's chemical and physical properties, the bio-oil was found to be directly miscible with fossil diesel when blended at a volume ratio of 50:50. The mass balance closure was 44 wt.% synthesis gas, with a H2 content of 36 vol% and HHV of 17.23 MJ/Nm3, and 31 wt.% char with a HHV of 17 MJ/kg. The production of high quantities of H2 gas and highly de-oxygenated organic liquids makes downstream hydrogen separation and subsequent hydro-deoxygenation of the produced bio-oil a promising upgrading step to achieve drop-in transportation fuels from MSW. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel has emerged as an alternative to partially replace diesel. However, the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acid chains, such as when using soybean oil as starting materials, is associated with several issues due to its low oxidative stability. Other issues, such as the formation of biofilms in fuel storage tanks and unsatisfactory cold properties are also major concerns during the use of biodiesel. Hence, the aim of this work is the modification of the chemical structure of soybean biodiesel in two steps: (i) epoxidation of soybean biodiesel double bonds and (ii) acetylation of the soybean biodiesel epoxide with acetic anhydride, using a heterogeneous catalytic system. The catalyst used for acetylation step was tin oxide supported on alumina. The catalytic system activity was evaluated using different temperature, catalyst/substrate ratio and different anhydrides. Oxidative stability, thermal analysis and anti-microbial activity were evaluated. The products structures were confirmed by infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance. The results show yields up to 98% of the desired product − di-acetylbiodiesel in 10 h and 15% catalyst (w/w). The catalyst could be recycled up to four times with minor activity loss. After acetylation, it was observed an increase in both oxidative stability and biostatic activity. However, the freezing point did not change. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, castor oil (CO) has been investigated as a potential source for biodiesel production in Bangladesh. Castor oil has been extracted from the seeds by mechanical press and the Soxhlet extraction method. Maximum oil content of 55.7% has been found by the Soxhlet extraction method. The physicochemical properties such as free fatty acid (FFA) content, kinematic viscosity, saponification value, and density of the oil have been measured by different standard methods. The FFA content and viscosity have been found considerably higher such as 33.5% and 253 mm2/s, respectively. Biodiesel has been prepared using a three-step method comprising of saponification of oil followed by acidification of the soap and esterification of FFA. The overall yield of FFA from CO is found to be around 89.2%. The final step is esterification that produces fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and a maximum 97.4% conversion of FFA to biodiesel has been observed. The effect of the oil to methanol molar ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, and time has been investigated for esterification reaction and optimized using the response surface methodology. 1H NMR of crude castor oil and castor oil methyl ester (COME) was studied and analyzed that confirms the complete conversion of castor oil to biodiesel. Finally, the biodiesel, produced under optimum conditions, was characterized using the various standard method and found comparable with petro-diesel and biodiesel standard. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Propylsulfonic acid functionalized SiO2 core/alkyl- or phenyl-bridged organosilica shell structured PrSO3H-SiO2@Si(R)Si (R = –C2H4–, –C6H4– or –C6H4–C6H4–) nanospheres are facilely prepared by a CTAB-directed one-pot two-step condensation strategy. The morphological characteristics, textural properties, Brønsted acid nature and structure of the PrSO3H-SiO2@Si(R)Si nanospheres are well characterized. The materials are successfully applied in the catalytic transformation of D-fructose into the important organic chemical, ethyl levulinate, in the presence of ethanol as both reactant and solvent. The catalytic activity of the PrSO3H-SiO2@Si(R)Si nanospheres outperform commercially available Amberlyst-15, HY zeolite and HCl, mainly attributing to their strong Brønsted acid nature; additionally, unique core-shell structure with excellent porosity properties and well-adjusted hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity also give the positive influence on the ethanolysis activity, which can improve the accessibility of the reactants to the PrSO3H sites and facilitate the multi-step ethanolysis reaction proceeding to the formation of the final product. The PrSO3H-SiO2@Si(R)Si nanospheres can be reused three times without obvious activity loss, contributed from covalent bonding of the PrSO3H groups with the silica and organosilica framework as well as hydrophobic PrSO3H-functionalized organosilica shell. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper compares the evaporating spray characteristics of biodiesel and biofuel pure component spray at engine-relevant conditions such as late-cycle postinjection and near top-dead-center injection conditions. The spray characteristics, liquid length, vapor length, and spray vapor area are predicted using an OpenFOAM CFD code. The liquid length of methyl oleate is observed to be longer under late-cycle postinjection conditions, which may lead to the impingement of liquid fuel on the combustion-chamber walls. The liquid length for methyl laurate is shorter than that of methyl oleate at high ambient temperature and density conditions. The vapor length at top-dead-center conditions for all of the biodiesel pure components is similar. The liquid length and vapor length of the straight vegetable oil pure components, triolein and trilaurin, is longer than those of their corresponding biodiesels. The liquid length, vapor length, and spray vapor area for methyl laurate are similar to those of dodecane. The liquid length of all of the pure components is found to be related to the specific energy ratio and boiling temperature of the fuel. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Energetic tobacco (EnT) is a type of genetically modified tobacco with a focus on energy. Its seeds are larger and appear in greater quantity than those of conventional tobacco. This plant easily adapts to unproductive soils and is practically free of nicotine. The oil seed from EnT can be used for producing biodiesel without competition with edible oils. Additionally, the resulting residual cake can be thermally degraded to bio-oil and biochar through pyrolysis processes. In this study, the fast pyrolysis (700 °C at 100 °C min-1) of the residual cake of EnT seeds was performed in a fixed bed reactor (quartz), yielding approximately 40% (in mass) liquid products (bio-oil and an aqueous phase). After removal of the aqueous phase, the organic phase was submitted to an acid-alkaline extraction of the N-compounds in a simple and efficient way. The bio-oil and alkaline extract were analyzed by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to fast-quadrupole mass spectrometry. Compounds were tentatively identified by similarity with a commercial library of mass spectra and using retention indexes. The main classes of compounds identified were phenols, hydrocarbons, and N-compounds (imidazole, pyridine, and their derivatives), with the potential to be applied in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries as well as biofuel production. The alkaline extraction resulted in the isolation of the main N-components, a finding fundamental for the utilization of these compounds for the production of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and polymers. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The biodiesel's importance in the renewable energy scenario is attributed to the lower environmental impact due to sustainability and economic viability. Biodiesel from production and storage is in contact with different metallic materials that catalyze the oxidation reaction and accelerate oxidative degradation. In order to inhibit the oxidative degradation of this biofuel, plant extracts such as rosemary, oregano, basil, sage, and pepper can be added which have phenolic compounds that act as antioxidants. The present research aims to evaluate the influence of iron oxide and iron(III) chloride on the oxidative stability of biodiesel and to identify deviations in reaction activation energy in the presence and absence of natural antioxidant. In the period evaluated, the biodiesel tests with addition of ferric chloride had the lowest oxidative stability; consequently, the oxidative reaction had the highest rate constant. The rate constant of the oxidation reactions increased with the increase in the evaluated period as well as the temperature employed. The samples with ferric chloride showed second-order polynomial behavior, indicating that the activation energy (Ea) is dependent on the reaction temperature. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - To reduce the oxygen content and increase the higher heating value (HHV) of bio-oil, this paper proposed a new method for deoxy-liquefaction of corn stalk in subcritical water with hydrogen generated in situ via aluminum-water reaction. The effects of aluminum on the physicochemical properties of bio-oil were investigated. The bio-oil was analyzed by elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that, when the aluminum content was 30 wt %, the yield of bio-oil reached 26.54 wt %, the deoxidation ratio was 47.92%, and the calorific value increased from 28.86 to 33.77 MJ/kg. The viscosity, acid value, and water content were also significantly improved. FT-IR analysis showed that the types of functional groups in bio-oil were almost unchanged. GC-MS analysis showed that the main components of bio-oil were phenols, ketones, hydrocarbons, and indoles. In addition, the content of aliphatic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons was as high as 36.18% when the aluminum content was 30 wt %. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Particulate matter emissions negatively affect public health and global climate, yet newer fuel-efficient gasoline direct injection engines tend to produce more soot than their port-fuel injection counterparts. Fortunately, the search for sustainable biomass-based fuel blendstocks provides an opportunity to develop fuels that suppress soot formation in more efficient engine designs. However, as emissions tests are experimentally cumbersome and the search space for potential bioblendstocks is vast, new techniques are needed to estimate the sooting tendency of a diverse range of compounds. In this study, we develop a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model of sooting tendency based on the experimental yield sooting index (YSI), which ranks molecules on a scale from n-hexane, 0, to benzene, 100. The model includes a rigorously defined applicability domain, and the predictive performance is checked using both internal and external validation. Model predictions for compounds in the external test set had a median absolute error of â3 YSI units. An investigation of compounds that are poorly predicted by the model lends new insight into the complex mechanisms governing soot formation. Predictive models of soot formation can therefore be expected to play an increasingly important role in the screening and development of next-generation biofuels. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The resurgence of aviation heavy fuel engines (HFEs) and the single fuel concept policy make it important to investigate the application of kerosene in aviation compression ignition engines. From the experience of automotive engines, biofuels, in particular higher alcohols, may offer better combustion and emission characteristics for HFEs. In this study, the combustion performance was analyzed in a commercial aircraft compression ignition engine burning diesel as a baseline fuel and Chinese aviation kerosene fuel (RP-3) blended with pentanol (so-called second generation biofuel) with different blending ratios. The injection timing as the most critical operational parameter was swept from 17 to 23°CA BTDC (crank angle before top dead center) under constant engine speed (1600 rpm) and fixed injection pressure (60 MPa). The indicated thermal efficiency of kerosene-pentanol blend (K60P40) was higher than those of all other test fuels, and the advancement in injection timing caused an increase in combustion temperature which improved both the indicated thermal efficiency and combustion efficiency. The combustion duration was shorter for kerosene-pentanol blends (K60P40 and K80P20) than diesel; however, the combustion duration considerably increased with advancing injection timings for all the test fuels. Kerosene and its pentanol blends showed longer ignition delay compared to baseline diesel due to their lower cetane numbers. The indicated specific fuel consumption (ISFC) values of K80P20 and K60P40 were demonstrated to be lower than that of baseline diesel. This work demonstrated the great potential of kerosene-pentanol fuel blends in aircraft diesel engines without significant modifications. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This contribution describes the development of a chromatographic method capable of simultaneously identifying and quantifying the constituents found in oleaginous biomass - including algae oil - and in biofuel samples through a single cost-effective analysis. Major constituents of the aforementioned analytes include oxygen- and/or nitrogen-containing compounds along with fuel-like hydrocarbons. A novel simulated distillation gas chromatographic (SimDist) technique including dual detection capabilities - specifically flame ionization (FID) and mass spectrometry (MS) - produced identical chromatograms with perfectly aligned signals. FID chromatograms afforded excellent quantitative data while the corresponding MS spectra enabled accurate and thorough compound identification. Simulated distillation data displayed a remarkably linear relationship between retention time and the boiling point of heteroatom-containing compounds in addition to n-alkanes. Indeed, although standard SimDist data were calibrated using the boiling points of n-alkanes, analyses involving other compounds yielded insights into the effect of additional functionalities on both retention time and response factor. Notably, the method developed proved superior relative to commonly employed techniques in the identification and quantification of polyunsaturated fatty acids in algae oil. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - As biofuels are increasingly represented in the fuel market, the use of these oxygenated fuels should be evaluated under various engine operating conditions, such as cold-start. However, to-date quantification has been mostly done under hot-start engine operation. By using a custom test designed for this study, a comparative investigation was performed on exhaust emissions during cold- and hot-start with diesel and three oxygenated fuels based on waste cooking biodiesel and triacetin. This study used a six-cylinder, turbocharged, after-cooled diesel engine with a common rail injection system. The results during cold-start with diesel showed lower NOx (up to 15.4%), PN (up to 48%), PM1 (up to 44%) and PM2.5 (up to 63%). However, the oxygenated fuels during cold-start showed a significant increase in NOx (up to 94%), PN (up to 27 times), PM1 (up to 7.3 times) and PM2.5 (up to 5 times) relative to hot-start. The use of oxygenated fuels instead of diesel during hot-start decreased the PN, PM2.5 and PM1 (up to 91%) while, during cold-start, it only decreased PM1 and PM2.5 at some engine operating modes and increased PN significantly up to 17 times. In both cold- and hot-start, the use of oxygenated fuels resulted in an increase in NOx emission. For cold-start this was up to 125%, for hot-start it was up to 13.9%. In comparison with hot-start, the use of oxygenated fuels during cold-start increased nucleation mode particles significantly, which are harmful. This should be taken into consideration, since cold-start operation is an inevitable part of the daily driving schedule for a significantly high portion of vehicles, especially in cities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Organic acids have primary and secondary sources in the atmosphere, impact ecosystem health, and are useful metrics for identifying gaps in organic oxidation chemistry through model-measurement comparisons. We photooxidized (OH oxidation) primary emissions from diesel and biodiesel fuel types under two engine loads in an oxidative flow reactor. formic, butyric, and propanoic acids, but not methacrylic acid, have primary and secondary sources. Emission factors for these gas-phase acids varied from 0.3-8.4 mg kg-1 fuel. Secondary chemistry enhanced these emissions by 1.1 (load) to 4.4 (idle) × after two OH-equivalent days. The relative enhancement in secondary organic acids in idle versus loaded conditions was due to increased precursor emissions, not faster reaction rates. Increased hydrocarbon emissions in idle conditions due to less complete combustion (associated with less oxidized gas-phase molecules) correlated to higher primary organic acid emissions. The lack of correlation between organic aerosol and organic acid concentrations downstream of the flow reactor indicates that the secondary products formed on different oxidation time scales and that despite being photochemical products, organic acids are poor tracers for secondary organic aerosol formation from diesel exhaust. Ignoring secondary chemistry from diesel exhaust would lead to underestimates of both organic aerosol and gas-phase organic acids. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This paper presents the production of biodiesel from Bauhinia variegata seeds using the solvent extraction technique. This process has attracted considerable attention recently in the renewable energy sector because it can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and subsidize energy security. The solvent extraction technique has a low production cost and low oil residue compared with the other methods. Six different solvents were employed for the separation process; among them, hexane proves to be the best solvent for bio-oil extraction (yield −28.43%) at the temperature of 68°C. The caloric value of B. variegata seeds is 4800 kcal/kg, which makes it a better choice of fuel. Its physicochemical properties such as acid value, calorific value, flash point, saponification value, iodine number, specific gravity, fire point, and kinematic viscosity were determined for bio-oil and compared with diesel. This result supports the production of biodiesel from B. variegata seeds oil as a viable alternative fuel to diesel in an eco-friendly manner. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Concern about the inevitable depletion of global energy resources is rising and many countries are shifting their focus to renewable energy. Biodiesel is one promising energy source that has garnered much public attention in recent years. Many believe that this alternative source of energy will be able to sustain the need for increased energy security while at the same time being friendly to the environment. Public opinion, as well as proactive measures by key players in industry, may play a decisive role in steering the direction of biodiesel development throughout the world. Past studies have suggested that public acceptance of biofuels could be shaped by critical consideration of the risk-benefit perceptions of the product, in addition to the impact on the economy and environment. Results: The purpose of this study was to identify the relevant factors influencing stakeholders' attitudes towards biodiesel derived from crops such as palm oil for vehicle use, as well as to analyse the interrelationships of these factors in an attitude model. A survey of 509 respondents, consisting of various stakeholder groups in the Klang Valley region of Malaysia, was undertaken. The results of the study have substantiated the premise that the most important direct predictor of attitude to biodiesel is the perceived benefits (β = 0.80, p < 0.001). Attitude towards biodiesel also involves the interplay between other factors, such as engagement to biotechnology, trust of key players, attitude to technology, and perceived risk. Conclusion: Although perceived benefit has emerged as the main predictor of public support of biodiesel, the existence of other significant interactions among variables leads to the conclusion that public attitude towards biodiesel should be seen as a multi-faceted process and should be strongly considered prior to its commercialisation. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Use of bio-based diesel is increasing in Europe. It is currently produced from oilseed crops, but can also be generated from lignocellulosic biomass such as straw. However, removing straw affects soil organic carbon (SOC), with potential consequences for the climate impact of the biofuel. This study assessed the climate impacts and energy balance of biodiesel production from straw using oleaginous yeast, with subsequent biogas production from the residues, with particular emphasis on SOC changes over time. It also explored the impact of four different scenarios for returning the lignin fraction of the biomass to soil to mitigate SOC changes. Climate impact was assessed using two methods, global warming potential (GWP) and a time-dependent temperature model (ΔT s ) that describes changes in mean global surface temperature as a function of time or absolute temperature change potential (AGTP). Results: Straw-derived biodiesel reduced GWP by 33-80% compared with fossil fuels and primary fossil energy use for biodiesel production was 0.33-0.80 MJprim/MJ, depending on the scenario studied. Simulations using the time-dependent temperature model showed that a scenario where all straw fractions were converted to energy carriers and no lignin was returned to soil resulted in the highest avoided climate impact. The SOC changes due to straw removal had a large impact on the results, both when using GWP and the time-dependent temperature model. Conclusions: In a climate perspective, it is preferable to combust straw lignin to produce electricity rather than returning it to the soil if the excess electricity replaces natural gas electricity, according to results from both GWP and time-dependent temperature modelling. Using different methods to assess climate impact did not change the ranking between the scenarios, but the time-dependent temperature model provided information about system behaviour over time that can be important for evaluation of biofuel systems, particularly in relation to climate target deadlines. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - It is a great challenge for even the most complex refineries to ensure an economic yield distribution that satisfies the increased diesel fuel and biofuel consumption of the European Union. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the use of different gas oil fractions (e.g. low value streams) for producing diesel fuel blending components and the integration possibilities of biofuel production to a refinery. According to that the co-hydrogenation of mixtures of fatty acid by-products (0–20%) and different gas oil fractions (untreated gas oil fraction, light cycle oil) on commercial, sulphided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst was investigated. The effects of feed compositions and process parameters (temperature, pressure, liquid hourly space velocity) on the quality and quantity of the gas oil products were investigated. The applied process parameters were the following: P = 40–70 bar, T = 320–380 °C, LHSV = 1.0–2.0 h−1, hydrogen/feedstock ratio = 600 Nm3/m3. We concluded that gas oil boiling range products with high yield can be produced from 10 to 20% fatty acid by-product and 10% light cycle oil containing feedstocks on the studied catalyst. The products are good quality diesel fuel blending components and have high waste derived component content. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel by non-edible oils via ultrasonic cavitational technique offers a unique and novel approach towards waste management. This study aims to synthesis biodiesel from two non-edible sources namely; Salvadora alii oil and Thespesia populneoides oil. Transesterification was carried out in the presence of solid base calcium oxide catalyst while using an ultrasonic cavitation (UC) reactor. Parametric optimisation was conducted by central composite design and response surface methodology. Results revealed that optimum condition to obtain maximum yield (≈92 wt %) of Salvadora alii methyl ester was as; molar ratio = 10:1 (alcohol: oil), catalyst amount = 3 wt %, and amplitude = 50% in 30 min of reaction time. Similarly, optimum condition was found satisfactory to render maximum yield (≈88.6 wt %) of Thespesia populenoides methyl ester as molar ratio = 6:1 (alcohol: oil), catalyst amount = 3.5 wt %, and amplitude = 45% in 30 min of reaction time. At obtained optimised values UC was compared with mechanical stirring (MS). UC showed 3 fold higher reaction constants and 3 fold more time efficiency than MS. The superiority of UC over MS can be established. Biomass waste to biofuel can make biodiesel synthesis towards cleaner fuel. These results suggest that combination of non-edible oils and UC technology have the potential to make cleaner process. Most of the fuel properties were met the EN 14214 and ASTM D 6751 standards. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation of sugar alcohols can be tuned to produce monofunctional oxygenates for use as jet or diesel fuel precursors. However, the catalysts typically utilize precious metals and are not highly selective. Here, the hydrodeoxygenation of aqueous sorbitol was studied over a Co/TiO2 catalyst to produce monofunctionals at a 56 C% yield. The majority of these species are alcohols (69%) or heterocycles (23%) while ketones and aldehydes are readily hydrogenated. 67% of the monofunctionals are C5-C6. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry provided evidence for the coupling of C3 and C6 oxygenates to C9+ oligomeric species, which likely fragment and deoxygenate to form C1-C6 monofunctionals and gases. Co/TiO2 deactivation occurred irreversibly due to sintering and leaching promoted by oxygenated species. Our results suggest that low-cost base metal catalysts can be as effective as many precious metal catalysts for monofunctional production from sorbitol toward heavy fuels if catalyst deactivation issues can be overcome. The production of jet- and diesel-range hydrocarbons from aqueous carbohydrate solutions remains a challenge, in part due to high catalyst costs and low product selectivities. Here, monofunctional fuel precursors were produced using low-cost Co/TiO2 at yields exceeding those from costly noble metal catalysts. The majority of these monofunctionals are C5-C6 alcohols and heterocycles, which can be coupled and hydrotreated into distillate-range hydrocarbons. FT-ICR MS shows the formation of C9 and C12 oligomers, which are likely intermediates in the hydrodeoxygenation route. This study shows that low-cost base metals can be effectively utilized in this chemistry if catalyst deactivation challenges, due to sintering and leaching, can be overcome for this type of catalyst. Monofunctional fuel precursors (alcohols and heterocycles) can be produced through the hydrodeoxygenation of the C6 polyol sorbitol using Co/TiO2 at yields exceeding those from expensive noble metal catalysts. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The main goals for sustainable water resource recovery include maximizing energy generation, minimizing adverse environmental impacts, and recovering beneficial resources. Wastewater biosolids pyrolysis is a promising technology that could help facilities reach these goals because it produces biochar that is a valuable soil amendment as well as bio-oil and pyrolysis gas (py-gas) that can be used for energy. The raw bio-oil, however, is corrosive; therefore, employing it as fuel is challenging using standard equipment. A novel pyrolysis process using wastewater biosolids-derived biochar (WB-biochar) as a catalyst was investigated to decrease bio-oil and increase py-gas yield for easier energy recovery. WB-biochar catalyst increased the py-gas yield nearly 2-fold, while decreasing bio-oil production. The catalyzed bio-oil also contained fewer constituents based on GC-MS and GC-FID analyses. The energy shifted from bio-oil to py-gas, indicating the potential for easier on-site energy recovery using the relatively clean py-gas. The metals contained in wastewater biosolids played an important role in upgrading pyrolysis products. The Ca and Fe in WB-biochar reduced bio-oil yield and increased py-gas yield. The py-gas energy increase may be especially useful at water resource recovery facilities that already combust anaerobic digester biogas for energy since it may be possible to blend biogas and py-gas for combined use. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The upgrade of acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) mixture from biomass to high-value biofuels has aroused increasing attention. However, a reported heterogeneous catalyst, metal-containing MgAl-hydrotalcite (HT), is confronted with a serious water-resistance problem due to an inherent memory effect of HT materials. With the aim of exploring catalysts with improved water-resistance, metal-containing MgO-SiO2 catalysts were synthesized and evaluated. An investigation on the effect of metal type including Ni, Cu, Fe, Zn, and Co, metal loading, and reaction temperature on catalytic performance indicates that the 10 wt % Ni-MgO-SiO2 catalyst provides the best catalytic performance, giving a yield of 81.5% to C5-C15 ketones and alcohols at 240 °C. As expected, the catalyst exhibits an excellent water-resistance. It could tolerate up to 3 wt % water, which was much higher than 0.5 wt % over that of Cu- or Pd-HT as reported. Results from XRD and 29Si MAS NMR analyses indicate that the high water-resistance could be ascribed to the more stable structure of magnesium silicates formed in the catalyst than HT materials. For a further study of the effect of catalyst property on catalytic performance, 10 wt % Ni-SiO2, 10 wt % Ni-MgO, and 10 wt % Ni-MgO-SiO2 catalysts were investigated and characterized. Results from CO2-TPD, pyridine-IR, and NH3-TPD analyses reveal that the catalytic performance is significantly affected by an acid-base property. Obtaining a high catalytic performance necessitates a cooperation of enough acidic sites and basic sites. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Algae biodiesel (BioD) and renewable diesel (RD) have been recognized as potential solutions to mitigating fossil-fuel consumption and the associated environmental issues. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been used by many researchers to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of these algae-derived fuels, yielding a wide range of results and, in some cases, even differing on indicating whether these fuels are preferred to petroleum-derived fuels or not. This meta-analysis reviews the methodological preferences and results for energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and water consumption for 54 LCA studies that considered algae BioD and RD. The significant variation in reported results can be primarily attributed to the difference in scope, assumptions, and data sources. To minimize the variation in life cycle inventory calculations, a harmonized inventory data set including both nominal and uncertainty data is calculated for each stage of the algae-derived fuel life cycle. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel and its additives have become interesting options for fossil fuel-based engines in the view of sustainable energy development. A biodiesel mix was used in this work to show the possibility of utilization of different biofuels. Experimental investigation was carried out on a direct-injection constant-speed (1500 rpm) diesel engine at different injection pressures of 180, 220 and 260 bar with natural aspiration and supercharging modes. The fuels selected are blends of diesel and used cooking oil biodiesel, with a mix of algae biodiesel. The brake specific fuel consumption of the engine was low at lower injection pressures and further lowered with supercharging operation. Brake thermal efficiency values improved with the reduction of injection pressures and the same was observed with supercharging. The NOx emissions increased with the rise in injection pressures due to rise in maximum temperature; unburnt hydrocarbon emissions were slightly increased with the rise in injection pressure. The algae biodiesel was used as an additive to increase the stability of biodiesel; it has been observed that the stability of biodiesel increases with addition of algae biodiesel. The overall observation indicates that a moderate injection pressure of 220 bar is advisable. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - A high-pressure/high-temperature reactor was used in batch and continuous mode to obtain hydrotreated cracked vegetable oil (HCVO). The effect of six catalysts such as Pt and Pd on active carbon, CoMo, NiMo and Pt+Pd on Al2O3 and ZSM-5 were investigated in batch experiments for cracked vegetable oil (CVO) upgrading. CVO was produced in-house from rapeseed oil. Reaction conditions were 300–380 °C at 50–150 bar hydrogen. The stripped and condensed product was gathered continuously in intervals of 30–60 min. Both, batch and continuous products were separated into an oil phase and a water phase. Physical properties were determined, including higher heating value (HHV), acid/iodine number, viscosity, density and elemental composition. HCVO showed HHV up to 46.6 MJ/kg (CVO: 43.5 MJ/kg), acid number of 2.8 mgKOH/g (CVO: 80.5 mgKOH/g) and oxygen content of 0.32 wt% (CVO: 5.27 wt%). HHV of HCVO is in the range of fossil diesel fuel. Pt/C is the most suitable catalyst for the production of HCVO under the used experimental conditions. HCVO may be used as a fossil fuel substitute based on renewable raw material. GCMS-FID was used for the quantitative analysis of composition. Up to 73 wt% of the samples were quantifiable. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This research article demonstrates biodiesel synthesis through the methanolysis of the oily contents (4.02 ± 0.27% w/w on dried basis) of Dictyota dichotoma collected from the coast of Hawksbay, Pakistan. The metal oxides (CaO, MgO, ZnO, and TiO2) used as nanocatalysts were refluxed (5% K2SO4), calcinated (850 °C) and characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) which produced 93.2% w/w FAME (biodiesel) at relatively mild condition (5% catalyst, 65 °C, 3 h, 18:1 molar ratio) using CaO. Whereas, MgO, ZnO, and TiO2 produced 92.4%, 72.5%, and 31.8% w/w FAME, respectively at elevated condition (225 °C). Thus, CaO was considered to be the best catalyst among the others. This tri-phase reaction require continuous fast mixing and the yield depends on the reaction parameters like catalyst amount, temperature, reaction time and molar ratio (methanol: oil). The reusability of these heterogeneous catalysts simplified the purification step, reduced the waste generation and make the final product technically and economically viable. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Waste from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) for Helianthus annuus L. production may be a viable solution to obtain biodiesel. This study achieved two objectives: assess the agronomical viability of waste (wastewater and sludge) from the Alcázar de San Juan WWTP in central Spain for H. annuus L. production; use H. annuus L. seeds grown in this way to obtain biodiesel. Five study plots, each measuring 6 m × 6 m (36 m2), were set up on the agricultural land near the Alcázar de San Juan WWTP. Five fertilizer treatment types were considered: drinking water, as the control; treated wastewater; 10 t ha−1 of air-dried sewage sludge; 20 t ha−1 of air-dried sewage sludge; 0.6 t ha−1 of commercial inorganic fertilizer. Soil, irrigation water, sewage sludge, crop development and fatty acid composition in achenes oil were monitored. The 20 t ha–1 dose of sewage sludge proved effective to grow H. annuus L. with similar results to those grown with a commercial fertilizer. However, precautions should be taken when irrigating with wastewater because of high salinity and nutrient deficiency. Sunflower oil was composed mostly of linoleic and oleic acid. The remaining fatty acids were linolenic, estearic, nervonic, palmitoleic, and palmitic. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Fast depletion of fossil fuels, rapid increase in the prices of petroleum products and harmful exhaust emissions from the engine are the driving factors in undertaking this research for finding the suitable alternative fuels. The present work deals with the Performance, Emission and Combustion characteristics of Biodiesel derived from acidic oil, which is a by-product of soybean oil refining process. Biodiesel was extracted using two-step esterification and transesterification process from the raw acidic oil. Different blends were prepared on the volume basis and one separate blend was prepared using 2% antigel additives in one of the combination. Tests were conducted with diesel and prepared blends on single cylinder, four strokes, multi-fuel, water cooled engine at compression ratio of 17.5 with different loading conditions. Present investigation indicates reduction in performance parameters as the engine is fuelled with different blends of biodiesel, but significant changes are observed with regard to combustion parameters and reduction in CO, HC. Further, increase in NOx, CO2 is observed during the use of similar blends of bio-diesel. Further the same engine is run with the addition of 2% Antigel Additives in one of the blend, BD20, which has given results which include significant reduction in BSFC, exhaust gas temperature, NOx percentage and integrated heat release rate. Simultaneously it is associated with increase in brake thermal efficiency, HC and CO percentage and peak in cylinder pressure. The prospective results have opened a new avenue of opportunity with regard to conversion of available waste oil to useful biofuel. © 2017 AMSE Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, 18 soapnut biodiesel-diesel blends along with soapnut oil as an additive in some blends were prepared and used in a diesel engine to investigate the effect of oxygen content in the fuel blends on engine performance and emission characteristics. Considering the large variations in the oxygen content of these fuel blends, the obtained results were demonstrated based on varying fuel oxygen content. Findings showed that the best engine performance was achieved with a fuel oxygen content in the range of 1.8%-3.0%, whereas the best engine emissions were obtained with a fuel oxygen content in the range of 0.71%-2.37%. Hence, considering both engine performance and emissions, the optimal zone of fuel oxygen content was found to be in the range of 1.80%- 2.37%. Thus, it can be concluded that biodiesel blended fuels having an oxygen content in the aforesaid range can be successfully used in diesel engines with comparable engine performance and emissions to those using diesel fuel. Nevertheless, further research is required to reduce the fuel oxygen content to this optimal range if the blends consist of higher biofuel components. Besides that, the use of suitable additives in the biodiesel blended fuels may be a viable option to achieve the said purpose, which needs further research. © 2017, Universiti Malaysia Pahang.

AB  - Biodiesel from higher plants has a number of limitations like burden on limited agricultural land and fresh water resources, especially in poor developing nations. On the other hand wastelands can be effectively used for the cultivation of microalgae and potential yields from many green algae have been reported to be many folds to that obtained from the oil crops. Productivity in natural habitats is generally limited by low nitrogen and phosphorus content. Present study deals with the application of main nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus stress conditions commonly found in natural water bodies on stimulating the biofuel components oils in Chlorella vulgaris, a unicellular freshwater green alga and a potential feedstock for biodiesel. Oils from the algal biomass were extracted in chloroform-methanol (2:1) and identified by GC-MS. Significantly reduced concentrations of the nutrients Ca(NO3)2 and K2HPO4 from the control values of Chu-10 medium positively affected the oil content without much affecting the growth. There was also a significant effect on the relative ratios of various types of oils produced by the algal strain in response to the nutrient stress conditions. Mostly C14 to C26 fatty acids were identified, with palmitic, oleic and stearic acids being the major ones. The relative proportion of the desirable biofuel component, palmitic acid, was increased significantly under NO3- and PO43-stress conditions. These findings suggest that monitoring the concentrations of a few nutrients may lead to significant enhancement in quantity as well as the desirable biofuel components with substantial growth for commercial cultivation of C. vulgaris for bioenergy production. © 2017, SciTechnol, All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The paper aims to analyse the relationship between energy prices (biodiesel, crude oil) and food commodities - vegetable oils used also as feedstock for biodiesel production. The econometric technique of price transmission, such as unit root test, cointegration test and vector error correction model, is applied to assess the interdependencies between energy prices and vegetable oil prices in Germany. Results suggest close price linkages between prices of vegetable oils and biodiesel and confirm that the vegetable oil prices drive the price dynamics of biodiesel. However, the simultaneous relationship is only revealed between biodiesel and soybean oil prices. The increase in crude oil prices is found to lead to an upward trend in the vegetable oils used for biodiesel production, thus influencing biodiesel prices as well.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the effects of temperature on the yield and properties of the subfractions derived from the pyrolysis of seed cakes of Calophyllum inophyllum. The seed cake of Calophyllum inophyllum, a large evergreen tree found in southern coastal belts of India, was Pyrolysed in three different temperatures of 450 °C, 500 °C and 550 °C in a fixed bed batch type reactor at a constant heating rate of 30 °C/minute and average particle size of 1.44 mm. The sub fractions were characterized by analytical techniques like FTIR, GC–MS and GC along with physicochemical characterization using ASTM D7544 standard. The highest yield of bio-oil was observed in the pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C above which the gas yield increases due to secondary cracking of volatiles. Major changes in FTIR spectra and peak area of GC–MS were observed for the products derived in three different temperature conditions. Proximate and ultimate analysis showed the significant changes in the composition of char obtained at various temperatures. It was observed that H/C and O/C ratio of biochar decreased with increase in operating temperature. Among the physicochemical of bio-oil, kinematic viscosity decreased by 21.32% as the pyrolysis temperature was increased from 450 °C to 550 °C whereas water content increased by 19.73% in the same temperature range. Meanwhile, other properties like calorific value, density and cetane number showed minor variations for the bio-oil obtained at dissimilar temperatures. The results proved that the pyrolysis temperature affects the properties of the products in a wide range. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW), disposed of at open dumping sites, poses health risks, contaminates surface water, and releases greenhouse gasses such as methane. However, pyrolysis offers the opportunity to convert MSW into Bio-Oil (BO) for clean energy resource. In this paper, an MSW sample consisting of plastic, paper and cardboard, rubber and textiles, and vegetable waste is pyrolysed on a laboratory scale in a fixed-bed vacuum reactor. In the non-isothermal process, the sample was fed into the reactor and then heated. In the isothermal process, the reactor is first heated and then the sample is added. The non-isothermal process created greater BO in both quality and quantity. The BO had a larger amount of gasoline species than diesel-48 fuel, with at 33.44%the BO produced by isothermal pyrolysis and 36.42% in non-isothermal pyrolysis. However the product of isothermal pyrolysis had a higher acid content that reduced its heating value. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper develops a lifecycle economic analysis (LCEA) model that integrates endogenous input substitution into the standard lifecycle analysis (LCA) of biofuel that typically assumes fixed-proportions production. We use the LCEA model to examine impacts of a pure carbon tax and a revenue-neutral tax-subsidy policy on lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from cellulosic ethanol using forest residues as feedstock in Washington State. In a model allowing for input substitution in the cellulosic ethanol feedstock, conversion, and transportation process, we consider energy source substitution (woody biomass for coal in the cellulosic ethanol conversion plant and biodiesel for diesel in feedstock production and feedstock and ethanol transportation) as well as substitution of capital and labor for energy in all stages of the lifecycle. We find that ignoring endogenous input substitution by using standard LCA leads to substantial underestimation of the impact of carbon tax policies on carbon emissions. Both tax policies can substantially reduce carbon emissions by inducing substitution among inputs. The revenue-neutral tax-subsidy policy reduces emissions more effectively than the carbon tax policy for carbon tax rates currently in place throughout most of the world. It stimulates substitution of woody biomass for coal and biodiesel for diesel at much lower tax rates when accompanied by corresponding subsidies for reduced emissions from renewable sources. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present work investigates the thermochemical valorization of camelina straw, which is a waste generated during the harvesting of Camelina sativa, an oilseed crop for the production of biodiesel or hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO). In particular, it is focused on obtaining bio-oil via thermal or catalytic fast pyrolysis, which would be the first stage on a sequence of chemical processes for biofuel production. The catalytic interference of the inorganic matter present in the biomass was studied by preparing a batch of de-ashed camelina straw by washing with diluted nitric acid. Chemical analysis revealed this treatment effectively removed alkaline (K and Na) and alkaline earth (Ca and Mg) metals. Pyrolysis of de-ashed camelina straw led to higher mass and energy yields of bio-oil in water-free basis (bio-oil*), but with higher oxygen concentration. Catalytic pyrolysis over HZSM-5 was also studied in both raw and de-ashed feedstocks. This catalyst promoted mainly decarbonylation and decarboxylation reactions of the pyrolysis vapors, leading to much higher gas yields and lower of bio-oil*, but with better quality. Catalytic pyrolysis of untreated camelina straw exhibited a synergetic effect between both the inorganic matter and the external HZSM-5 catalyst, so that bio-oil* yield was the lowest (20 wt%) due to an extensive deoxygenation (18 wt% oxygen content), which resulted in the highest HHV obtained (37.3 MJ/kgdb). Significant differences were also found on the molecular composition of the bio-oils* with larger proportion of anhydro sugars when the biomass was de-ashed, while HZSM-5 strongly promoted the formation of oxygenated aromatics and aromatic hydrocarbons. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Biomass conversion to chemicals and fuels through fast pyrolysis shows great potential but requires a more fundamental approach for its deployment. To this end, molecular-based kinetic modeling is starting to play a central role in the prediction of the molecular composition of bio-oil. A molecular-level representation of biomass provides the start point for the generation of detailed pyrolysis reaction networks for both the condensed and the gas phases. Significant progress has been made for cellulose, glucose-based carbohydrates, and lignin, together with the incorporation of the catalytic effects of minerals. Ab initio techniques are widely used to discriminate between reaction mechanisms and to calculate kinetic parameters. Automatic kinetic model generation is expected to play an even more important role in fast pyrolysis as it does already today. Experimental techniques enabled to obtain intrinsic kinetics and to decouple the timescales between reaction kinetics and analytic techniques. This greatly benefits the improvement of detailed kinetic models. The prospects for achieving a first-principles based kinetic model of biomass fast pyrolysis are promising. However, significant work is still needed to couple condensed- and gas-phase reaction networks. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Sustainable policies led to partially replace fossil diesel fuel by biodiesel. However, other technologies, such as diesel–biodiesel–ethanol (DBE) blends, are being investigated. The major challenge related to these mixtures is the improvement in the miscibility and the stability of alcohol in diesel fuel. The stabilization effect of ternary additives, composed of biodiesel and vegetal oil from two renewable sources (soybean and castor oil) and n-butanol obtained through Doehlert designs of experiments, was assessed. This article initially investigated blends with commercial Brazilian diesel S10 fuel with 7 vol% of biodiesel, B7, and hydrous ethanol. However, adequacy to potential future fuels was investigated for Brazilian diesel S10 fuel with up to 30 vol% of biodiesel and anhydrous ethanol. The best additive was defined as a mixture of 72.5 vol% of castor oil, 17.5 vol% of soybean biodiesel and 10 vol% of n-butanol in diesel B15 fuel. Diversity on the carbon chain length and moieties in the additive was required to improve the miscibility of ethanol in diesel fuel. Nevertheless, high content of n-butanol did not contribute to stabilization since it acted as an extraction solvent. The results also showed that a minimum addition of 1.0 vol% was required to have a sufficient short-term and long-term stability in diesel B15 blends at temperatures higher than 10 °C and anhydrous ethanol content up to 20 vol%. Using such blends, the displacement of fossil fuel demand by biofuels can be increased from 7 to 33 vol%. © 2017, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.

AB  - The use of lignocellulosic biomass is one of the promising technologies for the production of energy carriers (bioalcohols, biosyngas) and valuable chemicals. Lignocellulosic biofuels may be thought of as a material capable of substantially replacing oil to provide an efficient consumption of natural energy resources and an improvement of the environment. In the “bioreactor–membrane separator–catalytic reactor (converter)" circuit, all stages are considered to be key: (1) the pretreatment of lignocellulose and the development of fermentation, particularly the cultivation of novel strains of bacteria; (2) the design of energyefficient vapor/gas-phase membrane systems for (a) concentrating bioalcohols and (b) controlling the biosyngas composition; and (3) the development of catalyst systems for the conversion of bioalcohols to motor fuel components. The following sequential tasks are discussed in this brief review: (i) basic approaches to the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass aimed at preparing it for fermentation and enzymatic processing of lignocellulose, particularly the cultivation of novel strains of bacteria and their communities, to produce bioalcohols— ethanol and butanol—and thermochemical methods of lignocellulose conversion to products in the form of complex mixtures; (ii) the development of energy-efficient membrane concentrating of bioalcohols using hydrophilic and/or organophilic polymer membranes and the control of the composition of synthesis gas in the form of a multicomponent gas mixture using commercial gas-separation membranes; and (iii) the development of catalyst systems exhibiting high selectivity in the ethanol conversion to alkane and aromatic hydrocarbons (high-quality additives to motor fuels) and valuable olefins, particularly ethylene, propylene, and linear alpha-olefins up to C10. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Environmental building recommendations aimed towards new environmental policies and management-changing decisions which as example demonstrated in consideration of the problems of Canadian oil sands operators. For the implementation of the circular economic strategy, we use an in-depth analysis of reported environmental after-consequence on all stages of the production process. The study addressed the promotion of innovative solutions for greenhouse gas emission, waste mitigation, and risk of falling in oil prices for operators of oil sands with creating market opportunities. They include the addition of microalgae biomass in tailings ponds for improvement of the microbial balance for the water speedily cleaning, recycling, and reusing with mitigation of GHG emissions. The use of food scraps for the nutrition of microalgae will reduce greenhouse gas emission minimally, on 0.33 MtCO2eq for Alberta and 2.63 MtCO2eq/year for Canada. Microalgae-derived biofuel can reduce this emission for Alberta on 11.9–17.9 MtCO2eq and for Canada on 71–106 MtCO2eq/year, and the manufacturing of other products will adsorb up to 135.6 MtCO2 and produce 99.2 MtO2. The development of the Live Conserve Industry and principal step from non-efficient protection of the environment to its cultivation in a large scale with mitigation of GHG emission and waste as well as generating of O2 and value-added products by the use of microalgae opens an important shift towards a new design and building of a biological system. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - In a diesel engine, diesel particulate filter is used to reduce particle matter emissions. Diesel particulate filter requires periodic regenerations under high-temperature conditions in the exhaust pipe in order to oxidize the accumulated soot. A common strategy to produce high exhaust gas temperature is to inject late post-injections after the main injection. However, this practice may dilute the engine oil, causing engine wear. Biofuel addition to petroleum diesel may increase oil dilution even more. This is related to the fuel spray characteristics, the post-injection control and the vaporization process of fuel in engine oil. In this study, spray properties of late post-injection were studied with petroleum diesel and two types of transport biofuel blends containing 30% either fatty acid methyl ester or hydro-treated vegetable oil. Three different late post-injection timings were investigated. Image sequences of the main spray flame as well as the non-combusting late post-injection spray were extracted. In order to verify oil dilution during regeneration cycle and late post-injection, oil samples from six-cylinder test engine were analyzed. According to the present experiments, differences in the spray characteristics are not significant with the tested fuels. However, higher oil dilution rates were observed with fuel blend composed of 30% fatty acid methyl ester. All the studied late post-injection timings were noted to lead to the unwanted cylinder spray/wall interaction and wall-wetting consequently diluting the engine oil. The spray/wall interaction is thoroughly explained by introducing a theoretical/computational framework which characterizes any spray/wall interaction in terms of a phase diagram for any considered operation conditions. The novelty of this study arises from (1) first comparison of fatty acid methyl ester and hydro-treated vegetable oil blends in an optical engine, (2) strong evidence on the phenomena related to post-injection phase in six-cylinder and single-cylinder optical engine configurations and (3) the development of a single-droplet model showing inevitable wall-wetting. © IMechE 2016.

AB  - This work aims to investigate the de-acidification of organic liquid products, obtained by catalytic cracking of palm oil (Elaeis guineensis Jacq) using Na2CO3 as catalyst, by fractional distillation. The distillation of OLP carried out in laboratory, using columns of different heights with and without reflux, and in pilot scale. OLP and distillation fractions physicochemical characterized for density, kinematic viscosity, acid value, saponification value, refractive index, ester index, free fatty acids, flash point, and copper strip corrosion. The OLP analyzed by GC–MS and FT-IR, and light diesel-like fractions by FT-IR, NMR, and GC–MS. The experiments carried out in laboratory scale with and without reflux showed biofuels (distillates) yields between 62.15 and 76.41% and 71.65 and 89.44% (wt.), respectively, while that in pilot scale was 32.68% (wt.). For the experiments in laboratory scale, the yields of distillates decrease exponentially with column height, with and without reflux, while those of bottoms products increase exponentially. In addition, the yields of distillates and gas increase with increasing Na2CO3 content, while that of bottom products decrease. The yield of light diesel-like fractions, with and without reflux ranged between 48.82 and 63.18, and 20.23 and 21.43% (wt.), respectively. The column height had no significant effect on the density of distillation fractions, with and without reflux. The densities of gasoline, kerosene, and light diesel with reflux, superpose exactly those of kerosene, light diesel, and heavy diesel without reflux. The kinematic viscosity of distillation fractions decreases with increasing column height for the experiments with and without reflux, while the acid values decrease. For the distillation experiments in pilot scale, the acid values of gasoline, kerosene, and light diesel-like fractions were 0.33, 0.42, and 0.34 mg KOH/g. FT-IR of distillation fractions in pilot scale and NMR of light diesel-like fraction in laboratory scale, column height of 50 cm, under reflux identified the presence of aliphatic hydrocarbons and the absence of carbonyl groups. The GC–MS analysis identified in OLP composition 92.84% (area.) hydrocarbons and 7.16% (area.) oxygenates. The light diesel-like fraction contains 100% hydrocarbons with an acid value of 0.34 mg KOH/g, density of 0.7862 g/cm3, and kinematic viscosity of 1.52 mm2 s−1, proving the feasibility of OLP de-acidification by fractional distillation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Phosphorus and nitrogen are essential components of microalgal growth media. Critical to a wide range of biochemical processes, they commonly limit primary productivity. Recycling elemental phosphorus and fixed nitrogen after fuel conversion via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of algae biomass reduces the need for mined phosphorus and synthetic nitrogen resources. Scenedesmus obliquus DOE 0152.Z and Chlorella sorokiniana DOE1412 were used as test organisms in assessing nutrient recycle of phosphorus from filtered solids collected downstream of the HTL reactor and nitrogen collected from the aqueous phase after gravimetric biocrude separation. Maximum specific growth rates were measured in growth media using HTL waste as the sole source of either phosphorus or nitrogen and were compared to an algal growth medium control (BG-11). The maximum specific growth rate of both organisms in the recycled phosphorus medium were nearly identical to rates observed in the control medium. Both organisms showed significantly reduced growth rates in the recycled nitrogen medium. C. sorokiniana DOE1412 adapted after several days of exposure whereas S. obliquus DOE0152.Z exhibited poor adaptability to the recycled nitrogen medium. After adaptation, growth rates observed with C. sorokiniana DOE1412 in the recycled nitrogen medium were 3.02 (± 0.13) day− 1, 89% of the control medium (3.40 ± 0.21). We further tested maximum specific growth rates of C. sorokiniana DOE1412 in a medium derived entirely from HTL byproducts, completely replacing all components including nitrogen and phosphorus. In this medium we observed rates of 2.70 ± 0.05 day− 1, 79% of the control. Adding trace metals to this recycled medium improved growth rates significantly to 3.10 ± 0.10, 91% of the control, indicating a critical element is lost in the conversion process. Recycling elemental resources such as phosphorus and nitrogen from the HTL biofuel conversion process can provide a significant reduction in media cost and improves the prospects for industrial scale, algae-based biofuels. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - We examine four discontinuities in the ethanol content in blended gasoline fuel, mandated by Brazil’s central government over the period 2010–13, to test the joint hypotheses that (1) atmospheric ozone production in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area is limited by the volume and reactivity of volatile organic compounds (VOC-limited) and (2) increased ethanol use in the gasoline-ethanol vehicle fleet leads to higher ozone concentrations in urban Sao Paulo’s ambient air. We adopt a regression discontinuity design (RDD) and flexibly test each discontinuity separately. Our finding that ozone levels actually increased with ethanol penetration on each of the four occasions is consistent with a recent empirical study that used different identifying variation and contrasts with a modeling study of Sao Paulo’s atmosphere that predicted significant ozone abatement from hypothetical ethanol use. We find no significant relationship between ethanol versus gasoline use and PM2.5 levels. Current tailpipe emissions standards prescribe the exclusion of the mass of unburned ethanol that is emitted—our results suggest that this standard be reviewed. Following decades of VOC emissions control, urban areas in the United States and elsewhere that are currently VOC-limited may see ozone levels rise if and when they adopt mid-level ethanol gasoline blends, whether to meet the Renewable Fuel Standard or Intended Nationally Determined Contributions to abating fossil fuel emissions agreed upon at COP21 in Paris. © 2017 by The Association of Environmental and Resource Economists.

AB  - Biodiesel for combustible engine is available as mixture of fossil diesel and fatty esters obtained by transesterification of vegetable oils. The use of biodiesel reduces the amount of SOx, mainly. However, it was already observed that biodiesel has a different behavior in environment in cases of accidental spill and groundwater contamination. It was noticed that the biodegradation of hydrocarbons (cyclic and aliphatic) in the presence of biodiesel are speeded, although the mechanism is still unclear. Considering the chemical structure of fatty esters, it was investigated the formation of aggregates in water solution by fatty esters present in commercial biodiesel. In Brazil, biodiesel is composed by 95% of fossil diesel and 5% of fatty esters mixture. In this work, fatty esters were treated as neutral surfactant, i.e., it was treated as a molecule with polar and non-polar part. Turbidity and fluorescence were used to determine the critical aggregates concentration (CAC). Water solutions containing fatty esters were examined exploiting changes in turbidity and fluorescence intensity of pyrene. Abrupt changes were attributed to aggregates formation, following the same behavior of traditional amphiphilic compounds. It was determined the CAC for ethyl palmitate, ethyl stearate, ethyl oleate, and ethyl linoleate. The values of CAC for fatty esters varied from 1.91 to 4.27 μmol/L, while CAC for the mixture of esters (biodiesel) was 2.01 for methyl esters and 1.19 for ethyl esters, both prepared using soybean oil. The aggregates formation was also determined by fluorescence measurements considering the changes in intensity of peaks I and III of pyrene. Pyrene senses the changes in environment polarity. The values found of CAC by fluorescence for individual ethyl esters varied from 1.85 to 3.21 μmol/L, while mixtures of ethyl esters was 2.23 and 2.07 μmol/L for mixture of methyl esters. The results clearly showed that fatty esters form aggregates and might be responsible for speed degradation of compounds by accommodation of them in inner part of aggregates. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Biopropane made by hydrogenating vegetable or animal oil/fat is being commercialized as a biofuel alternative to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Its carbon footprint has been calculated from field to tank, using public data for each process in the supply chain, for six main feedstocks: palm oil, palm oil fatty acid distillate, tallow, used cooking oil, rape oil, and soy oil. Scenarios have been applied to the calculations using four main variables: allocation method, i.e., economic or energy; methane capture at the oil mill (or not); application of indirect land-use change (or not); and classification of the feedstock as a residue (or not). HVO biopropane's carbon footprint varies, depending on the feedstock and the four variables, from as low as 5 g CO2e/MJ to as high as 102 g. In most cases, this qualifies for government support, i.e., financial credits and biofuel mandates enacted by EU member states under the Renewable Energy Directive. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - This study evaluates whether a transition of large ports facilities to biofuel production for mobility improves the environmental performance and satisfies the renewable energy directive (RED) and it is the first LCA study that considers biofuel production from torrefied wood. The systems studied are wood, torrefied wood, and straw pellets circulating fluidized bed gasification for H2, synthetic natural gas, or Fischer–Tropsch (FT) diesel production and use. These systems are evaluated for their global warming, acidification, eutrophication and particulate matter potentials, as well as, for their aggregated environmental performance. The effects of the electricity mix selection and ecoinvent database’s economic allocation are also analyzed. All biomass systems result in a better aggregated environmental performance and benefits for the global warming potential. However, regarding the acidification, particulate matter, and eutrophication potentials, most biomass systems are inferior to the reference systems. Switching to a zero-emission electricity mix offers benefits for all the biomass and fossil-H2 systems and researchers should use databases cautiously. The bio-H2 and FT diesel of wood-based systems show the best environmental performance and satisfy the current and future RED targets. On one hand, the bio-H2 systems result in the largest benefits regarding the global warming potential, and on the other hand, both wood-based FT diesel systems offer overall benefits which concern not only the sustainable target of CO2 emissions reduction, but also the air quality improvement of the broader area as well. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - The continuous rise in the cost of fossil fuels as well as in environmental pollution has attracted research in the area of clean alternative fuels for improving the performance and emissions of internal combustion (IC) engines. In the present work, n-butanol is treated as a bio-fuel and investigations have been made to evaluate the feasibility of replacing diesel with a suitable n-butanol-diesel blend. In the current research, an experimental investigation was carried out on a variable compression ratio CI engine with n-butanol-diesel blends (10–25% by volume) to determine the optimum blending ratio and optimum operating parameters of the engine for reduced emissions. The best results of performance and emissions were observed for 20% n-butanol-diesel blend (B20) at a higher compression ratio as compared to diesel while keeping the other parameters unchanged. The observed deterioration in engine performance was within tolerable limits. The reductions in smoke, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon monoxide (CO) were observed up to 56.52, 17.19, and 30.43%, respectively, for B20 in comparison to diesel at rated power. However, carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrocarbons (HC) were found to be higher by 17.58 and 15.78%, respectively, for B20. It is concluded that n-butanol-diesel blend would be a potential fuel to control emissions from diesel engines. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Integrating cultivation with wastewater treatment improves the economics of microalgal based biofuel production and allows for the sustainable reuse of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from waste streams. Batch-cultivation of a locally isolated green microalga, UHCC00027, and an indigenous algal-bacterial consortium was undertaken on screened municipal wastewater in 24 L pilot reactors. Evaluations of growth and of N and P removal were performed at different Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) levels and N:P ratios. Lipid accumulation and fatty acid composition of the resulting biomass were also examined. Unique to the present study was the evaluation of wastewater treatment performance under cold temperatures (7–13 °C) typical of a Nordic climate. While temperature exerted little influence on heterotrophic COD removal, vigorous (temperature dependent) growth of microalgae was important in the efficient removal of N and P, with the N:P ratio playing a central role. The studied cultivation regime and organisms achieved regulatory N and P removal levels with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12 days. However, biodiesel properties of the resulting biomass did not meet international standards due to a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Possible workarounds for simultaneously increasing nutrient removal efficiency, biomass productivity, and improving biomass suitability for biodiesel under a Nordic climate are discussed. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - The net energy ratios (NERs) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of a Photosynthetic Cyanobacterial Biorefinery (PSBR) were evaluated using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. This study assessed engineered cyanobacterium cultures in which biosynthetic biofuels are directly secreted. Biofuels researched in this study include bisabolane, a biosynthetic substitute for D2 diesel; heptadecane, a substitute for diesel; and ethanol, a substitute for gasoline. Results demonstrate that cyanobacteria-based ethanol has higher yields, lower NER, and lower GHG emissions than bisabolane and heptadecane products in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. By performing a sensitivity analyses of the life cycle NER and GHG emissions responses of the system, we derived the improvements in system biology, metabolic engineering, and process engineering that would be required to minimize the environmental impacts at an industrial scale. The NER and GHG emissions of the biofuel products were found to be the most sensitive to organism-level biofuel productivities, the energy consumption of vapor compression and distillation, and the energy consumption of culture mixing. This LCA will serve as a baseline for stakeholders; including policy makers, cyanobacterial refineries, and researchers, to establish the goals to engineer cyanobacteria and sustainable bioprocesses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effects of unsaturation (including the C–C double bond's position in the alkyl chain) and the ester moiety in the fuel molecule on the morphology of soot particles in a laminar coflow diffusion flame are studied. The effects of the ester moiety are evaluated by comparing an n-decane flame with a biodiesel surrogate flame (composed of 50%/50% molar blend of n-decane and methyl octanoate). The effects of the unsaturation and the position of C–C double bond in the alkyl chain are analysed by comparing 1-decene, 5-decene and n-decane flames. Particles were collected thermophoretically on Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) carbon coated copper grids. TEM images are analysed to obtain parameters related to the size of the agglomerates such as radius of gyration, and morphological parameters such as fractal dimension and prefactor of the power-law relationship. The results show that the average primary particle diameter, the size of the agglomerates and the number of primary particles composing the agglomerates increase along the flame length to around two thirds of the flame length and then decrease as a consequence of oxidation becoming dominant over soot nucleation and growth. The fractal dimension of the agglomerates does not change significantly along the different pathlines of the flames. However, effects of the fuel chemical structure are clear. The lowest fractal dimensions are observed for the oxygenated fuel and the highest ones for the unsaturated fuels, with higher fractal dimension when the double bond is located at the edge of the molecule. The same trends are observed for agglomerate sizes: smallest agglomerates are observed for the oxygenated fuel and largest ones for the unsaturated fuels. This suggests that low soot-emitting fuels reduce their size as a consequence of oxidation while keeping their agglomeration skeletal structure. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Alternative fuel has raised increasing attention in recent years for better fuel economy and emission reduction. The biodiesel fuel is natively produced from vegetable and animal oils with large number of organic compounds with varying groups and characteristics. Particulate Matter (PM) emissions from the biodiesel blend are often complicated by the volatility of the different organic components. We here report the chemical and toxicological characterization of solid-PM and semi-volatile PM (SV-PM) from diesel and biodiesel blend (BD30) exhausts, using front and backup filter, respectively. While total PM emission was lower for BD30 in general, it contained 19% higher organic compounds (OC) in SV-PM compared to diesel, which on the other hand noted 24% more solid-PM. These organic compounds were further analyzed with OCEC thermograph to confirm the dominant existence of highly volatile OC in SV-PM. We further extracted water-soluble components from the solid- and SV-PM samples, and subjected to RAW 264.7 macrophage cell exposure. More than 2-fold increase of oxidative potential was observed in SV-PM samples over solid-PM with elevated levels of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a significant correlation with OC concentration. Instead, non-cellular assay for ROS quantification showed the change in oxidative potential is greatly influenced by solid-PM. And non-cellular ROS due to SV-PM is 2-fold less than cell-based assay. Hence, the semi-volatiles, though produced in small quantities, need great attention in assessing health hazards and could well be a scope for further research. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A small compression ignition (CI) engine with a rated power of 4.41 kW has been tested in dual-fuel (diesel-biogas) mode without any significant modification. The objectives are to explore the effects of biogas flow rate and methane concentration on the performance and emissions of the CI engine run in dual-fuel mode. The experiments have been carried out at engine load and speed vary from 1000 rpm to 1500 rpm and 600 W to 1500 W, respectively. The results show that the output power and specific fuel consumption of the CI engine run in dual-fuel mode are higher than the CI engine run in pure diesel mode. Brake thermal efficiency of the CI engine run in dual-fuel mode strongly affected by biogas flow rate and methane concentration. There exists an optimum biogas flow rate for a maximum brake thermal efficiency. The biogas can reduce the diesel fuel consumption significantly. In the present CI engine, diesel replacement ratio varies from 15.3% to 87.5%. At engine load and speed of 1500 W and 1500 rpm, to get maximum efficiency, the present CI engine should be operated at biogas energy ratios of 15% and 18% using biogas with 60% and 70% methane concentrations, respectively.

AB  - Worldwide, over 4 million premature deaths each year are attributed to the burning of biomass fuels for cooking and heating. Epidemiological studies associate household air pollution with lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and respiratory infections. Animal dung, a biomass fuel used by economically vulnerable populations, generates more toxic compounds per mass burned than other biomass fuels. The type of animal dung used varies widely depending on local agro-geography. There are currently neither standardized experimental systems for dung biomass smoke research nor studies assessing the health impacts of different types of dung smoke. Here, we used a novel reproducible exposure system to assess outcomes related to inflammation and respiratory infections in human airway cells exposed to six different types of dung biomass smoke. We report that dung biomass smoke, regardless of species, is pro-inflammatory and activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and JNK transcription factors; however, dung smoke also suppresses interferon responses after a challenge with a viral mimetic. These effects are consistent with epidemiological data, and suggest a mechanism by which the combustion of animal dung can directly cause lung diseases, promote increased susceptibility to infection, and contribute to the global health problem of household air pollution. © 2017

AB  - Recent interest in renewable energy sources and the need to diversify cropping systems have triggered research interest in camelina (Camelina sativa L. Crantz). Camelina is well adapted to the temperate dryland climates and can be used as an energy crop. But information on agronomic evaluation of camelina cultivars for biodiesel feedstock are limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate six spring camelina cultivars (cv. Blaine Creek, Calena, Ligena, Pronghorn, Shoshone, and Suneson) on seed yield, oil concentration, and oil yield. The study was carried out from 2013 to 2015 at three locations (Havre, Moccasin, and Pendroy, MT). Over locations and years, mean seed yield differences among cultivars were significant (P &lt; 0.05). The mean seed yield for cultivars ranging from 1295 kg ha−1 (Suneson) to 1420 kg ha−1 (Ligena). Ligena and Calena showed a combination of good seed yield performance and stability across environments. Environmental means for seed yield differences were substantial compared with cultivar means. The location Havre produced 45 and 32% more mean seed yield than Pendroy and Moccasin, respectively. There was no significant difference among cultivars in oil concentration and oil yield. The absence of variations in oil concentration and oil yield differences among these cultivars could indicate the need for further research to improve these qualities essential for biodiesel. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Abstract: Lipid extraction is the bottleneck step for algae-based biodiesel production. Herein, 12 solvent mixture systems (mixtures of three non-polar and two polar organic solvents) were examined to evaluate their effects on the total lipid yield from Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris). Moreover, the extraction yields of three solvent systems with maximum extraction efficiency of esterifiable lipids were determined by acidic transesterification and GC–FID analysis. Three solvent systems, which resulted in a higher extraction yield, were further subjected to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis. The total lipid extraction yields (based on dry biomass) were (38.57 ± 1.51), (25.33 ± 0.58), and (25.17 ± 1.14) %, for chloroform–methanol (1:2) (C1M2), hexane–methanol (1:2) (H1M2), and chloroform–methanol (2:1) (C2M1), respectively. The extraction efficiency of C1M2 was approximately 1.5 times higher than H1M2 and C2M1, whereas the FAME profile of extracted lipids by H1M2 and C1M2 were almost identical. Moreover, the esterifiable lipid extraction yields of (18.14 ± 2.60), (16.66 ± 0.35), and (13.22 ± 0.31) % (based on dry biomass) were obtained for C1M2, H1M2, and C2M1 solvent mixture systems, respectively. The biodiesel fuel properties produced from C. vulgaris were empirically predicted and compared to that of the EN 14214 and ASTM 6751 standard specifications.

AB  - The utilization of industrial waste streams as input materials for bio-mediated production processes constitutes a current R&D objective not only to reduce process costs at the input side but in parallel, to minimize hazardous environmental emissions. In this context, the EU-funded project ANIMPOL elaborated a process for the production of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biopolymers starting from diverse waste streams of the animal processing industry. This article provides a detailed economic analysis of PHA production from this waste biorefinery concept, encompassing the utilization of low-quality biodiesel, offal material and meat and bone meal (MBM). Techno-economic analysis reveals that PHA production cost varies from 1.41 €/kg to 1.64 €/kg when considering offal on the one hand as waste, or, on the other hand, accounting its market price, while calculating with fixed costs for the co-products biodiesel (0.97 €/L) and MBM (350 €/t), respectively. The effect of fluctuating market prices for offal materials, biodiesel, and MBM on the final PHA production cost as well as the investment payback time have been evaluated. Depending on the current market situation, the calculated investment payback time varies from 3.25 to 4.5 years. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Waste newspaper (WP) was first co-pyrolyzed with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) to enhance the yields of alcohols and hydrocarbons. The effects of WP: HDPE feed ratio (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, 0:100) and temperature (500–800 °C) on products distribution were investigated and the interaction mechanism during co-pyrolysis was also proposed. Maximum yields of alcohols and hydrocarbons reached 85.88% (feed ratio 50:50 wt.%, 600 °C). Hydrogen supplements and deoxidation by HDPE and subsequently fragments recombination result in the conversion of aldehydes and ketones into branched hydrocarbons. Radicals from WP degradation favor the secondary crack for HDPE products resulting in the formation of linear hydrocarbons with low carbon number. Hydrocarbons with activated radical site from HDPE degradation were interacted with hydroxyl from WP degradation promoting the formation of linear long chain alcohols. Moreover, co-pyrolysis significantly enhanced condensable oil qualities, which were close to commercial diesel No. 0. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A major concern about biofuels is that increasing biofuel feedstock demand reduces availability of crops for food and feed leading to higher food prices. This paper investigates relations between biofuel policies and prices of rapeseed, the major feedstock used for biodiesel production in Europe, and the impact of rapeseed prices on crop acreages in Germany and France. Biodiesel is an important biofuel in Europe, and Germany and France are the largest biodiesel producers in Europe. First, the various biofuel policies in Germany and France are discussed, followed by an analysis of their effects on rapeseed prices. Although theory indicates that such effects exist, we could not find empirical evidence for them. Second, using regional land use panel data from Germany and France we investigate empirically whether crop shares have been affected by rapeseed prices in the period 2000–2015 and whether these price effects changed because of biofuel policy changes. Results show that wheat shares in Germany and France did respond to rapeseed prices, but barley shares did not. Moreover, mandatory blending introduced in Germany in 2007 and production quotas introduced in France in 2005 led to a stronger effect of rapeseed prices on wheat shares, but again did not affect barley shares. © 2017 The Agricultural Economics Society

AB  - The biochemical behavior of the yeasts Rhodosporidium toruloides DSM 4444, Yarrowia lipolytica ACA YC 5029, and Y. lipolytica ACA YC 5030 was evaluated on waste glycerol-based media, added at increasing initial concentrations (50–140 g/L), with nitrogen remaining constant. During flask cultivation of Y. lipolytica ACA-YC 5030, and although medium pH remained &gt;4.8, major metabolites were the polyols mannitol (CMl) and erythritol (CEr) (CMlmax = 32.1 g/L, conversion yield per glycerol consumed =0.23 g/g, and CErmax = 35.5 g/L, yield ≈0.25 g/g). For the strain ACA-YC 5029, equally in flasks and pH &gt;4.8, the major metabolites were again mannitol and erythritol, with CMlmax = 28.9 g/L (conversion yield ≈0.21 g/g), and CErmax = 33.6 g/L (yield ≈0.24 g/g). In contrast, in batch-bioreactor experiment, the yeast ACA YC-5029 produced mainly citric acid (maximum concentration =39 g/L, yield on glycerol =0.42 g/g). R. toruloides DSM 4444 was flask-cultured at increasing initial glycerol quantities (up to ≈140 g/L) and displayed significant growth producing also satisfactory amounts of lipids. The maximum DCW concentration achieved was 39.1 g/L. Maximum lipids were 13.7 g/L (at that point lipid in DCW was 37.0% w/w). The major cellular fatty acid produced was oleic acid. Phospholipids of R. toruloides were the most unsaturated fraction among lipid fractions quantified. Practical applications: Industrial glycerol, the main by-product of biodiesel-producing facilities, appears in constantly increasing quantities in the market volume due to the worldwide rise of biodiesel production, rendering the valorization of this by-product as a very important scientific priority. In this report, the yeasts Y. lipolytica ACA YC 5029 and Y. lipolytica ACA YC 5030 were cultivated in submerged batch experiments with industrial glycerol as substrate under nitrogen limitation and appreciable quantities of mannitol and erythritol, compounds presenting significant importance for the food industries, were synthesized. The yeast R. toruloides DSM 4444, equally batch-cultured on glycerol under nitrogen limitation, produced appreciable quantities of biomass that contained high concentrations of microbial lipids, that could be transformed into “2nd generation” biodiesel. The current study, hence, provides viable possibilities of glycerol valorization through its use as substrate in order metabolic compounds of added-value to be synthesized. Crude glycerol, the principal “waste” stream deriving from biodiesel production process, is converted with the aid of microbial fermentations into secondary metabolites useful for the food- and biofuels-producing industries. The metabolic compounds synthesized are microbial lipids (single cell oils) amenable to be converted into 2nd generation biodiesel with fermentations led by a strain of the yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides and mannitol, erythritol and citric acid with fermentations led by strains of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - 4-Dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) was employed in the esterification of oleic acid (OA) and the trans-esterification of oleic oil (OO) with 1-butanol as alcohol in the presence of various degrees of excess water. Under these conditions DBSA was found to be a highly active esterification catalyst regardless of excess water content, but was found to be a less effective for trans-esterification reactions. Lipophilic alcohols of differing straight and branched C3-6 chains were also tested on mixtures of OA/water (1:1) in DBSA-catalyzed esterifications; OO/water (1:1) in trans-esterifications; and OA/OO/water (1:1:1) in simultaneous esterifications and trans-esterifications. While longer straight chain alcohols generally gave a two-fold increase in yield of their corresponding alkyl oleates to 80%+, we observed a doubling from 30–50% to 60–95% of alkyl oleate yield for the OO/OA/water mixture. DBSA-catalyzed amidations of OO and methyl oleate emulsions in water were conducted with 1-butyl and 1-heptyl amine where it was found that the more lipophilic the ester moiety the higher the yield of alkyl amide. Practical applications: The practical advantages of DBSA as catalyst are high conversions to the desired product along with its tolerance to high quantities of water, emulsified within the lipid material. A capacity to transform a range of substrates with varying lipophilic character in a range of condensation reactions. In addition, we demonstrate that esterification and trans-esterification reactions could be performed simultaneous and in the presence of high quantities of water. This is of direct interest to the transformation of waste sources of lipids that often contain a mixture of triglycerides and free fatty acids in various concentrations, emulsified with waste water. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all of the value-added products/co-products can be separated by an effective and industrially relevant methodology, including recovery of the DBSA catalyst as well as the water and water soluble co-products, such as glycerol. A 4-Dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) is demonstrated to be an effective polyvalent catalyst for the recovery of aqueous emulsified lipids by conversion into value-added products. DBSA proved to be a polyvalent catalyst showing high activity using a range of substrates, performing esterification, trans-esterification, and amidations reactions efficiently despite the potential detrimental presence of high water loadings. The commercial incentive of our system is the phase separation of the product mixture into the converted lipids for use as biofuels and glycerol for resale as a fine chemical. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Internal combustion engine emissions belong among the major anthropogenic sources of air pollution in urban areas. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there is sufficient evidence of the carcinogenicity of diesel exhaust in human beings. Although alternative fuels, mainly biodiesel, have recently become popular, little is still known about the genotoxicity of emissions from these fuels. We analysed DNA damage expressed as the frequency of micronuclei (MN) in human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B), induced by extractable organic matter (EOM; tested concentrations: 1, 10 and 25 μg/ml) obtained from particle emissions from various blends of biodiesel with diesel fuels (including neat diesel fuel (B0), a blend of 70% B0 and 30% biodiesel (B30) and neat biodiesel (B100)). We also tested the effect of selected diesel exhaust organic/genotoxic components [benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) concentrations: 25, 100 and 200 μM; 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) concentrations: 1, 5 and 10 μM; 3-nitrobenzanthrone (3-NBA) concentrations: 1, 5 and 50 μM]. The cells were treated with the compounds for 28 and 48 hr. Our results showed that most of the tested compounds (except for the 25 μM B[a]P, 28-hr treatment) significantly increased MN frequency. The genotoxicity of EOMs from the engine emissions of diesel and biodiesel engines was comparable. Both nitro-PAH compounds demonstrated higher genotoxic potential in comparison with B[a]P. Considering our results and due to increasing popularity of alternative fuels, it is prudent that the potential genotoxic effects of various fuels are investigated across engine technologies and operating conditions in a relevant model system. © 2016 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic Pharmacological Society)

AB  - The climate change concerns have necessitated the need for the advancement of biofuels and many countries including India have set targets for the reduction in green house gas emissions. The objective of this paper is to find the suitability of hydrotreated Jatropha curcas oil as fuel in diesel engines. The different blends of jatropha fuels were tested in a Kirloskar 4S diesel engine of 17.5:1 compression ratio, 4.4 kW, at a constant speed of 1500 rpm at various loads. The performance (brake specific fuel consumption and brake thermal efficiency) and emission (CO, HC, CO2, and NOx) data of hydrotreated and transesterified jatropha oils were compared with those of petro diesel. The experimental results for HTJATB25 and HTJATB100 in DI diesel engine showed a decrease in emission with respect to petro diesel viz., (1) CO by 18.75 and 33.33 %, (2) HC by 25.6 and 47.38 %, (3) CO2 by 18.75 and 26.25 %, (4) NOx by 9.09 and 18.18 % respectively and the improved performance in brake thermal efficiency by 10.71 and 19.35, (5) brake specific fuel consumption 9.14 and 17.14 %. Also it is noted that, no engine modifications is required while using hydrotreated vegetable oil as fuel. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Abstract: Ethanol and biogas are promising alternative fuels that can be produced from inedible agricultural wastes. However, a pretreatment step is needed to make these substrates amenable to the microbial digestion. The residue of vegetable oil extraction process, called seed cake, offers potential as a feedstock for ethanol and biogas production. However, the oil extraction process may affect the performance of further processes. In this study, the effect of mechanical and solvent extraction methods of Eruca sativa grains was studied on the further ethanol and biogas production from its seed cake. The mechanically extracted seed cake (MESC) and solvent extracted seed cake (SESC) were subjected to NaOH pretreatment prior to ethanolic fermentation and anaerobic digestion. The pretreatment offered positive effects on glucose and ethanol production yield from both type of seed cake; however, the results were more promising on MESC, in which the yield improved by 301.7 %. In case of biogas production, the pretreatment substantially increased the methane production from the MESC by 105.6 %, while it showed negative effects on the SESC. The current study suggested that the oil extraction method can affect the performance of further processes on seed cake for biofuel production, especially biogas. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - In this work a methodology was developed for the quantification of the contents of petroleum-derived hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFAs) and farnesane jet fuels in binary and ternary mixtures using near infrared spectroscopy and multivariate calibration based on partial least squares (PLS) regression. The developed models are simpler, faster and cheaper when compared to the standard reference method ASTM D6866-12, with a further advantage of differentiation between biofuels. Petroleum-derived jet fuel and biofuels were determined in binary blends with a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) value of 0.48% (v/v) for both HEFA and petroleum-derived jet fuels, with a limit of detection of 0.56% (v/v). Ternary blends presented values of RMSEP of 0.69% (v/v), 0.35% (v/v) and 0.44% (v/v) for HEFA, farnesane and petroleum-derived jet fuels, respectively, with limits of detection in the range of 0.12 to 0.24% (v/v). The developed models, based on bias and permutation tests, did not present systematic errors and trends in residuals, turning them appropriately for analysis of biojet fuel blends. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Anaerobic hydrocarbon biodegradation not only diminishes fuel quality, but also exacerbates the biocorrosion of the metallic infrastructure. While successional events in marine microbial ecosystems impacted by petroleum are well documented, far less is known about the response of communities chronically exposed to hydrocarbons. Shipboard oily wastewater was used to assess the biotransformation of different diesel fuels and their propensity to impact carbon steel corrosion. When amended with sulfate and an F76 military diesel fuel, the sulfate removal rate in the assay mixtures was elevated (26.8 μM/d) relative to incubations receiving a hydroprocessed biofuel (16.1 μM/d) or a fuel-unamended control (17.8 μM/d). Microbial community analysis revealed the predominance of Anaerolineae and Deltaproteobacteria in F76-amended incubations, in contrast to the Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria in the original wastewater. The dominant Smithella-like sequences suggested the potential for syntrophic hydrocarbon metabolism. The general corrosion rate was relatively low (0.83 − 1.29 ± 0.12 mpy) and independent of the particular fuel, but pitting corrosion was more pronounced in F76-amended incubations. Desulfovibrionaceae constituted 50–77% of the sessile organisms on carbon steel coupons. Thus, chronically exposed microflora in oily wastewater were differentially acclimated to the syntrophic metabolism of traditional hydrocarbons but tended to resist isoalkane-laden biofuels. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Differential scanning calorimetry is employed to investigate the cold flow property of a series of fuel mixtures prepared from fast pyrolysis bio-oil, crude glycerol, methanol, and/or biochar. Bio-oil alone has a melting peak temperature (TMP) of -21.9 °C that may lead to difficulties in practical applications under extreme cold weather conditions. Bio-oil water-soluble fraction (WSF) is even more problematic as its TMP is -8.7 °C. The results show that these problems can be alleviated or even eliminated by mixing various formulated crude glycerols (FCGs) with bio-oil or WSF. The TMP of FCG/methanol/bio-oil (FCGMB) blends significantly decreased from -21.9 to -38.1 °C. Similar phenomena were also seen for the FCG/WSF (FCGWSF) blends, with decreases in TMP from -8.7 to -32.0 °C. Water can worsen the cold flow properties of FCGMB and FCGWSF blends. However, other components in FCGs can lower the TMP and hence improve the cold flow properties of these fuel mixtures (with the effectiveness in the order of NaCl &gt; NaOH &gt; methanol &gt; glycerol &gt; soap due to solvation effect). The presence of biochar has a limited effect on the cold flow property of the slurry fuels, leading to a decrease of merely 4 °C in the TMP at a 20% biochar loading level. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In-situ hydrodeoxygenation of phenol with aqueous hydrogen donor over supported Ni catalyst was investigated. The supported Ni catalysts exerted very poor performance, if formic acid was used as the hydrogen donor. Catalyst modification by loading K, Na, Mg or La salt could not make the catalyst performance improved. If gaseous hydrogen was used as the hydrogen source the activity of Ni/Al2O3 was pretty high. CO2 was found poisonous to the catalysis, due to the competitive adoption of phenol with CO2. If formic acid was replaced by methanol, the catalyst performance improved remarkably, with major products of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol. The better effect of methanol enlightened the application of the supported Ni catalyst in in-situ hydrodeoxygenation of phenol. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Microalgae cultivation has gained increased attention from research and industry sectors in recent years, due to the wide variety of applications for the produced biomass, such as biofuels and substances of high economic value. Indirect biophotolysis biohydrogen production from microalgae has been shown recently to be limited by the amount of accumulated biomass during the growth phase. As a result, this study focused on developing a strategy to increase biohydrogen generation via biomass production increase through microalgae cultivation using exhaust gases from diesel engines. In order to achieve that objective, four simultaneous cultures were conducted to compare the growth of microalgae under pure air and emissions injection, in different flow regimes. An indigenous microalgae strain was selected to be robust under different weather conditions and was identified as Acutodesmus obliquus through rDNA sequence analysis. The results indicate an increase in biomass production of about 2.8 times for the best case of cultivation with emissions in comparison to a compressed air condition. Besides the growth analyses, the potential for treating the hazardous emissions injected into the system was investigated and the data demonstrated that the CO2 and NOx content was substantially reduced, showing that no damage to the microalgae is caused by the diesel engine emissions. Numerical simulation results for the H2 production indirect biophotolysis demonstrate that there is an optimal rhythm for maximum time averaged H2 production rate, and that the stoichiometrically limited total H2 production is augmented by a similar factor to microalgae biomass production increase. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - In recent years, the number of fossil fuels is decreasing sharply, and the harmful gases produced by fossil fuel combustion endanger human health and pollute the environment, people are devoted to looking for the alternative fuels of fossil fuels. Biomass energy is a good choice, it is renewable and clean. But the biomass was always burned directly, it is a great waste of biomass sources. In order to reduce the waste of biomass resources and protect the environment, we studied the rapid pyrolysis and catalytic cracking technology to convert the biomass to liquid fuel, which we called the liquid bio-oil. Choosing rape straw as biomass raw materials, HZSM-5 and MCM-41 were used to catalyze the rape straw pyrolysis with different mixing ratios. The experimental instruments include electronic controller, catalytic reactor, pyrolysis reactor, vacuum pump, cold trap, cooling tower, bio-oil collector and connecting pipe. The rape straws were placed in the pyrolysis reactor, the catalysts were replaced in the catalytic reactor, the vacuum pump pressure was controlled at 5kPa and the temperature of the cooling tower was set to -20℃. According to the physical and chemical properties, FT-IR and GC-MS analysis results of organic oil and the BET analysis results of catalysts, we studied the effect of HZSM-5 and MCM-41 mixing ratios on the quality of bio-oil. The results showed that with the increase of MCM-41 content, the yield of bio-oil organic phase decreased first and then increased. The density, oxygen content and kinematic viscosity of refined organic oil decreased first and then increased,while carbon content and calorific value increased first and then decreased, when HZSM-5 and MCM-41 were mixed with 1:1, the higher calorific value was 34.31 MJ/kg. The organic phase of refined oil showed six obvious absorption peaks, respectively, they were the absorption peaks of alcohols or phenols, aromatic compounds, acids and aldehydes, ketones, carboxylates, esters and substituted aromatic compounds. The mass fraction of aromatic hydrocarbon increased first and then decreased, while the mass fraction of carbonyl compounds showed the opposite trend, the mass fraction of acids was continuously reduced. With the increase of MCM-41 content, the catalytic activity and absorption capacity of mixed catalysts improved and tended to be stable when the mass fraction of MCM-41 was 50%. From these analysis results, we can speculate the catalytic cracking reaction mechanism of rape straw on HZSM-5 and MCM-41. Because of the large specific surface area and pore size of mesoporous molecular sieve MCM-41, most of the macromolecules in its pore channels can be decomposed into small molecules such as aldehydes, ketones and other small molecules by decarboxylation, dehydroxylation and ring-opening polymerization in the pore channels. These small molecules re-entered the pores of the microporous molecular sieve HZSM-5, and generated aromatic hydrocarbons, H2O, CO2 and CO through the decarbonylation, aromatization and deoxidation, and then the oxygen content in organic phase decreased, aromatic substances content increased, the acidity reduced, so that the quality of bio-oil was improved. This study could provide the experimental basis and the theoretical basis for the efficient utilization of biomass. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - Biomass-derived levulinic acid (LA) is an excellent substrate to obtain high-value esters that can be used as second-generation biofuels and biofuel additives. The present study focuses on the identification and definition of the key parameters crucial for the development of chemically and environmentally efficient protocols operating in continuous-flow for the preparation of structurally diverse alkyl levulinates via the esterification of LA. We have focused on the use of solid acid catalysts consisting of sulfonated cation exchange resins and considered different aliphatic alcohols to prepare levulinates 3 and 11–17 regioselectively, and in good to high yields (50–92%). Direct correlations between several reaction parameters and catalyst activity have been investigated and discussed to set proper flow reactors that allow minimal waste production during the workup procedure, enabling Environmental factor (E-factor) values as low as ca. 0.3, full recoverability and reusability of the catalysts, and the production of levulinates up to ca. 5 gxh−1 scale. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - The objective of this study is to elucidate the economic viability of algae-to-energy systems at a large scale, by developing a meta-analysis of five previously published economic evaluations of systems producing algae biodiesel. Data from original studies were harmonised into a standardised framework using financial and technical assumptions. Results suggest that the selling price of algae biodiesel under the base case would be $5.00–10.31/gal, higher than the selected benchmarks: $3.77/gal for petroleum diesel, and $4.21/gal for commercial biodiesel (B100) from conventional vegetable oil or animal fat. However, the projected selling price of algal biodiesel ($2.76–4.92/gal), following anticipated improvements, would be competitive. A scenario-based sensitivity analysis reveals that the price of algae biodiesel is most sensitive to algae biomass productivity, algae oil content, and algae cultivation cost. This indicates that the improvements in the yield, quality, and cost of algae feedstock could be the key factors to make algae-derived biodiesel economically viable. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP) is the largest megacity in South America, with 21 million inhabitants and more than 8 million vehicles. Those vehicles run on a complex fuel mix, with ethanol accounting for nearly 50% of all fuel sold. That has made the MASP a unique case study to assess the impact of biofuel use on air quality. Currently, the greatest challenge in terms of improving air quality is controlling the formation of secondary pollutants such as ozone, which represents the main air pollution problem in the MASP.We evaluated the temporal trends in the concentrations of ozone, its precursors (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and NO2), CO, and NO, from 2012 to 2016. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde concentrations were frequently higher in winter than in other seasons, showing the importance of meteorological conditions to the distribution of atmospheric pollutants in the MASP.We found no clear evidence that the recent growth in ethanol consumption in Brazil has affected acetaldehyde concentrations, which are associated with emissions from ethanol combustion. In fact, the formaldehyde/acetaldehyde ratio remained relatively constant over the period studied, despite the change in the fuel consumption profile in the MASP. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - The synthesis of new biomass-derived ethers is of great interest for the development of biofuels and biofuel additives. In this study, we report the facile synthesis of a novel bioether ethyl-4-ethoxy pentanoate (EEP) from γ-valerolactone (GVL), a well-known biomass platform compound. The formation of EEP involves the etherification of ethyl-4-hydroxyl pentanoate (EHP) formed by GVL ring opening catalyzed by H-β-zeolite in ethanol. When operated at 140 °C for 2 h under autogenous pressure, the highest EEP yield of 55% was achieved at 62% GVL conversion and 89% EEP selectivity. The EEP yield was significantly improved to 86% by increasing the reaction temperature to 160 °C, where the EEP selectivity reached ∼97%. The extraordinarily high selectivity to EEP over H-β is likely correlated to its unique structure, which has strong Lewis acid sites as well as an optimal pore size. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Aging of the world and depletion of all resources probes a path for discovering alternate energy sources. These Concerns on the search of bio fuels to replace the decaying fossil fuels. Identification of sustainable substitutes such as bio fuels (biodiesel, bio alcohol and biogas) from this study. The use of food crops may compete with the food chain, so non-edible crops are making an alternate for biodiesel production. As a result, scientists are now probing on the utilization of non-edible feedstock for biodiesel production. In this study moisture content of certain seeds was analyzed by oven dry method. Moisture content of seeds less than 8% shows maximum oil yield as 23%, 32% and 34.54% for Caesalpinia sappan, Cleome gynandra and Cleome viscose respectively. Ultrasonic Pretreatment was carried out on seed sources such as Caesalpinia sappan, Cleome gynandra and Cleome viscose. Optimization of oil extraction were carried out on Cleome viscose by Shaker Assisted Hexane Extraction and the variables for optimization are Seed to solvent ratio, Rpm,Temperature,Time respectively effect the oil extraction. The optimized parameters are seed to solvent ratio as 1:12, 125 Rpm, 67°C temperature and time 66 mins. After optimization, the yield of oil extracted from Caesalpinia sappan, Cleome gynandra and Cleome viscose respectively were 25%, 32%, 34%. The extraction kinetics determine the rate constant by applying Differential method. The reaction follows first order kinetics and the activation energy was interpreted as 7.1KJ and the Arrhenius constant was 3.77∗10-3 s1. The physiochemical properties of the seed oil were analyzed by AOCS methods. This biofuel second generation source was proved to be a suitable feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2017 Research Journal of BioTechnology. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present study, treatment of biodiesel production wastewater by a commercial nanofiltration membrane (NE-90) has been investigated for the first time. The wastewater was the water washing effluent of the biodiesel production pilot plant. The effect of feed flow rate and operating pressure on the COD, BOD and TDS removal was studied. The results showed that by an increase in feed flow rate, the rejection percentage for COD and BOD is increased due to lowering the effect of concentration polarization. Moreover, with an increase in the operating pressure, the rejection percentage for BOD and COD is also increased due to an increase in rejection from the surface of the membrane. A maximum removal percentage for BOD and COD was obtained as 74.1% and 77.9%, respectively at 14 bar feed pressure and 250 L/h feed flow rate. At this condition, TDS removal was measured as 86.5%. The obtained results showed that the current nanofiltration system is able to treat the biodiesel’s water washing effluent successfully and reduces the COD, BOD, and TDS, considerably. © 2017 Desalination Publications.

AB  - Currently, there are two mixtures of biodiesel/diesel fuel sold in Brazil: BX/S500 and BX /S10 (X = volume/volume biodiesel percentage; S500 and S10 = sulfur content in diesel fuels-500 ppm and 10 ppm, respectively). In order to differentiate these mixtures, red dye is added to diesel oil as required by the National Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP), regulatory agency in Brazil. Since the palm oil biodiesel has also a reddish color, mixing this product with diesel fuel leads to difficulty in visual differentiation of the mixtures BX/S500 and BX/S10. We propose the use of UV-Vis spectrophotometry, which is a low cost, simple and rapid technique. Spectra obtained for different mixtures show that qualitative distinction is possible. For quantification of red dye in the presence of palm oil biodiesel, the method is limited when dye is present in low concentrations (&lt; 0.1 mg L-1) due to matrix effects. The method showed good repeatability of the absorbance responses, wide linear dynamic range (0.02 mg L-1 to 40.00 mg L-1) and low limits of detection and quantification (0.006 mg L-1 and 0.019 mg L-1, respectively).

AB  - Bio fuels such as biogas and biodiesel attract increasing attention all over the world as a substitute or mixture for fossil fuels in automobiles. Transesterification is the process that is used for producing biodiesel which is accepted worldwide because of its efficiency. Transesterification is the process done for decreasing the viscosity of the vegetable oil. In this paper, we have used Transesterification of cottonseed oil to produce biodiesel. The cost of production of one liter of biodiesel from cottonseed oil is thrice the cost of the diesel per liter. The byproducts of Transesterification process are glycerol and methyl ester water-wash. Both of the byproducts are good source of Methanol content which can easily be converted into methane gas or Biogas (CH4). Also, the cottonseed from which the oil is extracted can be used for producing biogas. In this paper, the laboratory experiments for Integrating Biodiesel and Biogas Plants are studied quantitatively in detail. By integrating both biodiesel and biogas plant, it is a way of reducing the cost of biodiesel which can boost the use of biodiesel in future. © TJPRC Pvt. Ltd.

AB  - Carbon and nitrogen footprints are increasingly common metrics used to consider the environmental impacts of activities and consumption by institutions; an institutional water footprint complements these assessments by providing a third metric: water use. This study calculated the water footprint of the University of Virginia (UVA) as a summation of direct water use and virtual water use. The latter was estimated using purchasing records for utilities, food, transportation, paper, research animals, and hospital purchases for calendar year 2014. The direct water use portion of the footprint was 1.7 million m3 water. The virtual water footprint was 15.2 million m3. The utilities sector is responsible for 46 percent of UVA's total water footprint, and food production 23 percent. The UVA Health System contributed 17 percent, and paper, transportation, and research animals each constituted less than 3 percent of the total footprint. The most water-intensive inputs were biofuels, hydroelectricity, and animal products. This water footprint assessment supports carbon and nitrogen footprint-reduction strategies, such as replacing coal with natural gas and reducing beef consumption. Water footprints also require explicitly considering the impacts of renewable energy sources, such as biofuels or hydropower. The water footprint of the University of Virginia provides an additional measure to address the environmental implications of the institution's resource demands and this approach is broadly applicable to other institutions. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.

AB  - The catalytic hydroconversion of vegetable oil (CHVO) process associate vegetable oil triglyceride transformation to linearchain alkanes, via hydrodeoxygenation reactions (HDO) to generate multiple hydrocarbon compounds similar to heavy vacuum oil. The CHVO process was applied to Jatropha curcas seed oil, on commercial hydrodesulfurization (HDS) Ni- Mo/Al2O3 catalyst under HDS operation conditions. Jatropha curcas seed oil triglycerides conversion were observe by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and validated by Gas Chromatography (CG/MSD). The process occurs through three reaction pathways including: decarbonylation, decarboxylation and hydrodeoxygenation where the carboxyl group is removed from the fatty acids to produce alkanes similar to fossil fuels. Infrared spectroscopy in CHVO process showed to be a useful method to evaluate the catalytic activity by monitoring specific frequencies intensities of C=O and C-O bonds in carboxylic group. The intensity reduction of these bonds to linear hydrocarbons it associated as a way to quantify for CHVO process. © 2017, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa. All rights reserved.

AB  - Identifying and addressing critical improvements in biomass, bioproduct and biofuel productivity is a priority for the nascent algae-based bioeconomy. Economic and sustainability principles should guide these developing improvements and help to unravel the contentious water-food-energy-environment nexus that algae inhabit. Understanding the biochemistry of the storage carbon metabolism of algae to produce biofuels and bioproducts can bring to light the key barriers that currently limit the overall carbon efficiency and the photosynthetic efficiency, and ultimately guide productivity and commercial viability in the context of limiting resources. In the analysis reported here, we present different potential pathways for a conceptual algae biorefinery framework, with each pathway addressing one of the main identified barriers to future deployment. We highlight the molecular identification, in the form of an extensive literature review, of potential bioproducts that may be derived directly from both biomass and fractions produced through a conversion pathway, for three important commercially-relevant genera of algae, Scenedesmus, Chlorella and Nannochloropsis. We establish a relationship between each of the potential bioproducts, describe relevant conversion and extraction processes, and discuss market opportunities with values and sizes as they relate to commercial development of the products. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) are a group of organic compounds that can be synthesized through the process of esterification of fatty acids with methanol.With the increasing use of FAME in biodiesel, there is interest in the fate and effects of FAME in the environment. Single FAME compounds are of low aqueous solubility, low volatility and low mobility but the mechanisms of autoxidation and hydrolysis may result in the generation of more mobile but equally biodegradable components. The FAME types that have been studied in the peer-reviewed literature do not appear to enhance the solubility of hydrocarbons. FAME are widely reported to be readily biodegradable under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, although rates may vary from site to site. In the majority of studies, biodiesel FAME biodegradation occurred more rapidly than petroleum diesel biodegradation. At sites with limited electron acceptors and macronutrients, microorganisms that degrade FAME have the potential to deplete available electron acceptors and nutrients, resulting in an extended time for diesel biodegradation. As with other labile biofuels, anaerobic biodegradation of FAME may result in significant methane generation. Overall, natural attenuation would appear to be significant in controlling the fate, behaviour and potential risks posed by biodiesel. © 2017 Concawe, Brussels.

AB  - Abstract: A competitive price of biofuels is necessary for large-scale development. To reduce the overall costs of biofuels production from microalgae, a total use of feedstock was pursued in this research. Besides, the optimization of the different stages involved in biodiesel synthesis process was carried out. The use of algal waste, residue after biodiesel production, as raw material for pellets manufacturing, was analysed. In addition, other techniques as microwave irradiation or ultrasound were used to extract the algal oil and subsequently characterize the oil by gas chromatography. The highest yield of oil extracted (24.77%) was obtained when a microwave irradiation took place previously to ultrasound-assisted extraction. However, less than half of oil was extracted by ultrasound (11.74%). The results showed that high biodiesel conversions, about 50–67%, were achieved by direct transesterification. In addition, pellets from waste biomass could be used as fuel in biomass boilers. Therefore, an integral use of the microalgal raw material was accomplished. No residues were generated and two valuable biofuels were obtained: biodiesel and pellets. © 2017, University of Tehran.

AB  - The effect of pyrolysis temperature, retention time and inert gas (i.e. N2) flow rate on the conversion of Mahua Press Seed Cake (PSC) into bio-oil was studied in a slow pyrolysis fixed bed batch reactor. The optimum operating conditions for the process were derived using a Response Surface Methodology (RSM). It was found that the highest bio-oil yield (49.25 wt.%) can be achieved at a moderate temperature of 475 °C and a retention time of 45 min. As expected, the bio-oil yield was found to be affected by the reaction temperature. In a GC-MS analysis of the bio-oil, major compounds found were 6-octadecenoic acid, octadecanoic acid and free fatty acids (FFAs). The physicochemical properties of a raw PSC and bio-char were studied using bomb calorimeter, elemental analysis, and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy techniques. The heating value of the pyrolytic bio-oil (31.53 MJ/kg) at 475 °C was found to be increased by 46% compared to that of raw PSC (21.592 MJ/kg). The FT-IR analysis indicates that there was a decrease in the number of O-H (hydroxyl), C-H (alkanes) and C-O (primary alcohol) groups and an increase in the number of C=C (aromatics) functional groups with an increase in the pyrolysis temperature. Bio-gas analysis confirmed that, at higher temperatures, higher gas yield with increased CO and CH4 contents was observed. Finally, from the energy balance and economic analysis, it has been confirmed that at the derived optimum operating conditions it is feasible to produce bio-oil from Mahua PSC. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The nanostructure of diesel particulates has been shown to impact its oxidation rate and burnout trajectory. Additionally, this nanostructure can evolve during the oxidation process, furthering its influence on the burnout process. For this study, exhaust particulates were generated on a light-duty diesel engine with conventional diesel fuel, biodiesel, and intermediate blends of the two at a single load-speed point. Despite the singular engine platform and operating point, the different fuels created particulates with varied nanostructure, thereby greatly expanding the window for observing nanostructure evolution and oxidation. The physical and chemical properties of the particulates in the nascent state and at partial oxidation states were measured in a laboratory reactor and by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy as a function of the degree of oxidation in O2. X-ray photoacoustic spectroscopy analysis, thermal desorption, and solvent extraction of the nascent particulate samples reveal a significant organic content in the biodiesel-derived particulates, likely accounting for differences in the nanostructure. This study reports the nanoscale structural changes in the particulate with biofuel blend level and during O2 oxidation as observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and quantitated by fringe analysis and Brunnauer-Emmet-Teller total surface area measurements. It was observed that initial fuel-related differences in the lamella lengths, spacing, and curvature disappear when the particulate reaches approximately 50% burnout. Specifically, the initial ordered, fullerenic, and amorphous nanostructures converge during the oxidation process and the surface areas of these particulates appear to grow through these complex changes in internal particle structure. The specific surface area, measured at several points along the burnout trajectory, did not match the shrinking core projection and in contrast suggested that internal porosity was increasing. Thus, the appropriate burnout model for these particulates is significantly different from the standard shrinking core assumption, which does not account for any internal structure. An alternative burnout model is supported by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy image analysis. © 2016 IMechE.

AB  - The focus of research is shifting toward development of new engine fuels for optimized combustion systems. The altered chemical structure of these new fuels may impact their thermal decomposition chemistry during the ignition process and hence the in-cylinder conditions for particulate formation and post oxidation. This work fundamentally focuses on the influence of the fuel properties on particulate matter morphology and, thereby, the regeneration behavior of diesel particulate filters. The experiments for particulate analysis were conducted with a single-cylinder diesel research engine designed for future passenger car applications. A detailed analysis of soot characteristics and its consequences on diesel particulate filter behavior were studied at part-load engine operation at EU 6 engine-out nitrogen oxide level. Next to standard EN590 diesel, a paraffinic fuel was investigated as non-oxygenated biofuel candidate. A blend of the 2-methyltetrahydrofuran and di-n-butylether was studied as tailor-made oxygenated biomass-derived fuel candidate. With all fuels, samples of state-of-the-art diesel particulate filter were loaded at the research engine. In succession, the regeneration of the filters was investigated at a laboratory gas bench. Furthermore, the primary particle size, the total number concentration, and size-based number distribution were investigated in detail by means of a transmission electron microscope, condensation particle counter, and Engine Exhaust Particle Sizer™, respectively. Furthermore, the graphitic character of the soot structure was analyzed by optical measurements such as absorption coefficient. It was found that the soot oxidation temperature was decreased by -1/410 °C and -1/465 °C with the paraffinic fuel and the blend of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran and di-n-butylether, respectively, compared to conventional diesel fuel. Overall, the results indicate that with specific tailored fuels not only the total particle mass and number could be reduced but, with altering the soot structure and composition, also the energy requirement for diesel particulate filter regeneration can be reduced. © 2016 IMechE.

AB  - Evaluation of fuel consumption in internal combustion engines (ICE) of agricultural machinery and equipment is important in determining the performance under various operating conditions, especially when using biofuels. This study consisted of experimental evaluation of the gasoline (petrol)/ethanol consumption in a two-stroke 1-cylinder ICE, Otto cycle, functioning as an air blower for agriculture and related applications. A methodology for tests of non-automotive ICE, based on ABNT/NBR technical standards, was considered. The presented results refer to operation with commercial and non-commercial fuel blends. Characteristic curves for the tested equipment are presented, identifying consumption conditions and trend in the whole operating range of angular speeds (RPM), for five fuel blends (gasoline/ethanol). For the operating conditions of minimum and maximum angular speeds, 20 and 30% ethanol blends had the highest and lowest fuel consumptions, respectively. © 2017, Departamento de Engenharia Agricola - UFCG/Cnpq.

AB  - Biodiesels represent more carbon-neutral fuels and are introduced at an increasing extent to reduce emission of greenhouse gases. However, the potential impact of different types and blend concentrations of biodiesel on the toxicity of diesel engine emissions are still relatively scarce and to some extent contradictory. The objective of the present work was to compare the toxicity of diesel exhaust particles (DEP) from combustion of two 1st-generation fuels: 7% fatty acid methyl esters (FAME; B7) and 20% FAME (B20) and a 2nd-generation 20% FAME/HVO (synthetic hydrocarbon biofuel (SHB)) fuel. Our findings indicate that particulate emissions of each type of biodiesel fuel induce cytotoxic effects in BEAS-2B and A549 cells, manifested as cell death (apoptosis or necrosis), decreased protein concentrations, intracellular ROS production, as well as increased expression of antioxidant genes and genes coding for DNA damage-response proteins. The different biodiesel blend percentages and biodiesel feedstocks led to marked differences in chemical composition of the emitted DEP. The different DEPs also displayed statistically significant differences in cytotoxicity in A549 and BEAS-2B cells, but the magnitude of these variations was limited. Overall, it seems that increasing biodiesel blend concentrations from the current 7 to 20% FAME, or substituting 1st-generation FAME biodiesel with 2nd-generation HVO biodiesel (at least below 20% blends), affects the in vitro toxicity of the emitted DEP to some extent, but the biological significance of this may be moderate. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - The biochemical contents and biodiesel production ability of three microalgal strains grown under different sodium nitrate, sodium carbonate, and ferric ammonium citrate (iron) levels were investigated. The highest biomass and lipid contents were found in Scenedesmus sp., Chlorella sp., and Chlamydomonas sp. when grown in normal BG-11 containing sodium carbonate concentration at 0.03 g · L−1, and in normal BG-11 containing iron concentration (IC) at 0.009 or 0.012 g · L−1. Increasing the sodium nitrate level increased the biomass content, but decreased the lipid content in all three microalgae. Among the three microalgae, Scenedesmus sp. showed the highest total lipid yield of 0.69 g · L−1 under the IC of 0.012 g · L−1. Palmitic and oleic acids were the major fatty acids of Scenedesmus sp. and Chlamydomonas sp. lipids. On the other hand, Chlorella sp. lipids were rich in palmitic, oleic, and linolenic acids, and henceforth contributing to poor biodiesel properties below the standard limits. The three isolated strains had a potential for biodiesel production. Nevertheless, Scenedesmus sp. from stone quarry pond water was the most suitable source for biodiesel production with tolerance toward the high concentration of sodium carbonate without the loss of its biodiesel properties. © 2017 Phycological Society of America

AB  - Microalgae are widely viewed as a promising and sustainable source of renewable chemicals and biofuels. Botryococcus braunii synthesizes and secretes significant amounts of long-chain (C30-C40) hydrocarbons that can be subsequently converted into gasoline, diesel, and aviation fuel. B. braunii cultures are not axenic and the effects of co-cultured microorganisms on B. braunii growth and hydrocarbon yield are important, but sometimes contradictory. To understand the composition of the B. braunii microbial consortium, we used high throughput Illumina sequencing of metagenomic DNA to profile the microbiota within a well established, stable B. braunii culture and characterized the demographic changes in the microcosm following modification to the culture conditions. DNA sequences attributed to B. braunii were present in equal quantities in all treatments, whereas sequences assigned to the associated microbial community were dramatically altered. Bacterial species least affected by treatments, and more robustly associated with the algal cells, included members of Rhizobiales, comprising Bradyrhizobium and Methylobacterium, and representatives of Dyadobacter, Achromobacter and Asticcacaulis. The presence of bacterial species identified by metagenomics was confirmed by additional 16S rDNA analysis of bacterial isolates. Our study demonstrates the advantages of high throughput sequencing and robust metagenomic analyses to define microcosms and further our understanding of microbial ecology. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the polymethyl acrylate (PMA) additive on the formation of particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxide (NOX) emission from a diesel coconut and/or Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel-fueled engine. The physicochemical properties of 20% of coconut and/or C. inophyllum biodiesel–diesel blend (B20), 0.03 wt% of PMA with B20 (B20P), and diesel fuel were measured and compared to ASTM D6751, D7467, and EN 14214 standard. The test results showed that the addition of PMA additive with B20 significantly improves the cold-flow properties such as pour point (PP), cloud point (CP), and cold filter plugging point (CFPP). The addition of PMA additives reduced the engine’s brake-specific energy consumption of all tested fuels. Engine emission results showed that the additive-added fuel reduce PM concentration than B20 and diesel, whereas the PM size and NOX emission both increased than B20 fuel and baseline diesel fuel. Also, the effect of adding PMA into B20 reduced Carbon (C), Aluminum (Al), Potassium (K), and volatile materials in the soot, whereas it increased Oxygen (O), Fluorine (F), Zinc (Zn), Barium (Ba), Chlorine (Cl), Sodium (Na), and fixed carbon. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) results for B20P showed the lower agglomeration than B20 and diesel fuel. Therefore, B20P fuel can be used as an alternative to diesel fuel in diesel engines to lower the harmful emissions without compromising the fuel quality. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Researchers all around the world are making strenuous efforts to find alternative fuel to ameliorate the problem of depletion of fossil fuel. we have identified a novel plant based biofuel, namely Cymbopogon flexuous biofuel. It has excellent fuel properties and is widely available in India and it seems to have the potential to make India self-sufficient in energy production. Cerium oxide nanoparticles were synthesized using sol–gel combustion methods. Their structural, morphological and elemental properties were studied with the help of XRD, SEM, TEM and EDS respectively. On volume basis, 20% raw Cymbopogon flexuous biofuel was blended with diesel fuel, and various proportions of Cerium oxide nanoparticles, namely C20-D80 + 10 ppm, C20-D80 + 20 ppm andC20-D80 + 30 ppm were prepared. The properties like density, kinematic viscosity, calorific value of the test fuel were measured as per ASTM standards and compared with those of diesel fuel. An experimental study of its performance, emission, and combustion behavior was conducted at varied load conditions at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. NOx and smoke emission was simultaneously reduced by 3% and 6.6% respectively as compared with biofuel blend. Due to higher thermal stability and oxygen buffer of Cerium oxide nanoparticle the brake thermal efficiency was higher by 4.76% and cylinder pressure and heat release rate was also higher. © 2016 Energy Institute

AB  - Marine microalgae have emerged as important feedstock for liquid biofuel production. The identification of lipid-rich native microalgal species with high growth rate and optimal fatty acid profile and biodiesel properties is the most challenging step in microalgae-based biodiesel production. In this study, attempts have been made to bio-prospect the biodiesel production potential of marine and brackish water microalgal isolates from the west coast of India. A total of 14 microalgal species were isolated, identified using specific molecular markers and based on the lipid content; seven species with total lipid content above 20% of dry cell weight were selected for assessing biodiesel production potential in terms of lipid and biomass productivities, nile red fluorescence, fatty acid profile and biodiesel properties. On comparative analysis, the diatoms were proven to be promising based on the overall desirable properties for biodiesel production. The most potential strain Navicula phyllepta MACC8 with a total lipid content of 26.54 % of dry weight of biomass, the highest growth rate (0.58 day−1) and lipid and biomass productivities of 114 and 431 mgL−1 day−1, respectively, was rich in fatty acids mainly of C16:0, C16:1 and C18:0 in the neutral lipid fraction, the most favoured fatty acids for ideal biodiesel properties. The biodiesel properties met the requirements of fuel quality standards based on empirical estimation. The marine diatoms hold a great promise as feedstock for large-scale biodiesel production along with valuable by-products in a biorefinery perspective, after augmenting lipid and biomass production through biochemical and genetic engineering approaches. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Among these oils, jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) oil has attracted interest because it is composed almost entirely of wax esters that are liquid at room temperature. Consequently, it is widely used in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. To date, research on S. chinensis oil has focused on to its use as a fuel and its thermal stability, and information about its thermal properties is scarce. In the present study, the thermal effusivity and conductivity of jojoba oil between 20∘C and 45∘C were obtained using the inverse photopyroelectric and hot-ball techniques. The feasibility of an inverse photopyroelectric method and a hot-ball technique to monitor the thermal conductivity, and the thermal effusivity of the S. chinensis is demonstrated. The thermal effusivity decreased from 538 W·s1/2·m-2·K-1 to 378 W·s1/2·m-2·K-1 as the temperature increased, whereas the thermal conductivity remained the same over the temperature range investigated in this study. The obtained results provide insight into the thermal properties of S. chinensis oil between 20∘C and 45∘C. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The low cost biosynthesis of microbial lipids are an efficient feedstock to replace plant based oil for biodiesel production. The present study objective is to explore the effect of thermo-chemo-sonic pre-digestion of municipal Waste Activated Sludge (WAS) to cultivate oleaginous L. starkeyi MTCC-1400 as a model organism to produce high yield biomass and lipid. Higher Suspended Solids (SS) reduction (20 and 15.71%) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) solubilization (27.6 and 22.3%) were achieved at a Specific Energy (SE) input of 5569 kJ/kg for WAS digested with NaOH and KOH, respectively. The maximum biomass of 17.52 g L-1 and lipid 64.3% dwt were attained in NaOH pre-digested sample. The analyzed lipid profile exhibited high content of palmitic acid (45.6%) and oleic acid (38.7%) which are more suitable for biofuel production. Thus, these results strongly motivate the use of pre-digested WAS as an efficient and economical substrate for biodiesel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Worldwide consumption of hen eggs results in availability of large amount of discarded egg waste particularly egg shells. In the present study, the waste shells were utilized for the synthesis of highly active heterogeneous calcium oxide (CaO) nanocatalyst to transesterify dry biomass into methyl esters (biodiesel). The CaO nanocatalyst was synthesied by calcination-hydration–dehydration technique and fully characterized by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), brunauer−emmett−teller (BET) elemental and thermogravimetric analysis. TEM image showed that the nano catalyst had spherical shape with average particle size of 75 nm. BET analysis indicated that the catalyst specific surface area was 16.4 m2 g-1 with average pore diameter of 5.07 nm. The effect of nano CaO catalyst was investigated by direct transesterification of dry biomass into biodiesel along with other reaction parameters such as catalyst ratio, reaction time and stirring rate. The impact of the transesterification reaction parameters and microalgal biodiesel yield were analyzed by response surface methodology based on a full factorial, central composite design. The significance of the predicted mode was verified and 86.41% microalgal biodiesel yield was reported at optimal parameter conditions 1.7% (w/w), catalyst ratio, 3.6 h reaction time and stirring rate of 140.6 rpm. The biodiesel conversion was determined by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). The fuel properties of prepared biodiesel were found to be highly comply with the biodiesel standard ASTMD6751 and EN14214. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Alterations of gut bacterial metabolism play an important role in their host metabolism, and can result in diseases such as obesity and diabetes. While many factors were discovered influencing the gut bacterial metabolism, exposure to ultrafine particles (UFPs) from engine combustions were recently proposed to be a potential risk factor for the perturbation of gut bacterial metabolism, and consequentially to obesity and diabetes development. This study focused on evaluation of how UFPs from diesel engine combustions impact gut bacterial metabolism. We hypothesize that UFPs from different type of diesel (petrodiesel vs. biodiesel) will both impact bacterial metabolism, and the degree of impact is also diesel type-dependent. Targeted metabolic profiling of 221 metabolites were applied to three model gut bacteria in vitro, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus fermentum. UFPs from two types of fuels, petrodiesel (B0) and a biodiesel blend (B20: 20% soy biodiesel/80% B0 by volume), were exposed to the bacteria and their metabolic changes were compared. For each bacterial strain, metabolites with significantly changed abundance were observed in both perturbations, and all three strains have increased number of altered metabolites detected from B20 UFPs perturbation in comparison to B0 UFPs. Multivariate statistical analysis further confirmed that the metabolic profiles were clearly different between testing groups. Metabolic pathway analyses also demonstrated several important metabolic pathways, including pathways involves amino acids biosynthesis and sugar metabolism, were significantly impacted by UFPs exposure. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Sapindus mukorossi and Sapindus delavayi seeds were collected from 60 populations distributed over a wide geographic area (a range of 12.0° latitude, 19.0° longitude, and 1800 m elevation) across southern China. The variation in fatty acid composition of seed kernel oil between the two species and among individuals was determined, and relationships with geographical and environmental factors were analyzed. The oil characterization allowed the identification and the quantification of 12 fatty acids. The C16–C20 fatty acids accounted for more than 98% of the total content, of which oleic acid was the most abundant (more than 50%). The fatty acid composition was generally stable between the two species and among individuals despite the wide geographic range from which the samples were collected, and the oil showed good potential for biodiesel production. Oleic acid showed insensitivity to environmental factors. Correlation analysis showed that environmental factors had a strong influence on the composition of other fatty acids, such as C20:1 (20.95%), C18:2 (7.56%), C20:0 (6.01%), and C16:0 (4.55%), and explained 36.68% of the total variance. Among the environmental factors, elevation, maximum temperature, and precipitation significantly contributed to variation in seed kernel oil fatty acid composition among populations. Furthermore, the cooperativity of elevation and maximum explained 30.13% of the variance (P < 0.01). Thus, environmental factors, especially elevation, maximum temperature, and precipitation, of the original provenance should be considered during genotype selection. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Industrial spent coffee grounds (IND-SCG) are a potential non-edible biodiesel feedstock due to their abundant global supply and high oil content. In this study, an in-situ transesterification (in-situ TE) was developed and scaled up for IND-SCG biodiesel production. Several hurdles must be overcome, including the high acid value, and wide range in particle size of IND-SCG. Washing IND-SCG with methanol reduced its high acid value with negligible loss of oil. Size reduction (0.25–1.68 mm) and an increase of the reaction temperatures (30–60 °C) were found to improve the biodiesel yield significantly. The whole deacidified IND-SCG was processed at 50 °C; and a maximum biodiesel yield of 77% was achieved within 3 h. The process was successfully scaled up for processing 4 kg IND-SCG per batch with a yield comparable to the 30-g scale. The IND-SCG biodiesel met the ASTM biodiesel standard in terms of total glycerin, water content, kinematic viscosity and oxidative stability index (OSI), but its acid value exceeded the standard. A simple process modification using acidic water to neutralize alkaline catalyst during refining step, instead of strong acid, enabled the IND-SCG biodiesel to meet the standard for acid value. The oxidative stability index of the in-situ IND-SCG biodiesel was superior to that of the conventional process, probably due to the co-extraction of natural antioxidants. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Brassica napus L. is an important oil crop worldwide and is the main raw material for biofuel. Seed weight and seed size are the main contributors to seed yield. DA1 (DA means big in Chinese) is an ubiquitin receptor and negatively regulates seed size. Down-regulation of AtDA1 in Arabidopsis leads to larger seeds and organs by increasing cell proliferation in integuments. In this study, BnDA1 was down-regulated in B. napus by over expressed of AtDA1R358K, which is a functional deficiency of DA1 with an arginine-to-lysine mutation at the 358th amino acid. The results showed that the biomass and size of the seeds, cotyledons, leaves, flowers and siliques of transgenic plants all increased significantly. In particular, the 1000 seed weight increased 21.23% and the seed yield per plant increased 13.22% in field condition. The transgenic plants had no negative traits related to yield. The candidate gene association analysis demonstrated that the BnDA1 locus was contributed to the seeds weight. Therefore, our study showed that regulation of DA1 in B. napus can increase the seed yield and biomass, and DA1 is a promising target for crop improvement. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Urnula sp. was isolated as an endophyte of Dicksonia antarctica and identified primarily on the basis of its ITS sequence and morphological features. The anamorphic state of the fungus appeared as a hyphomyceteous-like fungus as based on its features in culture and scanning electron microscopy examination of its spores. On potato dextrose agar (PDA), the organism makes a characteristic fragrance resembling peach pie with vanilla overtones. A GC/MS analysis done on the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of this organism, trapped by carbotrap methodology, revealed over 150 compounds with high MS matching quality being noted for 44 of these. Some of the most abundantly produced compounds included 4-decene, tridecane, 2-decene (E), 2-dodecene, (Z,E)-alpha-farnesene, butanoic acid, pentyl ester, and 1-hexanol,2-ethyl. In addition, vanillin, methyl vanillin, and many other fragrant substances were noted including isomenthol, pyrazine derivatives, and 3-decanone. In split plate bioassay tests on potato dextrose agar (PDA), Botrytis cinerea, Ceratocystis ulmi, Pythium ultimum, Fusarium solani, and Rhizoctonia solani were inhibited at levels of 24 to 50% of their normal growth on this medium. Bioreactors supporting fungal growth on 50 g of beet pulp waste, using stainless steel carbotraps, yielded over 180 mg of hydrocarbon-based products collected over 6 weeks of incubation. Similarly, because this organism is making one of the largest sets of VOCs as any fungus examined to date, producing many compounds of commercial interest, it has enormous biotechnical potential. The role of the VOCs in the biology and ecology of this endophyte may be related to the antimicrobial activities that they possess. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Ethyl levulinate (EL) synthesis from biorenewable feedstocks in the presence of metal salts and under non-microwave instant heating reaction environment has been studied. Initial screening suggested CuCl2 and FeCl3 as an efficient catalyst for EL synthesis from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), thereby resulting into 47.5% and 43.3% EL yield respectively at 160 °C in 5 min. Interestingly, environmentally benign and widely available metal salt, AlCl3, was found to yield comparable EL (39.0%) when experiments were performed under identical reaction conditions. Therefore, further study was performed using AlCl3 to estimate the effect of operating parameters and catalyst concentration over EL yield and HMF conversion. Thereafter, a comparative study on the effect of microwave vs non-microwave instant heating reaction environment has been done to develop a sustainable process for EL synthesis. Consequently, mechanistic insights on reactant conversion and product yield have been attempted to understand various pathways followed. Thereafter, effect of reaction temperature, catalyst loading, ethanol concentration and heating rates were explored. EL synthesis from HMF under instant heating reaction conditions in the presence of metal salts is reported for the first time. We anticipate that present work would be helpful in providing insights on effects of instant heating method and operating conditions for EL synthesis from HMF. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In urban environments, carbon dioxide (CO2) is emitted from a variety of anthropogenic and biogenic sources. The isotopic ratio δ13CO2 has been widely used to source apportion CO2 as different sources have distinct isotopic fingerprints; the disadvantage of this technique is that δ13CO2 signatures are often spatially and temporally specific. We present a study characterizing the δ13CO2 signatures of the dominant anthropogenic sources of CO2 in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Refined gasoline and diesel fuel were sampled from various stations around the GTA in three separate campaigns (April, July and November 2015) to assess the variability of their δ13CO2 signatures. Mean winter δ13CO2 signatures for refined gasoline were measured to be −27.58 ± 0.52 ‰ and −28.12 ± 0.43 ‰ (uncertainties represent the standard deviation in sample signatures) in April and November respectively while the mean summer signature was measured to be −28.09 ± 0.34 ‰. Diesel fuel samples δ13CO2 signatures from the same campaign periods were measured to be −29.09 ± 0.34 ‰, −29.47 ± 0.29 ‰, and −29.28 ± 0.21 ‰, respectively. We hypothesize that inter-seasonal variability in signatures is likely a result of the use of different parent crude petroleum. We found no significant impacts from octane grade, fuel distributor or municipality the fuel was purchased from on the measured δ13CO2 signatures. Other transportation fuels that were measured include dyed-diesel (δ13CO2 signature = −29.3 ± 0.20 ‰) and jet fuel (δ13CO2 signature = −29.5 ± 0.20 ‰), which were both different than measurements made for the same fuels in other locations globally. To account for emissions from residential and commercial heating and electricity production, a variety of fuels were characterized in this study. The primary heating fuel used in the GTA, natural gas, was measured to have a δ13CH4 signature of −44.2 ± 0.20 ‰. Anthracite coal (a fuel that was used prior to 2014 for electricity) was measured to have a δ13CO2 signature of −23.8 ± 0.20 ‰, which is fairly consistent with coal samples measured elsewhere. With the transition in Ontario from coal to biomass-fueled power generation, softwood, hardwood and mixed wood pellets were sampled from two distributors in the GTA and measured δ13CO2 signatures were −25.0 ± 0.20 ‰, −26.8 ± 0.20 ‰, and −25.8 ± 0.20 ‰, respectively. Using these measured signatures, we performed a sensitivity analysis to quantify the precision required for continuous ambient measurements to separately identify fuel type using δ13CO2 as the sole tracer. The local signatures were also used in a mass balance calculation to quantify the relative contribution of two end-members (with the signatures of −44 ‰ and −28 ‰) to total measured CO2 in the GTA in 2014. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - (Chemical Equation Presented) Oxygenated biofuels provide a renewable, domestic source of energy that can enable adoption of advanced, high-efficiency internal combustion engines, such as those based on homogeneously charged compression ignition (HCCI). Of key importance to such engines is the cetane number (CN) of the fuel, which is determined by the autoignition of the fuel under compression at relatively low temperatures (550-800 K). For the plethora of oxygenated biofuels possible, it is desirable to know the ignition delay times and the CN of these fuels to help guide conversion strategies so as to focus efforts on the most desirable fuels. For alkanes, the chemical pathways leading to radical chain-branching reactions giving rise to low-temperature autoignition are well-known and are highly coincident with the buildup of reactive radicals such as OH. Key in the mechanisms leading to chain branching are the addition of molecular oxygen to alkyl radicals and the rearrangement and dissociation of the resulting peroxy radials. Prediction of the temperature and pressure dependence of reactions that lead to the buildup of reactive radicals requires a detailed understanding of the potential energy surfaces (PESs) of these reactions. In this study, we used quantum mechanical modeling to systematically compare the effects of oxygen functionalities on these PESs and associated kinetics so as to understand how they affect experimental trends in autoignition and CN. The molecules studied here include pentane, pentanol, pentanal, 2-heptanone, methylpentyl ether, methyl hexanoate, and pentyl acetate. All have a saturated five-carbon alkyl chain with an oxygen functional group attached to the terminal carbon atom. The results of our systematic comparison may be summarized as follows: (1) Oxygen functionalities activate C-H bonds by lowering the bond dissociation energy (BDE) relative to alkanes. (2) The R-OO bonds in peroxy radicals adjacent to carbonyl groups are weaker than corresponding alkyl systems, leading to dissociation of ROO• radicals and reducing reactivity and hence CN. (3) Hydrogen atom transfer in peroxy radicals is important in autoignition, and low barriers for ethers and aldehydes lead to high CN. (4) Peroxy radicals formed from alcohols have low barriers to form aldehydes, which reduce the reactivity of the alkyl radical. These findings for the formation and reaction of alkyl radicals with molecular oxygen explain the trend in CN for these common biofuel functional groups. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Crude bio-oil from the brown alga Saccharina japonica was separated into distilled fractions under reduced pressure (40 mmHg). The three bio-oil distillates were depending on temperature (Fraction I; ≤40 °C, Fraction II; 40–120 °C, Fraction III; 120–160 °C, solid residue; b.p. > 160 °C). The characteristic of the middle distillates showed that aliphatics (including alkanes) and aromatics (including heterocyclics) were mostly distributed in a dark hydrophobic oil (DHO) of Fractions II and III, while anhydrosugars, acids, ketones and ethers were mainly concentrated in a transparent hydrophilic oil (THO) of Fractions II and III. © 2017 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

AB  - The biomass-derived platform molecule levulinic acid is converted into the angelica lactone dimer (ALD) in high overall yield using simple inorganic catalysts. Hydrodecarboxylation of ALD using a Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst under moderate hydrogen gas pressure at high temperatures generates branched C8–C9 hydrocarbons in nearly quantitative yield consuming as little as a single equivalent of external hydrogen. These molecules are high-octane “drop-in” equivalents of isoalkanes used in commercial gasoline. Catalytic hydrodecarboxylation is presented as a highly effective means to reduce hydrogen demand in biomass-to-biofuel conversion technologies. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Various supported metal catalysts are screened for hydrogenation of lauric acid and 2-octanone as model reactions for the transformation of biomass-derived oxygenates to liquid alkanes (biofuels) in a batch reactor under solvent-free conditions. Among the catalysts tested, Pt and MoOx co-loaded on TiO2 (Pt–MoOx/TiO2) shows the highest yields of n-alkanes for both of the reactions. Pt–MoOx/TiO2 selectively catalyzes the hydrodeoxygenation of various fatty acids and triglycerides to n-alkanes without C−C bond cleavage under 50 bar H2 and shows higher turnover numbers than the catalysts in the literature. Pt–MoOx/TiO2 is effective also for the hydrodeoxygenation of various ketones to the corresponding alkanes. In situ IR study of the reaction of adsorbed acetone under H2 suggests that the high activity of Pt–MoOx/TiO2 is attributed to the cooperation between Pt and Lewis acid sites of the MoOx/TiO2 support. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - In this work, we describe a simple, heterogeneous catalytic system for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of 5-nonanone and 2,5-hexanedione, which we use as model compounds for more complex biomass-derived molecules. We present the stepwise reduction of ketones by using supported metal and solid acid catalysts to identify the intermediates en route to hydrocarbons. Although monoketone HDO can be achieved rapidly using moderate conditions (Ni/SiO2.Al2O3, HZSM-5, 200 °C, 1.38 MPa H2, 1 h), quantitative γ-polyketone HDO requires higher pressures and longer reaction times (Pd/Al2O3, HZSM-5, 2.76 MPa H2, 5 h), although these are more facile conditions than have been reported previously for γ-polyketone HDO. Stepwise HDO of the γ-polyketone shows the reaction pathway occurs through ring-closure to a saturated tetrahydrofuran species intermediate, which requires increased H2 pressure to ring-open and subsequently to fully HDO. This work allows for further understanding of bio-derived molecule defunctionalization mechanisms, and ultimately aids in the promotion of biomass as a feedstock for fuels and chemicals. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Under section 211 of the Clean Air Act, the EPA is required to set renewable fuel percentage standards every year. This action proposes the annual percentage standards for cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel that apply to gasoline and diesel transportation fuel produced or imported in 2018. Relying on statutory waiver authority that is available when projected cellulosic biofuel production volumes are less than the applicable volume specified in the statute, the EPA is proposing volume requirements for cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel that are below the statutory applicable volumes, and lower than the 2017 requirements. In this action, the applicable volume of biomass-based diesel for 2019 is being proposed. Comments must be received on or before 8/31/2017.

AB  - Background: The GTAP model has been used to estimate biofuel policy induced land use changes and consequent GHG emissions for more than a decade. This paper reviews the history of the model and database modifications and improvements that have occurred over that period. In particular, the paper covers in greater detail the move from the 2004 to the 2011 database, and the inclusion of cropland intensification in the modeling structure. Results: The results show that all the changes in the global economy and agricultural sectors cause biofuels induced land use changes and associated emissions can be quite different using the 2011 database versus 2004. The results also demonstrate the importance of including land intensification in the analysis. The previous versions of GTAP and other similar models assumed that changes in harvested area equal changes in cropland area. However, FAO data demonstrate that it is not correct for several important world regions. The model now includes land intensification, and the resulting land use changes and emission values are lower as would be expected. Conclusions: Dedicated energy crops are not similar to the first generation feedstocks in the sense that they do not generate the level of market-mediated responses which we have seen in the first-generation feedstocks. The major market-mediated responses are reduced consumption, crop switching, changes in trade, changes in intensification, and forest or pasture conversion. These largely do not apply to dedicated energy corps. The land use emissions for cellulosic feedstocks depend on what we assume in the emissions factor model regarding soil carbon gained or lost in converting land to these feedstocks. We examined this important point for producing bio-gasoline from miscanthus. Much of the literature suggests miscanthus actually sequesters carbon, if grown on the existing active cropland or degraded land. We provide some illustrative estimates for possible assumptions. Finally, it is important to note the importance of the new results for the regulatory process. The current California Air Resources Board carbon scores for corn ethanol and soy biodiesel are 19.8 and 29.1, respectively (done with a model version that includes irrigation). The new model and database carbon scores are 12 and 18, respectively, for corn ethanol and soy biodiesel. Thus, the current estimates values are substantially less than the values currently being used for regulatory purposes. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Owing to the increasing share of biofuels in combustion engines, use of these oxygenated fuels instead of diesel should be evaluated under different engine operating conditions. This paper studies the influence of oxygenated fuels on engine performance parameters under transient, compared to steady-state, operation on a six-cylinder, turbocharged, compression-ignition engine with a common rail injection system. The fuels used in this study were diesel, waste cooking biodiesel, and triacetin (as a highly oxygenated additive). A custom test was used to investigate different engine performance parameters during acceleration, load increase, and steady-state modes of operation. Additionally, a legislative transient cycle (NRTC), composed of many discrete transient modes, was used to study engine performance during a whole transient cycle. In this paper, different engine performance-related parameters were investigated, such as IMEP, BMEP, FMEP, turbocharger lag, air-to-fuel ratio, engine speed and torque, start of injection, start of combustion, injection pressure, maximum in-cylinder pressure, maximum rate of pressure rise, intake and exhaust manifold pressures, and CoV of IMEP. The investigation demonstrates that engine behavior during transient operation is different from steady-state operation. Results during NRTC indicated that, in comparison with diesel, the oxygenated fuels have lower IMEP (up to 18.7%), BMEP (up to 21.7%), and FMEP (up to 12.7%). During transient modes of the custom test, using oxygenated fuels rather than diesel resulted in higher indicated torque, maximum in-cylinder pressure, and maximum rate of pressure rise; however, during steady-state, most of the oxygenated fuels had lower values in these three parameters. Each advance in SOI corresponds to a rise in the maximum in-cylinder pressure and in the maximum rate of pressure rise. Oxygenated fuels had lower intake manifold pressure and CoV of IMEP than diesel. Different fuel properties were used to interpret engine behavior. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - There is a growing interest in lignin valorization to biofuels and chemicals. Here, we propose a novel and simple noncatalytic process to directly liquefy lignin rich solid residual from second generation bioethanol production by solvolysis with ethanol. Through an extensive parameter study in batch autoclaves assessing the effects of varying reaction temperature, reaction time, and solvent:lignin ratio, it is shown that hydrothermally pretreated enzymatic hydrolysis lignin solvolysis in supercritical ethanol can produce a heptane soluble bio-oil without the need for exhaustive deoxygenation. The process does not require addition of catalyst or a reducing agent such as hydrogen. The process is advantageously carried out with a low reaction period (<1 h) and with a reduced amount of solvent to lignin feedstock (ethanol:lignin (w/w) ratio of 2:1) which is a previously unexplored domain for lignin solvolysis. The resulting bio-oil product is mainly a mixture of di- and monomeric lignin species where the original lignin unit linkages have been broken. The oxygen content is lowered to <10 wt % (corresponding to an HHV of 36 MJ/kg) and the bio-oil is stable and acid free (verified by NMR), and due to the use of sulfur free lignin rich residual as feedstock, the resulting oil product is equally sulfur free. The residual solid product (char) has a reduced oxygen content relative to the lignin feed and equally increased higher heating value, making it a candidate for use as a biochar. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Valuable oil within the seeds of Senna occidentalis is extracted by completely different strategy. However, ancient Soxhlet extraction was compared with microwave-assisted extraction. Soxhlet extraction was known to enhance the yield of bio-oil production. Three polar solvents specifically methanol, acetone, isopropyl alcohol and three non-polar solvents specifically chloroform, hexane, toluene were used. Soxhlet equipment has been established to be the simplest technique with the highest oil yield. Parameters like size fractions of the crushed seeds, extraction time, aging of seeds, and selection of solvents have been optimized in order to enhance oil yield. The bio-oil was characterized using (FT-IR) and GC/MS. Chemical reaction price, iodine variety, relative density, carbon residue content, flash purpose, fire point, hot price, and kinematic consistency were investigated to characterize fuel quality of the bio-oil. The maximum oil yield of 23.46% was obtained with isopropanol at 82.6°C and 3.5 h of optimum extraction time. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Fly ash-derived HZSM-5 catalyst was first applied in the catalytic pyrolysis of Jatropha residues in a semi-continuous fixed-bed reactor. The catalytic performance of HZSM-5 catalysts prepared from chemicals including conventional hydrothermal HZSM-5, Ni/HZSM-5 by ion exchange, and commercial HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 30) was evaluated for comparison. Catalytic pyrolysis of Jatropha residues with HZSM-5 catalysts was investigated in terms of product yields and qualities of bio-oil and bio-char. The liquid yield produced from fly ash-derived HZSM-5 was 29.4%, which was comparable to those obtained from chemicals and commercial (30.2–32.2%). Fly ash-derived HZSM-5 had high efficiency in increasing desirable compounds such as aliphatics and phenols as well as decreasing oxygenates and particularly N-containing compounds in bio-oils. The higher heating values and pH value of catalytic bio-oil achieved from fly ash-derived HZSM-5 were comparable to those achieved from HZSM-5 prepared from chemicals and commercial. The bio-char had 48–50 wt% carbon and was classified as mesoporous material. Overall, HZSM-5 derived from fly ash showed potentials to use as a catalyst for catalytic pyrolysis application. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In this study, a non-edible seed oil of Alexandrian Laurel (Calophyllum inophyllum L.) with higher free fatty acid content has been harnessed to produce biodiesel by transesterification process. The 20.2% free fatty acid (FFA) content was first reduced to 12.9% by using TOP degumming process. Ortho-phosphoric acid was used to esterify the refined kernel oil. Transesterification reaction was performed with NaOH as an alkaline catalyst and methanol as an analytical solvent. The effects of methanol to oil molar ratio (MR), catalyst concentration (CC), reaction temperature (TP), reaction time (TM), and stirrer speed (SS) on biodiesel conversion were studied to optimize the transesterification conditions using DOE- approach. The experimental study revealed that 9:1 MR, 0.8 wt.% CC, 60°C TP, 75 min TM and 1000 rpm SS were the optimal process control variables. The study indicated that CC was the most important control parameter in optimal methyl ester production. The optimal treatment combination yielded 97.14% of biodiesel. The profile of biodiesel was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 1H NMR spectrum of Calophyllum inophyllum methyl ester (CIME) has been reported. The properties of the biodiesel have been found within specifications of the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards and hence could be considered as a suitable alternative to diesel fuel for sustainable circulation of carbon. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A series of heterogeneous KF/CaO catalysts modified with transition metals (lanthanum, cerium, and zirconium) were prepared via wet impregnation method and applied to the trsansesterification process of waste cooking oil (WCO) as feedstock with methanol to biodiesel production. The structure, performance of the solid catalysts was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The effect of methanol/oil molar ratio, 1reaction time, reaction temperature, catalyst amount, and stability was investigated. The results showed that 10 wt% of lanthanum, cerium, and zirconium improved the catalytic activity of KF/CaO catalyst. The maximum catalytic activity using the lanthanum doping of 10wt% on KF/CaO catalyst was reached 98.7% under the optimal reaction condition of methanol/oil molar ratio of 12:1, reaction for 1 h at reaction temperature of 65°C, and 4% (wt/wt oil) catalyst amount. In addition, the FAME yield of KF/CaO/La catalyst remained higher than 95% after 10 cycles. The promotional effect of lanthanum doping could be attributed to the enhancement of the basicity strength of KF/CaO catalyst and block the leach of Ca2+ in the transesterification reaction. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Bio-oil obtained from pyrolysis is highly complicated mixture with valued chemicals. In order to reduce the complexity for unambiguous characterization of components present in bio-oil, solvent extractions using different solvents with increasing polarity have been adopted. The fractions have been analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for identifying the functional groups and Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), for detailed characterization of components present in various fractions, thereby providing in-depth information at molecular level of various components in bio-oil. This paper reveals the potential of the analytical techniques in identification and brings out the similarities as well as differences in the components present in the bio-oil obtained from two non-edible oil seed-cakes, viz., Jatropha and Karanjia. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel is a very important biofuel obtained from vegetable oil or animal fat by a chemical reaction known as transesterification. It consists mainly of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). In biodiesel quality control, the limits and methodologies for each parameter are well established, and one of them is related to the total amount of FAMEs, which is measured by gas chromatography. However, the development of other analytical methods for such measurements can serve as alternative techniques. In this work, the use of a mass spectrometer with direct infusion into an electrospray ionization source (ESI-MS) is shown as a promising technique to quantify the FAMEs present in biodiesel. Due to the chemical difference and the behaviour of the methyl esters, the ionizations occur at different scales. Thus, to evaluate this behaviour, the concept of relative ionization efficiency (RIE) in the ESI source was used for quantification. Uncertainty estimations of intensity measurement by ESI-MS were also proposed. Four biodiesel samples (canola, coconut, crambe and soy) were synthesized, and their concentrations were determined by the reference methods, GC-MS and GC-FID, and by the proposed method, ESI-MS. Then the efficiency of the method was evaluated by comparing the methods with two approaches, one using the uncertainties and another considering a statistical analysis. In both situations, the methods could be considered as equivalent. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The continued increase in urbanization and vehicle ownership poses an increasing challenge in curbing the rising energy consumption and CO2 emissions in Malaysia. For more than a decade, road vehicles have been the leading contributor in the country, due mainly to their heavy reliance on petroleum products, particularly gasoline and diesel. The efficient utilization of petroleum products becomes paramount in reducing Malaysia's overall CO2 emissions in the land transportation sector. The timely abolition of petroleum product subsidies in 2014 may provide a financial source to support the improvement of petroleum product efficiency. The primary purpose of this paper is to examine the impact on economic growth and sectoral performance with fuel subsidy savings being reallocated to the biofuel industry for research and development purposes. The study then investigates whether an environmental tax on petroleum products could induce more energy saving and emission control. This research applies the computable general equilibrium modeling for the simulation, as it takes into account the interaction between petroleum products and the economy as a whole. The Malaysia Input-Output Tables 2010 is the main database used in the simulation. The simulation results found that fuel efficiency improvement could produce a double dividend effect with simultaneous benefits on the economy and environmental quality. A simultaneous implementation with fuel tax policy appears to be one suitable complementary measure for a further emission cut. However, sufficient compensation schemes might be necessary to stimulate economic activities over time. Based on the simulation results, policymakers should emphasize fuel efficiency improvement as a crucial strategy to control the rising energy consumption and emissions in Malaysia. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A positive matrix factorization model (US EPA PMF version 5.0) was applied for the source apportionment of the dataset of 37 non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) measured from 19 December 2012 to 30 January 2013 during the SusKat-ABC international air pollution measurement campaign using a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer in the Kathmandu Valley. In all, eight source categories were identified with the PMF model using the new constrained model operation mode. Unresolved industrial emissions and traffic source factors were the major contributors to the total measured NMVOC mass loading (17.9 and 16.8%, respectively) followed by mixed industrial emissions (14.0%), while the remainder of the source was split approximately evenly between residential biofuel use and waste disposal (10.9%), solvent evaporation (10.8%), biomass co-fired brick kilns (10.4%), biogenic emissions (10.0%) and mixed daytime factor (9.2%). Conditional probability function (CPF) analyses were performed to identify the physical locations associated with different sources. Source contributions to individual NMVOCs showed that biomass co-fired brick kilns significantly contribute to the elevated concentrations of several health relevant NMVOCs such as benzene. Despite the highly polluted conditions, biogenic emissions had the largest contribution (24.2%) to the total daytime ozone production potential, even in winter, followed by solvent evaporation (20.2%), traffic (15.0%) and unresolved industrial emissions (14.3%). Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production had approximately equal contributions from biomass co-fired brick kilns (28.9%) and traffic (28.2%). Comparison of PMF results based on the in situ data versus REAS v2.1 and EDGAR v4.2 emission inventories showed that both the inventories underestimate the contribution of traffic and do not take the contribution of brick kilns into account. In addition, the REAS inventory overestimates the contribution of residential biofuel use and underestimates the contribution of solvent use and industrial sources in the Kathmandu Valley. The quantitative source apportionment of major NMVOC sources in the Kathmandu Valley based on this study will aid in improving hitherto largely un-validated bottom-up NMVOC emission inventories, enabling more focused mitigation measures and improved parameterizations in chemical transport models. © Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Life cycle optimization (LCO) enables static life cycle analysis (LCA) and techno-economic analysis to be performed dynamically for automatic generation and optimization of process alternatives. Existing LCO models are developed following an attributional LCA approach, which overlooks the environmental consequences in response to the changes in the market. In this study, we develop a consequential LCO framework that simultaneously optimizes consequential environmental impacts and economic performance. We propose a general system boundary that encloses processes linked by markets. On the basis of the general system boundary, we develop a multiobjective optimization model, which integrates process models and market models with the tenets of consequential LCA and techno-economic analysis methodologies. To efficiently solve the resulting nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, a global optimization algorithm is proposed to integrate the inexact parametric algorithm and the branch-and-refine algorithm. The application of the proposed framework is illustrated through a case study of producing renewable diesel from microalgae. We conduct detailed market analysis to identify the consequences associated with the renewable diesel production process. The environmental impacts of the optimal process designs based on the proposed consequential LCO framework are significantly lower than those based on the existing attributional LCO framework. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study aimed to compare personal exposures to diesel fuel and a biodiesel blend exhaust in an underground mine. Personal exposure monitoring was performed in a non-operational, hard rock underground mine during use of a load-haul-dump vehicle. Eight-hour time-weighted average (TWA8) exposure concentrations of ultra-low sulfur diesel and 75% biodiesel/25% diesel blend (B75) fuels were compared. Compared to diesel, use of B75 was associated with relative percent reductions of 22 and 28% in median respirable (r) diesel particulate matter (DPM) and nitrogen dioxide and 25 and 23% increases in median total DPM and nitric oxide TWA8 exposure concentrations, respectively. Diesel was associated with a slightly greater total geometric mean mass concentration and lower mean surface area concentration. Although further testing is needed, B75 has the potential to reduce rDPM exposures. © 2017 JOEH, LLC.

AB  - The effects of biodiesel fuels made from swine or chicken fat residues on CO, CO2, and NOx tailpipe exhaust emissions in comparison with petrodiesel was identified. A comprehensive principal component analyses was performed to help elucidate potential associations between CN, I, and CO2, CO, and NOx emissions with different sources of feedstock commonly employed in the biodiesel industry. Significant reduction in CO emissions was obtained for all biodiesel blends tested except B5 from FW-2. An increase in fue lconsumption of up to 5% was measured for B5 and B100 from either FW-1 or FW-2. Principal component analysis demonstrated that NOx, CN, and I index were inversely proportional to CO2 and biodiesel concnetrations. Additionally, increased NOx emissions were reported from high-iodine-index biodiesel derived especially from forestry, fishery, and some agriculture feedstocks. Biodiesel derived from animal sources had lower iodine index, mitigatin NOx emissions.

AB  - Increase in global development of renewable energy sources as sustainable alternatives to the conventional fossil fuels witnessed in recent time is linked to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; high dependency on imported fossil oil especially in the developed world; non-renewable nature of fossil fuels; price volatility of petroleum products and instability in the oil producing areas. Therefore, bioenergy appears to offer hope for addressing these concerns while also providing new opportunities for farmers in developing and developed countries alike. Among the many possible resources, biodiesel has received the most attention as a promising substitute for conventional petrol-diesel fuel. The production of biodiesel (methyl esters) from Jatropha plant is currently generating interest in every economy of the world as an alternative means of producing liquid fuels from biomass and have gather relevance due to the environmental advantage the process offers. Biodiesel is a renewable source of energy that can facilitate clean air, readily usable in existing engines and transport facilities, capable of generating employment and income for citizens but has not been fully tapped. Hence, efforts are being made to explore this economically competitive, environmentally acceptable and readily available alternative source of energy. Therefore, the paper provides a review of Jatropha as a feedstock for biodiesel production in Nigeria. Focusing on biodiesel development from Jatropha feedstock, the objectives of reviewing its current trends in the production of this biofuel will hold an immense benefit. The biodiesel fuel properties and potential of Jatropha towards environmental sustainability, poverty alleviation, and more importantly improve economic development for rural communities were highlighted. © 2017 PENERBIT AKADEMIA BARU - All rights reserved.

AB  - This study evaluates the impact of biofuels on the air quality of the city of Rio de Janeiro using an air quality model based on the trajectory model OZIPR associated with the SAPRC chemical model. The results show that the increase in biodiesel use reduces ozone levels in the atmosphere by 10.2 %, using Biodiesel with Ethanol and Diesel mixture (BE-Diesel), in 5.28 %, using B20 mixture and only 0.33 % using B10. An increase was observed in NOx emissions of 5.66 and 2.83 % for BE-Diesel mixture and B20, respectively. The low ozone levels are attributed to its consumption by NO. The CO concentration reductions for BE-Diesel, B20 and B10 were 13.11, 6.56 and 4.12 %, respectively. The presence of oxygen atoms within the biodiesel chain leads to a better combustion process, reducing CO emissions.

AB  - This work presents a synthesis of bimetallic NiMo and NiW modified ZSM-5/MCM-41 composites and their heterogeneous catalytic conversion of crude palm oil (CPO) to biofuels. The ZSM-5/MCM-41 composites were synthesized through a self-assembly of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactant with silica-alumina from ZSM-5 zeolite, prepared from natural kaolin by the hydrothermal technique. Subsequently, the synthesized composites were deposited with bimetallic NiMo and NiW by impregnation method. The obtained catalysts presented a micro-mesoporous structure, confirmed by XRD, SEM, TEM, EDX, NH3-TPD, XRF and N2 adsorption-desorption measurements. The results of CPO conversion demonstrate that the catalytic activity of the synthesized catalysts decreases in the series of NiMo-ZSM-5/MCM-41&gt;NiW-ZSM-5/MCM-41&gt;Ni-ZSM-5/MCM-41&gt;Mo-ZSM-5/MCM-41&gt;W-ZSM-5/MCM-41&gt;NiMo-ZSM-5&gt;NiW-ZSM-5&gt;ZSM-5/MCM-41&gt;ZSM-5&gt;MCM-41.It was found that the bimetallic NiMo-and NiW-ZSM-5/MCM-41 catalysts give higher yields of liquid hydrocarbons than other catalysts at a given conversion. Types of hydrocarbon in liquid products, identified by simulated distillation gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (SimDis GC-FID), are gasoline (150-200℃; C5-12), kerosene (250-300℃; C5-20) and diesel (350℃; C7-20). Moreover, the conversion of CPO to biofuel products using the NiMo-and NiW-ZSM-5/MCM-41 catalysts offers no statistically significant difference (P&gt;0.05) at 95% confidence level, evaluated by SPSS analysis. © 2017, Science Press.

AB  - Biofuels derived from renewable biomass has been the focus of bio-based economy. Especially the development of new processes and facilities from lignocellulosic waste for advanced biofuel production represents an important field for academic research and industrial innovation within bioenergy development. The technical pathways for advanced biofuel production include the processes of cellulosic ethanol through lignocellulose hydrolysis-sugar fermentation, two-step hydrogenation (hydrodeoxygenation and hydroisomerization) of oils and fats (HVO), biomass gasification-Fischer Tropsch synthesis, biomass pyrolysis-upgrading of bio-oil and hydrotreating of algae oil via thermochemical, biochemical and hybrid conversions. Bio-oil, syngas, and sugars are used as platform chemicals. The progress of advanced biofuel development and the project activities in foreign countries were reviewed, which used lignocellulosic biomass, energy crops, municipal solid waste and organic waste as feedstock. The policies and regulations of advanced biofuels in America, Brazil, European Union and Canada, were described and compared. The current status of commercial and demonstration-scale facilities for advanced biofuel production was also discussed, mainly following the conversion processes of lignocellulosic ethanol, hydrotreated oils/fats (HVO) and biomass gasification-Fischer Tropsch synthesis. Although advanced biofuels have advantages for sustainable development, energy security and low carbon emission, the overall production and develop pathways cannot have cost parity with fossil-based fuels. The key barriers associated with its high cost include the unreliable feedstock availability, high production cost and uncertainty of policies. Biomass feedstock, especially lignocellulosic biomass, has huge annual amount worldwide, yet the significant hurdles for collecting, transportation and storage of biomass are needed to overcome in the scale-up of advanced biofuel production. And the limited lignocellulosic feedstock supply is also the result of uncertainties associated with its demand in the current market. Technical risk associated with scaling-up facilities is another restraining factor for investors due to the complexity of lignocellulosic feedstock and its conversion technologies, compared with starch-based corn ethanol. Financial support for pilot and demonstration plants can provide a valuable opportunity to validate technology from lab scale to commercial scale. Thus it would significantly reduce the technical and financial risks for new technology deployment. Cheap crude oil price in recent years is another reason, which resulted in the lack of policy irritation intention from government. As a consequence, the inconsistent developments of advanced biofuels cause its slowdown, and then form a vicious circle for limited feedstock supplements. The assessment of advanced biofuel in China was also discussed and its future development prospect was proposed. Due to the concern of food security in China, the only solution of biofuel production is using waste biomass via advanced technologies. HVO process is relatively easy and mature due to the utilization of bolt-on technologies by introduction of the advanced biofuel refineries into the existing petroleum refinery. Expanding the sources of oil feedstock by screening oil-fixing microorganisms, planting oil plant on marginal land will guarantee its long-term development in China. Cellulosic ethanol, bio-gasoline and biodiesel from lignocellulosic feedstock are essential guarantee for its perspective production. It is necessary to financially support cellulosic ethanol facilities of 100000 t/a and gasification-Fischer Tropsch facilities of 10000 t/a to demonstrate advanced biofuel production. And consistent policy measures are needed to provide investors with certainty about the future growth of advanced biofuel production in China, such as national mandatory addition of biofuel in transportation fuel, and adequate investment on demonstration project. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - A modeling process was developed to examine the economic and environmental benefits of utilizing energy crops for bioenergy products in the northeastern United States. Three energy crops (hybrid willow, switchgrass, and Miscanthus) that can potentially grow on marginal agricultural land or abandoned mine land in the region were considered in the analytical process for the production of biofuels, biopower, and pellet fuel. The supply chain components for the economic analysis and life cycle modeling processes included feedstock establishment, harvest, transportation, storage, preprocessing, conversion, distribution, and final usage of the bioenergy products. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the effects of energy crop yield, transportation distance, conversion rate, facility capacity, and internal rate of return (IRR) on the production of bioenergy products. The required selling price (RSP) ranged from $7.7/GJ to $47.9/GJ for different bioenergy products. The production of biopower had the highest RSP and pellet fuel had the lowest RSP. The results also indicated that bioenergy production using hybrid willow demonstrated lower RSP than the other two perennial grasses. Pellet production had presented the lowest greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (less than 10 kg CO2 eq per 1000 MJ) and fossil energy consumption (less than 150 MJ per 1000 MJ). The production of biofuel resulted in the highest GHG emissions. Sensitivity analysis indicated that IRR was the most sensitive factor to RSP, followed by conversion rate for biofuel and biopower production. Fuel conversion efficiency and feedstock transport distance had a significant effect on the life cycle environmental impact of the bioenergy products studied. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Fuel consumption and the emission of pollutant gases, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), derived from fuel combustion formulated from pure petrol and mixed at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25% v/v of dehydrated ethanol are evaluated. A monocylindric, four stroke, 196 cc, small non-road engine (SNRE), locked to a generator with maximum power of 2,400 W, at 0, 600, 1.200, 1.800 and 2.000 W, was employed. An automatic analyzer similar to that normally employed in the inspection of engines was used to determine gas emission. Results showed that decreases in CO, HC and NOx concentrations reached 75, 67 and 7% for the lowest charge (0 W ) and 189, 3 and 43% for the highest one (2000 W ), respectively, due to the gradual addition of ethanol to petrol. However, a mean 10% increase in fuel consumption was reported.

AB  - Microalgae are efficient source of renewable biodiesel which should be able to meet the global demand of transport fuels. The wastewater grown indigenous microalga Chlorella sp. for fuel quality parameters was evaluated. Microalgae were successfully grown in secondary treated wastewater diluted with tap water (25% dilution) in glass house. The microalga showed a dry weight of 0.849 g/L with 27.1% lipid content on dry weight basis on 21st day of incubation. After transesterification, fatty acid methyl ester yield was 80.64% with major fatty acids as palmitic, linoleic, oleic and linolenic. The physical parameters predicted from empirical equations in the biodiesel showed cetane number as 56.5, iodine value of 75.5 gI2/100 g, high heating value of 40.1 MJ/kg, 135°C flash point, 4.05 mm2/s kinematic viscosity, with density of 0.86 g/ cu cm, and cold filter plugging point as 0.7°C. FTIR, 1H, 13C NMR spectrum confirmed the chemical nature of biodiesel. The quality of biodiesel was almost as per the criterion of ASTM standards, thus, wastewater grown Chlorella sp. can be used as a promising strain for biodiesel production.

AB  - Increasing fuel prices lead to developing an alternative renewable fuel for internal combustion engines. Pine oil possesses lower viscosity, boiling point and flash point, similar to other plant based fuels like ethanol and eucalyptus oil. Pine oil has been identified to contain terpineol, a higher alcohol, along with pinene, which is an alicyclic hydrocarbon. In this research work, the various performance and emission characteristics of a single cylinder direct injection diesel engine were studied by using an alternative fuel of the biofuel mixed with pine oil and its blends. The results were compared with standard diesel fuel. From the results, it was found that there is a slight increase in brake thermal efficiency and a decrease in brake specific fuel consumption in all pine blended fuels when compared with regular diesel fuel. The use of pine oil resulted in lower emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and increased emissions of nitrogen oxides. © 2017, Rasayan Journal of Chemistry, c/o Dr. Pratima Sharma.

AB  - Intensive studies are being conducted to improve alternative energy resources due to a significant increase in the risks arising from the use of oil based energy in recent years. Biomass, ethanol and biodiesel are the most important alternative energy resources are renewable, recyclable and non-polluting. Biodiesel has caused an increase in food prices and has made it difficult to obtain food in some less developed countries, due to the allocation of agricultural land for the cultivation of oil crops rather than food production, to gain more profit. Therefore, microalgae, which can grow easily in fields not used for agriculture and for which per hectare yield is very high when compared with other biodiesel resources; appear to be a new biodiesel resource. In this study, the Chlorella protothecoides species belonging to the class Chlorophyceae were examined, suitability for biofuel production, large amount of oil, different temperature requirements. The effect of some growing parameters of this species, on different light intensity (172 lux, 186 lux and 265 lux) and different light cycles (12/12, 18/6, 6/18 and 24/0) on cell numbers, pH and conductivity values, has been investigated. According to the results of this study, it was determined that the effect of both light cycles and light intensity are important for cell numbers, pH, conductivity and salinity values. © by PSP.

AB  - Notable progress has been achieved in the past two decades regarding production of different enzymatic mixtures for hydrolysis of the lignocellulose matrix. Nevertheless, the hydrolysing mixtures remain slow and require tempering, which results in high-energy demands and bad financial results. Use of acids or alkali at a very high temperature and pressure accelerates the process more than ten times wherein the energy requirements are approximately equal. However, these elevated reaction conditions might cause the breakdown of complex lignin formula into substances that have the potential to inhibit subsequent fermentation processes. Formation of these breakdown products may be prevented by selecting the optimum process parameters, but their acquisition requires either a large number of expensive analytical techniques or equally large amounts of slow fermentation tests. An inexpensive and time saving alternative that is based on the sensitivity of chosen organisms to these inhibitors was designed and financially assessed. It was confirmed that the method is technically feasible and economically viable with significant potential to reduce the bioethanol production cost. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - The replacement of fossil hydrocarbons with the renewable biomass alternatives is an inevitable requirement in our transition toward a sustainable economy. However, traditional petrochemical technologies are not designed to operate using biomass raw materials. Thus, the development of new hydrocarbon processing methods is essential. This paper deals with the study of the hybrid plasma-catalytic reforming of liquid hydrocarbons. The system for the reforming of liquid hydrocarbons, which used low-power rotating gliding discharge as a plasma generator, was studied. Sunflower oil (C17H33COOH) and ethanol (C2H5OH) have been used as model oxygen-containing hydrocarbons and diesel fuel (C16H34) has been used as a model hydrocarbon without oxygen. Reforming products have been analyzed using mass spectrometry and gas chromatography, and the combustion of produced syngas was studied. The values of the reforming efficiency, the ratio between the chemical energy of the produced syngas and the electric energy spent on the plasma generation, and the efficiency of the produced syngas combustion in the standard water heaters were obtained. © 1973-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The depletion of fossil fuels and hike in crude oil prices were some of the main reasons to explore new alternatives from renewable source of energy. This work presents the impact of various bowl geometries on diesel engine with diesel and biodiesel samples. Three non-edible oils were selected, namely pumpkin seed oil, orange oil and neem oil. These oils were converted into respective biodiesel using transesterification process in the presence of catalyst and alcohol. After transesterification process, the oils were termed as pumpkin seed oil methyl ester (PSOME), orange oil methyl ester (OME) and neem oil methyl ester (NOME), respectively. The engine used for experimentation was a single-cylinder four-stroke water-cooled direct-injection diesel engine and loads were applied to the engine using eddy current dynamometer. Two bowl geometries were developed, namely toroidal combustion chamber (TCC) and trapezoidal combustion chamber (TRCC). Also, the engine was inbuilt with hemispherical combustion chamber (HCC). The base line readings were recorded using neat diesel fuel with HCC for various loads. Followed by 20% of biodiesel mixed with 80% neat diesel for all prepared methyl esters and termed as B1 (20% PSOME with 80% diesel), B2 (20% OME with 80% diesel) and B3 (20% NOME with 80% diesel). All fuel samples were tested in HCC, TCC and TRCC bowl geometries under standard injection timing and with compression ratio of 18. Increased brake thermal efficiency and reduced brake specific fuel consumption were observed with diesel in TCC geometry. Also, higher heat release and cylinder pressures with lower ignition delay were recorded with TCC bowl geometry. TCC bowl geometry showed lower CO, HC and smoke emissions with B2 fuel sample than diesel and other biodiesel samples. But, higher NOx emission was observed in HCC and TCC than that in TRCC bowl geometry. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In the Indian agricultural sector, millions of diesel-driven pump-sets were used for irrigation purposes. These engines produce carcinogenic diesel particulates, toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions which threaten the livelihood of large population of farmers in India. The present study investigates the use of n-propanol, a less-explored high carbon bio-alcohol that can be produced by sustainable pathways from industrial and crop wastes that has an attractive opportunity for powering stationary diesel engines meant for irrigation and rural electrification. This study evaluates the use of n-propanol addition in fossil diesel by up to 30% by vol. and concurrently reports the effects of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on emissions of an agricultural DI diesel engine. Three blends PR10, PR20, and PR30 were prepared by mixing 10, 20, and 30% by vol. of n-propanol with fossil diesel. Results when compared to baseline diesel case indicated that smoke density reduced with increasing n-propanol fraction in the blends. PR10, PR20, and PR30 reduced smoke density by 13.33, 33.33, and 60%, respectively. NOx emissions increased with increasing n-propanol fraction in the blends. Later, three EGR rates (10, 20, and 30%) were employed. At any particular EGR rate, smoke density remained lower with increasing n-propanol content in the blends under increasing EGR rates. NOx reduced gradually with EGR. At 30% EGR, the blends PR10, PR20, and PR30 reduced NOx emissions by 43.04, 37.98, and 34.86%, respectively when compared to baseline diesel. CO emissions remained low but hydrocarbon (HC) emissions were high for n-propanol/diesel blends under EGR. Study confirmed that n-propanol could be used by up to 30% by vol. with diesel and the blends delivered lower soot density, NOx, and CO emissions under EGR. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) has been considered as an effective process for converting wet algal biomass to biocrude. A major limitation of HTL however, is its inability to harvest high value-added byproducts or recover nutrients. Sequential Hydrothermal Liquefaction (SEQHTL) was recently developed to overcome this limitation to allow the simultaneous extraction of co-products and biocrude production. In this study, the performance for SEQHTL treating different algal species was assessed in terms of process versatility, biocrude production and nutrient recovery. The impact of feedstock and relevant feed stream thermophysical properties was evaluated. The biocrudes produced had moderately low oxygen content (< 14%), reduced nitrogen content (< 8%), very low sulfur (< 1.4%), and HHV ranging from 33 to 37 MJ/kg. Galdieria sulphuraria produced less crude (~ 20 wt%) as well as less char (~ 11 wt%). The Chlorella sp. had higher crude yields (~ 30 wt%) and superior nutrient recovery in aqueous effluents, ranging from 2640 to 3600 mg/L of phosphorous and from 2100 to 3700 mg/L of total nitrogen. The results also show non-Newtonian shear thinning and increasing effective viscosity at higher solid loadings. Although SEQHTL proved more suitable for algae with moderate to high lipid content, its versatility and mild reaction conditions allow for the harvesting significant quantities of water-soluble nutrients. These findings compare favorably to HTL studies and suggest that these compounds can be recovered for either recycle or producing other value-added co-products. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A theoretical comparison is made of the “well to waves” (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG) and criteria pollutant emissions from the SF-BREEZE high-speed hydrogen PEM fuel cell ferry and the VALLEJO ferry powered by traditional diesel engine technology but constrained to Tier 4 emissions standards. The emissions were calculated for a common maritime mission, the current ferry route between Vallejo CA and San Francisco CA. Calculations are made of the energy required for the SF-BREEZE and VALLEJO to perform the mission route profile. The SF-BREEZE requires 10.1% more fuel energy than the VALLEJO, primarily due to the SF-BREEZE being heavier. Estimates are made for the SF-BREEZE GHG emissions associated with five LH2 fuel production pathways including renewable and non-renewable (fossil-fuel based) methods. Estimates are also made for GHG emissions associated with fossil-diesel production and delivery as well as those for biodiesel, which can be considered a renewable “drop-in” fuel replacement for conventional diesel fuel. We find that the GHG emissions for the SF-BREEZE using non-renewable LH2 are significantly higher than for the Tier 4 diesel-fueled VALLEJO on a per passenger basis. However, using renewable LH2, the GHG emissions for the SF-BREEZE ferry are reduced 75.8% compared to the diesel-fueled VALLEJO operating at Tier 4 emissions standards. We also compare the criteria pollutant emissions (NOx, HC, PM10) for the SF-BREEZE to that of the VALLEJO held to Tier 4 emissions standards fueled by diesel fuel or biodiesel. Hydrogen PEM fuel cell technology dramatically reduces NOx and HC emissions below the most advanced Tier 4 criteria pollutant emissions requirements regardless of whether the LH2 is made by NG reforming or via water electrolysis using 70% renewable energy. Renewable LH2 made with greater than 84% renewable process energy is needed to also drop the SF-BREEZE PM10 emissions below that of Tier 4 for high-speed fuel cell ferry transportation. Overall, the results show that operating a hydrogen fuel cell ferry on nearly 100% renewable hydrogen provides the dramatic reduction in GHG and criteria pollutant emissions commensurate with the problems of global climate change and maritime air pollution worldwide. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of wastewater-grown algae for biofuel production is economical and eco-friendly. In the present study, an algal strain was isolated from the wastewater of a local dairy farm. On the basis of the morphology, ultrastructure, and 18S rRNA gene sequences, the specimen was identified to be conspecific with Choricystis minor Fott, which is a newly reported species in China. The C. minor cells accumulated predominantly neutral lipids that accounted for 60.82% of total lipids with 35.61% being triacylglycerol. Enlarged oil droplets were observed under nitrogen-depleted condition. C. minor was further cultivated outdoors on a larger scale, in which we employed both flat-plate and tubular photobioreactors (PBRs). The algae quickly adapted to the outdoor conditions and exhibited good growth performance (biomass and lipid productivities were 162.86 and 36 mg L− 1 day− 1 in flat-plate PBRs). Taken together, these results support the finding that C. minor is a promising source of low-cost, high-quality oil for biofuel production. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Photosynthesis and lipid allocation were investigated in Rubisco small subunit mutants of the microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Comparative analyses were undertaken with cells grown photoheterotrophically under sulphur-replete or sulphur-depleted conditions. The Y67A Rubisco mutant, which has previously demonstrated a pronounced reduction in Rubisco levels and higher hydrogen production rates than the wild type, also shows the following divergences in photosynthetic phenotype and lipid allocation: (i) low Fv/Fm (maximum photochemical efficiency), (ii) low effective quantum yield of photosystem II (ΦPSII), (iii) low effectiveness at protection against high light intensities, (iv) a higher level of total lipids per pigment and (v) changes in the relative proportions of different fatty acids, with a marked decrease in unsaturated fatty acids (FAs). The most abundant thylakoid membrane lipid, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, decreased in amount, while the neutral lipid/polar lipid ratio increased in the mutant. The low amount and activity of the mutated Rubisco Y67A enzyme seems to have an adverse effect on photosynthesis and causes changes in carbon allocation in terms of membrane fatty acid composition and storage lipid accumulation. Our results suggest that Rubisco mutants of Chlamydomonas might be useful in biodiesel production. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Microbially derived lipids have recently attracted renewed interests due to their broad applications in production of green diesels, cosmetic additives, and oleochemicals. Metabolic engineering efforts have targeted a large portfolio of biosynthetic pathways to efficiently convert sugar to lipids in oleaginous yeast. In the engineered overproducing strains, endogenous cell metabolism typically generates harmful electrophilic molecules that compromise cell fitness and productivity. Lipids, particularly unsaturated fatty acids, are highly susceptible to oxygen radical attack and the resulting oxidative species are detrimental to cell metabolism and limit lipid productivity. In this study, we investigated cellular oxidative stress defense pathways in Yarrowia lipolytica to further improve the lipid titer, yield, and productivity. Specifically, we determined that coupling glutathione disulfide reductase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase along with aldehyde dehydrogenase are efficient solutions to combat reactive oxygen and aldehyde stress in Y. lipolytica. With the reported engineering strategies, we were able to synchronize cell growth and lipid production, improve cell fitness and morphology, and achieved industrially-relevant level of lipid titer (72.7 g/L), oil content (81.4%) and productivity (0.97 g/L/h) in controlled bench-top bioreactors. The strategies reported here represent viable steps in the development of sustainable biorefinery platforms that potentially upgrade low value carbons to high value oleochemicals and biofuels.

AB  - Two ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) possessing three-dimensionally (3-D) well-ordered mesoporosity with different framework configurations were prepared via a hard template route. The OMCs were treated with different surface-oxidation methods for the preparation of OMC supported highly dispersed Pd catalysts (Pd/OMC). Among the different surface oxidation conditions, the 3-D ordered mesoporous structure of CMK-9 is preserved under a mild surface-oxidation condition by an ammonium persulfate solution at 30 °C for 2 h. The Pd/OMCs were introduced as catalysts for the catalytic deoxygenation of a fatty acid without hydrogen or different amounts of hydrogen. The catalytic performance of the deoxygenation of a fatty acid (stearic acid) was investigated in a batch reactor without hydrogen and a continuous fixed-bed reactor with different amounts of hydrogen (H2/stearic acid = 0–3 molar ratios). The Pd/OMC catalysts were found to be less prone to deactivation than a commercially available activated carbon supported Pd catalyst (Pd/AC). This was attributed to the well-ordered 3-D mesoporosity in the OMC supports, which facilitated the facile diffusion of the liquid reactant and product with a long carbon chain length in the catalyst during the deoxygenation reaction, leading to less Pd metal sintering during the deoxygenation reaction as compared to that with Pd/AC catalyst. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Pt/γ-Al2O3 materials with different metal loading were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method and tested as catalysts for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) at 320 and 340°C with 4 and 5 h of reaction time. Oleic acid was used as model molecule in HDO process for biodiesel production, since this acid is in high proportion in waste vegetable oils used in food and agro-industrial processes. Increasing the Pt-nanoparticles (Pt-NPs) content influences on obtaining higher yields of n-C17 at optimal conditions of 335°C for 4.86 h of reaction and 4 nm of nanoparticle size, statistically determined. Yields of alkanes were theoretically optimized and using regression models for obtaining response surfaces with size (S) and distribution (V) of Pt-NPs as additional factors to temperature and reaction time.

AB  - Biodiesel production from soybean oil deodorizer distillate intensified by dual-frequency counter-current pulsed ultrasound and the kinetics were studied. Results indicated that the biodiesel conversions enhanced by single-frequency were lower than those enhanced by dual-frequency. For dual-frequency, the biodiesel conversion of SMM was higher than those of SQM. The biodiesel conversion of the combination of 20/28 kHz is the highest. The effects of 20/28 kHz SMM on biodiesel production were studied and optimal conditions were: methanol to triglyceride molar ratio 8:1, catalyst content 1.8%, the water content in feedstock should be less than 0.4%, the acid value of feedstock should be less than 2 mgKOH·g−1, the biodiesel conversion could reach 96.3%. The kinetics of SMM and SSPU were studied and results showed that the transesterification reaction was pseudo-second order and the energy activation obtained by SMM and SSPU were 18.122 kJ·mol−1 and 26.034 kJ·mol−1, respectively. These results showed that transesterification reaction intensified by SMM is easier to take place than SSPU. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present work focuses on the simultaneous reduction of NO–smoke–CO2 emission in a Karanja oil methyl ester (KOME)-fueled single-cylinder compression ignition engine by using low-carbon biofuel with exhaust after-treatment system. Replacement of KOME for diesel reduced smoke emission by 3% but resulted in increase of NO emission and CO2 emission by 13 and 35% at 100% load condition. In order to reduce CO2 emission, tests were conducted with a blend of KOME and orange seed oil (OSO), a low-carbon fuel on equal volume basis (50–50). At the same operating conditions, compared to KOME, 27% reduction in CO2 emission and 5% reduction in smoke emission were observed. However, a slight increase in NO emission was observed. To achieve simultaneous reduction of NO–smoke–CO2 emissions, three catalysts, namely monoethanolamine, zeolite and activated carbon, were selected for exhaust after-treatment system and tested with optimum KOME–OSO blend. KOME–OSO + zeolite showed a great potential in simultaneous reduction of NO–smoke–CO2 emissions. NO, smoke and CO2 emissions were simultaneously reduced by about 15% for each emission compared to diesel at 100% load condition. The effect of exhaust after-treatment system with KOME–OSO blend on combustion, performance and other emission parameters is discussed in detail in this study. Fourier transform infrared spectrometry analysis and testing were done to identify the absorbance characteristics of zeolite material. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Purpose: Prospective evaluation of the lifecycle impacts of aviation biofuel production in Abu Dhabi, UAE based on a production system that integrates aquaculture, saltwater agriculture, and mangrove silviculture, termed an Integrated Seawater Energy Agriculture System (ISEAS) in order to investigate its energetic and environmental potential compared to conventional fuels. Methods: We compare the hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel (HRJ) produced from ISEAS against fossil jet fuel using a life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Based on a detailed description of the production process, we use data from a wide-ranging literature review and experimental results from the specific location to make informed assumptions for the range of the process inputs and yields. We then analyze several process configuration scenarios with different ranges. Results and discussion: ISEAS can produce aviation biofuels, electricity, and food while afforesting coastal desert land, acting as a long-term sink for carbon, minimizing freshwater consumption, and having beneficial land use impacts when compared to fossil jet fuel production. Based on a sensitivity analysis, we show that ISEAS HRJ emits 38 to 68% less greenhouse gases than fossil jet fuel and yields an overall positive net energy balance under all scenarios except one with an extensive use of desalinated water. Conclusions: ISEAS offers a promising pathway for integrating aquaculture and seawater agriculture in arid regions. It is essentially a process to sustainably augment aquaculture-based products by using its waste as a biofuel resource. Achieving positive emissions results depend critically on minimizing freshwater use, maximizing biomass yield and to a lesser extent the performance of biomass gasification. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Butanol is a promising alternative to ethanol and is desirable for use in transportation fuels and additives to gasoline and diesel fuels. Microbial production of butanol is challenging primarily because of its toxicity and low titer of production. Herein, we compared the transcriptome and phenome of wild-type Escherichia coli and its butanol-tolerant evolved strain to understand the global cellular physiology and metabolism responsible for butanol tolerance. When the ancestral butanol-sensitive E. coli was exposed to butanol, gene activities involved in respiratory mechanisms and oxidative stress were highly perturbed. Intriguingly, the evolved butanol-tolerant strain behaved similarly in both the absence and presence of butanol. Among the mutations occurring in the evolved strain, cis-regulatory mutations may be the cause of butanol tolerance. This study provides a foundation for the rational design of the metabolic and regulatory pathways for enhanced biofuel production. © 2017 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - Based on heavy chassis dynamometer, an experimental study was conducted in diesel buses compliant with China III, IV, V emissions standards respectively, fueled with three different blends of petroleum diesel/biodiesel (0%, 5%and 10%, V/V biodiesel blends), which investigated the characteristics of particulate matter (PM) emission under CCBC driving cycle. Results of study showed that the total PM number and mass emission from China V bus respectively decreased by 68.1%, 56.2%, 57.5% and 52.7%, 64.8%, 88.5% compared to China III bus. When compared to China IV bus, the PM mass emission decreased by 43.0%, 47.3% and 42.1%, while the number increased by 4.0%, 7.6% and 14.7%. The nucleation mode PM emission of China III bus was mainly from high-speed driving condition, while China IV and V buses were from middle-low speed. The accumulation mode PM emissions of China III, IV and V buses were all mainly from middle-low speed driving conditions. In relatively lower speed conditions, compared to China III bus, the nucleation mode PM emissions of China IV and V buses obviously decreased, so was accumulation mode PM. Compared to China IV bus, emission of China V bus did not improve obviously and the nucleation mode PM emission even increased. In high-speed driving condition, the nucleation mode PM emission from China III bus increased dramatically, while those from China V and IV buses slightly increased. Meanwhile, the accumulation PM number and mass emission of China IV bus was obviously higher than those of China V and III buses. When fueled with B10, the relatively bigger sizes PM emission of China III bus deteriorated rapidly, indicating that China III bus was not suitable for fuel with high blending ratio of biodiesel. © 2017, Science Press.

AB  - Bio-oil, also called pyrolysis liquid biofuel, is made from the pyrolysis of waste biomass and provides a carbon-neutral alternative fuel. This study focuses on optimizing swirl burners for use with bio-oil. Spray combustion of bio-oil/ethanol blends was previously studied using a 10 kW swirl burner. The previous burner had a small combustion chamber with no refractory lining. It was not feasible to stabilize flames of bio-oil without blending with ethanol, and the pollutant emissions were relatively high. In this study, the burner is upgraded by implementing a refractory-lined combustion chamber and increasing the size of the chamber to investigate the relationship between the burner design and combustion performance of bio-oil. The main reasons for upgrading the burner are to eliminate ethanol addition to bio-oil, stabilize the pure bio-oil flame, achieve lower pollutant emissions, and make the burner more comparable to industrial bio-oil burners. In addition to flame stability, fuel boiling inside the nozzle and nozzle coking are two other challenges that require some optimization and adjustments in the setup. After modification of the new burner configuration and adjustment of the operating parameters, the pure bio-oil flame is stabilized with minimal nozzle coking and gaseous exhaust emissions. The new burner has a significantly lower amount of heat loss and, hence, a higher gas temperature within the combustion chamber compared to the previous burner. The effects of operating conditions on the gaseous pollutants are also investigated. CO and unburned hydrocarbon emissions are extremely sensitive to the operating parameters, such as the equivalence ratio, swirl number, and atomizing air flow rate. Moreover, the pilot flame energy and primary air preheat temperature play important roles in ignition quality of bio-oil, flame stability, and nozzle coking. The dominant mechanism for NOx emissions is the conversion of fuel-bound nitrogen. The new burner also has decreased particulate matter emissions compared to the previous burner by achieving higher temperatures, which favors burnout of char particles within the flame. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The role of solvents in the conversion of oleic acid over Pt/C was studied. Three solvent systems (solvent-free, water, and dodecane systems) were employed for the conversion of oleic acid over Pt/C at 350°C. Decarboxylation, hydrogen transfer, and aromatization were observed in these three reaction systems. In comparison to the non-solvent reaction system, much slower decarboxylation and aromatization rates and fewer heptadecane and aromatic products were observed in the hydrothermal and dodecane reaction systems. The decarboxylation and aromatization rates and yields of heptadecane and aromatics decreased with increased dodecane loading in the dodecane reaction system, and the decarboxylation and aromatization rates and yields of heptadecane and aromatics significantly decreased with the increase of water in the hydrothermal reaction system. The effects of solvent loading, catalyst loading, and reaction time on the reactions (decarboxylation, hydrogen transfer, and aromatization) were investigated. The reaction behaviors of 1-heptadecene with different solvents were studied, and N2 adsorption-desorption and thermogravimetric analysis of fresh and spent Pt/C in the three reaction systems were also performed. The results indicate that the competition of dodecane for the Pt/C active sites is mainly responsible for the slow decarboxylation and aromatization rates. In addition to the similar influencing factor to that in the dodecane system, H+ released from water and hydrogen bonding, which inhibited the ionization of carboxyl groups, was the key influencing factor for the slower decarboxylation and aromatization rates obtained under hydrothermal conditions. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biofuels are expected to play a significant role in the quest for greener energy generation. In this perspective, esters produced from biomass are promising candidates. This work presents the first computational kinetic study on n-butyl formate (BF) oxidation under combustion conditions coupled to an experimental study in a jet-stirred reactor. Absolute rate constants for hydrogen abstraction reactions by the OH radical were calculated using the G3//MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ model chemistry, in conjunction with statistical rate theory (TST). Subsequently, the fate of the butyl formate radicals was also investigated by calculating absolute rate constants for combustion relevant decomposition channels such as β-scission and hydrogen transfer reactions. The derived rate expressions were used in the presently developed detailed kinetic mechanism, which was validated over experimental data obtained in a jet-stirred reactor at 10 atm and for three different mixtures (φ = 0.45, 0.9, and 1.8). Rate of production analyses were finally used to understand the oxidation kinetics of butyl formate over the temperature range of 500-1300 K and highlighted the importance of the unimolecular decomposition reactions of the fuel, producing formic acid and 1-butene. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Although biodiesel oil extracted from microalgae attracts much attention as one of the most promising green energies, its high production cost is a big problem, impeding its extensive use. In order to lower the production cost, the effective use of microalgal residue after extracting biofuel was investigated as a feed material of functional materials. In the present work, a new adsorbent for silver(I) was prepared by immobilizing functional groups of polyethylene-polyamine or dithiooxamide, which exhibita high affinity for soft Lewis acids such as silver(I) ions. Their adsorption behaviors for silver(I) were investigated from aqueous nitrate and acidothiourea media. The effects of the concentrations of nitrate and thiourea, as well as of sulfuric acid, were qualitatively interpreted. From the study of adsorption isotherms on these gels, they were found to exhibita higher adsorption capacity than the majority of those reported to date. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - The upgrading of algae biocrude (obtained by hydrothermal liquefaction) was studied under mild conditions. Here we adopted a guard catalyst to protect the core catalyst and obtained algae biofuel with low heteroatom content at 350°C. The nitrogen content of biofuel is 0.016 wt %, and the calculated oxygen content is less than 0.51 wt %. Furthermore, the effective yield from biocrude to a low-heteroatom-containing biofuel was close to the theoretical yield. Through a detailed study of the upgrading process, the content variation trend of biocrude and biofuel compositions and their potential reaction pathways were revealed. The results indicated that hydrogenation reactions almost finished after upgrading at 350°C for 15-30 min. (Figure Presented). © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Ultrafine particle (UFP) emissions and particle number size distributions (PNSD) are critical in the evaluation of air pollution impacts; however, data on UFP number emissions from cookstoves, which are a major source of many pollutants, are limited. In this study, 11 fuel-stove combinations covering a variety of fuels and different stoves are investigated for UFP emissions and PNSD. The combustion of LPG and alcohol (∼1011 particles per useful energy delivered, particles/MJd), and kerosene (∼1013 particles/MJd), produced emissions that were lower by 2-3 orders of magnitude than solid fuels (1014-1015 particles/MJd). Three different PNSD types - unimodal distributions with peaks ∼30-40 nm, unimodal distributions with peaks &lt;30 nm, and bimodal distributions - were observed as the result of both fuel and stove effects. The fractions of particles smaller than 30 nm (F30) varied among the tested systems, ranging from 13% to 88%. The burning of LPG and alcohol had the lowest PM2.5 mass emissions, UFP number emissions, and F30 (13-21% for LPG and 35-41% for alcohol). Emissions of PM2.5 and UFP from kerosene were also low compared with solid fuel burning but had a relatively high F30 value of approximately 73-80%. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - As part I of two companion papers, the present paper evaluates the economic feasibility of hydrocarbon biofuel production via two pathways: a one-step production pathway through fast pyrolysis of biomass followed by the catalytic upgrade of bio-oil to a liquid hydrocarbon biofuel and a novel two-step pathway that includes a torrefaction pretreatment step prior to fast pyrolysis and then the catalytic upgrade. These two pathways were modeled using Aspen Plus to process 1000 dry metric tons/day of feed through the fast pyrolysis unit operating at 530 °C whereas torrefaction for the two-step pathway was investigated at three different torrefaction temperatures of 290, 310, and 330 °C. Three scenarios of producing process heat from natural gas, internal byproducts biochar supplemented with natural gas, and torrefaction condensate were investigated, with additional heat integration considered. Minimum selling price ranged from $4.01/gal to $4.78/gal for the heat-integrated processes whereas the price ranged from $4.70/gal to $6.84/gal without heat integration. Analysis indicated that a one-step pathway and a two-step pathway with torrefaction taking place at 290 °C yielded comparable least minimum selling price and it increased with increasing torrefaction temperature. Sensitivity analysis showed that the yield of hydrocarbon biofuel, total project investment, and internal rate of return have the greatest impact. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study, as part II of two companion papers, investigated the environmental performance of liquid hydrocarbon biofuel production via fast pyrolysis of pine through two pathways: a one-step pathway via fast pyrolysis only, and a two-step pathway that includes a torrefaction step prior to fast pyrolysis. Fast pyrolysis in all cases took place at a temperature of 530 °C whereas for the two-step pathways, torrefaction was investigated at temperatures of 290, 310, and 330 °C. Bio-oil produced was then catalytically upgraded to hydrocarbon biofuel. Different scenarios for providing the required process heat either by using fossil energy or renewable energy, as well as the effect of heat integration, were also investigated. Our life cycle analysis indicated that using the energy allocation approach, a two-step heat integrated pathway with torrefaction taking place at 330 °C had the lowest global warming potential among all scenarios of about 29.0 g CO2 equiv/MJ biofuel. Using the system expansion approach, significantly higher reductions in GHG emissions of about 56 to 265% relative to conventional gasoline were observed for the heat integrated processes. More modest percentage reduction in emissions of about 34 to 67% was observed across all scenarios using the energy allocation approach. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Even when the feasibility of using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with partial least squares (PLS) regression for prediction of physico-chemical properties of biodiesel/diesel blends has been widely demonstrated, inclusion in the calibration sets of the whole variability of diesel samples from diverse production origins still remains as an important challenge when constructing the models. This work presents a useful strategy for the systematic selection of calibration sets of samples of biodiesel/diesel blends from diverse origins, based on a binary code, principal components analysis (PCA) and the Kennard-Stones algorithm. Results show that using this methodology the models can keep their robustness over time. PLS calculations have been done using a specialized chemometric software as well as the software of the NIR instrument installed in plant, and both produced RMSEP under reproducibility values of the reference methods. The models have been proved for on-line simultaneous determination of seven properties: density, cetane index, fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) content, cloud point, boiling point at 95% of recovery, flash point and sulphur. © 2017

AB  - Bio-oil is a potential product from the fast pyrolysis of biomass. However, it should be upgraded before being used in subsequent applications and corrosion prevention. In this work, crude bio-oil from fast pyrolysis of Jatropha curcas residues, which has many long-chain compounds, and a high content of carboxylic acid, was catalytically upgraded over mechanically mixed catalysts (normal ZSM-5 and Y-Re-16) in a fixed-bed reactor. The effects of the key parameters on the yields of light oil products were analyzed, including cracking temperature (350–500°C), reaction time (15–60 min), catalyst loading (10–25%), and mixture ratio between Y-Re-16 and ZSM-5 (10–70%). Experimental test cases were based on a simplex lattice design. The gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) analysis showed that the catalytic cracking of crude bio-oil using mixed catalysts resulted in the successful formation of short-chain acid methyls. The employed analytical fit of the experimental data gave R2 and the adjusted R2 of 0.902 and 0.843, respectively. The optimized operation conditions to produce aliphatic hydrocarbons from mechanically mixed catalysts were found to be at 400°C, 15 min of reaction time, 15% of catalyst loading, and a mixture ratio of about 1:5. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Alumina nanoparticles were synthesized by sol-gel method and submitted to thermal treatment at 750°C and 1000 °C. X-ray diffraction was used to determine crystal formation with sizes up to 280 nm. To achieve stable suspensions, a nano-additive was mixed with the diesel/biodiesel blends along with oleic acid surfactant to obtain concentrations of nano-additives at 10 and 20 ppm. Colloidal stability was evaluated according to Deryaguin-Landau-Verwey-Oberbeek theory by analyzing the total interaction energy of the system. Effects on the kinematic viscosity and flash point of the B10 blend were determined according to ASTM D-445 and ASTM D-93 regulations. The application of nano-additives in biodiesel blends showed an increase of the kinematic viscosity from 2.75 cSt to 3.33 cSt at 40°C with 20 ppm of nanoparticles in the B10 blend, while flash point increased from 65 °C to 66 °C.

AB  - The performance of bleaching earths as removal agents of Total Contamination from samples of Colombian biodiesel obtained from palm oil as studied. The effect of temperature and the dose of three commercial adsorbents were studied on quality parameters, Total Contamination and moisture of biodiesel. Results showed a complex behavior of the study variables on Total Contamination and final moisture; but either almost or no effects on other quality parameters such as free glycerin, total glycerin and pour point. Response surfaces showed that the values of the manipulated variables that improved the removal of Total Contamination in biodiesel also increased final moisture in the samples. Therefore, it was necessary to compute optimum values using desirability functions, which gave values for Total Contamination and final moisture, of 5.5 mg/kg and 562 mg/kg, respectively, using 0.48% of Bleaching Earth BE1 at 30°C.

AB  - The vaporization characteristics of Palm and Castor oil biodiesel droplets were evaluated. An experimental set-up for measuring the evaporation rate of fuel droplets at atmospheric pressure and variable temperatures was developed. Biodiesel physical properties were estimated using group contribution methods and empirical mixing rules. Numerical results accurately predict the evaporation rate of biodiesel when compared to experimental results, with maximum deviations of the evaporation of 15.2%. Results show that Castor oil biodiesel evaporation rate is 48% lower than that for Palm oil biodiesel at the studied temperatures. This is explained by its higher density and vaporization enthalpy, which can be traced back to the structure of the fuel components.

AB  - Rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) and (bio)ethylene are converted into biofuel with an evenly rising boiling point curve, which fulfills the strict boiling specifications prescribed by the fuel standard EN 590 for modern (petro)diesel engines. Catalyzed by a Pd/Ru system, RME undergoes isomerizing metathesis in a stream of ethylene gas, leading to a defined olefin, monoester, and diester blend. This innovative refining concept requires negligible energy input (60°C) and no solvents and does not produce waste. It demonstrates that the pressing challenge of increasing the fraction of renewables in engine fuel may be addressed purely chemically rather than by motor engineering.

AB  - The present study aims to improve the oxidation stability of wild apricot kernel oil biodiesel (WAKOB) by using natural antioxidants of Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum (L.) Gaertn). Biodiesel was synthesized at different catalyst (NaOH) concentrations, reaction temperatures, reaction time intervals and methanol-to-oil molar ratios. Thermal oxidative stability measurements were carried out according to EN14112 using a Rancimet instrument. Our results showed a high yield of biodiesel (97±1.092) at 65oC in the presence of 1% NaOH (%w/w oil) and methanol/oil molar ratio of 9:1 and for the time duration of 60 min. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) confirmed the conversion percentage of kernel oil into biodiesel, which was further evidenced by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and refractometer analyses. Methanolic fraction of Tartary buckwheat leaves (MTBWLF) was standardized to contain the highest amount of phenolics (209 mg gallic acid/100 g). In this study, the mixture of synthetic antioxidant butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT) (0.25%) and methanolic extract of Tartary buckwheat leaves (0.5%) ensured high oxidation stability of biodiesel samples, leading to stabilizing factor of 4.86.

AB  - A sensitive voltammetric method for the determination of pyrogallol (PY) was developed employing a boron-doped diamond electrode (BDDE). The composition of the supporting electrolyte was investigated during the development of the methodology. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) under the optimized experimental conditions was applied for PY determination with a limit of detection and limit of quantification of 0.85 and 2.82 μmol L-1, respectively. These values are satisfactory for application to real samples. The usability of this method for the quantification of pyrogallol was in range from 2.82 to 296.00 μmol L-1. Finally, the developed method was successfully used for the analysis of real samples of biodiesel produced from rapeseed oil and its blend with diesel fuel. Samples of biodiesel and biodiesel blends were analyzed directly in an electrochemical cell, while samples with very low concentrations of PY in biodiesel were extracted with water using the proposed simple and fast process. © 2016 Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Objective: Endophytic fungus Ascocoryne sarcoides NRRL 50072 was firstly found to be able to produce volatile compounds similar to those in fossil fuels. This could be a new avenue to biofuel development. The purpose of this study is to clarify whether the other strains from the same species or related species in Ascocoryne have similar metabolisms to produce biofuel compounds. Method: Different strains from Ascocoryne were isolated with tissue-surface sterilization. The evolutionary relationship between the strains in the genus was determined through constituting a ML phylogenetic tree. The compounds in volatile gas from the strains were analyzed and identified in NIST database with HSSPEM-GC-MS. Result: All the strains studied were able to produce volatile metabolites containing hydrocarbons, alcohols, esters, aldehydes, acids, etc. However, the volatile compounds among the strains were highly diverse, even among closely related strains with significantly different compositions in their volatile compounds. Conclusion: Most fungi from Ascocoryne could have the capability to produce volatile hydrocarbons. The compounds of hydrocarbons may be strain-specific. Therefore, it is fundamental for discovering or genetic engineering new strains to study and develop myco-diesel from Ascocoryne fungi. © 2017, Chinese Academy of Forestry. All right reserved.

AB  - The depletion of fossil fuel for energy production is one of the major problems being faced worldwide. As an alternative to fossil fuels, first and second generation biofuel was developed from corn, grains and lignocellulosic agricultural residues. These generations are inefficient in achieving the desired rate of biofuel production, climate change mitigation and economic growth. Therefore, third generation biofuel specifically derived from microalgae have proved to be a promising unconventional energy source. Microalgae are microscopic organisms that grow in salt or fresh water and have been used for producing metabolites, cosmetics and for energy production. The conventional approaches used for biofuel production include pyrolysis, gasification, direct combustion and thermomechanical liquefaction. The search for biological and eco-friendly approaches led to the emergence of Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC), which provide a new solution to energy crisis. Integration of photosynthetic organisms such as microalgae into MFC resulted in a new approach i.e. Microbial Solar Cell, which can convert solar energy into electrical energy via photosynthesis. Microbial solar cells have broad range application in wastewater treatment, biodiesel processing and intermediate metabolite production.

AB  - Aviation industries are vulnerable to the energy crisis and simultaneously posed environmental concerns. Proposed engine technology advancements could reduce the environmental impact and energy consumption. Substituting the source of jet fuel from fossil-based fuel to biomass-based fuel will help reduce emissions and minimize the energy crisis. The present paper addresses the analysis of aircraft engine performance in terms of thrust, fuel flow and specific fuel consumption at different mixing ratio percentages (20%, 40%, 50%, 60% and 80%) of alternative biofuel blends already used in flight test (Algae biofuel, Camelina biofuel and Jatropha biofuel) at different flight conditions. In-house computer software codes, PYTHIA and TURBOMATCH, were used for the analysis and modeling of a three-shaft high-bypass-ratio engine which is similar to RB211-524. The engine model was verified and validated with open literature found in the test program of bio-synthetic paraffinic kerosene in commercial aircraft. The results indicated that lower heating value had a significant influence on thrust, fuel flow and specific fuel consumption at every flight condition and at all mixing ratio percentages. Wide lower heating value differences between two fuels give a large variation on the engine performances. Blended Kerosene-Jatropha biofuel and Kerosene-Camelina biofuel showed an improvement on gross thrust, net thrust, reduction of fuel flow and specific fuel consumption at every mixing ratio percentage and at different flight conditions. Moreover, the pure alternative of Jatropha biofuel and Camelina biofuel gave much better engine performances. This was not the case for the Kerosene-Algae blended biofuel. This study is a crucial step in understanding the influence of different blended alternative biofuels on the performance of aircraft engines. © 2016 Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - Depletion of conventional fuels, concerns about environmental pollution and the tightening of exhaust emission legislations are the main reasons for increasing research on alternative fuels produced from agricultural feedstock. In this study, biodiesel fuels produced from cotton and corn vegetable oils are investigated as renewable fuels for a gas turbine engine for aviation. The biodiesel fuels are defined as cotton methyl ester (CTME) and corn methyl ester. The performance characteristics and exhaust emissions of the gas turbine engine are investigated when the engine fueled with three blends of 10%(B10), 20%(B20) and 50%(B50) of biodiesel/JetA-1 by volume. The biodiesel fuels were produced using transesterification process and characterized according to ASTM biodiesel specifications. Chemical and physical properties show a real potential of using biodiesel blends as an alternative for JetA-1. The measured engine performance parameters and exhaust emissions are compared with that of pure JetA-1 over a range of throttle setting. The gas turbine engine used in this study is equipped with pressure, flow, temperature, thrust and speed sensors that connected to data acquisition system and control unit in addition to exhaust gas analyzer. The experimental results show that biodiesel fuels can be used up to blend of 50% with JetA-1 in gas turbine engines with slight enhancement in engine performance and significant improvements in exhaust emissions. The engine static thrust is increased with 2% for B50 at lower and medium engine speeds and decreased with 11% at high engine speed compared to conventional JetA-1 fuel. The thrust-specific fuel consumption for biodiesel blends is lower than that for regular JetA-1 fuel. The gas turbine engine efficiency is increased for biodiesel blends by 14% compared to JetA-1, and this is reported for CTME B50. For oxygen concentration in exhaust gases emissions, the higher the biodiesel blend, the higher the O2 concentration in the exhaust compared with JetA-1 fuel. The O2 level increased by 6% for biodiesel blend of B50 compared to JetA-1 fuel. The emissions of CO and HC emissions decreased by 5 and 37%, respectively, compared with conventional JetA-1. Additionally, the biodiesel blends achieve a higher CO2 and NOx emissions with 11 and 27%, respectively, compared to JetA-1. The sulfur dioxide SO2 decreased by 75% compared to the regular JetA-1 fuel. © 2016, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - A study was conducted to investigate the response of Jatropha curcas L., an important bio-diesel plant species, to arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) inoculations. AM species, isolated from its rhizosphere could colonize its roots/rhizospheres, indicating that J. curcas does not retard the activities of AM fungi. However, the seedlings did not respond positively to the inoculations and mycorrhizal dependency (MD) for some inoculants was in the negative range. This could be due to the large amount of nutrients stored in cotyledons of big sized J. curcas seeds. Further results showed that the removal of cotyledons (metabolic reserves) immediately after seed germination did not increase MD of J. curcas. Workers from different countries have reported variable results on this aspect and it is generally admitted that different populations, varieties, cultivars or strains of any specific cultivated crop may react differently to different situations such as inoculation with AM fungi. Therefore, it will be worthwhile to test the different populations of J. curcas from various locations under a given set of conditions. © 2015, The National Academy of Sciences, India.

AB  - In this paper we seek to understand the impact of expanded use of soybean oil biodiesel to address biofuel mandates on global vegetable oil markets, and in particular on the demand for palm oil. An open-economy equilibrium model is derived to investigate the market effects of biodiesel expansion on related energy and vegetable oil markets. The model is calibrated to represent the recent benchmark data in calendar year 2014. The simulation estimates suggest that the expanded use of soy oil for biodiesel in the US will have considerable impacts on world vegetable oil markets. The majority of the vegetable oil replacement is likely to occur through substitution of palm oil under a wide range of plausible elasticity values on the demand for vegetable oil and the demand substitution between soy oils and palm oils. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The European Union plays a globally influential role in environmental legislation, with policies and regulation rooted in particular norms. Through a narrative on regulatory capitalism, ecological modernization, and diffusion, we trace how the promotion of renewable energy in transport through subsidies, mandatory targets, and prescriptive criteria for liquid biofuels mobilize social forces for its market development. The study identifies prevailing norms, mechanisms of decision making, and the network of actors involved in this regulatory regime and also identifies where and through whom its expansion influenced decisions in Tanzania. The findings show how this regime emphasizes systematic eco-innovation of energy technologies, has a substitutable approach to natural capital, and subordinates social concerns to economic efficiency. The analysis shows how this regime mobilized a broader network of actors with similar interests, who mediated the political space of liquid biofuels in Tanzania in ways which conflicted with a domestic critique concerning land use. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - The purpose of this research was evaluation of the effect of soil contamination with waste coming from biomass gasification on chosen indicators of its biological activity, growth and development of spring barley, and change of physiological parameters of the plant. Chromatographic content and basic rheological parameters of the substances under research were also analyzed. Liquid wastes, tar, and mixture of tar and engine oil were introduced to the soil in the amount of 100 mg kg−1 DM soil. Based on the conducted research, it was ascertained that the changes in the number and activity of soil microorganisms were determined by the type of waste and its dose. Individual groups of microorganisms showed different sensitivity to the presence of pollution; however, the impact of tar and engine oil mixture was generally more disadvantageous. Presence of contaminants in the soil limited the growth of roots and aboveground parts of spring barley, especially when the dose was 10,000 mg kg−1 DM soil. The unfavorable impact of waste on photosynthesis efficiency on assimilation pigment synthesis and water content in the plant was recorded. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - The aim of the present work was to study the anaerobic biodegradation of benzene in the presence of ethylic and methylic biodiesel. Biodiesel was produced by methanolysis and ethanolysis of virgin sunflower oil and ethanolysis of waste frying oil, and further characterized according to the European Biodiesel Standard EN 14214 for water content, fatty acid esters content, acid value, kinematic viscosity at 40°C, and oxidation stability at 110°C. Microcosms were set up in order to assess the biodegradation of the different biodiesel types and their impacts on benzene biodegradation. Methane production and benzene biodegradation were monitored for 85 days. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to assess impacts on archaeal and bacterial community fingerprints. The results showed that the three types of biodiesel were readily biodegraded, even in the presence of benzene. In microcosms with only biodiesel, the highest biodegradation rate and extent was observed for sunflower methylic biodiesel followed by sunflower ethylic biodiesel and waste frying oil ethylic biodiesel. Similar results were observed in the presence of benzene. The presence of any biodiesel type negatively impacted benzene biodegradation with soybean ethylic biodiesel impacting rates the least. Microbial community fingerprint analyses showed that biodiesel composition selected distinct communities according to the alcohol employed in the transesterification reaction. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Two micro algal species namely Chlorella vulgaris (C1) and Chlorella sp. (C2) were selected for the viability of bio-oil production by transesterification in the presence of Ni/H2 catalyst supported with Ni(II)-Schiff base chelate promotor. By this method about 92% of low viscous bio-oil is obtained. Systematic characterizations of the extracted lipids with proximate, elemental and spectral techniques (FT-IR, UV-vis, GC-Mass, 1H NMR and 13C NMR) have been carried out to measure their composition profile. Thermogravimetry (TG/DTA) of the wet micro algal biomass, micro algal feed stock and bio-oil has also been performed to analyze their thermal behavior. In addition, scanning electron microscopic pictographs (SEM) were taken for analyzing the micro algal structure before and after the lipid extraction. The fuel properties of the extracted bio-oil were assessed using standard methods and compared to the standards. The bio-oil samples were tested for their remarkable in vitro biological and nuclease activities. In addition, the engine performance (brake specific fuel consumption and brake thermal efficiency) using five types of fuels namely diesel (B100), C1 micro algal bio-oil 20% blend (C1 B20), C2 micro algal bio-oil 20% blend (C2 B20), C1 micro algal bio-oil 50% blend (C1 B50) and C2 micro algal bio-oil 50% blend (C2 B50) and emission characteristics (CO2, NOx, exhaust and smoke) were studied for the bio-oil–diesel blends. © 2016 Energy Institute

AB  - Heating deteriorates the physicochemical properties of a vegetable oil for both edible and biofuel uses. The parameters for edible olive oil are established by European Union regulations and by the International Olive Council. The properties of a vegetable oil to be used as a source for biodiesel production are indicated by the German DIN 51605 for rapeseed oil. Biofuel properties are described by the European EN 14214 and the North American ASTM 6751 standards for biodiesel. It is useful to know how temperature and heating duration influence the physicochemical properties of olive oil. Free acidity, refractive index and myristic acid were not significantly influenced by temperature and heating duration. K232, K266, K270, K274, p-anisidine value, totox index, kinematic viscosity (at 30, 40, 50 °C), estimated higher heating value, relative density, and cetane number increased during olive oil heating. The biological properties: iodine value, oxidative stability index, antiradical (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical, DPPH∙) activity, and phenol content, decreased when time and temperature increased. Fatty acid methyl esters were highly influenced by the applied variables. Almost all the fatty acid methyl esters, except myristic, stearic, and arachidic acid esters, were influenced by the combined effect of temperature and time in a very highly significant level. These results show how temperature and duration of heating influence extra virgin olive oil degradation for both edible use and biodiesel production. © 2017, AOCS.

AB  - Algae is considered a promising future feedstock for biofuels. Although several studies have been conducted to assess the environmental impact of algae-based fuels, land use change is one area that is commonly overlooked in previous life cycle assessment studies. However, land use change can impact the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of algal biofuels when large tracts of land are converted to algal raceway cultivation systems. This study assesses the impacts of land use change through a variety of means. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1 methodology was utilized to assess potential emissions resulting from the conversion of potential algae facility sites in the U.S. Gulf Coast, consisting of grassland, cropland, and forestland in several management conditions. These emission values over a 20-year time horizon were combined with guidance on promising sites for algae raceway development to provide an estimate of industry-wide GHG emissions impacts due to direct land use change (LUC). Direct LUC impacts appear to be important, with average GHG emissions of between 4 and 8 g CO2eq/MJ for grassland and cropland conversion, which is roughly 6.3% and 12.5% of the total GHG emission over the entire algae renewable diesel life cycle without considering the LUC. Emissions due to direct LUC could be even larger if previously forested lands are cleared, averaging 24.7 g CO2eq/MJ across a range of potential algae sites. This article details the methods, assumptions and initial LCA results for these land use change scenarios when considering the algae biofuels life cycle. Results from this LCA can help decision-makers recognize the importance of facility siting in overall environmental performance, and select locations of algae cultivation facilities to minimize direct LUC emissions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lipid production is an important indicator for evaluating microalgal species for biodiesel production. In this study, a new green microalga was isolated from a salt lake in Egypt and identified as Asteromonas gracilis. The main parameters such as biomass productivity, lipid content, and lipid productivity were evaluated in A. gracilis, cultivated in nutrient-starved (nitrogen, phosphorous), and salinity stress as a one-factor-at-a-time method. These parameters in general did not vary significantly from the standard nutrient growth media when these factors were utilized separately. Hence, response surface methodology (RSM) was assessed to study the combinatorial effect of different concentrations of the abovementioned factor conditions and to maximize the biomass productivity, lipid content, and lipid productivity of A. gracilis by determining optimal concentrations. RSM optimized media, including 1.36 M NaCl, 1 g/L nitrogen, and 0.0 g/L phosphorus recorded maximum biomass productivity, lipid content, and lipid productivity (40.6 mg/L/day, 39.3%, and 15.9 mg/L/day, respectively) which agreed well with the predicted values (40.1 mg/L/day, 43.6%, and 14.6 mg/L/day, respectively). Fatty acid profile of A. gracilis was composed of C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:3, C18:2, C18:1, and C20:5, and the properties of fuel were also in agreement with international standards. These results suggest that A. gracilis is a promising feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Biodiesel fuel fuels are introduced at an increasing extent as a more carbon-neutral alternative to reduce CO2-emissions, compared to conventional diesel fuel. In the present study we have investigated the impact of increasing the use of 1st generation fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) biodiesel from current 7% blend (B7) to 20% blend (B20), or by increasing the biodiesel content by adding 2nd generation hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) based biodiesel (SHB; Synthetic Hydrocarbon Biofuel) on toxicity of diesel exhaust particles (DEP) in an in vitro system. Human bronchial epithelial BEAS–2B cells were exposed for 4 and 20 h to DEP from B7, B20 and SHB at different concentrations, and examined for effects on gene expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6), CXCL8 (IL-8), CYP1A1 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). The results show that both B20 and SHB were more potent inducers of IL-6 expression compared to B7. Only B20 induced statistically significant increases in CXCL8 expression. By comparison the rank order of potency to induce CYP1A1 was SHB &gt; B7 &gt; B20. No statistically significant difference were observed form HO-1 expression, suggesting that the differences in cytokine responses were not due to oxidative stress. The results show that even moderate increases in biodiesel blends, from 7% to 20%, may increase the proinflammatory potential of emitted DEP in BEAS–2B cells. This effect was observed for both addition of 1st generation FAME and 2nd generation HVO biodiesel. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pyrolytic bio-oil was chemically upgraded after physically distilled upgrades to meet the petroleum transportation fuel substitute. A Pd/C catalyst was used to upgrade the microalgae pyrolytic bio-oil to determine the effect of different distillation fractions and catalytic upgrading conditions on the yields and properties. The middle distillation fraction (F2) was upgraded under various temperature (130 to 250 °C) and pressure (4.1 to 8.3 MPa) conditions based on response surface methodology (RSM). The light distillation fraction (F1) and raw bio-oil were also catalytically upgraded for the comparison. The distillation step prior to catalytic upgrading led to a better quality of upgraded bio-oil compared to the direct bio-oil upgrades. Both the oxygen and hydrogen contents of light and middle fraction upgrades were improved, while the upgraded raw bio-oil showed limited improvement. The other properties of HHV and TAN with the middle fraction upgrades were improved to 42.9 MJ/kg and 1.09 mg KOH/g, respectively, at the severe condition as most of the ketones in upgrades were removed. Also, paraffin and aromatic chemical groups were significantly produced at the expense of the olefin groups through hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation. Thus, the catalytic upgrading after a distillation stage enhanced the quality of biofuel that can be a petroleum fuels substitute or additives. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The palm biodiesel industry has been promoted for climate change mitigation, energy security and sustainability strategies worldwide. International debates on land use change and unintended consequences from market-driven impacts of biofuel (i.e. biodiesel and bioethanol) production have highlighted the need for an assessment which considers multi-modelling approaches as well as up-to-date improvement technologies. This study assessed potential environmental life cycle consequences of palm-based biodiesel production in comparison with conventional diesel production. Impacts from modelling choices (consequential and attributional life cycle assessment), co-product utilisation during the palm oil milling and biodiesel conversion stages, recent improvement technologies for treating palm oil mill effluent and oil palm breeding, and direct and indirect land use change were assessed using fifteen scenarios. It was found that the different modelling choices as well as the inclusion of direct and indirect land use change highly affected environmental gains and losses compared with the conventional diesel system. The most important contributor to the environmental benefits was utilisation of co-products. When excluding the use phase (because its value did not vary across the different scenarios; except for climate change), the most important contributor in environmental impacts for terrestrial acidification and marine eutrophication, was emissions from indirect land use change. Increased oil palm yields and improved palm oil mill effluent treatment technologies resulted in overall impact reduction; and should be promoted. Various co-product utilisation pathways have shown different impact reduction potentials. Co-products from palm oil mills should be fully utilised for electricity production, animal feed and oil substitution. Glycerol from biodiesel conversion was suggested to be used for animal nutrition. In conclusion, both modelling choices should be used for supporting policies in different contexts. Policy makers need to be aware of the differences in outcomes and risks of both modelling choices and later on select the specific approach which fits their specific decision context. Co-product utilisation should be optimised in order to increase the total impact reduction. Recommended co-product utilisation pathways, oil palm variety and wastewater treatment technologies can be used for further enhancing the sustainability of palm oil industry. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Esterases catalyze the cleavage and formation of ester bonds and are members of the diverse family of α/β hydrolase fold. They are useful in industries from different sectors, such as food, detergent, fine chemicals, and biofuel production. In a previous work, 30 positive clones for lipolytic activity were identified from a metagenomic library of a microbial consortium specialized in diesel oil degradation. In this study, a putative gene encoding an esterase/lipase, denominated est8, has been cloned and the corresponding protein expressed recombinantly, purified to homogeneity and characterized functional and structurally. We show that the protein codified by est8 gene, denominated Est8, is an alkaline esterase with high catalytic efficiency against p-nitrophenyl acetate and stable in the presence of up to 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. The three-dimensional structure of Est8 was determined at 1.85-Ǻ resolution, allowing the characterization of the substrate-binding pocket and features that rationalize the preference of Est8 for short-chain substrates. In an attempt to increase the size of ligand-binding pocket and enzyme activity against distinct substrates of long chain, we mutated two residues (Met213 and Phe217) that block the substrate channel. A small increase in the reaction velocity for p-nitrophenyl butyrate and p-nitrophenyl valerate hydrolysis was observed. Activity against p-nitrophenyl acetate was reduced. The functional and structural characterization of Est8 is explored in comparison with orthologues. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The uncertainty and variability of algal biomass production presents several challenges to the nascent algal biofuel industry, including equipment scaling and feedstock supply. Ideally, on-site processing equipment will be scaled to minimize overall biofuel production costs, which means at times biomass production could exceed down-stream processing capacity due to seasonal variation. Biomass produced in excess of conversion capacity during summer months must be stabilized by some method, such as drying, until needed later in the year. Because of algae's high moisture content and its cohesive nature, drying is challenging. Blending algae with terrestrial biomass may provide a cost-effective method to enable drying and stabilization of algae by reducing moisture content and improving rheological (i.e. flowability) properties. To test the technical feasibility of this approach, bench-scale rotary drum dyers were constructed and tested with blends of algae (Scenedesmus sp.), ground pine (2 mm grind), sorghum, corn stover (6 mm), sieved sand, and dried algae. In these studies, blends up to 40% algae exhibited drying behavior similar to that of pine alone, and reached dryness (2% moisture) in half of the time it took to dry algae alone. Thermogravimetric analyses performed on blends and neat blend materials provided drying curves consistent with the bench-scale dryers. Preliminary logistics analysis for production-scale operations were performed to determine cost and availability of feedstock materials for blending as compared to drying algae directly. This analysis indicates that revenue lost due to idle processing capacity had a significant impact on the per gallon gasoline equivalent feedstock cost. The blending approach, described herein, reduced feedstock-related costs, including procurement, drying, and storage by 35% relative to drying algae directly. Our results indicate that blending algae with terrestrial biomass enables the use of rotary dryers and has the potential to improve overall algal biofuel economics. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An alternative method is proposed for the quantitative analysis of biodiesel in diesel-biodiesel blends. It is based on hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy and applies univariate calibration, in which the integrals of the spectra are considered. Statistical comparisons between the results obtained from the method proposed here and from the infrared (IR) spectrometry method, which is recommended by the European Standard EN 14078, show that the 1H NMR method offers equivalent results compared with standard ones. Furthermore, the proposed 1H NMR method recognizes the difference between biodiesel and vegetable oil, whereas the IR method cannot. Therefore, the 1H NMR method developed to quantify biodiesel in diesel-biodiesel blends is proposed here as a more practical and efficient alternative to the official method, because besides quantifying biodiesel in blends, it indicates adulteration with vegetable oil, either as the intentional and illegal addition of this raw material or because of a low degree of transesterification conversion during biodiesel synthesis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Natural cellulose fibers with properties suitable for textile and other applications have been extracted from the outer layer of Ricinus communis (castor plant) stems. Castor plants are cultivated mainly for their oil seeds but are also found to grow extensively as weeds in marshy and polluted waters. The plant grows up to 40 feet in length with minimum requirement of natural resources. Up to 5–10 times the weight of the oil seeds are left as residue which is generally burnt or buried in the ground. In this research, we studied the potential of using castor plant residues as a source for natural cellulose fibers. Fibers were extracted using a simple alkaline approach and characterized for their morphology, physical structure and tensile properties. Polypropylene was reinforced with castor fibers and made into composites. About 25% of the stem could be obtained as fibers with properties similar to that of fibers from other lignocellulosic plant residues. Individual fibers were fibrillar and exhibited convolutions similar to those seen in cotton. Elongation of the fibers at 5% was higher than common bast fibers jute and flax and the strength at 2.7 g/den (350 MPa) was similar to that of jute but lower than that of cotton. Castor fibers have the properties to be processable as textile fibers and were also found to be suitable as reinforcement for composites. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Kernels recovered from fruit pits (industrial by-products) of twenty-eight plum varieties of two species Prunus domestica L. and Prunus cerasifera Ehrh. were studied as potential biodiesel feedstock. The lowest (22.7% (w/w) on dry weight basis (dw)) and the highest (53.2% (w/w) dw) oil yields in the tested varieties differed by almost two-fold. The levels of oleic and linoleic acids, the two dominant fatty acids in plum kernel oils, were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) affected by the variety and ranged between 46.2–70.7% and 22.6–45.3%, respectively. Two significant correlations were found between the oil yield in kernels of different plum varieties of both species and two fatty acids, oleic and linoleic acids. The European biodiesel standards of kinematic viscosity, cetane number, density and iodine value were met for all studied samples. Recorded differences between minimum and maximum value of individual biodiesel parameters obtained for various plum varieties were: 4.7 (cetane number), 0.20 mm2/s (kinematic viscosity), 0.0022 g/cm3 (density), 0.01 MJ/kg (higher heating value), 2.63 °C (CFPP), 2.61 h (induction period) and 14.7 I2/100 g (iodine value). The logarithmic regression model in comparison to linear regression model, better expressed the relationship between physicochemical properties of biofuel and the ΣPUFA/(ΣSFA + ΣMUFA) ratio; where ΣPUFA, ΣSFA and ΣMUFA are the sum of polyunsaturated, saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, respectively. Regardless of the species, P. cerasifera Ehrh. vs. P. domestica L., a similar variation of all study parameters was noted. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Scale-up of microalgal biotechnology to provide large quantities of biofuel, lipids, and coproducts is not fully developed because of the large needs for nutrients, water, land, solar insolation, and CO2/carbon supplies. Wastewaters, including oil and gas produced water (PW), may supply a portion of these needs in regions with insufficient fresh water resources. PW is a challenging water resource for this use because of variable salinity, geochemical complexity, and the presence of biologically toxic components. In this paper we review PW volumes, quality, and use in media for microalgae production in the southwestern US, Australia, and Oman. We also include data from the southwestern US, referencing previously unpublished results from the National Alliance for Biofuels and Bioproducts (NAABB) consortium research project. We include a Supplementary Information section that explores cultivation of multiple microalgae species in PW and examines the carbon utilization process, all work performed in support of the NAABB field program. Strains of algae tested in the reviewed papers include Nannochloropsis, Dunalliella, Scenedesmus, and several mixed or unknown cultures. We conclude that the use of PW in algae cultivation is feasible, if the additional complexity of the water resource is accounted for in developing media formulations and in understanding metals uptake by the algae. We recommend additional work to standardize growth testing in PW, better and more thorough chemical analysis, and geochemical modeling of the PW used in media. Expanded strain testing in PW media will identify improved strains tolerant of PW in algae cultivation. © 2017

AB  - Abundant, low prices and a highly reduced nature make glycerol to be an ideal feedstock for the production of reduced biochemicals and biofuels. Escherichia coli has been paid much attention as the platform of microbial cell factories due to its high growth rate (giving higher metabolite production rate) and the capability of utilizing a wide range of carbon sources. However, one of the drawbacks of using E. coli as a platform is its mixed metabolite formation under anaerobic conditions. In the present study, it was shown that ethanol could be exclusively produced from glycerol by the wild type E. coli, while D-lactic acid could be exclusively produced from glucose by pflA.cra mutant, where the glucose uptake rate could be increased by this mutant as compared to the wild type strain. It was also shown that the growth rate is significantly reduced in pflA.cra mutant for the case of using glycerol as a carbon source due to redox imbalance. The metabolic regulation mechanisms behind the fermentation characteristic were clarified to some extent. © 2017

AB  - Conventionally, production of methyl ester fuels from microalgae occurs through an energy-intensive two-step chemical extraction and transesterification process. To improve the energy efficiency, we performed in situ enzymatic conversion of whole algae biomass from an oleaginous heterokont microalga Nannochloropsis oceanica IMET1 with the immobilized lipase from Candida antarctica. The fatty acid methyl ester yield reached 107.7% for dry Nannochloropsis biomass at biomass to t-butanol to methanol weight ratio of 1:2:0.5 and a reaction time of 12 h at 25 °C, representing the first report of efficient whole algae biomass conversion into fatty acid methyl esters at room temperature. Different forms of algal biomass including wet Nannochloropsis biomass were tested. The maximum yield of wet biomass was 81.5%. Enzyme activity remained higher than 95% after 55 days of treatment (equal to 110 cycles of reaction) under the conditions optimized for dry algae biomass conversion. The low reaction temperature, high enzyme stability, and high yield from this study indicate in situ enzymatic conversion of dry algae biomass may potentially be used as an energy-efficient method for algal methyl ester fuel production while allowing co-product recovery. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The suitability of biodiesel produced from spent Vietnamese coffee was examined. Previous work shows that the geographical origin of coffee beans has little effect on the composition and physical properties of the biodiesel produced Jenkins et al. [1]. Vietnamese coffee, however, is roasted in a range of fats and oils for flavour enhancement and therefore has a unique fatty acid profile. The oil yield and biodiesel properties of three Vietnamese coffees were assessed and compared to a coffee of more typical composition—Colombian—and traditional biodiesel feedstocks (rapeseed, sunflower and palm). The oil yield from fresh Vietnamese coffee was higher (12.0–14.0 %) than Colombian coffee (9.3 %), while the oil yield from spent Vietnamese coffee (9.3–10.4 %) was comparable to the Colombian coffee (9.5 %). The unsaponifiable matter was only present in low levels in the Vietnamese coffee (1.9–4.9 %) compared to Colombian coffee (30.4 % fresh, 21.4 % spent). Vietnamese coffee biodiesel was more saturated than Columbian coffee biodiesel. It was therefore more viscous and had a higher pour point than the Colombian coffee, and possessed properties more akin to palm biodiesel. Vietnamese coffee biodiesel would therefore be a suitable feedstock for use locally due to the more suitable climate and compatibility with the palm feedstock that is currently used.

AB  - Biofuels have transitioned from a technology expected to deliver numerous benefits to a highly contested socio-technical solution. Initial hopes about their potential to mitigate climate change and to deliver energy security benefits and rural development, particularly in the Global South, have unravelled in the face of numerous controversies. In recognition of the negative externalities associated with biofuels, the European Union developed sustainability criteria which are enforced by certification schemes. This paper draws on the literature on stewardship to analyse the outcomes of these schemes in two countries: the UK and Guatemala. It explores two key issues: first, how has European Union biofuels policy shaped biofuel industries in the UK and Guatemala? And second, what are the implications for sustainable land stewardship? By drawing attention to the outcomes of European demand for biofuels, we raise questions about the ability of European policy to drive sustainable land practices in these two cases. The paper concludes that, rather than promoting stewardship, the current governance framework effectively rubberstamps existing agricultural systems and serves to further embed existing inequalities. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The effect of regional factors on life cycle assessment (LCA) of camelina seed production and camelina methyl ester production was assessed in this study. While general conclusions from LCA studies point to lower environmental impacts of biofuels, it has been shown in many studies that the environmental impacts are dependent on location, production practices, and even local weather variations. Methods: A cradle-to-farm gate and well-to-pump approaches were used to conduct the LCA. To demonstrate the impact of agro-climatic and management factors (weather condition, soil characteristics, and management practices) on the overall emissions for four different regions including Corvallis, OR, Pendleton, OR, Pullman, WA, and Sheridan, WY, field emissions were simulated using the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model. openLCA v.1.4.2 software was used to quantify the environmental impacts of camelina seed and camelina methyl ester production. Results and discussion: The results showed that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during camelina production in different regions vary between 49.39 and 472.51 kg CO2-eq./ha due to differences in agro-climatic and weather variations. The GHG emissions for 1 kg of camelina produced in Corvallis, Pendleton, Pullman, and Sheridan were 0.76 ± 11, 0.55 ± 10, 0.47 ± 18, and 1.26 ± 6 % kg CO2-eq., respectively. The GHG emissions for 1000 MJ of camelina biodiesel using camelina produced in Corvallis, Pendleton, Pullman, and Sheridan were 53.60 ± 5, 48.87 ± 5, 44.33 ± 7, and 78.88 ± 4 % kg CO2-eq., respectively. Other impact categories such as acidification and ecotoxicity for 1000 MJ of camelina biodiesel varied across the regions by 43 and 103 %, respectively. Conclusions: It can be concluded that process-based crop models such as DNDC in conjunction with Monte Carlo analysis are helpful tools to quantitatively estimate the influence of regional factors on field emissions which consequently can provide information about the expected variability in LCA results. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Monthly US diesel and soybean prices spanning from January 2004 to June 2014 are used in this analysis. Strong links between diesel and soybean prices are identified over the long run. Results indicate that soybean price movement is tail-dependent and varies over quantiles. In the upper quantiles, soybean prices respond strongly to diesel price fluctuations as compared to that in the lower quantiles. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Despite promises that they can contribute toward more environmentally beneficial transportation there are many sustainability concerns about liquid transport biofuels. In response to pressure from civil society, the European Union (EU) has introduced sustainability criteria for biofuels. A hybrid regulatory system involving state and non-state actors stipulates that retailers and producers must comply to be eligible for fiscal support such as tax exemptions. Flexibility in the system allows choice between different means of compliance, including a range of voluntary schemes. We present an analysis of views within the Swedish liquid transport biofuel sector in 2012 – a year after the introduction of EU sustainability criteria. Using document analysis, official statistics, and a survey, we use four key structures of global value chains — input–output structure, territorial configuration, institutional framework, and firm-level chain governance structure — to structure an analysis of biofuel value chain coordination. This yields three main findings regarding how the Swedish liquid transport biofuel system operates within, and views, the new regulatory framework. Firstly that it uses a broad portfolio of feedstock mainly from within Europe, seemingly avoiding countries where any supply conditions may be in doubt; second, larger retailers and producers achieve compliance without the need to provide additional social sustainability information; third, that actors exhibit predominantly Eurocentric perspectives on sustainability, express confidence that their supply chains have strong 'sustainability performance’ and desire long-term policy stability. We conclude that despite a deep critique of the sustainability of biofuels amongst civil society and academia, EU regulation allows for production systems that reflect a European- and climate change mitigation-centred view on biofuel 'sustainability’. © 2015 The Authors

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. is a highly promising oilseed for sustainable production of biofuels and bio-kerosene due to its high oil content and excellent quality. However, it is a perennial and incipiently domesticated species with none stable cultivar created until now despite genetic breeding programs in progress in several countries. Knowledge of the genetic structure and diversity of the species is a necessary step for breeding programs. The molecular marker can be used as a tool for speed up the process. This study was carried out to assess genetic diversity of a germplasm bank represented by J. curcas accessions from different provenance beside interspecific hybrid and backcrosses generated by IAC breeding programs using inter-simple sequence repeat markers. The molecular study revealed 271 bands of which 98.9% were polymorphic with an average of 22.7 polymorphic bands per primer. Genetic diversity of the germplasm evaluated was slightly higher than other germplasm around the world and ranged from 0.55 to 0.86 with an average of 0.59 (Jaccard index). Cluster analysis (UPGMA) revealed no clear grouping as to the geographical origin of accessions, consistent with genetic structure analysis using the Structure software. For diversity analysis between groups, accessions were divided into eight groups by origin. Nei’s genetic distance between groups was 0.14. The results showed the importance of Mexican accessions, congeneric wild species, and interspecific hybrids for conservation and development of new genotypes in breeding programs. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa L.) an oilseed crop has emerged as a potential source for biofuels and bio-products. Camelina is an economic crop due to its less requirements of agronomic inputs as compared to other oilseed crops. However, it is direly required to evaluate the adaptability of camelina and characterize its production potential. Therefore, a pot experiment was carried out in rain out shelter at the Department of Agronomy, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan to optimize appropriate sowing date with respect to growth and yield potential of different genotypes of camelina under drought stress. Completely randomized design with factorial arrangements was adopted. Three sowing dates with the difference of 10 days (November 13th, 23rd and December 03rd), two water regimes (100% FC and 60% FC) and two camlena genotypes (611 and 618) were used in this experiment. Results indicated that camelina growth and yield related traits were significantly influenced by difference in sowing dates and water regimes. Maximum leaf area index (LAI), crop growth rate (CGR), leaf area duration (LAD), net assimilation rate (NAR) and yield related traits were recorded with early sowing (13th November) which was followed by sowing on 23rd November and least values of these variables were recorded in late sowing (December 03rd). Plants grown under water deficit conditions (60% FC) showed the decreased values of LAI, CGR, LAD, NAR and yield related attributes as compared to normally irrigated plants (100% FC). However, the response of genotypes of camelina 611 and 618 remained statistically similar to each other. © 2017, Soil Science Society of Pakistan.

AB  - The preparation of sodium methoxide-treated algae catalysts and their activity in the transesterification of Pongamia pinnata seed oil by dimethyl carbonate were investigated. We also investigated the effect of the sodium methoxide-treated algae catalyst on the biodiesel yield. The development of sodium methoxide-treated algae catalysts can overcome most problems associated with dissolution in dimethyl carbonate. The products were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy to identify the fatty acid methyl esters in the biodiesel produced. The molar ratio of Pongamia pinnata seed oil to dimethyl carbonate in transesterification in the presence of the sodium methoxide-treated algae catalyst was observed to play a substantial role in this study, wherein the Pongamia pinnata seed oil conversion increased with increasing catalyst concentration. The highest percent conversion rate was 97%. With intense research focus and development, an ideal catalyst can indeed be developed for optimal biodiesel production that is both economically feasible and environmentally benign. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Bio-oil which derivates from fast pyrolysis of biomass is a promising product for replacing the traditional fossil oil. Bio-oil with high oxygen, high viscosity, strong acid, low heat value and poor thermal stability is not beneficial to the industry application. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the quality of bio-oil. The technology of ultrasonic emulsification and additives was used to improve the stability and decrease the oxygen content. The influence of ultrasonic power, ultrasonic time, the kinds of alcohol and the ratio of alcohol on the improvement of bio-oil quality was investigated. The result showed that the stability and heat value can be effectively improved when adding alcohol or using ultrasonic emulsification appropriately. With the increase of ultrasonic time or the ultrasonic power, the viscosity was increased first and then increased after a decreasing. When the content of alcohol was not enough, the addition of emulsification auxiliaries could improve the stability of the emulsification liquid effectively. Heavy oil combined with alcohol showed a better stability, and the TG curve was significantly shifted to lower temperature zone. The results of TG curve of emulsified heavy oil and alcohol showed that methanol and ethanol were more conducive to the heavy oil in polymer or oligomer ester alcoholysis. When the ratio of additional methanol to bio-oil was 3∶1, the viscosity was decreased from 32.47 mm2/s to 1.73 mm2/s and calorific value was increased from 15.21 MJ/kg to 19.43 MJ/kg, the quality of the emulsified oil was improved significantly. With the increase of carbon chain, the caloric value of bio-oil was increased gradually. And there was no obvious delamination in the mixture and the viscosity was decreased. The ultrasonic time and ultrasonic power had significant influence on the physicochemical properties of the emulsion, when n-butanol and heavy oil were mixed by 1∶1, the viscosity of heavy oil emulsion was effectively reduced after ultrasonic treatment for 10 min under 150 W. Under the condition of low alcohol content, the emulsifier can effectively increase the stability of emulsion. © 2017, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery. All right reserved.

AB  - Background: Lindera glauca fruit with high quality and quantity of oil has emerged as a novel potential source of biodiesel in China, but the molecular regulatory mechanism of carbon flux and energy source for oil biosynthesis in developing fruits is still unknown. To better develop fruit oils of L. glauca as woody biodiesel, a combination of two different sequencing platforms (454 and Illumina) and qRT-PCR analysis was used to define a minimal reference transcriptome of developing L. glauca fruits, and to construct carbon and energy metabolic model for regulation of carbon partitioning and energy supply for FA biosynthesis and oil accumulation. Results: We first analyzed the dynamic patterns of growth tendency, oil content, FA compositions, biodiesel properties, and the contents of ATP and pyridine nucleotide of L. glauca fruits from seven different developing stages. Comprehensive characterization of transcriptome of the developing L. glauca fruit was performed using a combination of two different next-generation sequencing platforms, of which three representative fruit samples (50, 125, and 150 DAF) and one mixed sample from seven developing stages were selected for Illumina and 454 sequencing, respectively. The unigenes separately obtained from long and short reads (201, and 259, respectively, in total) were reconciled using TGICL software, resulting in a total of 60,031 unigenes (mean length = 1061.95 bp) to describe a transcriptome for developing L. glauca fruits. Notably, 198 genes were annotated for photosynthesis, sucrose cleavage, carbon allocation, metabolite transport, acetyl-CoA formation, oil synthesis, and energy metabolism, among which some specific transporters, transcription factors, and enzymes were identified to be implicated in carbon partitioning and energy source for oil synthesis by an integrated analysis of transcriptomic sequencing and qRT-PCR. Importantly, the carbon and energy metabolic model was well established for oil biosynthesis of developing L. glauca fruits, which could help to reveal the molecular regulatory mechanism of the increased oil production in developing fruits. Conclusions: This study presents for the first time the application of an integrated two different sequencing analyses (Illumina and 454) and qRT-PCR detection to define a minimal reference transcriptome for developing L. glauca fruits, and to elucidate the molecular regulatory mechanism of carbon flux control and energy provision for oil synthesis. Our results will provide a valuable resource for future fundamental and applied research on the woody biodiesel plants. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The environmental potential impacts of rice husk fast pyrolysis and upgrading in supercritical ethanol (PY-USE) system and catalytic hydrotreating system (PY-CH) were calculated and compared based on the life cycle assessment (LCA) models. The results of this work revealed that FDP, GWP, ODP, POCP and AP of the PY-CH system were lower than those of the PY-USE system, while the HTP and EP was higher than that of PY-USE system. The fossil ethanol consumed during fast pyrolysis and upgrading process and agriculture system were the main sources of the potential environmental impacts of the PY-USE and PY-CH system, respectively. It was founded that the impact of the pyrolysis fuels were lower than that of the fossil fuels for FDP, GWP and ODP, but higher for HTP, POCP, AP and EP. LCA results showed that greenhouse gas (GHG) saving of 38.83% and 45.93% for the produced fuel of PY-USE system compared to conventional gasoline and diesel, while the GHG saving of 73.50% and 76.58% for the fuel of PY-CH system. © 2017, Editorial Board of China Environmental Science.

AB  - As the increasing scarcity of the fossil fuel is rising day by day, alternate fuel or vegetable oils that available naturally can be used as a substitute to the conventional fuels in diesel engines. In this work, a new type of biodiesel fuel, Chicha oil methyl ester, is introduced as alternate fuel in diesel engine. The use of biodiesel resulted in lower carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions and increased emissions of carbon di oxide and nitrogen oxides. The experimental results proved that the use of Chicha oil biodiesel as fuel in diesel engine is a viable alternative to diesel fuel. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Greasy agroindustrial waste from the process of cooking hog meat was used to produce biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters and fatty acid ethyl esters) under a specific storage condition. The operating conditions necessary to achieve the optimal relationship between quality and productivity were assessed. Next, batches of methyl and ethyl biodiesels were produced, generating 2 L of each product to evaluate their stability during 150 days of storage. The following study indicates that, for methyl route, the molar ratio (1:5) and catalyst (0.5%) yielded the best result of 90.77% (w/v) and quality parameters within the international standards. The ethyl route also showed the highest yield (77.09% w/v) and better quality parameters with a molar ratio (1:5) and catalyst (0.5%). No significant differences were observed in the methyl biodiesel obtained from the batch process for up to 45 days, while the ethyl biodiesel degraded in 30 days of storage. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Rice husks are pyrolyzed in a fluidized bed reactor and the vaporized bio-oils are continuously graded into lighter and heavier bio-oils by in-line fractional distillation. The selection of the operating fluidization velocity is systematically discussed and the influences of the gas fluidization velocity on the physical and chemical properties of the graded oils are initially investigated. At the gas fluidization velocity of 0.46 m/s (1.3 Umf) and pyrolysis temperature of 590 °C, aromatic compounds in the graded heavier oil, graded 20 °C trapped lighter oil and graded 0 °C trapped lighter oil are 68%, 38% and 15%, respectively. The best oil grading performance is obtained at 1.3 Umf. The properties of the bio-chars are closely related to the gas fluidization velocity. Cleaner chars are obtained at 1.0 Umf at the same pyrolysis temperature. The enhanced gas backmixing at higher gas fluidization velocity enhances secondary decomposition reactions. When the gas fluidization velocity increases from 1.0 Umf to 1.6 Umf at the pyrolysis temperature of 490 °C, the water content and the heating value of the 20 °C trapped lighter bio-oils increases from 10% to 23% and decreases from 25.7 MJ/kg to 21.3 MJ//kg, respectively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is regarded by many as a “greener” alternative fuel to petroleum diesel with potentially lower health risk. However, recent studies examining biodiesel particulate matter (PM) characteristics and health effects are contradictive, and typically utilize PM generated by passenger car engines in laboratory settings. There is a critical need to analyze diesel and biodiesel PM generated in a “real-world” setting where heavy duty-diesel (HDD) engines and commercially purchased fuel are utilized. This study compares the mass concentrations, chemical composition and cytotoxicity of real-world PM from combustion of both petroleum diesel and a waste grease 20% biodiesel blend (B20) at a community recycling center operating HDD nonroad equipment. PM was analyzed for metals, elemental/organic carbon (EC/OC), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (N-PAHs). Cytotoxicity in a human lung epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) following 24 h exposure to the real-world particles was also evaluated. On average, higher concentrations for both EC and OC were measured in diesel PM. B20 PM contained significantly higher levels of Cu and Mo whereas diesel PM contained significantly higher concentrations of Pb. Principal component analysis determined Mo, Cu, and Ni were the metals with the greatest loading factor, suggesting a unique pattern related to the B20 fuel source. Total PAH concentration during diesel fuel use was 1.9 times higher than during B20 operations; however, total N-PAH concentration was 3.3 times higher during B20 use. Diesel PM cytotoxicity was 8.5 times higher than B20 PM (p < 0.05) in a BEAS-2B cell line. This study contributes novel data on real-world, nonroad engine sources of metals, PAH and N-PAH species, comparing tailpipe PM vs. PM collected inside the equipment cabin. Results suggest PM generated from burning petroleum diesel in nonroad engines may be more harmful to human health, but the links between exposure, composition and toxicity are not straightforward. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are pollutants of concern due to their carcinogenic and mutagenic activity. Their emissions are mainly related with the combustion or pyrolysis of the organic matter, such as in fossil fuels combustion. It is important to characterize PAHs in the combustions of biofuels due to their increasing importance in the actual energetic setting. There is a lot of research focused in PAHs emission due to the combustion in diesel engines; but only few of them have analyzed the effect of raw material and type of alcohol used in the transesterification process. Different raw materials (i.e. animal fat, palm, rapeseed, linseed, peanut, coconut, and soybean oils) have been used for obtaining FAME and FAEE. A method for measuring PAHs generated during combustion in a bomb calorimeter has been developed. Combustion was made at different oxygen pressures and the samples were taken from the bomb after each combustion. Samples were extracted and the PAHs amounts formed during combustion were analyzed by GC-MS. This research shows the statistical relationships among the 16 PAHs of concern, biodiesel composition and oxygen pressure during combustion. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present paper is focused on the use of a vacuum ultraviolet absorption spectrometer (VUV) for gas chromatography (GC), within the context of flow modulated comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (FM GC × GC). The features of the VUV detector were evaluated through the analysis of petrochemical and fatty acids samples. Besides responding in a predictable fashion via Beer's law principles, the detector provides additional spectroscopic information for qualitative analysis. Virtually all chemical species absorb and have unique gas phase absorption features in the 120–240 nm wavelength range monitored. The VUV detector can acquire up to 90 full range absorption spectra per second, allowing its coupling with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography. This recent form of detection can address specific limitations related to mass spectrometry (e.g., identification of isobaric and isomeric species with very similar mass spectra or labile chemical compounds), and it is also able to deconvolute co-eluting peaks. Moreover, it is possible to exploit a pseudo-absolute quantitation of analytes based on pre-recorded absorption cross-sections for target analytes, without the need for traditional calibration. Using this and the other features of the detector, particular attention was devoted to the suitability of the FM GC × GC-VUV system toward qualitative and quantitative analysis of bio-diesel fuel and different kinds of fatty acids. Satisfactory results were obtained in terms of tailing factor (1.1), asymmetry factor (1.1), and similarity (average value 97%), for the FAMEs mixtures analysis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The hydroisomerisation/hydrocracking properties of Ni-zeolite catalysts (H-MFI and H-Beta) are studied using n-hexadecane as model compound and compared with those of Ni/ASA (amorphous silica-alumina) as reference catalyst. In the case of H-Beta, the effect of the introduction of mesoporosity by controlled desilication is also investigated. The results indicate that Ni on desilicated H-Beta catalysts shows very interesting characteristics for the potential use in the production of biofuel from vegetable/algal oil, or the upgrading of biomass-derived Fischer–Tropsch waxes. Ni/H-Beta shows lower activity with respect to Ni/H-MFI, but significantly lower formation of gases and much better hydroisomerisation activity. The introduction of mesoporosity by desilication enhances the activity, while still maintaining an acceptable gas formation and good hydroisomerisation properties. Furthermore, the desilication treatment improves the stability with respect to carbon formation. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Wood chips were hydrothermally treated in near critical point water in the presence of a catalyst to yield a raw biocrude, containing a wide range of organic components. This product was subsequently distilled to remove its heaviest fraction, which tends to yield chary products if heated above 350 °C. The biocrude obtained has an oxygen content of 12 wt % and was subsequently hydrotreated to obtain a hydrocarbon stream. Varying the hydrotreatment operating conditions and catalyst yielded a deoxygenated syncrude which quality improved with operation severity. The hydroprocessed stream produced under very mild conditions can be further upgraded in conventional refinery operations while the stream produced after more severe hydrotreatment can be mixed with conventional diesel. This proof of concept was demonstrated with commercial hydrotreating catalysts, operating between 350 and 380 °C, 40 to 120 bar pressure and 0.5 to 1 h−1 contact time. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - A family of silica-supported, magnetite nanoparticle catalysts was synthesised and investigated for continuous-flow acetic acid ketonisation as a model pyrolysis bio-oil upgrading reaction. The physico-chemical properties of Fe3O4/SiO2 catalysts were characterised by using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and porosimetry. The acid site densities were inversely proportional to the Fe3O4 particle size, although the acid strength and Lewis character were size-invariant, and correlated with the specific activity for the vapour-phase acetic ketonisation to acetone. A constant activation energy (∼110 kJ mol−1), turnover frequency (∼13 h−1) and selectivity to acetone of 60 % were observed for ketonisation across the catalyst series, which implies that Fe3O4 is the principal active component of Red Mud waste. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Oxymethylene dimethyl ethers (OMEs) are promising fuel additives that are accessible from renewable resources. We present a mechanistic investigation of the zeolite-catalyzed synthesis of OMEs from trioxane and OME1 based on first-principles calculations. The most favorable mechanism proceeds via direct incorporation of trioxane rather than formaldehyde incorporation after prior trioxane decomposition to formaldehyde. The computed mechanism is in agreement with the experimental kinetics as well as the selectivity after short and long reaction times. The competition between direct incorporation of trioxane and formaldehyde is predicted to depend on the acidity of the catalyst as well as the concentration of protic species in solution.

AB  - Injection parameters are known to impact most on diesel engine emissions and performance but there is little work in literature regarding the effect of injection parameters on biodiesel engine performance. Studies of the effect of injection timing and pressure on emissions and brake specific consumption has been carried out on a 48 kW, VW Polo, MK3, four-cylinder, four-stroke, indirect injection engine which is naturally aspirated and air cooled. Engine modifications were carried out for each fuel used except petroleum diesel. The input factors for the modification include injection timing only, injection pressure only and their effects on brake specific energy consumption and exhaust emissions particularly carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen. Injection timing was varied at six levels including advance of 7°, 5°, 3°, 0° settings and retardation settings of 3° and 5°. Nozzle injection pressures were varied at 150, 175, 200, 225 and 250 bars. Generally, injection advance led to significantly lower hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions because there was ample time for combustion to reach completion. Though not significant, higher nozzle pressures accounted for lower emissions except NOx. Injection timing was found to have the most profound effect on engine emissions and brake specific energy consumption. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Waste cooking oil is discarded into sewage and waste bins in various developing countries. In China, the discarded oil is scooped illegally from drains by smugglers. After collection, the obtained waste oil is reprocessed; the resulting substance is popularly called gutter oil. Gutter oil and its mixture with fresh vegetable oils are sold in food markets at lower prices. This created panic among the general public because of food safety concerns. 1H NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance), MALDI-MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry) and HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) are used for the detection of gutter oil. Currently, sustainable utilization of gutter oil for biofuel production is being explored using chemical and enzymatic methods. Furthermore, trial runs by Boeing company shows that gutter oil can be blended with normal jet fuel for use in aviation industry. Annually, around 1.8 billion L (476 million gallons) of biofuels can be produced from gutter oil in China. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Biodiesel is now-a-days recognized as a real potential alternative to petroleum-derived diesel fuel due to its number of desirable characteristics. However, its higher production cost resulting mainly due to use of costly food-grade vegetable oils as raw materials is the major barrier to its economic viability. Present work is an attempt to explore the potential of Eriobotrya japonica seed oil for the synthesis of biodiesel using alkali-catalyzed transesterification. Optimization of production parameters, namely molar ratio of alcohol to oil, amount of catalyst, reaction time and temperature, was carried out using Taguchi method. Fatty acid composition of both oil and biodiesel was determined using GC and H1 NMR. Alcohol to oil molar ratio of 6:1, catalyst amount of 1% wt/wt, 2 h reaction time and 50 °C reaction temperature were found to be the optimum conditions for obtaining 94.52% biodiesel. Highest % contribution was shown by the ‘amount of catalyst’ (67.32%) followed by molar ratio of alcohol to oil (25.51%). Major fuel properties of E. japonica methyl esters produced under optimum conditions were found within the specified limits of ASTM D6751 for biodiesel, hence it may be considered a prospective substitute of petro-diesel. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study focuses on the ultrasonic pretreatment of bio-oil produced from the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae. Ultrasonic pretreatment would increase the viscosity of the bio-oil. Time was the most influential factor affecting the viscosity of the bio-oil and increasing the time significantly increased the viscosity of the bio-oil. Ultrasonic pretreatment could increase the H/C molar ratio of the bio-oil. Ultrasonic frequency has little effect on the properties of the bio-oil. Basically, the pretreated bio-oil produced at a higher temperature, longer reaction time, higher frequency, and higher power contained lower N. However, contrary results were observed for the O content. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Promising biological objects containing the maximum amounts of lipids were selected for further study based on an analysis of published studies on the quantitative and qualitative composition of lipids accumulating in microalgae. The genera Navicula and Isochrysis were found to be most optimal for liquid biofuel production because they contained the maximum percentage of triacylglycerides in the total lipids. Freshwater species of these microalgae genera can be considered most suitable for cultivation in CFD bioreactors as a primary product of biofuel production. Innovative methods using vortex devices are proposed for removing the algal oil. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Day by day biofuels are gaining importance because of depletion of fossil fuels and because of energy security. Replacement of biofuels to the regular conventional fuels is one of the valuable methods to attain better performance as well as to reduce unwanted emissions. In the Present paper rice bran oil is selected as a biofuel and conducted series of experiments to measure the Performance characteristics. From the results, it is clearly seen that performance improves slightly with the usage of rice bran oil and shows beneficial nature in reduction of emission characteristics which is logical to observe. It is observed that NOx emissions for B30 biodiesel is 20ppm less than that of Diesel and for B15 biodiesel it is 10ppm less than diesel. Unburnt HC is nearly 40ppm less for B30 compared with diesel and 10ppm less for B15 biodiesel. For B30 biodiesel CO emissions is 1% less than that of diesel and for B15 biodiesel CO emissions is 0.5% less than diesel. Reduction of emissions is due to better combustion and low friction with higher lubrication because of high viscosity and stability. © 2017 IAEME.

AB  - Soybean biodiesel (B100) has been playing an important role in Brazilian energy matrix towards the national bio-based economy. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is the most widely used indicator for assessing the environmental sustainability of biodiesels and received particular attention among decision makers in business and politics, as well as consumers. Former studies have been mainly focused on the GHG emissions from the soybean cultivation, excluding other stages of the biodiesel production. Here, we present a holistic view of the total GHG emissions in four life cycle stages for soybean biodiesel. The aim of this study was to assess the GHG emissions of Brazilian soybean biodiesel production system with an integrated life cycle approach of four stages: agriculture, extraction, production and distribution. Allocation of mass and energy was applied and special attention was paid to the integrated and non-integrated industrial production chain. The results indicated that the largest source of GHG emissions, among four life cycle stages, is the agricultural stage (42-51%) for B100 produced in integrated systems and the production stage (46-52%) for B100 produced in non-integrated systems. Integration of industrial units resulted in significant reduction in life cycle GHG emissions. Without the consideration of LUC and assuming biogenic CO2 emissions is carbon neutral in our study, the calculated life cycle GHG emissions for domestic soybean biodiesel varied from 23.1 to 25.8 gCO2eq. MJ-1 B100 and those for soybean biodiesel exported to EU ranged from 26.5 to 29.2 gCO2eq. MJ-1 B100, which represent reductions by 65% up to 72% (depending on the delivery route) of GHG emissions compared with the EU benchmark for diesel fuel. Our findings from a life cycle perspective contributed to identify the major GHG sources in Brazilian soybean biodiesel production system and they can be used to guide mitigation priority for policy and decisionmaking. Projected scenarios in this study would be taken as references for accounting the environmental sustainability of soybean biodiesel within a domestic and global level. © 2017 Cerri et al.

AB  - We explore four fundamental channels of mandate compliance available under current U.S. biofuel policy: increased ethanol blending through E10 or E85, increased biodiesel blending, and a reduction in the overall compliance base. Simulation results highlight the interplay and varying importance of these channels at increasing blend mandate levels. In addition, we establish how RIN prices are formed: The value of a RIN in equilibrium is shown to reflect the marginal cost of compensating the blender for employing one additional ethanol-equivalent unit of biofuel. This contrasts with existing research equating the price of RINs to the gap between ethanol supply and demand evaluated at the mandate level. We demonstrate the importance of this distinction in case of binding demand side infrastructure constraints such as the ethanol blend wall: as percentage blend mandates increase, the market for low-ethanol blends may contract in order to reduce the overall compliance base. This has important implications for implied ethanol demand in the economy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The co-pyrolysis of olive bagasse with crude rapeseed oil at different blend ratios was investigated at 500ºC in a fixed bed reactor. The effect of olive bagasse to crude rapeseed oil ratio on the product distributions and properties of the pyrolysis products were comparatively investigated. The addition of crude rapeseed oil into olive bagasse in the co-pyrolysis led to formation of upgraded biofuels in terms of liquid yields and properties. While the pyrolysis of olive bagasse produced a liquid yield of 52.5 wt %, the highest liquid yield of 73.5 wt % was obtained from the co-pyrolysis of olive bagasse with crude rapeseed oil at a blend ratio of 1:4. The bio-oil derived from olive bagasse contained 5% naphtha, 10% heavy naphtha, 30% gas oil, and 55% heavy gas oil. In the case of bio-oil obtained from the co-pyrolysis of olive bagasse with crude rapeseed oil at a blend ratio of 1:4, the light naphtha, heavy naphtha, and light gas oil content increased. This is an indication of the improved characteristics of the bio-oil obtained from the co-processing. The heating value of bio-oil from the pyrolysis of olive bagasse alone was 34.6 MJ kg−1 and the heating values of bio-oils obtained from the co-pyrolysis of olive bagasse with crude rapeseed oil ranged from 37.6 to 41.6 MJ kg−1. It was demonstrated that the co-processing of waste biomass with crude plant oil is a good alternative to improve bio-oil yields and properties. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - A pilot-scale algal biofilm reactor (P-ABR) was assessed for its potential to provide a continuous supply of high volume algal biomass to be utilized as feedstock for hydropyrolysis. The half-year long performance assessment showed significantly high productivity of 15-20 g m-2 d-1 with uniform biochemical composition. Hydropyrolysis (HyPy) using ZSM-5 was used to convert and partition ABR-grown algal biomass components into energy-rich biocrude (HyPyO), nutrient-rich aqueous condensate (HyPyA), carbon-rich solid residue (HyPyS), and gases. The effect of temperature on yield and composition of different HyPy products was quantified in terms of carbon and nitrogen recovery. The maximum yield of biocrude was 31% at 200 °C and decreased to 18% with an increase in temperature up to 300 °C. The influence of temperature on recovery of nitrogen showed preferential accumulation of nitrogen in the aqueous phase with increasing temperature. The highest carbon recovered was 41% in the form of biocrude (HyPyO) at 200 °C followed by 31% in HyPyA at 300 °C. In the context of energy and nutrient recovery potential of each of the HyPy products, applications of different fractions was explored for development of a sustainable algal biorefinery. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Rapeseed is considered to be a promising sources for hydroprocessed ester and fatty acid (HEFA) jet fuel production as a means to address energy security and climate change mitigation. However, concerns have been raised about its impact on water, as large-scale biofuel production may place pressure on fresh water supplies and water quality. Water footprint (WF) analysis, when combined with water-focused life cycle assessment (LCA), can be an effective system analysis tool for water sustainability. This study developed a life cycle water footprint analysis informed by inputs from multiple models for rapeseed HEFA jet fuel production in North Dakota and evaluated the environmental impacts on water utilization and water quality due to large scale HEFA jet production. The biogeochemical-based EPIC model was incorporated to simulate crop growth that influences the hydrological cycle. Systematic LCA models were built in SimaPro to conduct life cycle blue WF analysis. Results using energy allocation indicate that rapeseed derived HEFA jet fuel has a WF of 131-143 m3 per GJ fuel over a rapeseed price range of $470-600, including all green, blue, and gray WF components. Discussions also indicate the importance of incorporating allocation within a life cycle approach when conducting biofuel WF analysis. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, the 60,000-km durability tests were performed on two diesel engines (EURO IV and EURO II) by using B10 (10% waste cooking oil + 90% diesel) and B8 (8% waste cooking oil + 92% diesel), respectively, to determine the impacts on the emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCCD/Fs). The above emissions were measured per 20,000-km testing intervals. The highest total PAH mass concentrations were 38.2 and 25.6 µg Nm–3 before durability test by using EURO IV and II engines, respectively, and decreased 51–55% after 60,000-km operation. The dominant congeners of PAH emissions were naphthalene (&gt; 45%), pyrene, and phenanthrene, which belonged to the LM-PAHs. The total PAH BaPeq had different emission trends between two engines during the durability tests. The highest level was 2.17 µg BaPeq Nm–3 from EURO II engine before test and reduced 84% after a 60,000-km cycle, when the total-BaPeq emissions of EURO IV tended to increase from 0.0894 to 0.154 µg BaPeq Nm–3 after the same test. The most dominant congener to the toxicity emissions was benzo(a)pyrene (~70%). Additionally, the PCDD/F emissions were tested in EURO IV engine by using B10. The PCDD/F concentrations of mass and toxicity approached the highest levels, 167 ng Nm–3 and 3.69 pg WHO-TEQ Nm–3, after 60,000-km and 20,000-km running cycles, respectively. The main dominant congeners were OCDD (&gt; 50%) for mass, 2,3,7,8-TeCDD (&gt; 35%) and 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD (&gt; 18%) for toxicity. Consequently, the use of WCO-biodiesel might reduce the PAH mass and toxicity emissions in older engine but had no significant effect in PAH and PCDD/F emission during the deterioration of a newer engine. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.

AB  - The study of in situ gas explosion to lyse the triglyceride-rich cells involves the solubilization of gas (e.g., carbon dioxide, CO2) in lipid-rich cells under pressure followed by a rapid decompression, which allows the gas inside the cell to rapidly expand and rupture the cell from inside out. The aim of this study was to perform the cell disruption using pressurized CO2 as well as to determine the solubility of CO2 in Rhodotorula glutinis cell suspension, sugar broth media, and spent media. Cell disruption of R. glutinis was performed at two pressures of 2,000 and 3,500 kPa, respectively, at 295.2 K, and it was found from both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and plate count that a substantial amount of R. glutinis was disrupted due to the pressurized CO2. We also found a considerable portion of lipid present in the aqueous phase after the disruption at P = 3,500 kPa compared to control (no pressure) and P = 2,000 kPa, which implied that more intracellular lipid was released due to the pressurized CO2. Solubility of CO2 in R. glutinis cell suspension was found to be higher than the solubility of CO2 in both sugar broth media and spent media. Experimental solubility was correlated using the extended Henry's law, which showed a good agreement with the experimental data. Enthalpy and entropy of dissolution of CO2 were found to be −14.22 kJ mol−1 and 48.10 kJ mol−1 K−1, 9.64 kJ mol−1 and 32.52 kJ mol−1 K−1, and 7.50 kJ mol−1 and 25.22 kJ mol−1 K−1 in R. glutinis, spent media, and sugar broth media, respectively. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

AB  - The life cycle analysis of biofuels from microalgae shows a feasibility to recover essential fatty acids (EFA) as co-products from polar lipid components. Lipid fractionation of Spirulina platensis and Nannochloropsis gaditana showed 86 and 78% of γ- linolenic acid (GLA) and eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) distributed in glycolipid (GL) and glycolipid + phospholipid (PL) fractions respectively. Optimized solvent recovery of total lipids from the consortium and subsequent treatment with amphipolar solvent resulted in the selective separation of triglycerides and polar lipid components (PL+GL). FT-IR spectroscopic studies confirmed the partition of triglycerides and polar lipids exhibiting their respective characteristic peaks in the IR region. The EFA's when concentrated from these organisms following winterization at +5, +10 and -20°C with 10% w/v, showed petroleum ether and hexane as ideal solvents at 20oC for effective concentration of GLA and EPA. The weight ratio optimization of EFA to the solvent showed 5% w/v at -20oC in petroleum ether followed by hexane and dichloromethane as suitable conditions for concentration and recovery of GLA and EPA fatty acids.

AB  - Biofuels are proven for its environment friendliness, but they are not completely effective in reducing the emissions due to the problems in blending ratio, compression ratio (CR) and fuel consumption. Moreover, identifying new oil with appropriate blends of diesel is the prerequisite for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, without compromising the mechanical efficiency. Inspired from the special biofuel characteristics, this paper contributes to the literature through improving the diesel engine performance using tamanu oil (TO)-based biodiesel blend. Firstly, the TO-based biodiesel is blended with the conventional diesel to produce two blending ratios, namely 5:95 and 10:90. The blends are experimentally studied for its combustion characteristics, mechanical efficiency and the emission characteristics on a single cylinder four-stroke diesel engine. The results demonstrate the minimized emissions with no sort of compromise on the engine performance. Secondly, this paper proposes an interpolation and prediction model using artificial neural network through which the mechanical efficiency and the emission characteristics of the TO blends can be estimated. The deviation between the actual and the estimated characteristics is found to be less and so the proposed prediction model can act as an equivalent engine model for further works. © 2016, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.

AB  - The present work is intended to investigate the emission characteristics of neat cashew nut shell methyl ester (CNSME100) by adding pentanol at two different proportions and compared with the baseline diesel. CNSME100 is prepared by the conventional transesterification process. CNSME100 is chosen due to its non-edible nature. Pentanol is chosen as an additive because of its higher inbuilt oxygen content and surface to volume ratio which reduces the drawbacks of neat CNSME100. Emission characteristics were carried out in single cylinder naturally aspirated CI engine fuelled with neat cashew nut shell methyl ester (CNSME), cashew nut shell methyl ester and pentanol by 10% volume (CNSME90P10), cashew nut shell methyl ester and pentanol by 20% volume (CNSME80P20), and diesel. This work also aims to investigate the feasibility of operating an engine fuelled with neat methyl ester and alcohol blends. Experimental results showed that by blending higher alcohol to neat cashew nut shell methyl ester reduces the emissions significantly. It is also found that the emission from neat methyl ester and pentanol blends is lesser than diesel at all loads. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Although the aviation sector is a relatively small contributor to total greenhouse gas emissions, it is a fast-growing, fossil fuel-intensive transportation mode. Because aviation is a mode for which liquid fuels currently have no practical substitute, biofuels are gaining attention as a promising cleaner alternative. In this paper, we use the GCAM integrated assessment model to develop scenarios that explore the potential impact of biojet fuels for use in aviation in the context of broader climate change mitigation. We show that a carbon price would have a significant impact on the aviation sector. In the absence of alternatives to jet fuel from petroleum, mitigation potential is limited and would be at the expense of aviation service demand growth. However, mitigation efforts through the increased use of biojet fuels show potential to reduce the carbon intensity of aviation, without a significant impact on bioenergy use in the rest of the energy system for carbon mitigation. The potential of biofuel to decarbonize air transport is significantly enhanced when carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is used in the conversion process to produce jet fuels from biomass feedstock. © 2017

AB  - Wood chip, mainly used to produce paper and other products traditionally, has also been used to produce biofuel. The global demand for wood chip is increasing as policies promote the use of biomass for renewable energy. The USA has been a major exporter of wood chip worldwide, but US exports of wood chip could decline if this resource is increasingly used for domestic electricity generation and cellulosic biofuel production. Meanwhile, European Union (EU) demand for wood chip is expected to increase rapidly in response to its renewable energy policy. In this paper, we build the first global trade model for wood chip using available wood chip trade data and analyze the combined effects of local renewable energy policies in these jurisdictions on the global market of wood chip. We find that the tropical regions of Latin America and Southeast Asia as well as the Former Soviet Union would increase their export of wood chip significantly in response to the policy scenarios. If forest governance in some of these countries is weak, US and EU renewable energy policy could inadvertently exacerbate deforestation in these regions, with an associated negative impact on carbon storage and other environmental services. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Biogas derived from anaerobic digestion of organic wastes, and lignocellulosic biomass can be used to produce drop-in diesel fuel via Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. In this study, we developed a process-based simulation model for the biogas to liquid fuel (BgTL) plant to conduct mass and energy balances and to evaluate techno-economic assessment of producing drop-in FT fuels. The BgTL plant operations consisted of biogas cleaning, biomethane reforming, FT synthesis of syngas and hydrocracking and final distillation to produce drop-in liquid fuels. The unconverted syngas and syncrude were utilized to generate steam and electricity to meet internal plant demand, while the excess power was sold to the grid. The base case BgTL plant (2 000 Nm3/h) produced about 4.6 million gallons per annum of total FT fuels which consisted of 62% diesel, 32% gasoline, 6% LPG with an overall biogas conversion of 54%. A discounted cash flow rate of return (DCFOROR) approach for the Nth plant was used to estimate the capital and operating costs with the minimum selling price for the FT drop-in fuels of about $5.67/gal ($5.29/GGE). The increase in plant feed capacity to 20 000 Nm3/h decreased the minimum selling price to $2.06/gal ($1.92/GGE). The sensitivity analysis conducted on the base case plant demonstrated that the internal rate of return (IRR), FT conversion rate, plant operating hours, and biogas cost were the most sensitivity parameters to the minimum selling price. Overall, the BgTL technology is deemed to be economically feasible to meet US biofuels demand. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires production of cellulosic biofuel, such as ethanol produced from switchgrass. However, the bioenergy industry faces a well-established “chicken and egg” conundrum where biorefineries cannot be built until adequate farmers' participation in cellulosic biomass production is ensured; on the other hand, farmers will not commit to growing cellulosic biomass until a market is established. We assume that individual farmers in a future biofuel market are boundedly rational, and will endure the risk of growing switchgrass if they are likely to receive a better payoff in the future. After the number of switchgrass farmers reaches a certain threshold, sufficient biomass can be procured to build an economically viable biorefinery. If a biorefinery is built in a region, the reductions of logistics costs and economies of scale lead to the realization of a public good, and all farmers can be benefited from it; otherwise, the efforts of early switchgrass adopters could be unsuccessful. In this paper, an appropriate biorefinery capacity and the corresponding incentives provided to the farmers are determined by balancing the impact and the risk of the public good. Our incentive model is more efficient than a program that incentivizes all switchgrass growers equally. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present paper outlines the catalytic thermolysis of Jatropha oil carried out in laboratory model fixed bed reactor varying temperature between 340 and 420°C and at liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) 1.12, 1.87, and 2.25 h−1. Three heterogeneous catalysts, comprising of Amorphous Alumino-Silicate (AAS) loaded separately with titania (TiO2), zirconia (ZrO2) and ceria (CeO2), were successfully synthesized and used in the reaction. The study reveals that the maximum distilled liquid biofuel yield of 71% by volume could be achieved through zirconia impregnated catalyst at 380°C and 1.87 h−1 LHSV. Reaction products mainly consist of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons along with the carbon dioxide, coke, and water. The liquid product is a crude mixture of various components and hence distilled out into four fractions over the temperature range of 60-200°C. The physical properties like boiling point, specific gravity, viscosity, and calorific value of distilled biofuel fraction 1 resembles the properties of petrol whereas fractions 2 and 3 resemble diesel. Suitable blends of these fractions lead to cleaner biofuel. Life of catalyst could be enhanced by nitrogen purging practice at moderate temperature. Yield and quality of distilled biofuel product were improved by using hydroquinone as a polymerization inhibitor. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 36: 749–757, 2017. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog

AB  - Using sustainable feed stock such as non-edible oil for the biodiesel production can be one of the cost effective approaches considering the ever growing interest towards renewable energy and problems in existing approaches for production. However, due to the high free fatty acid content, non-edible oils require considerable preprocessing before the actual transesterification reaction for biodiesel production. The present work focuses on intensification of the esterification reaction used as preprocessing step based on acoustic and hydrodynamic cavitation also presenting the comparison with the conventional approach. Karanja oil with initial acid value as 14.15 mg of KOH/g of oil has been used as a sustainable feedstock. Effect of operating parameters such as molar ratio, catalyst loading, temperature and type of catalyst (sulfuric acid and Amberlyst-15) on the acid value reduction has been investigated. The maximum reduction in the acid value (final acid value as 2.7 mg of KOH/g of oil) was obtained using acoustic cavitation at optimum molar ratio of oil to methanol as 1:5 and 2% sulfuric acid loading at ambient temperature. In the case of hydrodynamic cavitation, acid value reduced upto 4.2 mg of KOH under optimized conditions of first stage processing. In the second stage esterification using hydrodynamic cavitation and conventional approach, the final acid value was 3.6 and 3.8 mg of KOH/g of oil respectively. Energy requirement analysis for ultrasound and conventional approaches clearly established the superiority of the ultrasound based approach. The present study clearly demonstrated that significant intensification benefits can be obtained in terms of the reduction in the molar ratio and operating temperature for the case of acoustic cavitation as compared to the conventional approach with somewhat lower effects for the hydrodynamic cavitation. © 2016

AB  - A possible application of glycerol, which is produced in large amounts as a by-product from the biodiesel industry, is its fermentation to serinol (2-amino-1,3-propanediol), a glycerol derivative. The downstream processing of this glycerol-based fermentation broth was investigated. The challenge of the isolation of serinol was the complex media and the solubility of the desired substance in aqueous media. In this study, the isolation of serinol was investigated by an appropriate reversible derivatization method. Serinol was isolated by protecting the amino group with diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate directly in the aqueous phase, followed by extraction of the 2,2-bis(ethoxycarbonyl)vinyl-serinol (BECV-serinol) with ethyl acetate resulting in an isolated yield of 63%. We demonstrate the possibility of isolation of a hydroscopic amino alcohol from the fermentation broth and the comparison of the products in water as well as the cleavage of the 2,2-bis(ethoxycarbonyl)vinyl group (BECV group). The procedure can also be used for other amino group containing molecules, such as serine, glucosamine, hexylamine and amino methyl laureate. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - BACKGROUND: A response surface methodology was used to study the reaction mechanism of strontium oxide (SrO) as a catalyst for a biodiesel production process using a model oil (composed of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), free fatty acids (FFAs) and triglycerides). The influence of several factors (initial FAME content (0–30 wt%), initial FFAs content (oleic acid 0.20–2.7 wt%), temperature (40–60 °C), methanol to model oil ratio (11–43 wt%), catalyst to model oil ratio (0.5–2.5 wt%) and reaction time (5–30 min)) on the FAME yield, the FAME content, the pH of polar phase and the biodiesel alkalinity was studied. SrO was also compared with potassium hydroxide (KOH) for the conversion of Scenedesmus Obliquus microalgae esterified lipids after a first step of FFAs esterification with sulfuric acid into biodiesel with the following conditions: temperature: 60 °C; reaction time: 22.2 min; catalyst to microalgae ratio: 2.48 wt%; methanol to microalgae lipid ratio: 31.4 wt%. RESULTS: With those operating conditions, KOH was able to reach a slightly higher FAME yield (32.6% g FAME g−1 lipid) than SrO (29.0% g FAME g−1 lipid). Moreover, the results showed a strong relationship between the pH of the polar phase (glycerol–methanol–water) and the FAME yield, which indicates that the reaction using alkaline metal earths is mostly catalyzed by a homogeneous reaction. CONCLUSION: The fact that alkaline metal earths act as homogeneous catalysts make them less suitable for biodiesel production, because they are not inducing neutral pH, and they increase the risk of corrosion. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - In the present work, biofuel derived from industrial fish processing industry waste is used in diesel engines to study its suitability. Biofuel from industry fish waste is produced through catalytic cracking, and its quality has been improved through distillation. A single cylinder 4.5 kW at 1500 rpm was used to find the suitability of biofuel and undistilled biofuel in diesel engine. Experimental results show that the brake thermal efficiency of biofuel and undistilled biofuel is similar. Brake thermal efficiency for diesel, undistilled biofuel and biofuel is 29.98, 32.12 and 32.4%, respectively, at 80% load. Carbon monoxide, unburnt hydrocarbons, particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen emissions increase with undistilled biofuel compared to biofuel. There is a small reduction in carbon dioxide emission with undistilled biofuel compared to biofuel. Even though the cylinder pressure is high with undistilled biofuel, the intensity of premixed combustion is lower than distilled biofuel. The ignition delay and combustion duration increase with undistilled biofuel. Finally, it is concluded that the fuel derived from fish processing industry waste can be used as a fuel for diesel engine after distillation. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - BACKGROUND: At commercial level, the biodiesel production process is well established for many types of feedstock. However, economic feasibility depends on regional fluctuating data, making each case unique. A calculation model to analyze the economic feasibility of biodiesel production from Jatropha curcas was developed, along with an analysis of the energetic balance derived from this process. RESULTS: Yucatán state has the cultivation surface to replace 10% of its fossil diesel fuel consumption with biodiesel. Two scenarios were studied: the use of biodiesel–fossil diesel blends B5 and B10. The net energy ratio (NER) of biodiesel production is 2.88, indicating that the system provides more energy than it consumes. The economic analysis indicates that biodiesel cost remains constant with production capacities of 10 000 m3 year−1 and higher. Field labor, pesticides, and fertilizers are the major costs at J. curcas plantations, representing 64.3, 16.3 and 11.5% of total biodiesel cost, respectively. The net present value (NPV) was always negative, proving that the biodiesel–jatropha chain is not economically viable. CONCLUSIONS: Actual seed productivity (1 495 kg ha−1 year−1) must be increased 2.17 times to attain economic viability. Agricultural practices need to be enhanced in order to lower labor cost and the use of fertilizers. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - In this experimental study, glycerol conversion to hydrogen and synthesis gas was carried out by utilizing thermal plasma technology. An entrained-flow reactor equipped with a direct current arc discharge plasma torch, which was used to heat plasma-forming gas via Joule heating effect, and superheated water vapor, which was used to form the plasma, as a main reaction agent and a source of active radicals generation during steam reforming process of glycerol, set up a core of the glycerol conversion system. Glycerol, which is a by-product of biodiesel production during transesterification process, is considered to be a potential feedstock for renewable energy, biofuels, and high value-added chemicals production, such as methanol, hydrogen, etc. The reforming of glycerol was performed at various experimental conditions by changing the flow rate of water vapor and glycerol as well as the plasma torch power. The obtained results showed that the main reaction products were hydrogen and carbon monoxide with total concentration up to 75%. Moreover, the process was quantified in terms of cold gas efficiency, energy efficiency, carbon conversion, and specific energy requirement. Generally, the performed study indicates that hydrogen and synthesis gas could be effectively produced from glycerol by employing thermal plasma technology. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The technology of transesterification of biodiesel obtained from many agricultural products, which are often referred to as renewable resources, yields substantial amounts of by-products. They exhibit various properties that prompt scientific research into potential application thereof. Various spectroscopic methods, e.g. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, are being increasingly used in the research. In this paper, we present the results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectroscopy analyses of technical glycerine, distilled glycerine, and matter organic non glycerol, i.e. by-products of biodiesel production. To facilitate the spectroscopic analysis, a number of parameters were determined for all the materials, e.g. the calorific value, water content, sulphated ash content, methanol content, acidity, as well as the contents of esters, heavy metals, aldehydes, nitrogen, and phosphorus. The results indicate that the analysed products are characterised by a comparable calorific value in the range from 11.35 to 16.05 MJ kg-1 in the case of matter organic non glycerol and technical glycerine. Observation of changes in the position of selected peaks in the range of 3700-650 cm-1 in the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy method facilitates determination of the level of degradation of the analysed material. Changes in the wavelength ranges can be used for monitoring the formation of secondary oxidation products containing carbonyl groups. © 2017 by Magdalena Kachel-Jakubowska.

AB  - Pyrolysis oil has been identified as a possible alternative fuel source; however, widespread use is hindered by high acidity and water content. These negative characteristics can be mitigated by blending with, for example, biodiesel, marine gas oil, and butanol. These blended samples can be unstable and often separate into two distinct phases. NMR spectroscopy is a well-established spectroscopic technique that is finding increasing application in the analysis of pyrolysis oil and blended fuels derived from it. Here, slice-selective NMR, where the NMR spectrum of only a thin slice of the total sample is acquired, is used to study, noninvasively, how the constituent components of blended biofuel samples are partitioned between the two layers. Understanding the outcome of the phase separation is an important step toward understanding why the blended oil samples separate and may provide answers to mitigating and eventually solving the problem. The NMR method was successfully used to analyze a number of separated biofuel samples, typically separated into an oil layer, containing marine gas oil and biodiesel, above a bio-oil layer with a high water and butanol content. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Oxygenated species obtained from the selective chemo-catalytic refunctionalization of lignocellulosic materials and rationally formulated mixtures thereof can be tailored to the needs of advanced internal combustion engine concepts like low temperature compression-ignition or highly boosted spark-ignition combustion. In the present contribution, we present a framework for model-based formulation of biofuel blends with tailored properties by considering the fuel's molecular composition as the fundamental design degree of freedom. To this end, optimization-based reaction pathway screening is combined with mathematical fuel property prediction by means of structural group contribution and quantitative structure-property relationship modeling in order to formulate and solve an integrated product and pathway design problem. The model-based approach is envisioned (i) to guide fundamental experimental investigations of the combustion behavior of blended biofuels toward the most favorable mixtures and (ii) to identify promising conversion pathways for further elaboration by means of reaction engineering and conceptual process design. The latter is ultimately needed to bridge the gap from the mass- and energy-based molecular level analysis presented here to a process level analysis addressing the economics of the involved conversion and separation steps. A case study is dedicated to the identification of promising blends and respective production routes for the spark-ignition (SI) engine. The goal here is to produce a 100% bioderived fuel with tailored properties from hexoses and pentoses of lignocellulosic biomass by utilizing renewable hydrogen from carbon-free energy sources such as wind or solar to boost the energy of fuel produced for a given quantity of biomass supplied. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) were used to characterize the microstructure of a reverse micelle system consisting of ethanol, water, and surfactant in n-hexadecanes as an analytical framework to understand the structure and stability of a model platform for biofuel formulations. Best-fit modeling of SANS scattering data suggested that the micelles are better described as ellipsoids rather than spheres, with the (geometric) diameters of stable micelles increasing from 2.4 to 7.5 nm as a function of the increasing water content as well as surfactant concentration. Fitted diameters from DLS measurements followed similar trends, but DLS measurements overestimated the interior of the micelles by roughly 2-3 nm because DLS measurements are based on the full hydrodynamic radius, including the surfactant shell. SANS only detects the nanopool interior, a significant advantage. The choice of surfactant altered the stability at temperatures below 10°C, but the micelles readily reassembled when the temperature was raised toward room temperature. This model framework was then used to quantitatively assess "real world" surrogate fuel systems consisting of ethanol, commercial ultra-low sulfur diesel, and a surfactant derived from minimally processed corn oil waste. These surrogate mixtures were probed over temperatures ranging from 10 to 60°C, at concentrations up to 740 mM, and at various saturation levels with results similar to the model system. Results confirmed that this analytical framework can be used to understand optimization of biofuel formulations to meet industry standards for stability, cold-flow, and other performance requirements. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Development of biofuels is considered as one of the important ways to replace conventional fossil energy and mitigate climate change. However, rapid increase of biofuel production could cause other environmental concerns in China such as water stress. This study is intended to evaluate the life-cycle water footprints (WF) of biofuels derived from several potential non-edible feedstocks including cassava, sweet sorghum, and Jatropha curcas in China. Different water footprint types including blue water, green water, and grey water are considered in this study. Based on the estimated WF, water deprivation impact and water stress degree on local water environment are further analyzed for different regions in China. Results: On the basis of the feedstock resource availability, sweet sorghum, cassava, and Jatropha curcas seeds are considered as the likely feedstocks for biofuel production in China. The water footprint results show that the feedstock growth is the most water footprint intensive process, while the biofuel conversion and transportation contribute little to total water footprints. Water footprints vary significantly by region with climate and soil variations. The life-cycle water footprints of cassava ethanol, sweet sorghum ethanol, and Jatropha curcas seeds biodiesel were estimated to be 73.9-222.2, 115.9-210.4, and 64.7-182.3 L of water per MJ of biofuel, respectively. Grey water footprint dominates the life-cycle water footprint for each type of the biofuels. Development of biofuels without careful water resource management will exert significant impacts on local water resources. The water resource impacts vary significantly among regions. For example, based on blue and grey water consumption, Gansu province in China will suffer much higher water stress than other regions do due to limited available water resources and large amount of fertilizer use in that province. In term of blue water, Shandong province is shown with the most severe water stress issue, followed by Gansu province, which is attributed to the limited water resources in both provinces. Conclusions: By considering feedstock resource distribution, biofuel production potentials, and estimated water footprints, this study provides insight into the impact of biofuel production on the local water environment in China. Biofuel development policies need to be carefully designed for the sustainable development of biofuels in China. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Regardless of whether biodiesel is represented in the form of oil from grains, agricultural crops, or microorganisms, it is a clean fuel depends mainly on biomass conversion. The present work indicates that the green microalga Scenedesmus obliquus showed higher biomass productivity of 0.15 g (CDW) L−1 d−1. The increase in NaCl concentration up to +100% caused an increase in growth, esterified fatty acid (EFA) content, and EFA productivity of S. obliquus. The decrease or increase of pH values reduced the growth, EFA content, and productivity. Biomass productivity increased from 0.06 g L−1d−1 under a light intensity of 80 μmol m−2s−1 to 0.1 g L−1d−1 at 160 μmol m−2 s−1. Biodiesel characterization showed that the iodine value of biodiesel of S. obliquus was 70 g iodine/100 g oil. Except viscosity, all biodiesel characteristics are in accordance with the European standards for fuel diesel (EN 590:1999). These results nominate S. obliquus as a promising candidate for biodiesel production by outdoor cultivation. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Microalgae grown under different nutrient deficient conditions present a good source of natural lipids with applications for several types of biofuels. The expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene can further provide an insight to the mechanisms leading to enhanced lipid production under such stresses. In this study, two nutrients viz. nitrogen and phosphorus were modulated to see its effect on lipid productivity in selected cyanobacteria and its correlation with Accase followed by molecular dynamics simulation. Results: Selected cyanobacteria viz. Oscillatoria sp. (SP8), Anabaena sp. (SP12), Anabaena sp. (SP13), Microcoleus sp. (SP18), and Nostoc sp. (SP20) varied in their ability to accumulate lipids which ranged from a lowest of 0.13% in Anabaena sp. (SP13) to the maximum of 7.24% in Microcoleus sp. (SP18). Microcoleus sp. (SP18) also recorded highest lipid accumulation at both N (6 mM NaNO3) and P (0.20 mM K2HPO4) limiting conditions. The overall expression of accD was found to be upregulated in both Oscillatoria sp. (SP8) and Microcoleus sp. (SP18) for all nitrogen concentrations but was differentially regulated with both positive and negative induction under phosphorus stress conditions. Maximum induction was observed in Microcoleus sp. (SP18) at 0.20 mM K2HPO4. The obtained 3D structure of SP8 protein (21.8 kDa) showed six alpha helices, while SP18 protein (16.7 kDa) exhibited four alpha helices and four beta sheets. The phi (φ)/psi(ψ) angles of the amino acid residues observed in Ramachandran plot analysis showed that both SP8 and SP18 proteins were highly stable with more than 90% amino acids in allowed regions. The molecular dynamics simulation results also indicated the stability of ligand-bound protein complexes. Conclusion: It has been demonstrated that cyanobacterial isolates are affected differently by nutrient limitation leading to variation in their lipid productivity. The same has been revealed by the behavior of accD gene expression which was regulated more by nutrients concentrations rather than the organism. However, the ligand-bound protein complexes were stable throughout MD simulations. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Increased use of biofuels raises concerns about health effects of new emissions. We analyzed relative lung health effects, on Fisher 344 rats, of diesel engine exhausts emissions (DEE) from a Euro 5-classified diesel engine running on petrodiesel fuel containing 20% rapeseed methyl esters (B20) with and without diesel particulate filter (DPF). One group of animals was exposed to DEE for 7 days (6 h/day), and another group for 28 days (6 h/day, 5 days/week), both with and without DPF. The animals (n = 7/treatment) were exposed in whole body exposure chambers. Animals breathing clean air were used as controls. Genotoxic effects of the lungs by the Comet assay, histological examination of lung tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) markers of pulmonary injury, and mRNA markers of inflammation and oxidative stress were analyzed. Our results showed that a minor number of genes related to inflammation were slightly differently expressed in the exposed animals compared to control. Histological analysis also revealed only minor effects on inflammatory tissue markers in the lungs, and this was supported by flow cytometry and ELISA analysis of cytokines in BALF. No exposure-related indications of genotoxicity were observed. Overall, exposure to DEE with or without DPF technology produced no adverse effects in the endpoints analyzed in the rat lung tissue or the BALF. Overall, exposure to DEE from a modern Euro 5 light vehicle engine run on B20 fuel with or without DPF technology produced no adverse effects in the endpoints analyzed in the rat lung tissue or the BALF. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Sludge taken from a wastewater treatment plant of the petrochemical industry was dewatered and pyrolyzed to produce liquid oil as an alternative fuel via microwave heating. Element contents of dried sludge were 45.9 ± 3.85 wt.% carbon, 7.70 ± 1.43 wt.% hydrogen, 4.30 ± 0.77 wt.% nitrogen and 3.89 ± 0.52 wt.% sulfur. Two major thermal degradation peaks of sludge were determined during the microwave pyrolysis process, one at 325–498 K (most of the water was vaporized, and the weight loss was over 85 wt.%) and the other at 548–898 K for sludge constituent decomposition. Zn content was high in the dried raw material and residues. Other toxic elements such as Ni, Cr, Pb, As and Cd contents were 0.61–0.99, 0.18–0.46, 0.15–0.25, 0.018–0.034, and 0.006–0.017 mg/g, respectively. About 14–20 wt.% of oil was produced based on the dried sludge cake, and the oil major elements were C (69–72 wt.%), H (5.7–6.7 wt.%), N (1.9–2.2 wt.%), and S (0.58–0.82 wt.%). The heat values of liquid oils were 8700–9200 kcal/kg at 400–800 °C. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The increasing demand of plant oils for biodiesel production has highlighted the need for alternative strategies based either on non-food crops or agro-industrial wastes that do not compete with food and feed production. In this context, the combined use of wastewater and oleaginous microorganisms could be a valuable production option. Ricotta cheese whey (RCW), one of the major byproducts of the dairy industry, is produced in very high and steadily increasing amounts and, due to its high organic load, its disposal is cost-prohibitive. In the present study, in order to assess the adequacy of RCW as a growth medium for lipid production, 18 strains of oleaginous yeasts were investigated in shaken flask for their growth and lipid-producing capabilities on this substrate. Among them, Cryptococcus curvatus NRRL Y-1511 and Cryptococcus laurentii UCD 68-201 adequately grew therein producing substantial amounts of lipids (6.8 and 5.1 g L− 1, respectively). A high similarity between the percent fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) composition of lipids from the former and the latter strain was found with a predominance of oleic acid (52.8 vs. 48.7%) and of total saturated fatty acids (37.9 vs. 40.8%). The subsequent scale transfer of the C. laurentii UCD 68-201 lipid production process on RCW to a 3-L STR led to significantly improved biomass and total lipid productions (14.4 and 9.9 g L− 1, respectively) with the biodiesel yield amounting to 32.6%. Although the C. laurentii FAME profile was modified upon process transfer, it resembled that of the Jatropha oil, a well established feedstock for biodiesel production. In conclusion, C. laurentii UCD 68-201, for which there is very limited amount of available information, turned out to be a very promising candidate for biodiesel production and wide margins of process improvement might be envisaged. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The emissions and the potential health effects of particulate matter (PM) were assessed from two heavy-duty trucks with and without emission control aftertreatment systems when operating on CARB ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) and three different biodiesel blends. The CARB ULSD was blended with soy-based biodiesel, animal fat biodiesel, and waste cooking oil biodiesel at 50 vol%. Testing was conducted over the EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) in triplicate for both trucks. The aftertreatment controls effectively decreased PM mass and number emissions, as well as the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) compared to the uncontrolled truck. Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) exhibited increases with the biodiesel blends, showing some feedstock dependency for the controlled truck. The oxidative potential of the emitted PM, measured by means of the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay, showed reductions with the use of biodiesel blends relative to CARB ULSD for the uncontrolled truck. Overall, the cellular responses to the particles from each fuel were reflective of the chemical content, i.e., particles from CARB ULSD were the most reactive and exhibited the highest cellular responses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Nutrient limitation, such as nitrogen depletion, is the most widely used method for improving microalgae fatty acid production; however, these harsh conditions also inhibit algal growth significantly and even kill cells at all. To avoid these problems, we used artificial microRNA (amiRNA) technology as a useful tool to manipulate metabolic pathways to increase fatty acid contents effectively in the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We down-regulated the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), which catalyzes the formation of oxaloacetate from phosphoenolpyruvate and regulates carbon flux. Results: amiRNAs against two CrPEPC genes were designed and transformed into Chlamydomonas cells and amiRNAs were induced by heat shock treatment. The transcription levels of amiRNAs increased 16-28 times, resulting in the remarkable decreases of the expression of CrPEPCs. In the end, inhibiting the expression of the CrPEPC genes dramatically increased the total fatty acid content in the transgenic algae by 28.7-48.6%, which mostly increased the content of C16-C22 fatty acids. Furthermore, the highest content was that of C18:3n3 with an average increase of 35.75%, while C20-C22 fatty acid content significantly increased by 85-160%. Conclusions: Overall our results suggest that heat shock treatment induced the expression of amiRNAs, which can effectively down-regulate the expression of CrPEPCs in C. reinhardtii, resulting in an increase of fatty acid synthesis with the most significant increase occurring for C16 to C22 fatty acids. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - A reduction in glycerol price has been observed in the last years, considering it is a byproduct of biodiesel production. This fact has motivated studies about alternative uses for this compound, as in pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass to produce ethanol, another biofuel of interest. In this context, glycerol acid-pretreatment of sugar cane bagasse (SCB) was evaluated in terms of temperature (80-120°C), solid loading (2.5-7.5%), glycerol (85-95%) and acid concentrations (0.5-3%), and reaction time (10-60 min), using a 25-1 factorial design. The cellulose digestibility was further optimized for the variables temperature (120-130°C), acid/SCB mass ratio (5-15%), and time (20-60 min). The optimal conditions were obtained at 130°C temperature, 15% acid/SCB mass ratio, and 57.5 min reaction time, yielding a 68.5% digestibility. Moreover, a considerable amount of ethanol, 0.38 g/g biomass (0.57 g/L·h of productivity), was achieved using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which also shows the efficacy of this pretreatment.

AB  - Background: Microalgae are promising sources of lipid triacylglycerol (TAG) for biodiesel production. However, to date, microalgal biodiesel is technically feasible, but not yet economically viable. Increasing TAG content and productivity are important to achieve economic viability of microalgal biodiesel. To increase TAG content, oleaginous microalga Neochloris oleoabundans was genetically engineered with an endogenous key enzyme diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (NeoDGAT2) responsible for TAG biosynthesis. Results: The integration of NeoDGAT2 expression cassettes in N. oleoabundans transformant was confirmed by PCR. The neutral lipid accumulation in the transformant detected by Nile red staining was accelerated and 1.9-fold higher than in wild type; the lipid bodies in the transformant visualized under fluorescence microscope were also larger. The NeoDGAT2 transcript was two-fold higher in the transformant than wild type. Remarkably higher lipid accumulation was found in the transformant than wild type: total lipid content increased 1.6-to 2.3-fold up to 74.5 ± 4.0% dry cell weight (DCW) and total lipid productivity increased 1.6- to 3.2-fold up to 14.6 ± 2.0 mg/L/day; while TAG content increased 1.8- to 3.2-fold up to 46.1 ± 1.6% DCW and TAG productivity increased 1.6- to 4.3-fold up to 8.9 ± 1.3 mg/L/day. A significantly altered fatty acid composition was detected in the transformant compared to wild type; the levels of saturated fatty acid C16:0 increased double to 49%, whereas C18:0 was reduced triple to 6%. Long-term stability was observed in the transformant continuously maintained in solid medium over 100 generations in a period of about 4 years. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the increased TAG content and productivity in N. oleoabundans by NeoDGAT2 overexpression that may offer the first step towards making microalgae an economically feasible source for biodiesel production. The strategy for genetically improved microalga presented in this study can be applied to other microalgal species possessing desired characteristics for industrial biofuel production. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The simultaneous conversion of cyclopentanone and m-cresol has been investigated on a series of solid-acid catalysts. Both compounds are representative of biomass-derived streams. Cyclopentanone can be readily obtained from sugar-derived furfurals through Piancatelli rearrangement under reducing conditions. Cresol represents a family of phenolic compounds, typically obtained from the depolymerization of lignin. In the first biomass conversion strategy proposed here, furfural is converted in high yields and selectivity to cyclopentanone (CPO) over metal catalysts such as Pd-Fe/SiO2 at 600 psi (∼4.14 MPa) H2 and 150 °C. Subsequently, CPO and cresol are further converted through acid-catalyzed hydroxyalkylation. This C−C coupling reaction may be used to generate products in the molecular weight range that is appropriate for transportation fuels. As molecules beyond this range may be undesirable for fuel production, a catalyst with a suitable porous structure may be advantageous for controlling the product distribution in the desirable range. If Amberlyst resins were used as a catalyst, C12–C24 products were obtained whereas when zeolites with smaller pore sizes were used, they selectively produced C10 products. Alternatively, CPO can undergo the acid-catalyzed self-aldol condensation to form C10 bicyclic adducts. As an illustration of the potential for practical implementation of this strategy for biofuel production, the long-chain oxygenates obtained from hydroxyalkylation/aldol condensation were successfully upgraded through hydrodeoxygenation to a mixture of linear alkanes and saturated cyclic hydrocarbons, which in practice would be direct drop-in components for transportation fuels. Aqueous acidic environments, which are typically encountered during the liquid-phase upgrading of bio-oils, would inhibit the efficiency of base-catalyzed processes. Therefore, the proposed acid-catalyzed upgrading strategy is advantageous for biomass conversion in terms of process simplicity. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Decomposition of biomass-derived alkaline-earth metal levulinate and formate salts above 700 K, commonly called thermal deoxygenation (TDO), has previously been demonstrated to produce deoxygenated crude oil at 80% of theoretical yield suitable for refining to gasoline, jet, and diesel fuel. Decomposition in thermogravimetric experiments involves low-temperature (423-623 K) and high-temperature reaction (623-723 K) regimes. The current work presents results of isothermal decomposition and infrared techniques which provide insights into the low-temperature, or Stage I, reactions. Stage I reactions are shown to be primarily addition/condensation reactions between levulinate ketone groups evolving water which equates to 8-15 wt % of the sample. These Stage I reactions account for one-third of theoretical oxygen removal of the levulinate and formate salts while also increasing the molecular weight of the organic fraction. Therefore, Stage I is an important reaction step in the TDO process. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this paper, the behavior of different types of biodiesel (from rapeseed, soybean, coconut and palm oils) in contact with different parts of a common rail injection system was evaluated. Stability tests were carried out by static immersion of test pieces in biodiesel at two different temperatures, 50ºC and 75ºC. After 15 days of immersion, interaction between pieces and biodiesel was evaluated considering two parameters: mass variation of pieces and biodiesel acid value (AV). A mass loss in both injector and pipes was found, no matter which biodiesel was used. In case soybean oil biodiesel was used, a slightly lower loss was achieved. On the other hand, coconut oil biodiesel showed a significant acid value increase with respect to the others. The temperature increase influenced mass loss and acid value increase. © 2017, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

AB  - Vinasse, main residue of the sugarcane industry, has high pollutant content, being subjected to the use in biogas production due to the high content of organic matter non-toxic to microbial action. For a consolidated process, it is necessary to study parameters that influence the process, in which the amount of inoculum is one of the major factors in the biological process of biogas production. This study investigated the influence of the amount of manure as inoculum (0.5 to 5.5%) during the biodigestion process, evaluating variables such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), pH, biogas production, methane concentration, total solids and total phosphorus and nitrogen contents, as well as microbiological analysis in the sludge remaining in the digester. Biodigestion occurred normally, with hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 20 days, with an acidogenic phase, subsequent stabilization of pH and biogas production. The vinasse had COD and total solids reduced during biodigestion by around 67 and 40%, respectively. Biogas production was increased after the fifth day. Among the three studied conditions, there was no significant increase in efficiency of inoculum use and it can be used the lowest amount, 0.5 % (m v-1). © 2017, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the effect of silicon fertilization on the growth of Jatropha curcas L. seedlings subjected to drought stress. The study was conducted in a greenhouse at the State University of Goiás on the Ipameri Campus, Goiás state, using eight-liter pots containing a substrate of red-yellow latosol, sand and manure at a ratio of 3:1:0.5, respectively. A completely randomized 5x2 factorial design was applied (plants irrigated every day with a water volume corresponding to 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % evapotranspiration and foliar feeding of Si at concentrations of 0 and 1 g L-1, applied on April 29 and May 6, 2016, in a volume of 30 ml/plant/application), with four repetitions and a single genotype per pot. Drought stress treatment was imposed on April 29, 2016, when the plants were 60 days old, and lasted 13 days. Water availability directly affected plant growth. Regardless of Si dose, biomass accumulation, number of leaves, stem diameter and leaf area exhibited a linear decline proportional to the decrease in water supply. The reduction in the leaf mass ratio, number of leaves and leaf area occurs because water is needed to initiate and expand leaf primordia. The high stomatal sensitivity of Jatropha curcas combined with the reduced biomass partitioned among the leaves contributed to decreasing transpiration and maintaining water status. The Si doses did not alleviate the water shortage in Jatropha curcas plants. Jatropha curcas plants are drought tolerant and capable of delaying the dehydration of tissue and partitioning assimilates for root growth.

AB  - With growing concerns about environmental pollution caused by automobiles, biofuels containing oxygen – also known as oxygenates – are being researched very rigorously. In this article, we have inspected the use of isopropanol/gasoline blends, as fuel in a 4 – cylinder Spark Ignition engine with Multi-Point Fuel Injection System. Isopropanol was mixed with Unleaded Gasoline in proportions of 10, 20 and 30% by volume (IPA10, IPA20 and IPA30). It is found that with the use of isopropanol/gasoline blends in Spark Ignition Engine, Brake Thermal Efficiency and NOx emissions increased whereas carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions decreased. When the spark timing was retarded by 2 degrees, it was found that isopropanol/gasoline blends emitted lower NOx emissions than those at original spark timing. Isopropanol blends also increased the in-cylinder pressure values and heat release rate values. © 2016 Karabuk University

AB  - This study evaluates the ability of biostimulation to enhance the bioremediation of soil contaminated with oily compounds as compared with natural attenuation. The soil was contaminated with 4% of diesel or biodiesel and biostimulated with phycocyanin (a proteic emulsifier extracted from the Spirulina platensis biomass), an inactive biomass of S. platensis, or ammonium sulfate. Experiments were conducted for 60 days, whereas the biodegradation was measured through the determination of carbon dioxide (CO2) evolution and oils and grease. Higher CO2 evolution was observed in the soil contaminated with the biodiesel and phycocyanin as biostimulant (2,997.35 mg C-CO2) and in the soil contaminated with diesel oil with the inactive biomass S. platensis as biostimulant (2,454.89 mg C-CO2). The highest biodegradation was achieved by using phycocyanin as a biostimulant for biodiesel contamination (88.75%) or inactive biomass of S. platensis (63.89%) for diesel as contaminant. Natural attenuation resulted in the lower CO2 evolution of 386.5 and 282.5 mg C-CO2 and biodegradation rates of 42.4 and 31.3% for biodiesel and diesel, respectively. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - This paper presents a review of the literature available on biofuels production through different chemical catalytic routes. Biofuels are promising alternative to the fast-depleting fossil fuel and oil reserves. In consideration of the existing environmental issues, such as greenhouse effect and global warming, researchers are now interested in biofuels production from biomass. Biofuels are produced from renewable and sustainable bioresources, which are available globally in the form of residual agricultural biomass and wastes. However, the biofuels production process through chemical transformation could be very expensive and uneconomical for large-scale commercial supply. Hence, there is a continuous need for improvisation on the research on this topic. This review broadly describes the different types of biofuels and the processes for their production through catalytic routes.

AB  - Abstract: Butanol is not only an important chemical intermediate and solvent in pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries, but also considered as an advanced biofuel. Although species of the natural host Clostridium have been engineered, butanol titers in the anaerobe seem to be limited by its intolerance to butanol less than 13 g/L. Here we aimed to develop a technology for enhancing butanol production by a co-culture system with butyrate fermentative supernatant addition. First, when adding 4.0 g/L butyrate into the acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation broth with single-shot at 24 h, the “acid crash” phenomenon occurred and the ABE fermentation performance deteriorated. Subsequently, we found that adding certain amino acids could effectively enhance butyrate re-assimilation, butanol tolerance and titer (from 11.1 to 14.8 g/L). Additionally, in order to decrease the raw material cost, butyrate fermentative supernatant produced by Clostridium tyrobutyricum was applied to butanol production in the Clostridium acetobutylicum/Saccharomyces cerevisiae co-culture system, instead of adding synthetic butyrate. Final butanol and total ABE concentrations reached higher levels of 16.3 and 24.8 g/L with increments of 46.8 and 37.8%, respectively. These results show that the proposed fermentation strategy has great potential for efficiently butanol production with an economic approach.

AB  - This work evaluates experimentally on a comparative basis the effects of using three customary biofuels on the cyclic variability (irregularity) of combustion and emissions balance in a single-cylinder, light-duty, direct-injection diesel engine run at three loads. Blends of fossil diesel with up to 15% (by volume) ethanol and 24% n-butanol or diethyl ether (DEE) are investigated. Related experimental study including heat release diagrams reported by the authors for these blends in the same engine disclosed the differentiation in performance and emissions of these biofuel blends from running the engine with neat fossil diesel. Given that low ignition quality fuels, as the present biofuels, mainly at high blending ratios may give rise to unstable engine functioning and hence detrimental performance, this work examines on a comparative basis the strength of combustion cycle-to-cycle variations as revealed in the measured cylinder pressure diagrams. The latter are analyzed with respect to maximum pressures, maximum rates of pressure rise, mean effective pressures (indicated), and ignition delays, by using statistical tools for mean values and coefficients of variation. Apart from the examination and interpretation of the engine stability results, this study also explores the balance of all four regulated exhaust emissions, namely the defeat of the smoke-nitrogen oxides trade-off and the interesting carbon monoxide-unburned hydrocarbons adverse coupling (trade-off) realized when alcohols or diethyl ether are used in the blends. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The need for renewable environmentally friendly energy resources is growing every day. Biodiesel is one of the most promising alternatives to the conventional non-renewable energy resources. Heterogeneous catalysts proved a high efficiency in the transesterification of oils to produce biodiesel. In this research, activated carbon was tested as a heterogeneous catalyst in the transesterification of two non-edible oils (waste cooking oil and Jatropha oil) with methanol to produce biodiesel. Activated carbon was characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and Fourier transformed infrared. The effect of different operating parameters, namely operation time (30, 60, 120 and 180 min), alcohol-to-oil molar ratio (4:1, 6:1, 8:1 and 10:1), catalyst loading [0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 5% (w/w)] and rotational speed (100, 200, 300 and 400 rpm), was investigated. Results showed that increasing the operational time, the alcohol-to-oil molar ratio and the catalyst loading increases the conversion to biodiesel but only to some extent; increasing the stirring rate was found to be beneficial to the process. The optimum conditions were found to be 2 h of heating, 6:1 alcohol-to-oil ratio, 1 wt% catalyst loading and 400 rpm stirring. Under optimum conditions, the conversion to biodiesel reached 93.95 and 93.27% for the waste cooking oil and the Jatropha oil, respectively. The properties of the obtained biodiesel (density, viscosity, flash point, pour point and cloud point) were measured giving promising results. © 2016, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - A series of starting tests was conducted on a turbocharged diesel engine to investigate combustion instability for various coolant temperatures, ranging from 20 to 80°C, and fuel blends (neat diesel, blend of diesel with 30% biodiesel, and blend of diesel with 25% n-butanol). A statistical analysis was performed in order to quantify the effects of the coolant temperature and fuel properties on the extent of the instability phenomena. As expected, the engine thermal status was found to play an influencing role, with cold starting leading to combustion instability; a difference up to 38 bar between successive cycles was documented. The biodiesel blend exhibited higher instability and the n-butanol one showed higher absolute pressures but somewhat more stable operation. Both biofuel blends led to higher in-cylinder pressure irregularities compared to the neat diesel operation. For all examined blends, instability phenomena were still apparent even after several seconds from the engine start-up. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Biodiesel production in the U.S. from vegetable oils has increased substantially during the past decade. However, its further increase is limited by the low amounts of oil produced per hectare from temperate oilseed crops. Recently novel transgenic sugarcane has been developed to accumulate both sugars and lipids in stems, making it a promising dual-purpose feedstock to produce both ethanol and biodiesel. In this study, two lines of the transgenic lipid producing sugarcane (lipid-cane) and the non-transformed sugarcane were characterized and processed. The total lipid concentrations were 0.7%, 0.9% and 1.3% for the non-transformed sugarcane and lipid-cane lines19B and 25 C, respectively. Lipid composition analysis showed that about 31–33% of the total lipids were triacylglycerols, main feedstock for biodiesel production, for the lipid-cane samples, while this value was only 5% for the non-transformed sugarcane. By processing the sugarcane stems with a juicer, about 90% of the sugars and 60% of the lipids were extracted with juice. The extracted sugars in juice were fermented to ethanol and the lipids were later recovered from the fermented juice using organic solvents. The recovered lipids from the fermented juice were 0.3, 0.5 and 0.8 g/100 g dry stem for the non-transformed sugarcane and lipid-cane lines 19B and 25 C, respectively. This study proved the concept of the lipid and sugar coproduction from the novel lipid-cane, which have a potential to make a large-scale replacement of fossil derived fuel without unrealistic demands on land area. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study evaluated the concentration profiles of regulated and unregulated pollutants emitted from a stationary diesel engine cycle, operating at the speed of 1800 rpm and 0% load, using biofuels and binary blends. The experimental test considered fuel burning time on three different periods and storage times. The operation of the engine when it is still cold, for example at 15 minutes, showed negative effect on particulate matter (PM), benzene and ethylbenzene emissions in pure soybean biodiesel (B100) compared to the blend of diesel with 5% biodiesel (B5). Regarding to the concentration of mono aromatics, aliphatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), this study showed similar results to those reported in the literature, where B5 fuel emits more pollutants than pure biodiesel. However, comparing some pollutants individually, benzene and ethylbenzene emissions were higher for B100 and pure soybean biodiesel with butil-hydroxyanisol additive (B100 Adt). The B5 showed the highest concentration profile for the PAH sum in the gaseous and particulate phases in longer engine operation periods. © 2017 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.

AB  - Abstract: This study investigates the retention of biodiesel in residual clayey soil during biostimulation by nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) under conditions of rainfall infiltration. Several column tests were conducted in a laboratory under different void ratios (1.14, 1.24, and 1.34), varying moisture contents (15, 25, and 35%), and in both the presence and absence of biostimulation. The volume of biodiesel (which was equivalent to the volume of voids in the soil) was placed atop the soil and allowed to percolate for a period of 15 days. The soil was subjected to different rainfall infiltration conditions (0.30 or 60 mm). The greatest reductions in residual contaminants occurred after 60 mm of rain simulation, at values of up to 74% less than in samples with the same conditions but no precipitation. However, the residual contamination decay rate was greater with 0–30 mm (0.29 g/mm) of precipitation than with 30–60 mm (0.075 g/mm). Statistical assessment revealed that increased moisture and the presence of nutrients were the factors with the most powerful effect on contaminant retention in the soil. The residual contaminant level was 21 g/kg at a moisture content of 15% and no precipitation, decreasing to 12 g/kg at 35% moisture and no precipitation. Accordingly, it is possible to conclude that biostimulation and rainfall infiltration conditions can decrease the retention of contaminants in soil and allow a greater leaching or spreading of the contamination. All of these phenomena are worthy of careful examination for the in situ bioremediation of organic contamination. Highlights: • The higher moisture in the soil, due to a high initial moisture content and/or infiltration of rainfall, can reduce contaminant retention, • The use of biostimulation through the addition of nutrients to accelerate the biodegradation of toxic organic contaminants may induce inadvertent undesirable interactions between the soil and the contaminant. • When adopting biostimulation for bioremediation, the effects of rainfall should be addressed; ideally, it should be prevented from entering the affected site, in order to avoid increased contaminant leaching and potential spreading. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The adverse effects of petrodiesel exhaust exposure on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems are well recognized. While biofuels such as rapeseed methyl ester (RME) biodiesel may have ecological advantages, the exhaust generated may cause adverse health effects. In the current study, we investigated the responses of bioactive lipid mediators in human airways after biodiesel exhaust exposure using lipidomic profiling methods. Lipid mediator levels in lung lavage were assessed following 1-h biodiesel exhaust (average particulate matter concentration, 159 μg/m3) or filtered air exposure in 15 healthy individuals in a double-blinded, randomized, controlled, crossover study design. Bronchoscopy was performed 6 h post exposure and lung lavage fluids, i.e., bronchial wash (BW) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), were sequentially collected. Mass spectrometry methods were used to detect a wide array of oxylipins (including eicosanoids), endocannabinoids, N-acylethanolamines, and related lipid metabolites in the collected BW and BAL samples. Six lipids in the human lung lavage samples were altered following biodiesel exhaust exposure, three from BAL samples and three from BW samples. Of these, elevated levels of PGE2, 12,13-DiHOME, and 13-HODE, all of which were found in BAL samples, reached Bonferroni-corrected significance. This is the first study in humans reporting responses of bioactive lipids following biodiesel exhaust exposure and the most pronounced responses were seen in the more peripheral and alveolar lung compartments, reflected by BAL collection. Since the responsiveness and diagnostic value of a subset of the studied lipid metabolites were established in lavage fluids, we conclude that our mass spectrometry profiling method is useful to assess effects of human exposure to vehicle exhaust. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - The study represents a comprehensive analysis of engine exhaust emission variation from a compression ignition (CI) diesel engine fueled with diesel-biodiesel blends. Biodiesel used in this investigation was produced through transesterification procedure from Moringa oleifera oil. A single cylinder, four-stroke, water-cooled, naturally aspirated diesel engine was used for this purpose. The pollutants from the exhaust of the engine that are monitored in this study are nitrogen oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), and smoke opacity. Engine combustion and performance parameters are also measured together with exhaust emission data. Some researchers have reported that the reason for higher NO emission of biodiesel is higher prompt NO formation. The use of antioxidant-treated biodiesel in a diesel engine is a promising approach because antioxidants reduce the formation of free radicals, which are responsible for the formation of prompt NO during combustion. Two different antioxidant additives namely 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT) and 2,2′-methylenebis(4-methyl-6-tert-butylphenol) (MBEBP) were individually dissolved at a concentration of 1% by volume in MB30 (30% moringa biodiesel with 70% diesel) fuel blend to investigate and compare NO as well as other emissions. The result shows that both antioxidants reduced NO emission significantly; however, HC, CO, and smoke were found slightly higher compared to pure biodiesel blends, but not more than the baseline fuel diesel. The result also shows that both antioxidants were quite effective in reducing peak heat release rate (HRR) and brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) as well as improving brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and oxidation stability. Based on this study, antioxidant-treated M. oleifera biodiesel blend (MB30) can be used as a very promising alternative source of fuel in diesel engine without any modifications. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - We studied the impact of blending pentanol, a next generation biofuel, with cashew nut shell biodiesel on its performance and emissions characteristics in a constant speed compression ignition engine. Our main objective was to reduce CO, HC, NOX and smoke emission when fueled with neat cashew nut shell biodiesel and the pentanol blends. Cashew nut shell oil is a byproduct from cashew nut industry. Since it is nonedible, it can be used as a promising alternative. Conventional transesterification process was used to convert the cashew nut shell oil into cashew nut shell biodiesel. Pentanol with 98.4% purity was used as an oxygenated additive. The experiment involved three test fuels: neat cashew nut shell biodiesel (C100), Pentanol blended with cashew nut shell biodiesel by 10% volume (C90P10) and Pentanol blended with cashew nut shell biodiesel by 20% volume (C80P20). The feasibility of using neat biofuel (without adding diesel) was also investigated. Experimental work concluded that the test fuels used in this study does not require any modification in engines. In addition, the combustion of fuels was smooth and there was no physical and visible damage in the engine components when fueled with cashew nut shell biodiesel and the pentanol blends. By adding 10% and 20% of pentanol to cashew nut shell biodiesel, significant reduction in CO, HC, NOX and smoke emission was observed. In addition, brake thermal efficiency increased marginally with slight reduction in brake specific fuel consumption. © 2017, Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers, Seoul, Korea.

AB  - Vegetable oils are the primary raw materials used in biodiesel production; however, they usually present oxidative stabilities inferior to the EN 14214 specifications. An alternative to improve the oxidative quality of vegetable oil biodiesel is blending it with animal fat biodiesel. In this paper, we studied the oxidative degradation of soybean/beef-tallow biodiesel (SB) 70/30 and 50/50 (w/w) during long-term storage. Soybean biodiesel (SO) was used as a control sample. The biodiesel samples were stored for 350 days and analyzed periodically via oxidative stability, tocopherol content, peroxide value, polar compounds, and kinematic viscosity. The results showed that SB 70/30 and 50/50 biodiesel samples presented higher oxidative stabilities than SO biodiesel. Additionally, the blends met the limits proposed by EN 14214 for oxidative stability (8 h). During long-term storage, the SB biodiesel showed greater resistance to oxidative degradation, which was indicated by the lower formation of hydroperoxides and polar compounds. Similarly, the decline in the tocopherol content was slower in SB biodiesel. Blends of soybean and beef-tallow biodiesel at levels of 70/30 and 50/50 are, therefore, proper alternatives to improve the oxidative quality of this biofuel. © 2017, AOCS.

AB  - Camelina sativa is an old world crop newly introduced to the semi-arid regions of the Southwestern US. Recently, Camelina gained attention as a biofuel feedstock crop due to its relatively high oil content, polyunsaturated fatty acids, very short growing season with fairly good adaption to marginal lands, and low input agricultural systems. To expand Camelina growing zones into more arid regions, it is important to develop new drought resistant cultivars that can grow under water-limited conditions. Plants having cuticles with low permeability to water can possess elevated dehydration avoidance and improved drought tolerance. To extend our understating of cuticle chemical composition among Camelina species, leaf wax and cutin monomers in seventeen accessions representing four Camelina species were analyzed. Camelina exhibited a wide range of wax and cutin contents. The primary alcohols and alkanes were the predominant classes of leaf wax, followed in abundance by wax esters, fatty acids, aldehydes, alkylguaiacols, methylalkylresorcinols, α-amyrin and ß-sitosterol. Among primary alcohols, the dominant constituents were the C24, C26 and C28 homologues, while the C31 homologue was the most abundant alkane among all Camelina accessions. Cutin monomers included monohydroxy monobasic acids, phenolics, monobasic acids, monohydroxy epoxymonobasic acids, and dibasic acids. Among the cutin monomers examined, the C16:0 diOH acid showed extensive variation among Camelina species. © 2017

AB  - Due to the adverse effects of fossil fuel use, it is becoming increasingly important to produce next-generation biofuels from renewable, sustainable sources. Filamentous N2-fixing strains of cyanobacteria have emerged as promising industrial microorganisms capable of producing a range biofuels and chemicals using CO2, water, and sunlight. In this study, a life cycle analysis (LCA) was conducted on a hypothetical production facility that uses a genetically engineered strain of filamentous cyanobacteria to produce the cyclic hydrocarbon limonene. Two scenarios were evaluated in which the only difference between the scenarios was the limonene productivity of the engineered cyanobacteria strain. In Scenario 1, the cyanobacterium was assumed to produce limonene at a rate of 1.8 mg/L/h, resulting in an annual production of 32,727 L/yr of limonene. In Scenario 2, limonene productivity was 55.5 mg/L/h, resulting in annual production of 1,000,000 L/yr. Both scenarios were assumed to produce the same amount of cellular biomass, that was converted to biogas by anaerobic digestion and the biogas was converted by gas turbines into electricity to power the facility. Excess electricity was assumed to be sold to the grid. The major environmental burdens of the facility, which were measured in eco-points and calculated based on the Eco-indicator 99 method, were the cyanobacteria nutrient supply (especially sodium nitrate) and the photobioreactor (PBR) electrical requirements. The lower output of limonene in Scenario 1 meant that less energy was required for product recovery, leaving more electricity for sale to the grid. Even though a higher limonene productivity will worsen the environmental profile of the process, both scenarios described in this study have less of a negative environmental impact than biodiesel production. This study strongly suggests both scenarios of the theoretical limonene production facility described herein holds great potential as a future solution for producing next-generation biofuels directly from solar energy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this research was to optimize the energy recovery in the form of biodiesel and biogas from ubiquitous Spirulina platensis microalgae. Investigations were undertaken to select appropriate cell disruption technique, organic solvent for lipid recovery and catalyst for transesterification reaction for biodiesel production from Spirulina platensis. Based on energy considerations, osmotic shock was the most suitable cell disruption technique which recorded highest lipid recovery yield of 8.9% when chloroform/methanol (1:2 v/v) was used as solvent. The extracted lipid from Spirulina platensis was esterified into Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (biodiesel) using sulfuric acid as the catalyst with conversion up to 79.5%. Under these conditions, biodiesel yield of 7.1% (based on biomass weight) was obtained. Investigations also brought out that the lipid-extracted residue can be used as feedstock for biogas production with the average methane yield of about 290 ml/gVS. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Current trends in diesel transport anticipate that in the upcoming future a range of renewable fuels will be necessary to comply with emission and sustainability legislations. Exhaust after-treatment devices such as diesel particulate filters –DPFs– will have to operate satisfactorily with this pool of biofuels. In particular, DPF regeneration is crucial to cut the fuel penalty and guarantee an acceptable lifetime for this device. In the present work, an automotive diesel engine was run with fossil fuel and three renewable fuels: a conventional biodiesel, a fuel manufactured through Fischer-Tropsch –FT– process and a HVO biofuel. The DPF was loaded and regenerated through an active process with fuel post-injections. Additionally, soot samples were investigated with thermo-gravimetry (TGA) and calorimetry (DSC) to confirm whether these techniques obtain relevant information for explaining DPF behavior. Both methods proved that biodiesel leads to a more economical regeneration being the biodiesel soot, more reactive than the other samples, the main reason. DPF regenerations with paraffinic fuels (FT-derived and HVO) did not reveal strong differences compared to diesel, though TGA and DSC results suggested that soot from paraffinic biofuels is more reactive than that from diesel. The exhaust gas temperature and composition are behind this apparent discrepancy. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Micro algae are promising attractive energy carriers. Their biomass productivity is 5–30 times higher than that of first and second generation biomass. Additionally, they utilize CO2 for their photosynthetic process thereby protects possibly the environment and contributes towards CO2 remediation at higher rates. Their cultivation can be combined with wastewater and industrial effluents which consequently leads to the bioremediation of inorganic elements more effectively. Among the conversion technologies for the biofuel production from the micro algal biomass, thermochemical conversion is an enduring sustainable alternative path in the view of engineering as this process utilizes all kinds of the biochemical moieties from the micro algal biomass cellular constitution. This article reviews the bio moieties of micro algal biomass, and subsequent use of them in thermochemical liquefaction (TCL) technologies like pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) for the extraction of liquid fuels and upgrading of bio-oil processes via decarbonylation, decarboxylation (DCO) and hydrogenation for palmitic/oleic using suitable catalysts viz activated carbon with noble metals &amp; cost-effective tungsten based catalysts. These two technically feasible processes in an appropriate technical downstream path are dependent on the oil upgrading process. Moreover, a comparative study of pyrolysis and HTL processes has been evaluated towards the challenges and opportunities of a commercial-scale microalgae-to-fuels process in the consideration for mitigating technical, environmental, and logistical concern. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The performance (activity, selectivity and stability) of a Pt-Pd catalyst supported on a phosphorus-containing activated carbon (ACP) has been studied in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of raw bio-oil, and compared with another bifunctional catalyst prepared with a FCC (Fluid Catalytic Cracking) catalyst as acid support. Experiments have been carried out in a fixed bed reactor under the following conditions: 400–450 °C; 65 bar; space time, 0.18 gcat h g−1 bio-oil; H2:bio-oil ratio, 20 cm3 H2 (STP) cm−3 bio-oil; time on stream, 0–10 h. The catalyst reaches a pseudo-steady state at 450 °C after 6 h of time on stream, preserving a constant activity as a consequence of the simultaneous formation and hydrocracking of the deposited coke. In these conditions, the yield of C5+ hydrocarbons is 20 wt%. This organic liquid fraction mainly contains aromatics, and thus, it may require an additional mild hydrocracking treatment for its valorization as fuel. On the other hand, the gas fraction obtained can be used directly as fuel, and the aqueous liquid fraction (with a high concentration of methanol, 58 wt%) is interesting as co-feedstock with methanol in a methanol to olefins (MTO) unit. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mesoporous nanocrystal HZSM-5 were successfully synthesized by hydrothermal crystallization during 24 h, at 130 °C with CTAB and TPABr as the templates. The template removing process of as-synthesized sample was studied by TG/DSC. Characterization by modern techniques as XRD, SEM, TEM and TPD-NH3 has showed that the obtained catalyst is highly crystalline with uniformly nanocrystal size. This product has mesoporous sieves which are neatly ordered with diameters around 30 Å high BET surface area of 495 m2/g and great acidity. These advantages give the mesoporous nanocrytal ZSM-5 catalyst the applicability in the process of cracking waste oil for green fuel due to the shape—selective advantage for large size molecules in waste vegetable oil. The results of waste vegetable oil catalytic cracking reaction has officially confirmed this identification. The production of green diesel has good quality, meets the technical and environmental standards. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - In this present work, the disposal of waste frying oil was explored. The experiment tests were performed under nitrogen (N2) atmosphere at 5 °C/min heating rate from the ambient temperature to 500 °C. In these operating conditions, the obtained pyrolitic liquid fraction was 76 wt% formed by 63.87 wt% of crude bio-oil and 12.13 wt% of aqueous fraction. The chemical characterization using FTIR, GC, and GC/MS has revealed that the bio-oil is a complex chemical mixture of linear saturated, unsaturated, and cyclic hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds such as carboxylic acids, ketones, aldehydes, and alcohols. Moreover, the produced bio-oil can be considered as promising fuel with high calorific value (∼39 MJ/kg). However, the higher acidity (∼125 mg KOH/g sample) and viscosity (9.53 cSt at 40 °C) limit currently its direct use in engines. Therefore, although several promising results, further investigations are requested to improve the bio-oil quality in order to find an environmentally friendly issue to waste frying oil. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Biofuels are considered as eco-friendly fuels and can readily replace fossil fuels while helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable rural development. Although Algeria is an oil producer and exporter, the development of renewable energies is a strategic goal for public authorities, which are giving new impetus to this sector to replace the fossil energy resources of which are becoming increasingly scarce. In this context, the life-cycle assessment (LCA) of a second-generation biodiesel derived from Ricinus communis feedstock is undertaken. LCA is a tool that can be used effectively in evaluating various renewable energy sources for their sustainability and can help policy makers to choose the optimal energy source for specific purpose. The life cycle of Castor bean-based biodiesel production includes the stages of cultivation, oil extraction, and biodiesel production. The impact categories studied were global warming, Energy return-on-energy investment (EROEI), human health, and ecosystem. We have used the impact 2002 + evaluation method which is implemented in the SimaPro© software package. Moreover, it is the most useful method for identifying and measuring the impact of industrial products on the environment. Results show that among all the production stages, the cultivation process of Ricinus communis and the conversion of oil to biodiesel are the largest contributors to most of environmental impact categories. Life-cycle analysis revealed that the use of castor for biodiesel production could have many advantages like an energy return-on-energy investment (EROEI) of 2.60 and a positive contribution to climate-change reduction as revealed by a positive carbon balance. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - One of the main concerns of humankind in the last years is the availability of energy sources. Research has been focused on finding clean and renewable ways to satisfy the energy demand worldwide. In the particular case of the state of Guanajuato, Mexico, clay industry burns each year about 15,000 m3 of fuel oil and residual oils, and 96,000 t of wood derivatives. As a way to reduce the environmental impact of clay industry, the use of solid fuel pellets, obtained from vegetable residual material, is proposed. The raw material for the pellets is obtained from agribusiness and from the cities of the state. The solid biofuel has high density, low content of humidity, a homogeneous shape and high energy density. Nevertheless, special care must be taken about the location of the production facility and hubs, in order to make the production of the biofuel economically feasible. Furthermore, to have an environmentally friendly fuel, the supply chain and the production process must minimize the global environmental impact. In this work, a mathematical programming model is proposed to determinate the optimal location of the production facilities, the hubs, and the best distribution logistics. The problem is modelled using a general disjunctive programming approach, and then relaxed into a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. It has been determined that the main plant should be located in the city of Irapuato, while secondary plants must be established in the cities of León, Irapuato, Abasolo and Salamanca. Moreover, it has been estimated that, when the residual biomass is converted into pellets, about 72,548 t/year of equivalent CO2 are avoided in the main plant, together with 24,182 of equivalent CO2 avoided per secondary facility. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The cost of supplying wood biomass from forestry operations in remote areas has been an obstacle to expansion of forest-based bioenergy in much of the western United States. Economies of scale in the production of liquid fuels from lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks favor large centralized biorefineries. Increasing transportation efficiency through torrefaction and pelletization at distributed satellite facilities may serve as a means to expand the utilization of forestry residuals in biofuel production. To investigate this potential, a mixed-integer linear program was developed to optimize the feedstock supply chain design with and without distributed pretreatment. The model uses techno-economic assessment of scale-dependent biomass pretreatment processes from existing literature and multimodal biomass transportation cost evaluations derived from a spatially explicit network analysis as input. In addition, the sensitivity of the optimal system configuration was determined for variations of key input parameters including the production scale of pretreatment facilities, road and rail transportation costs, and feedstock procurement costs. Torrefaction and densification were found to reduce transportation costs by $0.84 per GJ and overall delivered costs by $0.24 per GJ, representing 14.5% and 5.2% cost reductions compared to feedstock collection without pretreatment. Significant uncertainties remain in terms of the costs associated with deploying torrefaction equipment at the scales modeled, but the level of potential cost savings suggests further analysis and development of these alternatives. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Brazil is considered one of the world’s leading producers of biofuels given the predominance of ethanol fuel in its energy matrix. However, despite the prominence of Brazil in ethanol production, the vast majority of biodiesel production plants in Brazil use methanol instead of ethanol as the alcohol for transesterification reaction, as is generally the case in the rest of the world. The aim of this paper is therefore to examine the transesterification process in the Brazilian biodiesel production in terms of sustainability. In this regard, it was necessary to evaluate the way in which the industrial process is currently carried out, the role of government incentives or subsidies for the use of ethanol to produce biodiesel, and the investments of companies in technology development for the same purpose. This study presents indications that the development of the biodiesel market in Brazil is still oriented toward a production model which is inconsistent with the environmental and social aspects of sustainability. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The influence of two oxygenated tailor-made fuels on soot formation and oxidation in an optical single cylinder research diesel engine has been studied. For the investigation a planar laser-induced incandescence (PLII) measurement technique was applied to the engine in order to detect and evaluate the planar soot distribution for the two bio fuels within a laser light sheet. Furthermore the OH* chemiluminescence and broad band soot luminosity was visualized by high speed imaging to compare the ignition and combustion behavior of tested fuels: Two C8 oxygenates, di-n-butylether (DNBE) and 1-octanol. Both fuels have the same molecular formula but differ in their molecular structure. DNBE ignites fast and burns mostly diffusive while 1-octanol has a low cetane number and therefore it has a longer ignition delay but a more homogeneous mixture at time of ignition. The two bio fuels were finally compared to conventional diesel fuel. The heat release reactions after ignition by means of the OH* chemiluminescence showed the fast igniting behavior of DNBE, with soot formation being delayed. The soot formation for DNBE was very similar to that of conventional diesel fuel. However, the amount of soot formed is lower and starts oxidizing earlier in the cycle according to the PLII signal. The OH* chemiluminescence signal of 1-octanol on the other hand shows a rapid burn out in the combustion chamber. Due to the homogenous mixture, hardly any soot formation takes place. © 2017 SAE International.

AB  - We describe a study to identify potential biofuels that enable advanced spark ignition (SI) engine efficiency strategies to be pursued more aggressively. A list of potential biomass-derived blendstocks was developed. An online database of properties and characteristics of these bioblendstocks was created and populated. Fuel properties were determined by measurement, model prediction, or literature review. Screening criteria were developed to determine if a bioblendstock met the requirements for advanced SI engines. Criteria included melting point (or cloud point) < -10°C and boiling point (or T90) <165°C. Compounds insoluble or poorly soluble in hydrocarbon were eliminated from consideration, as were those known to cause corrosion (carboxylic acids or high acid number mixtures) and those with hazard classification as known or suspected carcinogens or reproductive toxins. Compounds predicted to be less anaerobically biodegradable than methyl-tert-butyl ether with water solubility greater than 10,000 mg/L were also eliminated. A minimum Research octane number (RON) of 98 was applied. These criteria produced a list of 40 bioblendstocks with promising properties. Additional property data, including Motor octane number (MON), heat of vaporization, and lower heating value, were acquired for these bioblendstocks. A subset of the bioblendstocks representing all functional groups were blended into gasoline or a gasoline surrogate to measure their effect on vapor pressure, distillation curve, oxidation stability, RON, and MON. For blending into a conventional or reformulated blendstock for E10 blending, ethanol, 2-butanol, isobutanol, and diisobutylene have the most desirable properties for blending of a high-octane advanced SI engine fuel. © 2017, SAE International.

AB  - The biofuel and engine co-development framework was initiated at Sandia National Labs. Here, the synthetic biologists develop and engineer a new platform for drop-in fuel production from lignocellulosic biomass, using several endophytic fungi. Hence this process has the potential advantage that expensive pretreatment and fuel refining stages can be optimized thereby allowing scalability and cost reduction; two major considerations for widespread biofuel utilization. Large concentrations of ketones along with other volatile organic compounds were produced by fungi grown over switchgrass media. The combustion and emission properties of these new large ketones are poorly known. Therefore, fundamental measurements of representative molecules are needed to provide feedback on their desirability in advanced combustion engines (e.g., HCCI: homogeneous charge compression ignition engines) and their impact on emissions, as well as other combustion devices such as micro-combustors. 2,4-Dimethyl-3-pentanone, also known as diisopropyl ketone (DIPK), is a promising candidate biofuel for automotive applications produced by the fungal conversion process. Laminar burning velocity (LBV) is an important fundamental property of a fuel/air mixture and it depends on the composition, temperature, and pressure. Therefore, the knowledge of the dependence of the laminar burning velocity on above mentioned parameters can be used to design advanced engines as it can affect efficiency and heat release rates. We provide LBV measurements for DIPK, using the University of Central Florida (UCF) spherical flame chamber connected to a modified spark plug. Both pressure and direct flame visualization (shadowgraph) were utilized to ensure that the flame is spherical and stable (no cellular structure was observed within the flame) in order to provide reliable results with the constant volume approach. LBV measurements were also performed in iso-octane (C8H18), a relatively well characterized fuel, in order to validate our facility and measurement technique. The LBV results of C8H18/air and DIPK/air mixtures are compared with several oxygenated fuels in the literature and numerical values predicted by two chemical kinetic mechanisms. © 2017 SAE International.

AB  - The production of biodiesel has emerged as an alternative to fossil fuels. However, this industry generates glycerol as a by-product in such large quantities that it has become an environmental problem. The biotransformation of this excess glycerol into other renewable bio-energy sources, like H2 and ethanol, by microorganisms such as Escherichia coli is an interesting possibility that warrants investigation. In this work we hypothesized that the conversion of oxaloacetate (OAA) to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) could be improved by a controlled expression of the human mitochondrial GTP-dependent PEP carboxykinase. This heterologous expression was tested in several E. coli mutant backgrounds with increased availability of C4 intermediates. It was found that this metabolic rewiring improved the synthesis of the target products in several mutants, with the dcuD mutant being the most suitable background for hydrogen and ethanol specific productions and glycerol consumption. These factors increased by 2.46, 1.73 and 1.95 times, respectively, when compared to those obtained for the wild-type strain. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although the United States has pursued rapid development of corn ethanol as a matter of national biofuel policy, relatively little is known about this policy's widespread impacts on agricultural land conversion surrounding ethanol refineries. This knowledge gap impedes policy makers' ability to identify and mitigate potentially negative environmental impacts of ethanol production. We assessed changes to the landscape during initial implementation of the Renewable Fuel Standard v2 (RFS2) from 2008 to 2012 and found nearly 4.2 million acres of arable non-cropland converted to crops within 100 miles of refinery locations, including 3.6 million acres of converted grassland. Aggregated across all ethanol refineries, the rate of grassland conversion to cropland increased linearly with proximity to a refinery location. Despite this widespread conversion of the landscape, recent cropland expansion could have made only modest contributions to mandated increases in conventional biofuel capacity required by RFS2. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a shortcoming in the existing 'aggregate compliance' method for enforcing land protections in the RFS2 and suggest an alternative monitoring mechanism would be needed to appropriately capture the scale of observed land use changes. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background: Acetyl-triacylglycerols (acetyl-TAGs) are unusual triacylglycerol (TAG) molecules that contain an sn-3 acetate group. Compared to typical triacylglycerol molecules (here referred to as long chain TAGs; lcTAGs), acetyl-TAGs possess reduced viscosity and improved cold temperature properties, which may allow direct use as a drop-in diesel fuel. Their different chemical and physical properties also make acetyl-TAGs useful for other applications such as lubricants and plasticizers. Acetyl-TAGs can be synthesized by EaDAcT, a diacylglycerol acetyltransferase enzyme originally isolated from Euonymus alatus (Burning Bush). The heterologous expression of EaDAcT in different organisms, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, resulted in the accumulation of acetyl-TAGs in storage lipids. Microbial conversion of lignocellulose into acetyl-TAGs could allow biorefinery production of versatile molecules for biofuel and bioproducts. Results: In order to produce acetyl-TAGs from abundant lignocellulose feedstocks, we expressed EaDAcT in S. cerevisiae previously engineered to utilize xylose as a carbon source. The resulting strains were capable of producing acetyl-TAGs when grown on different media. The highest levels of acetyl-TAG production were observed with growth on synthetic lab media containing glucose or xylose. Importantly, acetyl-TAGs were also synthesized by this strain in ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX)-pretreated corn stover hydrolysate (ACSH) at higher volumetric titers than previously published strains. The deletion of the four endogenous enzymes known to contribute to lcTAG production increased the proportion of acetyl-TAGs in the total storage lipids beyond that in existing strains, which will make purification of these useful lipids easier. Surprisingly, the strains containing the four deletions were still capable of synthesizing lcTAG, suggesting that the particular strain used in this study possesses additional undetermined diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity. Additionally, the carbon source used for growth influenced the accumulation of these residual lcTAGs, with higher levels in strains cultured on xylose containing media. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that S. cerevisiae can be metabolically engineered to produce acetyl-TAGs when grown on different carbon sources, including hydrolysate derived from lignocellulose. Deletion of four endogenous acyltransferases enabled a higher purity of acetyl-TAGs to be achieved, but lcTAGs were still synthesized. Longer incubation times also decreased the levels of acetyl-TAGs produced. Therefore, additional work is needed to further manipulate acetyl-TAG production in this strain of S. cerevisiae, including the identification of other TAG biosynthetic and lipolytic enzymes and a better understanding of the regulation of the synthesis and degradation of storage lipids. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Used frying oil (UFO), a waste produced in large volume each year worldwide, represents a potential resource for biofuel production rather than a disposal problem for modern society. Pyrolysis technique using microwave heating offers a promising approach for the conversion of UFO into biofuel products with improved properties. In this study, pyrolysis of UFO was performed by contacting with a bed of microwave absorbents heated by microwave radiation. The pyrolysis approach was examined using different materials as the reaction bed, comprising particulate carbon, activated carbon and mesoporous aluminosilicate (MCM-41). The use of particulate and activated carbon as the reaction bed provided a fast heating rate and extensive cracking capacity to pyrolyze the used oil, thus showing favorable features that could lead to short process time and less energy usage. This resulted in a production of a high yield of a biofuel product (up to 73 wt%) in a process taking less than 35 min. The biofuel showed a composition dominated by light C5-C20 aliphatic hydrocarbons with low amounts of oxygenated compounds (≤11%). In particular, the oil product obtained from activated carbon bed showed a low nitrogen content and was free of carboxylic acid and sulphur. The absence of carboxylic acids with low amounts of oxygenated compounds could reduce the formation of oxygenated by-products that could generate undesirable acidic tar or potentially hazardous sludge in the biofuel during storage. Combined with the detection of a high calorific value (46 MJ/kg) nearly comparable to diesel fuel, the biofuel shows great promise to be upgraded for use as a ‘cleaner’ fuel source with potentially reduced oxygenated by-products plus low or zero emissions of NOx and SOx during the use of the fuel in combustion process. This study also revealed that the use of activated carbon bed results in the highest energy recovery (88–90%) from the used frying oil. Our results demonstrated that the use of a microwave-heated reaction bed of activated carbon shows great potential as an improved and sustainable pyrolysis approach that is energy-efficient and timesaving for the recycling of used frying oil into a biofuel product with desirable properties. This pyrolysis approach provides an alternative to transesterification that avoids the use of solvents and catalysts, and thus could be developed further as a promising route to recycle various types of waste and biomass materials. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Global warming, environmental issues, food crisis and energy security are the main concerning problems which have triggered a sense of urgency among policymakers and development practitioners to find sustainable and viable solutions in the area of bioenergy. Among various edible and non-edible bioenergy feedstocks specified for biodiesel production, Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) and waste cooking oil (WCO) have been introduced to be promising and sustainable. In this study, an integrated hybrid approach based on a data envelopment analysis (DEA) and mathematical programming techniques is presented for the strategic design of biodiesel supply chain network in Iran. In the first phase, JCL cultivation areas are assessed according to climatic and social criteria by a unified DEA (UDEA) model. In the second phase, the locations which have achieved desired efficiency scores are considered as candidate locations for JCL cultivation within a mathematical programming model developed for designing the biodiesel supply chain network. The proposed mathematical programming model optimizes the numbers, locations and capacities of JCL cultivation centers, JCL seeds and WCO collection centers, bio-refineries, and distribution centers. The proposed approach is implemented in Iran for 10 years planning horizon. The results show the usefulness and efficiency of the proposed method in assisting the policymakers to take suitable strategic and tactical level decisions related to biodiesel supply chain planning. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fossil fuel combustion produces around 98% of coal emissions. Therefore, liquid and gaseous biofuels have become more attractive due to their environmental benefits. The biodiesel production process requires measurements that help to control and supervise the variables involved in the process. The measurements provide valuable information about the operation conditions and give estimations about the critical variables of the process. The information from measurements is essential for monitoring the state of a process and verifying if it has an optimal performance. The objective of this study was the conception of a virtual sensor based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the model of a batch biodiesel reactor for estimating concentrations of triglycerides (TG), diglycerides (DG), monoglycerides (MG), methyl ester (E), alcohol (A), and glycerol (GL) in real-time through measurement of the temperature and pH. Estimation of the TG, DG, MG, E, A, and Gl through this method eliminates the need for additional sensors and allows the use of different types of control. For the performance analysis of the virtual sensor, the data obtained from the EKF are compared with experimental data reported in the literature, with the mean square error of the estimate then being calculated. In addition, the results of this approach can be implemented in a real system, since it only uses measurements available in a reactor such as temperature and pH. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - The Government of Canada has committed that Canada’s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions be reduced by 17% from 2005 levels by 2020. The new Renewable Fuels Regulations required 2% renewable content in diesel fuel and heating distillate oil and 5% for gasoline. This represents approximately 2.1 billion liters of ethanol and 600 million liters of biodiesel requirement per year, which would reduce GHG emissions by more than four million tones. Canada is expected to consume more fuel ethanol compared to its production capacity. The above mandates as well as the gap in consumption and production of biofuel will have enormous impact on the Canadian economy. In this backdrop, an input–output model of the Canadian economy is developed to estimate the macroeconomic impact of the ethanol and biodiesel production in Canada. The impacts on sectoral prices have also been calculated. Simulation exercises have been attempted to reach the mandates using modified Leontief model. Results show that agriculture sector is affected because of feedstock use in the biofuel sector. Mining and manufacturing industries also show a considerable impact. In addition, the impact on commodity prices cannot be ignored. Finally, to meet the target of Copenhagen commitment, the nation needs to revise the blending capacity of ethanol and biodiesel. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A low-cost and high-purity calcium oxide (CaO) was prepared from waste crab shells, which were extracted from the dead crabs, was used as an efficient solid base catalyst in the synthesis of biodiesel. Raw fish oil was extracted from waste parts of fish through mechanical expeller followed by solvent extraction. Physical as well as chemical properties of raw fish oil were studied, and its free fatty acid composition was analyzed with GC-MS. Stable and high-purity CaO was obtained when the material was calcined at 800 °C for 4 h. Prepared catalyst was characterized by XRD, FT-IR, and TGA/DTA. The surface structure of the catalyst was analyzed with SEM, and elemental composition was determined by EDX spectra. Esterification followed by transesterification reactions were conducted for the synthesis of biodiesel. The effect of cosolvent on biodiesel yield was studied in each experiment using different solvents such as toluene, diethyl ether, hexane, tetrahydrofuran, and acetone. High-quality and pure biodiesel was synthesized and characterized by 1H NMR and FT-IR. Biodiesel yield was affected by parameters such as reaction temperature, reaction time, molar ratio (methanol:oil), and catalyst loading. Properties of synthesized biodiesel such as density, kinematic viscosity, and cloud point were determined according to ASTM standards. Reusability of prepared CaO catalyst was checked, and the catalyst was found to be stable up to five runs without significant loss of catalytic activity. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Aviation-related aerosol emissions contribute to the formation of contrail cirrus clouds that can alter upper tropospheric radiation and water budgets, and therefore climate. The magnitude of air-traffic-related aerosol-cloud interactions and the ways in which these interactions might change in the future remain uncertain. Modelling studies of the present and future effects of aviation on climate require detailed information about the number of aerosol particles emitted per kilogram of fuel burned and the microphysical properties of those aerosols that are relevant for cloud formation. However, previous observational data at cruise altitudes are sparse for engines burning conventional fuels, and no data have previously been reported for biofuel use in-flight. Here we report observations from research aircraft that sampled the exhaust of engines onboard a NASA DC-8 aircraft as they burned conventional Jet A fuel and a 50:50 (by volume) blend of Jet A fuel and a biofuel derived from Camelina oil. We show that, compared to using conventional fuels, biofuel blending reduces particle number and mass emissions immediately behind the aircraft by 50 to 70 per cent. Our observations quantify the impact of biofuel blending on aerosol emissions at cruise conditions and provide key microphysical parameters, which will be useful to assess the potential of biofuel use in aviation as a viable strategy to mitigate climate change. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objectives The inflammatory effects of organic sub-10 nm particles generated and emitted from a diesel engine fueled with a biodiesel and a commercial diesel oil are analyzed in this paper. Diesel combustion is the major sources of ultrafine particles (UFP) in the environment, particularly in urbanized areas. In the last years, there is an increasing use of biomass-derived fuels because they are a renewable source of energy that may mitigate climate change through the reduction of net CO2 with respect to conventional fossil fuels. Although there is a general agreement on biofuels ability to reduce conventional pollutants, new and potentially harmful pollutants can be formed during biofuel combustion. In particular, the emission of sub-10 nm particles is strongly increased with respect to that of larger soot particles. Methods Organic sub-10 nm particles are separated from larger sizes particulate matter by collection in water suspension for toxicological and inflammatory tests. After exposure to sub-10 nm particles, the effects on proliferation, apoptosis and secretion of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors networks production is analyzed in immortalized non-tumorigenic human dermal keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) and human alveolar epithelial-like cells (A549). Results and conclusion Nanoparticles exert different cytotoxic effects in the two cell lines, suggesting that the dermal way of exposure is more sensitive than the inhalant way. These differences are most evident in the secretion of pro-inflammatory, angiogenic and proliferative cytokines and chemokines whose expression is more finely modulated in HaCaT cells compared to A-549 cells. Considering the size of these particles, it is important to promote the culture of prevention also for the dermal way in particularly exposed workers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Laser surface texturing technology was employed for fabricating textured structures on cylinder liners. The tribological behavior of the cylinder liners with different texturing structures including line, dimple and line + dimple and texturing area ratio was investigated under the lubrication of esterified bio-oil with and without MoS2 microsheets as additives. The experimental results indicated that all the three textured surfaces showed better lubricating effects than untextured one except for the line + dimple structures leading to a higher wear rate to the cylinder liner; the dimple structures have better friction and wear performance than other structures. In addition, the textured surfaces lubricated with esterified bio-oil with MoS2 microsheets presented the optimal friction reduction and antiwear properties. This might be ascribed to the fact that besides the adsorbed film composed of carbon and organics from the base oil, there was a robust complex composite tribo-film composed of MoS2, MoO3, FeOOH, FeO, Fe2O3, FeS, FeSO4 and etc. on the rubbing surfaces. Furthermore, the dimples acted as an oil reservoir and provided a sink to pull wear debris away from the contacting surfaces. The combined actions of these factors gave rise to the lowest friction and wear of the tribopairs tested. The synergistic combination of the 12% area ratio dimples and MoS2 microsheets showed great potential for application in IC engines, when coupled with bio-oil to reduce parasitic losses and energy consumption. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present work proposes the use of total synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (TSFS) as a discrimination methodology for fluorescent compounds in edible oils, which are preserved after the transesterification processes in the biodiesel production. In the same way, a similar study is presented to identify fluorophores that do not change in expired vegetal oils, to associate physicochemical parameters to fluorescent measures, as contribution to a fingerprint for increasing the chemical knowledge of these products. The fluorescent fingerprints were obtained by Tucker3 decomposition of a three-way array of the total synchronous fluorescence matrices. This chemometric method presents the ability for modeling non-bilinear data, as Total Synchronous Fluorescence Spectra data, and consists in the decomposition of the three way data arrays (samples × Δλ × λ excitation), into four new data matrices: A (scores), B (profile in Δλ mode), C (profile in spectra mode) and G (relationships between A, B and C). In this study, 50 samples of oil from soybean, corn and sunflower seeds before and after its expiration time, as well as 50 biodiesel samples obtained by transesterification of the same oils were measured by TSFS. This study represents an immediate application of chemical fingerprint for the discrimination of non-expired and expired edible oils and biodiesel. This method does not require the use of reagents or laborious procedures for the chemical characterization of samples. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Due to the rising price of crude oil, biofuel is being considered as a global alternative for fossil fuels to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. Diesel blended with bio fuel is currently being widely adopted in many countries. The Taiwanese government has been enforcing the adoption of B2 since 2010. However, there have remained consistent concerns about engine durability related to the use of biofuel, especially regarding after-treatment systems. A selective catalytic reduction system (SCR) has been utilized recently to reduce NOX emission in order to meet the Euro IV and V emission standards. To evaluate the impact of biodiesel on the durability of engines equipped with the SCR system, a long-term testing program was organized for the purposes of this study. The results can be used as a reference for the development of marketing promotion strategies as well as government policies in Taiwan. B8 diesel fuel (8 vol% biodiesel) was employed in a commercial heavy duty common-rail fuel injection engine for testing purposes to determine its influence on the durability of engine components and the SCR system. After a 1000-hour full load test operation, the key components of the engines, including the injector, piston ring, and catalyst were analyzed and characterized through a series of inspections to identify the degree of decay and wear behavior. In addition, the engine performance was evaluated with the SAE J1995 test procedure, and the emissions were measured using the ETC test procedure at each maintenance stage and after the durability test to determine any variations in performance and emissions. Furthermore, non-regulatory emissions, such as PM2.5, PM diameter distributions, and particle numbers, which have been proved to be critically important in terms of causing cancer from diesel engine emissions, were also evaluated in this study. It was found that the standard deviation of performance and emissions varied less than 3% when the diesel engine was fueled with B8 biodiesel. The results also indicated that the SCR system still maintained conversion efficiency at 70∼95% after the 1000hr durability tests. © 2017 SAE International.

AB  - Background: The introduction of renewable jet fuel (RJF) is considered an important emission mitigation measure for the aviation industry. This study compares the well-to-wake (WtWa) greenhouse gas (GHG) emission performance of multiple RJF conversion pathways and explores the impact of different co-product allocation methods. The insights obtained in this study are of particular importance if RJF is included as an emission mitigation instrument in the global Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Results: Fischer-Tropsch pathways yield the highest GHG emission reduction compared to fossil jet fuel (86-104%) of the pathways in scope, followed by Hydrothermal Liquefaction (77-80%) and sugarcane- (71-75%) and corn stover-based Alcohol-to-Jet (60-75%). Feedstock cultivation, hydrogen and conversion inputs were shown to be major contributors to the overall WtWa GHG emission performance. The choice of allocation method mainly affects pathways yielding high shares of co-products or producing co-products which effectively displace carbon intensive products (e.g., electricity). Conclusions: Renewable jet fuel can contribute to significant reduction of aviation-related GHG emissions, provided the right feedstock and conversion technology are used. The GHG emission performance of RJF may be further improved by using sustainable hydrogen sources or applying carbon capture and storage. Based on the character and impact of different co-product allocation methods, we recommend using energy and economic allocation (for non-energy co-products) at a global level, as it leverages the universal character of energy allocation while adequately valuing non-energy co-products. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Biofuel is an attractive vehicular fuel option for the transportation sector. Diverse biofuel blends can be produced from biomass. Complexity arises when optimum biofuel blends need to be designed to comply with fuel regulation standards as well as generate less emission. This paper discusses an integrated computational and experimental technique to design economically viable and environmentally friendly tailor-made biofuel blends from palm biomass that is abundant in Malaysia. An experimental based trial-and-error method is time consuming and uses up resources. Computational approaches adopt a systematic blend formulation methodology that assists focused experimental work. The biofuel design problem has been formulated as a Non-Linear Program to satisfy specified target properties such as density, kinematic viscosity, cetane number, gross calorific value, distillation temperature, and sulphur content. Target properties predicted through mixture property models were experimentally validated according to ASTM standard test methods. Five optimum tailor-made biofuel blend formulations were generated based on cost, gross calorific value and emission limitations. The result indicates that biofuel blends with butyl levulinate could increase the price of biofuel up to 80% from the retail price of B5 diesel. However, cleaner biofuel with less cost and highest calorific value can be achieved for biofuel blends that contain B5 diesel, butanol and ethanol. The application of this model yields about 26% CO2 emission reduction and about 22% less sulphur content as well as comply with the EN590 fuel regulation standard. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ozone (O3) pollution is becoming increasingly severe in China. In addition, our limited understanding of the relationship between O3 and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), is an obstacle to improving air quality. By developing an improved source-oriented speciated VOC emission inventory in 2013, we estimated the ozone formation potential (OFP) and investigated its characteristics in China. Besides, a comparison was made between our estimates and space-based observations from the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Aura satellite. According to our estimates, m-/p-xylene, ethylene, formaldehyde, toluene, and propene were the five species that had the largest potential to form ozone, and on-road vehicles, industrial processes, biofuel combustion, and surface coating were the key contributing sectors. Among different regions of China, the North China Plain, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta had the highest OFP values. Our results suggest that O3 formation is VOC-limited in major urban areas of China. Additionally, considering the different photochemical reactivities of various VOC species and the disparate energy and industry structures in the different regions of China, more efficient OFP-based and localized VOC control measures should be implemented, instead of the current mass-based and nationally uniform policies.

AB  - Currently, the catalytic conversion of biomass-derived compounds into biofuels is of great significance in terms of environmental protection and sustainable development. Among them, valeric esters derived from γ-valerolactone (GVL) are regarded as one of the most promising alternatives to fossil fuels. Herein, the highly efficient one-pot transformation of GVL to produce a series of valeric esters was successfully achieved over novel ZrO2-incorporated ZnAl2O4-composite-supported Cu-based catalysts. An extensive investigation gave clear evidence that the incorporation of ZrO2 into composites could lead to the enhanced metal dispersion and surface acidity. Especially, the catalyst with a Zr/Zn mass ratio of 0.2 exhibited the best selectivity of 99% in the transformation of GVL into pentyl valerate to date, together with a comparable conversion of 91% with respect to the Cu-based catalyst previously reported. The superior catalytic performance was attributable to the surface cooperation effect between highly dispersed active copper species and abundant surface acid sites. Especially, different surface types of acidic sites on catalysts could induce the reaction to efficiently proceed in different paths. The present work provides a valuable approach for precious metal substitution research in future large-scale biorefineries. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Slow pyrolysis of industrial waste lignin has been carried out in a lab-scale tube furnace reactor at 300–700°C, and the effect of temperature on yields and character of pyrolytic products (bio-char, bio-oil and gas) was investigated. The results showed that pyrolysis temperature played an important role on the conversion of waste lignin into high value-added products. Bio-char was the dominant product of waste lignin, whose quality improved with increasing temperature, while the best combustion reactivity was focus at 500°C. The optimum condition for bio-oil formation was at 600°C, where contained a mass of phenols. Gas yield significantly increased effected by temperature, especially CH4. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Engine oil contamination, degradation and wear of engine components occurs mainly due to fuel dilution, oxidation and blow-by. This contamination accelerates the wear of engine components and also decreases the useful service life and performance of engine oil. Failure of engine oil can cause engine component failure. The three major contaminants which initiate engine oil degradation and engine component wear are soot, water and particles. Soot contamination in lubricating oil is responsible for oil thickening and engine wear. Water emulsifies the oil and the wear debris generated further enhance the wear rate as three body abrasive process. This paper reveals the role of biofuels in engine oil degradation in terms of contamination, fuel dilution, oxidation and blow-by and wear. This paper provides a platform to understand the tribological relationship between lubricating oil and engine components. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - With growing concerns about environmental pollution and depletion of fossil fuel resources, various biofuels have been assessed. In this paper, the performance and emission characteristics of sapote seed oil methyl ester blends were studied. Sapote seed oil methyl ester was blended with diesel in increments of 5%. Additionally, 5% diethyl ether was added to all blends with sapote seed oil methyl ester in order to reduce the overall viscosity of the blends. It was observed that with an increase in the proportion of sapote seed oil methyl ester in the blend, CO, HC emissions and smoke opacity decreased. Similarly, with an increase in sapote seed oil methyl ester content in the blend, brake thermal efficiency, exhaust gas temperature and NOx emissions also increased. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In this paper, a number of scenarios to decarbonize the Greek road transport sector are modeled using the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) software for a variety of alternative technologies and fuels. Both light duty and heavy duty vehicles are considered. The scenario analysis time span covers years 2010–2050 with 2010 as the baseline year. The reference scenario includes all binding targets set out by the European Union and the Greek legislation regarding the development of renewable energies and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. At present transportation is dominated by internal combustion engines. Two alternative scenarios to the reference are presented. For all scenarios, the vehicle technologies and fuels proposed are the hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, biofuels and gas engine vehicles. The analysis has shown that the Greek road transport sector can be decarbonized through various combinations of alternative technologies and fuels. Selecting specific options of fuels for year 2050 would be characterized with great uncertainty. This study proposes an increased penetration of biofuels, electric vehicles and gas engine vehicles. For the best alternative scenario as compared to the reference scenario, energy consumption is reduced from 5784 ktoe down to 4299 ktoe or by 26% for all vehicle stock, while CO2 emissions are reduced from 16,995 ktons CO2 down to 10,531 ktons CO2 or by 38%. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We study relationship between biodiesel, as a most important biofuel in the European Union, relevant feedstock commodities and fossil fuels. Our main interest is to capture relationship between biodiesel and natural gas. They are both used either directly as a fuel or indirectly in form of additives in transport. Therefore, our purpose is to find price linkage between biofuel and natural gas to support or reject the claim that they compete as alternative fuels and potential substitutes. The estimated price link between biodiesel and diesel is negative and the strongest among analyzed commodities. The price transmission between biodiesel and natural gas is the weakest one. © 2017.

AB  - Euphorbia esula (leafy spurge) is a perennial noxious weed native to Eurasia, which can also be potentially useful as a biofuel, medicine, or a pest control agent. In this study, we analysed publicly available ESTs of 'NCBI dbEST' (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST) using in silico tools to have an insight into the genetic makeup of the plant. Mining of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) was performed by MISA, primer designing by Primer3 while functional annotation, gene ontology and enrichment analysis were performed by Blast2GO. SSR mining from 47543 ESTs revealed a total 3248 SSRs, of which di-, tri- and hexa-nucleotide repeats were 352 (10.83%), 822 (25.30%), 17 (0.52%) respectively. A total of 527 primer pairs were designed for the annotated SSR-Contigs. About 77.07% SSR-ESTs could be assigned a significant match to the protein database. 210 unique SSR-FDM (Functional Domain Markers) were assigned for significant functional domains by InterProScan. The gene ontology (GO) analysis provided 1213 number of unique GO terms which were subjected to enrichment analysis to obtain 95 statistically significant GO terms mapped to the SSR containing ESTs. Most frequent enriched GO terms were GO:0005886 for cellular component, GO:0003677 for molecular function and GO:0044255 in case of biological process, indicating the potential of the species as a fuel crop. Many SSR markers were functionally annotated to various biotic and abiotic stress responsive genes. Further studies may help us to understand these traits of extreme adaptive features. This will provide opportunity to genetically manage and modify crops for resistance to these stresses.

AB  - Oleochemical activities (e.g. biodiesel production, fat saponification) generate annually very high amounts of concentrated glycerol-containing waters (called crude glycerol) as the principal residues of these processes. Crude glycerol is an industrial residue the valorization of which attracts remarkable and constantly increasing interest. In the current investigation, biodiesel-derived glycerol was employed as substrate for yeast and fungal strains cultivated under nitrogen-limited conditions in shake flasks. Glucose was employed as reference substrate. Several yeasts (Candida diddensiae, Candida tropicalis, Pichia ciferrii, Williopsis saturnus, Candida boidinii, and Candida oleophila) rapidly assimilated glucose and converted it into ethanol, despite aerobic conditions imposed, and were Crabtree-positive. None of these yeasts produced ethanol during growth on glycerol or accumulated significant quantities of lipid during growth on glucose or glycerol. Only Rhodosporidium toruloides produced notable lipid quantities from glucose and to lesser extent from glycerol. Yarrowia lipolytica LFMB 20 produced citrate ≈58 g/L growing on high-glucose media, while on high-glycerol media ≈42 g/L citrate and ≈18 g/L mannitol. During growth on glucose/glycerol blends, glycerol was assimilated first and thereafter glucose was consumed. Fungi produced higher lipid quantities compared with yeasts. High lipid quantities were produced by Mortierella ramanniana, Mucor sp., and mainly Mortierella isabellina, with glycerol being more adequate for M. ramanniana and glucose for Mucor sp. and M. isabellina. M. isabellina ATHUM 2935 produced lipids of 8.5 g/L, 83.3% w/w in dry cell weight (DCW) and conversion yield per unit of glucose consumed ≈0.25 g/g. The respective values on glycerol were 5.4 g/L, 66.6% w/w in DCW and ≈0.22 g/g. Lipids of all microorganisms were analyzed with regards to their fatty acid composition, and M. isabellina presented the closest similitude with rapeseed oil. Crude lipids produced by this fungus and extracted with chloroform/methanol blend, were composed mostly of triacylglycerols, thus indicating that these solvents are adequate for triacylglycerol extraction. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Microalga Nannochloropsis oculata is a promising alternative feedstock for biodiesel. Elevating its oil-yielding capacity is conducive to cost-saving biodiesel production. However, the regulatory processes of multi-factor collaborative stresses (MFCS) on the oil-yielding performance of N. oculata are unclear. The duration effects of MFCS (high irradiation, nitrogen deficiency and elevated iron supplementation) on N. oculata were investigated in an 18- d batch culture. Despite the reduction in cell division, the biomass concentration increased, resulting from the large accumulation of the carbon/energy-reservoir. However, different storage forms were found in different cellular storage compounds, and both the protein content and pigment composition swiftly and drastically changed. The analysis of four biodiesel properties using pertinent empirical equations indicated their progressive effective improvement in lipid classes and fatty acid composition. The variation curve of neutral lipid productivity was monitored with fluorescent Nile red and was closely correlated to the results from conventional methods. In addition, a series of changes in the organelles (e.g., chloroplast, lipid body and vacuole) and cell shape, dependent on the stress duration, were observed by TEM and LSCM. These changes presumably played an important role in the acclimation of N. oculata to MFCS and accordingly improved its oil-yielding performance. © 2017 Wei, Huang.

AB  - Now days, production of fuels and petrochemicals from renewable lignocellulosic biomass is an indispensable issue to meet the growing energy demand. Meanwhile, the changes in the climate and soil topography influence the growth and development as well as canopy level of the lignocellulosic biomass. In this study, Zilla spinosa Turr (Zilla) plants with similar age and size were collected from three main sectors (upstream, midstream, and downstream) of Wadi Hagul during spring (April) and summer (July) seasons. Environmental stresses evoked reduction in the energy trapping pigments concomitant with increments in chlorophyll fluorescence in summer harvested plants particularly at downstream. Furthermore, the biofuels generating compounds including carbohydrate, lignin, and lipid making the plant biomasses are greatly affected by environmental conditions. Greater amount of lignin was estimated in summer harvested Z. spinosa shoots particularly at downstream. Moreover, the total oil content which is a promising source of biodiesel was considerably decreased during summer season particularly at downstream. The physical properties of the lipids major constituent fatty acid methyl esters determine the biofuel properties and contribute in the adaptation of plants against environmental stresses. Hence, the analysis of fatty acid profile showed significant modifications under combined drought and heat stress displayed in the summer season. The maximum increase in saturated fatty acid levels including tridecanoic acid (C13:0), pentadeanoic acid (C15:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), and stearic acid (C18:0) were estimated in spring harvested Z. spinosa aerial portions particularly at midstream. In spite of the reduction in the total oil content, a marked increase in the value of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids ratio and thereby the unsaturation index were achieved during the dry summer period. Henceforth, these seasonal and spatial variations in fatty acids profiles may contribute in the acclimatization of Z. spinosa plants to soil water scarcity associated with heat stress experienced during summer. In addition, the alterations in the fatty acid profiles may match biofuel requirements. In conclusion, the most adequate growing season (spring) will be decisive for achieving high lipid productivity associated with improved biofuel quality in terms of high saturated fatty acids percentage that improves its cetane number. However, the dry summer season enhanced the accumulation of greater amount of lignin that may enhance the biodiesel quantity. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Biodiesel is one the most popular bio-derived fuel among the alternative fuels. The biodegradable, environmental friendly and easy resources are causing biodiesel received extra attentions by industries and researchers in addition to solve the future energy crises. Despite years of improvement, the crucial issue in using bio-derived fuels is the oxidation stability, stoichiometric, chemical composition, antioxidants on the degradation and much oxygen compared to diesel. Thus, the improvement of emissions quality from engines fuelled by biodiesel is immediately required to meet the future stringent emission regulations. Instead of using biodiesel itself, the used of biodiesel blended with additive has been experimented extensively aiming the emissions reductions and improving the engine performance. Therefore, this study was executed to analyze the effects of biodiesel mixed with bio-additives on performance, emissions and combustions characteristics of diesel engine. The division of experimental investigation comprises of 1) performance of diesel engine specifically on brake power, brake mean effective pressure and fuel consumption; 2) exhaust gas emissions focusing on CO2, NOx, HC and CO formations; and 3) combustion characteristics of fuel inside the combustion chamber. Biofuels tested in the study was derived from three different feedstock's i.e. crude palm oil (CPO), jatropha curcas oil (JCO) and waste cooking oil (WCO) at 5, 10, 15 and 20% concentration were blended with selected bio-additive namely Di Methyl Poly Siloxane (DMPS) and D20 palm oil methyl bio-additive formula. Additionally, petroleum diesel namely standard diesel (STD) was examined as well for comparison purpose. A 4-cycle YANMAR TF120ML diesel engine integrated with a 20 HP Eddy-Current dynamometer and mounted with Airrex HG-540 gas analyzers are used. Outcomes of the study implied that blended fuels particularly C10+DMPS and J15+DMPS promotes the optimum performance associated with reduction of exhaust emission specially CO gas. Yet, the best alternative fuels were recommended. © 2006-2017 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN). All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on the panel data of 306 cities in China from 2002 to 2012, this paper investigates China’s road transport fuel (i.e., gasoline and diesel) demand system by using the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) and the Quadratic AIDS (QUAIDS) models. The results indicate that own-price elasticities for different vehicle categories range from –1.215 to –0.459 (by AIDS) and from –1.399 to –0.369 (by QUAIDS). Then, this study estimates the air pollution emissions (CO, NOx and PM2.5) and public health damages from the road transport sector under different oil price shocks. Compared to the base year 2012, results show that a fuel price rise of 30% can avoid 1,147,270 tonnes of pollution emissions; besides, premature deaths and economic losses decrease by 16,149 cases and 13,817.953 million RMB yuan respectively; while based on the non-linear health effect model, the premature deaths and total economic losses decrease by 15,534 and 13,291.4 million RMB yuan respectively. Our study combines the fuel demand and health evaluation models and is the first attempt to address how oil price changes influence public health through the fuel demand system in China. Given its serious air pollution emission and substantial health damages, this paper provides important insights for policy makers in terms of persistent increasing in fuel consumption and the associated health and economic losses. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Emissions from diesel engines have been considered as major air pollution sources. The blending of feedstocks is motivated by the desire to enhance the properties and reduce the cost of biofuels. In this study, a rubber seed/palm oil mixture at equal blend ratios was used to produce biodiesel. The effects of irreverent parameters on transesterification were studied using the response surface methodology (RSM) to determine the maximum yield. Methyl ester at optimized conditions was produced, and its thermophysical properties were studied. Methyl ester effect on the emissions and performance of an unmodified indirect injection diesel engine (IDI) at partial and full load was examined. The results showed that the torque and brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) were 1.1 and 1 % lower than diesel fuel, respectively. Compared to diesel fuel, power and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) were 1.1 and 1.3 % lower, respectively, and the brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) was 1.4 % higher at full load. CO was also reduced by 2 % while CO2, NOx, and exhaust temperature increased on average by 1, 1.2, and 1.1 %, respectively. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Lime mud, the industrial waste from pulp and paper mills, was used as a raw material for preparing calcium oxide (CaO)-based catalysts. Lime mud was heated at 1000 °C to transform it into active CaO and then modified by adding 5 wt% Fe or Ni (as nitrates) using the wet impregnation method and calcining to form the Fe/CaO and Ni/CaO catalysts. The fast pyrolysis of Jatropha residues to bio-oil with no catalyst and with the derived CaO, Fe/CaO and Ni/CaO catalysts was studied using an analytical pyrolysis-GC/MS at 500 °C at a biomass: catalyst ratio of 1:1 and 1:5. A Jatropha residue: catalyst ratio of 1:5 was more optimal for enhancing aliphatic hydrocarbon production and decreasing the amount of oxygenated and N-containing compounds. The presence of the CaO catalyst completely eliminated the undesirable acids and sugars in the bio-oil, significantly decreased N-containing compounds and considerably promoted the formation of aliphatic hydrocarbons up to 37.3%. The Fe/CaO and Ni/CaO catalysts further increased the selectivity for aliphatic hydrocarbons, and reduced aldehyde formation compared to with CaO, with Ni/CaO being the best catalyst for hydrocarbon selectivity (47.5%). Overall, these CaO-based catalysts derived from industrial lime mud waste can be used for catalytic fast pyrolysis applications. © 2017

AB  - Food waste, as a major part of the municipal solid waste has been generated increasingly worldwide. Efficient and feasible utilization of this waste material for productivity process is significant for both economical and environmental reasons. In the present study, Musca domestica larva was used as the carrier to conduct a bioconversion with food waste to get the value-added maggot protein, oil and organic fertilizers. Methods of adult flies rearing, culture medium adjuvant selection, maggot culture conditions, stocking density and the valorization of the waste have been explored. From the experimental results, every 1000 g culture mediums (700 g food waste and 300 g adjuvant) could be disposed by 1.5 g M. domestica eggs under proper culture conditions after emergence in just 4 days, 42.95 ± 0.25% of which had been consumed and the culture medium residues could be used as good organic fertilizers, accompanying with the food waste consumption, ∼53.08 g dried maggots that contained 57.06 ± 2.19% protein and 15.07 ± 2.03% oil had been produced. The maggot protein for its outstanding pharmacological activities is regarded as a good raw material in the field of medicine and animal feeding. Meanwhile, the maggot oil represents a potential alternative feedstock for biodiesel production. In our study, the maggot biodiesel was obtained after the procedure of transesterification reaction with methanol and the productivity was 87.71%. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the production of nanostructured biochar from lignocellulosic biomass, sugarcane bagasse, is demonstrated via microwave assisted pyrolysis by using iron (Fe) and cobalt (Co) particles as susceptors. The experiments were performed in a bench scale pyrolysis reactor at 600 W microwave power up to a temperature of 500 °C. The effect of bagasse:susceptor composition on the quality of biochar was evaluated using a range of characterization techniques like scanning electron microscopy, porosimetry, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. The addition of Fe as the susceptor resulted in the formation of nanoparticles and nanotubes of average diameter in the range of 30–120 nm and 20–50 nm, respectively. The addition of more Fe particles resulted in an increase in size of nanoparticles and nanotubes due to enhanced rate of localized heating, which led to fusion of small particles and tubes. The biochar obtained by the addition of Fe susceptor was rich in carbon content compared to that obtained without the addition of susceptor. The addition of a mixture of Fe and Co as susceptor led to the formation of small graphitic flakes and fine nanotubes. Besides biochar, bio-oil and non-condensable gases were also characterized for their composition. The major organic functionalities in bio-oil included furan derivatives, simple phenols, guaiacol, syringol and their derivatives. Maximum energy recovery of 49% was observed in bio-oil when 20 wt.% Fe and 33.3 wt.% of Fe + Co were used as susceptors. The addition of Fe resulted in high yield of H2 and CH4 gases, besides CO2 and CO. Thus, microwave pyrolysis is shown to be a promising technique to tailor the morphological features of biochar by using metallic susceptors, and simultaneously produce good quality bio-oil and gases. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, a ZrO2-based polycrystalline ceramic foam catalyst was prepared and used in catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste vegetable oil and high density polyethylene (HDPE) for hydrocarbon fuel production. The effects of pyrolysis temperature, catalyst dosage, and HDPE to waste vegetable oil ratio on the product distribution and hydrocarbon fuel composition were examined. Experimental results indicate that the maximum hydrocarbon fuel yield of 63.1 wt. % was obtained at 430 °C, and the oxygenates were rarely detected in the hydrocarbon fuel. The hydrocarbon fuel yield increased when the catalyst was used. At the catalyst dosage of 15 wt.%, the proportion of alkanes in the hydrocarbon fuel reached 97.85 wt.%, which greatly simplified the fuel composition and improved the fuel quality. With the augment of HDPE to waste vegetable oil ratio, the hydrocarbon fuel yield monotonously increased. At the HDPE to waste vegetable oil ratio of 1:1, the maximum proportion (97.85 wt.%) of alkanes was obtained. Moreover, the properties of hydrocarbon fuel were superior to biodiesel and 0# diesel due to higher calorific value, better low-temperature low fluidity, and lower density and viscosity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recently, several endophytic fungi have been demonstrated to produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with properties similar to fossil fuels, called “mycodiesel,” while growing on lignocellulosic plant and agricultural residues. The fact that endophytes are plant symbionts suggests that some may be able to produce lignocellulolytic enzymes, making them capable of both deconstructing lignocellulose and converting it into mycodiesel, two properties that indicate that these strains may be useful consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) hosts for the biofuel production. In this study, four endophytes Hypoxylon sp. CI4A, Hypoxylon sp. EC38, Hypoxylon sp. CO27, and Daldinia eschscholzii EC12 were selected and evaluated for their CBP potential. Analysis of their genomes indicates that these endophytes have a rich reservoir of biomass-deconstructing carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZys), which includes enzymes active on both polysaccharides and lignin, as well as terpene synthases (TPSs), enzymes that may produce fuel-like molecules, suggesting that they do indeed have CBP potential. GC-MS analyses of their VOCs when grown on four representative lignocellulosic feedstocks revealed that these endophytes produce a wide spectrum of hydrocarbons, the majority of which are monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, including some known biofuel candidates. Analysis of their cellulase activity when grown under the same conditions revealed that these endophytes actively produce endoglucanases, exoglucanases, and β-glucosidases. The richness of CAZymes as well as terpene synthases identified in these four endophytic fungi suggests that they are great candidates to pursue for development into platform CBP organisms. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).

AB  - This article aims to present the shear strength of soil-geosynthetic interface through laboratory tests. Shear strength of a soil-geosynthetic interface is defined as the primary parameter of slope stability in cases where the potential slip surface runs along a geosynthetic. Besides, palm biodiesel contamination can affect the geotechnical properties of foundation soils. In this study, interface interaction between soil and various geosynthetics, namely A, B, and C was investigated in term of shear strength parameters. The type of palm oil used for contaminating is B20 palm biodiesel ranging from 3% to 10% by the weight of dry sand. The objective of this research is to assess the shear strength parameters at the soil-geosynthetic interface. For this purpose, test specimens of both clean and contaminated sample with different geosynthetics were tested under direct shear test in order to evaluate their shear strength. Results were analyzed based on the behavior of three different geosynthetics as reinforcements and contaminated mining sand. The results of direct shear tests indicate that shear strength varies considerably along the soil-geosynthetic interface. It was found that the shear strength of reinforced sand with geosynthetic C was increased by almost 1.3 times as compared to that of the unreinforced test specimen. A notable discovery is that the reinforced sand with geosynthetic C could improve the shear strength of the soil sample to protect the slopes, particularly shallow foundations on mining sand. However, further laboratory and field investigations are recommended. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-diesel is a sustainable alternative to fossil fuel, in particular if the input materials are not edible. This paper considers the production of bio-diesel from rubber seeds, which are currently viewed as a waste product and discarded by farmers. We investigate whether technological innovations in local pre-processing at individual farms and oil production via mobile processing units (MPUs) visiting villages, makes bio-diesel production profitable for groups of farmers. A mixed integer programming model optimizing supply chain decisions is developed and applied to a specific case in Indonesia. We find that operating the relatively expensive MPUs at maximum capacity is essential for economic sustainability. Furthermore, variations in the price of bio-diesel affect the profitability and governments may consider offering minimum price guarantees. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The research for new alternative energy sources has encouraged the study of different raw materials for the production of biodiesel. This work evaluated the use of murumuru (Astrocaryum murumuru Mart.) butter, and oils of buriti (Mauritia flexuosa Mart.) and pracaxi (Pentaclethra macroloba (Willd.) Kuntze) for biodiesel production by homogeneous alkaline transesterification. It was also studied their thermal stability by thermal gravimetric analysis (TG/DTG) and performed a kinetic study of the thermal decomposition of biodiesels using the Ozawa method. Classical physical and chemical analyses were used to characterize the oils and synthesized biodiesels. The results regarding the physico-chemical properties of the biodiesels were consistent with the values specified by Brazilian, American and European standards. Pracaxi biodiesel was thermally more stable than buriti and murumuru biodiesels. Due to their low decomposition temperatures, buriti and murumuru biodiesels showed high volatility, a very important feature associated with improved combustion properties, allowing their application in diesel engines. The values obtained for the activation energy of the thermal decomposition process of biodiesels confirmed that pracaxi biodiesel possesses greater thermal stability among the species studied. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.), a common winter annual weed species in North America, has received attention in recent years as a potential oilseed feedstock for biofuel production but little is known about best practices for its production as a managed crop. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine optimum sowing date to maximize pennycress yield, oil content, and crude protein. Four field experiments with 10 unique sowing and harvest dates over 3 crop years were conducted in Morris, MN, USA. Pennycress was no-till seeded from late August to late October at a rate of 6.7 kg ha−1. Seed yield averaged between 99 and 1109 kg ha−1 when sown in late October and early September, respectively, while oil content for the same sowing period averaged between 26.8 and 36.3%, respectively. Yield was not related to in-season environmental variables, such as cumulative precipitation, soil temperature at planting, or accumulated photohydrothermal time. However, oil content was maximized under greater precipitation (r2 = 0.86), warmer soil temperatures (r2 = 0.62) and greater photohydrothermal time when modeled at 2, 4, 6, 8, 25, 50 and 100 cm soil depths (between r2 = 0.53 to r2 = 0.85). Results indicate that environment conditions favoring a long maturation period increased oil accumulation in seeds. Conversely, a longer growth period reduced seed crude protein. Although pennycress protein is expected to have industrial uses, managing for yield and oil content is preferred. Therefore sowing pennycress in late August through September in the northern Corn Belt will maximize yields and oil content. © 2016

AB  - Brazilian railroads transport over 490 million tons a year using diesel-electric locomotives. These locomotives emit several pollutants into the atmosphere and because of that, the railroads seek to reduce emissions and achieve global emission standards. Thus, it is important to analyze the environmental impact of the use of diesel and alternative fuels to reach environmental standards. This paper makes use of a method based upon the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) metrics to evaluate the locomotives’ eco-efficiency. The method was applied to Estrada de Ferro Vitória a Minas (EFVM). Different scenarios representing the exchange of fuel sources and technologies were developed, tested and analyzed. The impacts were evaluated by seven eco-efficiency performance indicators and compared with United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards. The results offered cost savings and emissions reduction opportunities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Yellow horn (Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge) seed oil methyl esters have emerged as the potential candidate for producing biodiesel. The present study was conducted on 15 yellow horn germplasm accessions to assess the variability in its seed morphological characteristic, oil content and fatty acid composition. Variations of seed dry biomass, seed coat weight, kernel dry biomass, seed length, seed breadth and seed thickness were significant (P < 0.01). These yellow horn accessions were mainly divided into two groups according to kernel percentage. One group mainly included XS-233 and XS-281 with heavy kernels, while the other was the rest of the yellow horn accessions with heavy seed coats. Wide variability in oil content (49.77%–68.30%) was observed among the 15 accessions. Oil content showed a negative correlation with seed coat weight (r = −0.519*). The palmitic acid (C16:0), oleic acid (C18:1), linoleic acid (C18:2), eicosenoic acid (C20:1) and erucic acid (C22:1) were the predominant fatty acids in the 15 yellow horn accessions. Meanwhile, a small amount of docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6) (0.33%) was detected in XS-272 accession. Iodine value, cetane number, density and kinematic viscosity of yellow horn methyl esters changed from 119.1 to 125.6, 46.0–47.6, 881.3–882.3 and 4.50–4.66, respectively. Accessions XS-202 and XS-253 were found most suitable for breeding as biodiesel genotypes. And accessions XS-203, XS-213, XS-222, XS-232, XS-271 and XS-281 may be preserved as potential biodiesel types. Such assessment can be utilized for yellow horn plantations established with promising genotypes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify and characterize industrial solid wastes generated by a biodiesel production plant in Brazil, as well as to present strategies for the management of these materials. This plant produces every year around 100,000 tons of biodiesel from vegetable oils and animal fats. The methodology of the study included technical visits, interviews with the operational and environmental management staff as well as analysis of documents, reports and computerized data systems. An approach to reduce the generation of hazardous waste was investigated. It was take into account the amount of raw material that was processed, reduction of landfill disposal, and the maximization of the their recycling and reuse. The study also identified the sources of waste generation and accordingly prepared an evaluation matrix to determine the types of waste with the higher potential for minimization. The most important residue of the process was the filter material impregnated with oil and biodiesel, requiring, therefore, measures for its minimization. The use of these residues in the production of ceramic artefacts (light bricks) was considered to be very promising, since no significant effect on the physico-chemical and mechanical properties of the artefacts produced was observed. Phytotoxicity test using seeds of Lactuva sativa (lettuce), Brassica juncea (mustard), Abelmoschus esculentus (okra), Chrysanthemum leucanthemum (daisy), Dendranthema grandiflorum (chrysanthemum) and Allium porrum (leek) were carried out. The results clearly show incorporation of the waste material into bricks did not influence relative germination and relative root elongation in comparison to control tests. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) is an emerging biofuel plant, of which its seed oil is suitable for biodiesel production. Curcin, a type 1 ribosome inactivating protein, is the major toxic protein found in jatropha seeds. Here we report the cloning and characterization of three curcin genes from J. curcas MD44. The Curcin 1 (C1) gene encodes a Type I curcin precursor containing 293 amino acid residues. The C1 gene is specifically expressed in the endosperm of jatropha seeds at late developmental stage. The Curcin 2A (C2A) gene encodes a Type II curcin precursor containing 309 amino acid residues and is mainly expressed in young leaves of J. curcas. The Curcin 2B (C2B) gene is another Type II curcin gene that is physically linked to the C1 gene. However, the expression of the C2B gene was not detected in leaves or seeds of jatropha plants growing under normal growth condition. A conserved 227-bp or 228-bp intron was identified or predicted in the 5′ untranslated region of the three curcin genes. A C1 promoter (−�2888�bp to +�293�bp) was identified to harbor all cis-elements that are required for full promoter activity in jatropha endosperm. The isolation of the three curcin genes and the endosperm-specific C1 promoter provide useful information and research materials for further functional study of curcin proteins and genetic engineering of J. curcas. � 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) of phorbol esters (PEs) from Jatropha curcas L. (JC) seed oil using methanol as the extraction solvent was optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). Jatropha curcas L. seed oil is an excellent feedstock for biodiesel production, in which the presence of major toxic factor (phorbol esters) has limited its industrial applications. The aim of this work is to prepare the nontoxic oil from Jatropha curcas L. whole seeds with the first phorbol esters removal step and the second oil extraction step. The Box-Behnken design was applied to optimize three key parameters in the first phorbol esters removal step including temperature (X1, °C), extraction time (X2, min) and liquid-to-solid ratio (X3, mL:g) for achieving a high extraction efficiency and minimal energy consumption. Ultimately, the optimized conditions were as follows: extraction temperature 36°C, extraction time 52 min and liquid-to-solid ratio 5.78:1. Among these three parameters, temperature had the most significant effect on phorbol esters extraction efficiency followed by extraction time and liquid-to-solid ratio. Maximum content of phorbol esters obtained were 0.33 mg/g Jatropha curcas L. seed in the first step and 89.20 ± 2.96% of seed oil could be recovered by n-hexane in the second step. A sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography method was also established to determine the phorbol esters content within 5 min, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.04 μg/g. Since the concentrations of phorbol esters were all below the limit of detection, most of the virtually phorbol ester-free (PE-free) oil was produced to extend the Jatropha biodiesel production chain for household chemicals, cosmetic or jet fuel preparation. Meanwhile, the phorbol esters enriched fraction (PEEF, 71.9 ± 0.3 mg/g) obtained from the first step can be utilized as value-added by-products in pharmaceutical and agro-pharmaceutical fields. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work, the production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from crambe oil by enzyme interesterification assisted by ultrasound was investigated. The experiments evaluated the effect of temperature, reaction time, methyl acetate (MA)/oil molar ratio, enzyme loading, catalyst reuse and influence of ultrasound. The best results were obtained at 60 °C, temperature at which the reaction reached equilibrium in 6 h. FAME yield was maximal at MA/oil molar ratio of 12 and the enzyme loading of 20 wt% (relative to oil mass) gave the best yields. The use of methyl acetate promoted the enzyme stability throughout successive cycles, with a decrease of only 10% and 8% in FAME yield and enzymatic activity. The results allow us to conclude that ultrasound reduced total reaction time and percentage of enzyme loading, when compared to the process without ultrasound. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The presence of high levels of free fatty acids (FFA) in oil is a barrier to one-step biodiesel production. Undesirable soaps are formed during conventional chemical methods, and enzyme deactivation occurs when enzymatic methods are used. This work investigates an efficient technique to simultaneously convert a mixture of free fatty acids and triglycerides (TAG). A partial soybean hydrolysate containing 73.04% free fatty acids and 24.81% triglycerides was used as a substrate for the enzymatic production of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). Whole-cell Candida antarctica lipase B-expressing Aspergillus oryzae, and Novozym 435 produced only 75.2 and 73.5% FAME, respectively. Fusarium heterosporum lipase-expressing A. oryzae produced more than 93% FAME in 72 h using three molar equivalents of methanol. FFA and TAG were converted simultaneously in the presence of increasing water content that resulted from esterification. Therefore, F. heterosporum lipase with a noted high level of tolerance of water could be useful in the industrial production of biodiesel from feedstock that has high proportion of free fatty acids.

AB  - Accumulating evidence suggests a deleterious role for urban air pollution in central nervous system (CNS) diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders. Microglia, the resident innate immune cells and sentinels in the brain, are a common source of neuroinflammation and are implicated in air pollution-induced CNS effects. While renewable energy, such as soy-based biofuel, is of increasing public interest, there is little information on how soy biofuel may affect the brain, especially in people with preexisting disease conditions. To address this, male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were exposed to 100% Soy-based Biodiesel Exhaust (100SBDE; 0, 50, 150 and 500 μg/m3) by inhalation, 4 h/day for 4 weeks (5 days/week). Ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (IBA-1) staining of microglia in the substantia nigra revealed significant changes in morphology with 100SBDE exposure in rats from both genotypes, where SHR were less sensitive. Aconitase activity was inhibited in the frontal cortex and cerebellum of WKY rats exposed to 100SBDE. No consistent changes occurred in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, nitrated protein, or arginase1 expression in brain regions from either rat strain exposed to 100SBDE. However, while IBA-1 mRNA expression was not modified, CX3CR1 mRNA expression was lower in the striatum of 100SBDE exposed rats regardless of genotype, suggesting a downregulation of the fractalkine receptor on microglia in this brain region. Together, these data indicate that while microglia are detecting and responding to 100SBDE exposure with changes in morphology, there is reduced expression of CX3CR1 regardless of genetic background and the activation response is atypical without traditional inflammatory markers of M1 or M2 activation in the brain. © 2016

AB  - The heating value describes the energy content of any fuel. In this study, this parameter was evaluated for different abundant materials in Morocco (two types of biochar, plastic, synthetic rubber, and cardboard as municipal solid waste (MSW), and various types of biomass). Before the evaluation of their higher heating value (HHV) by a calorimeter device, the thermal behavior of these materials was investigated using thermogravimetric (TGA) and Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses. The focus of this work is to evaluate the calorific value of each material alone in a first time, then to compare the experimental and theoretical HHV of their mixtures in a second time. The heating value of lignocellulosic materials was between 12.16 and 20.53 MJ/kg, 27.39 for biochar 1, 32.60 MJ/kg for biochar 2, 37.81 and 38.00 MJ/kg for plastic and synthetic rubber respectively and 13.81 MJ/kg for cardboard. A significant difference was observed between the measured and estimated HHVs of mixtures. Experimentally, results for a large variety of mixture between biomass/biochar and biomass/MSW have shown that the interaction between biomass and other compounds expressed a synergy of 2.37% for biochar 1 and 6.11% for biochar 2, 1.09% for cardboard, 5.09% for plastic and 5.01% for synthetic rubber. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microbial oil production has received significant attention as a potential precursor for the production of biofuels, oleochemicals and food products. In this study, six oleaginous yeasts, isolated from fruits, were selected based on their ability to accumulate high intracellular content of microbial oil (20–48% w/w of total dry weight). The highest content of saturated fatty acids was 68.7% (w/w), whereas the highest content of oleic acid was 62.7% (w/w). Furthermore, nutrient-rich hydrolysates produced via enzymatic hydrolysis of flour-rich waste streams generated by a confectionery industry were evaluated as fermentation media for microbial oil production via fed-batch bioreactor cultures using one of the most promising isolates, namely VV_D4. A total dry weight of 40 g/L with a microbial oil content of 39% (w/w) was produced by isolate VV_D4. Critical biodiesel properties were estimated based on the fatty acid composition and correlated with the international standards. The microbial oil produced by the new isolates could be potentially used for biodiesel production. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - To alleviate high friction and corrosive wear in piston ring and cylinder liner friction pairs lubricated with bio-oil, four kinds of coatings: Ni-P, Ni-P-MoS2, Ni-P-GO and Ni-P-MoS2-GO have been prepared via chemical nickel plating technology. A multi-functional engine piston ring-cylinder liner tribometer was employed to evaluate their tribological behaviors. Furthermore, the changes of the bio-oil under different frictional conditions were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results show that adhesive wear, scratching, spalling and mild wear took place respectively on the worn surfaces of piston rings with Ni-P, Ni-P-MoS2, Ni-P-GO, and Ni-P-MoS2-GO coatings. Ni-P-MoS2-GO coated piston rings showed excellent friction-reducing and anti-wear performance and subsequently have great potential for accelerating the application of bio-oil in IC engines. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, fast and efficient analytical methodologies were developed for quality monitoring of the content of jatropha methyl and ethyl biodiesels in blends with mineral diesel, and to monitor the presence of adulterants using mid-infrared (MIR) spectrometry allied to the method of multivariate control charts based on net analyte signal (NAS). The methodology of multivariate control charts consists of dividing the spectral signal of calibration samples into three vectors, namely NAS, interference and residual, generating three charts. The NAS chart monitors the quality of the analyte of interest in blends (biodiesel content, in this case), while the interference chart monitors the diesel quality, i.e., monitors the presence of adulterants or contaminants in the binary mixtures. The residual chart monitors the information or variations not modeled by the NAS and interference vectors. The validation of control charts in both models was done in two ways: (i) in relation to the biodiesel content in the biodiesel/diesel blends and (ii) in relation to the presence of contaminants in blends. In relation to the biodiesel content, sets of samples with biodiesel content in and out of control of the quality specifications were prepared for validation. In relation to the presence of adulterants, validation was performed by applying other sets of samples adulterated by the partial substitution of biodiesel in the blends by soybean oil and used frying oil (UFO) in the range of 0–30%, and by partial substitution of diesel by residual automotive lubricant oil (RALO) and gasoline, also in the range of 0–30%. The results of the application of multivariate control charts demonstrated satisfactory monitoring for the identification of samples of B7 blends in or out of quality specifications and identification of the presence of adulterants in blends. That is, the proposed methodologies correctly identified samples as in- or out-of-control. Therefore, the methodologies were shown to be effective for use by the supervisory board of such blends of these biofuels. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although the independent effects of the predictors of the yield in transesterification are well documented, there are still gaps in our current understanding of how specific process variables cumulatively influence the yield of biodiesel. In this study, a two-level Plackett–Burman experimental design was used to assess the set of active process variables that most decisively influence the yield of biodiesel in transesterification. The results of the model in which the parameters were entered at once show in decreasing order, the magnitude of the effect of the process variables on the yield was as follows: amount of FFA > weight of catatlyst > rate of stirring > duration of reaction > temperature > methanol for the ranges of values that were studied. In the sequential/nested ordinary least squares regression model, the order of importance of the predictors was almost maintained however the coefficients varied somewhat. This indicates that the level and the order of entry of variables within each level makes a fundamental difference to the results. The methanol-oil ratio had no influence on biofuel yield within the range of values studied. Overall, the adjusted model in which most of the variables had been taken into consideration explained approximately 94 % of the total variance in the data. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Abstract: This study aimed to assess the generation of biodiesel via enzymatic transesterification (commercial Candida antarctica lipase) using four types of oily waste from environmental sanitation, with the intention of utilising this waste not only to decrease the cost of biofuel but also to mitigate possible negative impacts on the environment. Using factorial experimental design (32), the best temperature and molar ratio (oil:alcohol) conditions were evaluated for each type of catalyser for the studied waste types. The best conversion (96.5 %) was obtained with the C. antarctica lipase (5 % w/w oil/24 h) and raw material from the grease trap at the university restaurant at 50 °C and a molar ratio of 1:9 (oil:alcohol). Graphical Abstract: Fats from industrial food grease trap, university restaurant grease trap, scum from the grease trap at the Wastewater Treatment Station and sludge from sumps and septic tanks were used as feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Sono-sulfated zirconia nanocatalyst supported on MCM-41 was prepared by an ultrasound-assisted impregnation/hydrothermal hybrid method. The effect of irradiation power was studied by changing power of the sonication (30, 60 and 90 W) during the synthesis which led to different physiochemical properties of the nanocatalyst. XRD, FESEM, EDX, FTIR and BET analyses exhibited smaller particles with higher surface area and less population of particle aggregates at highly irradiated nanocatalysts. The nanocatalyst irradiated at 90 W for 30 min showed a very narrow particle size distribution. About 59% of nanocatalyst particles were in the range of 1–30 nm. The performance of investigated nanocatalysts in biodiesel production from sunflower oil showed ultrasound-assisted synthesized nanocatalysts had higher conversion in comparison to non-sonicated catalyst. Biodiesel conversion in catalyst with 90 W and 30 min ultrasonic irradiation exceeded 96.9% under constant condition at 60 °C reaction temperature, methanol/oil molar ratio of 9:1 and 5% catalyst concentration. After five cycles, biodiesel conversion of non-sonicated catalyst was well maintained in a high extend (71.4%) while biodiesel conversion of non-sonicated catalyst barely reached to 43.5%. Among sonicated nanocatalysts, with increasing power of irradiation, the nanocatalyst represented higher conversion and reusability. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effect of metal contaminants Fe(III), Ni(II), Mn(II), Co(II) and Cu(II) on the stability of soybean biodiesel (SB) was studied in the presence and absence of alternatives binary and ternary blends. The blends were composed by alizarin (ALZ), as the alternative additive, tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) as well as the citric acid (CA) and their effectiveness on SB (B100) stability was evaluated via induction period to measure the synergistic effect, following by acid value and kinematic viscosity to measure the accelerate thermal oxidation. We find that even in small concentrations, the metals were enough to degrade SB in the absence of additives, in which Cu(II) showed the highest catalytic effect. However, we show that target blends, even at low concentrations, have great impact on SB stability compared to the effects provided by the individual additives (at highest concentration). This finding influence directly in the reduction of the final costs due to reduction around 70% of the total amount of additives used to stabilize the biodiesel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The novel method for biogenic component determination in liquid fuels by direct measurement of the 14C activity concentration via liquid scintillation counting (LSC) technique has been used in few laboratories worldwide. This paper presents results of the development of method for bio-component quantification in fuel mixtures in the Nuclear Physics Laboratory Novi Sad, Serbia, as well as their comparison to established methodology in literature with intent to define optimal parameters and measurement conditions for 14C determination in biofuels. Therefore, the purpose of the paper is to give comprehensive overview of optimal parameters such as scintillation cocktail and vial selection, fuel/cocktail ratio and best calibration procedure of liquid scintillation counter Quantulus 1220™, with practical information for laboratories that intend to develop this technique. Biodiesel produced from two different feedstock materials was mixed with two commercial fossil matrices to produce fuel blends containing 1–100% FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Esters), which were analyzed for calibration purposes. Analytical study of relation between the detected released energy and quench level led to establishment of calibration curves specific to the fuel types produced in this moment on the market in Serbia. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A series of tribological experiments have been conducted to characterise and study the formation of tribofilms derived from TiF3 and FeF3 catalysts impregnated in soot-contaminated lubricants. Results showed that inorganic fluorides reduced friction and wear in the specimen contaminated lubricants. With the best results observed when TiF3 was used. There were also indications that the frictional process, when coupled with the fluorides induced a structural change in the soot particles within the contact zones, contributing to the improved tribological performance. The key contributors to the formation of robust tribofilms were adsorption and tribo-chemical reactions. The better tribological response leads to a method for the design of engine lubricants to mitigate against the effects of soot contamination. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As ethanol and rapeseed oil are not miscible, tributyl citrate, 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), 2-methylfuran (2-MF), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), rapeseed oil FAME-biodiesel (FAME), 1-heptanol (HepOH) and 2-ethylhexyl nitrate (EHN) are used as green mixing agents or “ethanolotropes”. The area of existence of clear and monophasic mixtures as well as biphasic liquid/liquid solutions, determined in a previous work, are reported at 25 °C using ternary phase diagrams. In the present work, some of these ternary diagrams are completed by investigating their critical points (CPs). Further, the kinematic viscosity (kV) of different binary and ternary, clear and monophasic mixtures is measured at 25 and 40 °C and their phase behaviour is studied at 0, −15 and −20 °C. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments are performed on various samples at 25 °C and the results are discussed with respect to previous measurements including DLS, static light scattering (SLS), small and wide angle X-ray scattering (SWAXS) and conductivity. Close to the CP of the investigated systems, the highest scattering intensities (SIs) can be observed as well as a distinct increase of the slope of the kV versus the rapeseed oil concentration. Evaluating these results, the high viscosities can be associated with the formation of a rapeseed oil continuum. Further, the monophasic domain close to the CP can be considered as bicontinuous-like. For every used “ethanolotrope”, the mixtures meet the required ASTM D6751 standard for the kV of biodiesel. Thus, rules for possible adjustments to reach this standard by varying the nature and the quantities of the “ethanolotropes” are proposed. Ternary and binary melts with high amounts of rapeseed oil can meet the kV standard and are clear and monophasic below 0 °C or even below −15 °C. Binary mixtures of DMF or 2-MF with high amounts of rapeseed oil (70 wt%) show no phase transitions during several hours at −20 °C and form reversible, monophasic and clear gels. As the kV of these two binary mixtures is slightly above 6 mm2/s at 40 °C, they nearly meet the kV standard. Replacing ethanol by “ethanolotropes” like 2-MTHF or HepOH can lead to an increase of the monophasic region of these ternary mixtures at low temperatures. Moreover, this temperature dependence could be associated with the nanostructuring, since mixtures located in the bicontinuous-like regions seem to be more sensitive regarding their phase behaviour. © 2016

AB  - Biodiesel possesses some comparable physical properties to petroleum diesel in addition to its improved environmental benefits. Nonetheless, both fuels differ greatly with respect to their chemical compositions. Therefore, the compatibility of the materials, which are commonly employed in contact with diesel, must also be assured for biodiesel. This paper assessed the influence of sulphur-based curing systems on the resistance of nitrile rubber to soybean biodiesel. Formulations were prepared using high-acrylonitrile-content nitrile rubber by employing a two-level experimental design. The amounts of two different accelerators and sulphur were varied to achieve different types of vulcanisation systems. Thermal analyses, mechanical tests and microscopy analyses were conducted to evaluate the behaviour of the material after contact with biodiesel. The results showed that the choice of the accelerator played an important role on the resistance of the rubber to the biofuel, and crosslink density was not a key factor with respect to the resistance. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The blending ratio of biodiesel in petroleum diesel has become one of the most important parameters to ensure the quality of diesel/biodiesel blend. This paper presents a fast and simple method based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to determine the biodiesel content in diesel fuel. Different from the method reported in the literature, using a pair of two identical screen printed carbon paste electrodes, in the present work we used two electrodes made from 304 stainless steel with dimensions of 0.8×0.3 cm for the EIS measurements. Improved results were obtained in terms of sensitivity, stability of measurements, electrode reuse, and cost. In this procedure the charge transfer resistance is proportionally related to the biodiesel content, which is used to construct a calibration curve for the analysis of biodiesel content. The procedure was validated by an official method, using two samples, being one of them, certified through an official interlaboratory program of the Brazilian government (Interlaboratory Program for Biodiesel of National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (PIB)/ANP). Good results were obtained in terms of recovery (102.6 %-102.8 %), precision (coefficient of variation lower than 2.3 %), limit of detection (0.24 %) and limit of quantification (0.80 %). These results indicate that this method is sufficiently suitable as an alternative method to the official method for determining biodiesel content in commercial diesel fuel. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Multiple factors including climate change, price uncertainties, and geopolitical instability have prompted many industries to investigate the feasibility of replacing traditional petroleum-based fuels with biofuel alternatives. However, to make this transition successful, these new biofuels must be environmentally sustainable and the necessary support infrastructure must be in place to make the production, distribution, and storage of these biofuels technologically feasible and cost effective. Developing a value chain, spanning from feedstock production to distribution to end users, requires garnering buy-in from multiple stakeholders by demonstrating environmental, economic, and social benefits and incentives. Two critical factors are the environmental benefits achieved from the use of the biofuel technology and the degree of resilience of the value chain to emergent conditions to ensure steady supply to consumers. Moreover, different biofuel pathways have different costs, benefits, and risks which must be compared. In this paper, we describe how environmental sustainability can be modeled using life cycle assessment (LCA) and how the resilience of value chain initiatives can be modeled using a scenario-based decision model. We then describe how sustainability and resilience assessments can be integrated in an iterative, anticipatory LCA framework. These assessments can be used as the basis for a business case for various investments, as well as a means for promoting responsible innovations, with the aviation industry used as a case study. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The temperature of the coolant is known to have significant influence on engine performance and emissions. Whereas existing literature describes the effects of coolant temperature in engines using fossil derived fuels, very few studies have investigated these effects when biofuel is used. In this study, Jatropha oil was blended separately with ethanol and butanol. It was found that the 80% jatropha oil + 20% butanol blend was the most suitable alternative, as its properties were closest to that of fossil diesel. The coolant temperature was varied between 50 °C and 95 °C. The combustion process enhanced for both diesel and biofuel blend, when the coolant temperature was increased. The carbon dioxide emissions for both diesel and biofuel blend were observed to increase with temperature. The carbon monoxide, oxygen and lambda values were observed to decrease with temperature. When the engine was operated using diesel, nitrogen oxides emissions correlated in an opposite manner to smoke opacity; however, nitrogen oxides emissions and smoke opacity correlated in an identical manner for biofuel blend. Brake specific fuel consumption was observed to decrease as the temperature was increased and was higher on average when the biofuel was used. The study concludes that both biofuel blend and fossil diesel produced identical correlations between coolant temperature and engine performance. The trends of nitrogen oxides and smoke emissions with cooling temperatures were not identical to fossil diesel when biofuel blend was used in the engine. © 2017, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

AB  - Abstract: A significant problem of biofuels is their low oxidative stability, which could be improved by addition of synthetic antioxidants. Therefore, the monitoring of antioxidant content plays a crucial role in using of biofuels. In this work, the new method of voltammetric determination of synthetic antioxidant propyl gallate (propyl 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate) in biofuels using linear sweep voltammetry with a gold disc electrode as the working electrode was developed. In comparison with other published papers dealing with the determination of propyl gallate in food samples, voltammetric analysis of antioxidant under study in biofuels requires a completely different approach of determination due to the composition of these samples. The proposed method enables the determination of antioxidant in model samples with excellent results. Its applicability was verified by analysis of practical biofuel samples. Limit of detection 0.39 µg cm−3 and limit of quantification 1.31 µg cm−3 were obtained. The proposed method can be used to control of the quality of biofuels.

AB  - Lignocellulosic feedstocks corn stover, prairie cord grass, and switchgrass were subjected to ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX™) pretreatment and densified using extrusion pelleting and ComPAKco densification technique. The effects of AFEX™ pretreatment and densification were studied on the fast pyrolysis product yields. Feedstocks were milled in a hammer mill using three different screen sizes (2, 4, and 8 mm) and were subjected to AFEX™ pretreatment. The untreated and AFEX™-pretreated feedstocks were moisture adjusted at three levels (5, 10, and 15 % wb) and were extruded using a lab-scale single screw extruder. The barrel temperature of the extruder was maintained at 75, 100, and 125 °C. Durability of the extruded pellets made from AFEX™-pretreated corn stover, prairie cord grass, and switchgrass varied from 94.5 to 99.2, 94.3 to 98.7, and 90.1 to 97.5 %, respectively. Results of the thermogravimetric analysis showed the decrease in the decomposition temperature of the all the feedstocks after AFEX™ pretreatment indicating the increase in thermal stability. Loose and densified feedstocks were subjected to fast pyrolysis in a lab-scale reactor, and the yields (bio-oil and bio-char) were measured. Bio-char obtained from the AFEX™-pretreated feedstocks exhibited increased bulk and particle density compared to the untreated feedstocks. The properties of the bio-oil were statistically similar for the untreated, AFEX™-pretreated, and AFEX™-pretreated densified feedstocks. Based on the bio-char and bio-oil yields, the AFEX™-pretreated feedstocks and the densified AFEX™-pretreated feedstocks (pellets and PAKs) exhibited similar behavior. Hence, it can be concluded that densifying the AFEX™-pretreated feedstocks could be a viable option in the biomass-processing depots to reduce the transportation costs and the logistical impediments without affecting the product yields. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Waste cooking oil (WCO) can serve as a feedstock for producing biodiesel, which would not only address food security and waste disposal but also has the potential to reduce emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) and particulate matter of 2.5 μm or smaller (PM2.5). In this study, we assessed restaurant waste oil (RWO) availability in China and conducted life cycle analysis (LCA) of GHG and PM2.5 emissions of RWO-based biodiesel using the GREET model. The results showed that the amount of RWO in China varies between 0.56 and 1.67 million tons in 2013 and between 0.54 and 1.63 million tons in 2014. Life cycle analysis estimated reduction of GHG and PM2.5 emissions through the use of RWO-based rather than petroleum-based biodiesel of 82 kg CO2-Eq. (90 %) and 0.92 g PM2.5 (46 %) respectively per 100 km driven by busses in 2014 in Shanghai, China. Given the total amount of RWO available in 2014 in China, the potential mitigated annual GHG emission ranges, in China, are 1.51 ∼ 4.52 × 106 tons of CO2-eq and 16.94 ∼ 50.83 tons of PM2.5. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. as a bio energy plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family is gaining progressive importance over the last years. In 2012 and 2014 field experiments were carried out to assess the effects of cytokinins 6-Benzyladenine (BA) and Forchlorfenuron (CPPU) acting as plant growth regulators (PGRs). Number of flowers per inflorescence, female-to-male ratio of flowers, fruits per infructescence, fruiting rate, number of seeds per fruit, seed size and weight as well as seed oil content were determined. It was suggested that concerning effectiveness of exogenous application of PGRs the developmental stage of flower is very important. Due to that, special interest was laid on the age of inflorescences at the time of application. Our experiments revealed a strong dependence of cytokinin effectiveness on the developmental stage of flowering. So treatment of plants with 6-Benzyladenine at the beginning of flower formation (stage 1) significantly increased the number of male and female flowers per inflorescence, whereas treatment at an advanced flowering stage (stage 2) or at the stage of fully developed flowers (stage 3) had only slight or no effects. In contrast, fruit retention was progressively increased by treatment in stage 2 and 3. Application of Forchlorfenuron significantly increased female-to-male ratio in stage 1 flowers but showed no effects on stage 2 and 3. 6-Benzyladenine as well as Forchlorfenuron showed equal effects on number of fruit inflorescences treated in stage 1. Our results show a significant decrease in seed weight due to BA- and CPPU-application while kernel weight remained stable. Concerning fruits, clusters and oil yield per tree, BA-application showed significant increasing effects. This study indicates that 6-Benzyladenine and Forchlorfenuron can improve yield affecting parameters in J. curcas when the phenological stage of flowering at time of application is precisely considered. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Pyrolytic lignin, the water-insoluble fraction in bio-oil, often shows a high content and has strong intermolecular interactions with other compounds in bio-oil. In order to obtain pure pyrolytic lignin and facilitate the utilization of aqueous phase obtained from water extraction of bio-oil, methanol–water extraction method was employed to further separate the bio-oil water-insoluble phase in this paper. Different technologies, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance, were adopted to characterize the structures of pyrolytic lignins with different activities obtained through this method. Both the heating value and the polymerization degree of high-molecular-weight pyrolytic lignin were higher than those of low-molecular-weight pyrolytic lignin. The molecular weight distribution of high-molecular-weight pyrolytic lignin was relatively wider, among which the contents of dimers to pentamers all accounted for 12% –18%, while the low-molecular-weight pyrolytic lignin mainly consisted of trimers (75.38%). The pyrolytic lignins had similar basic structures, both of which contained syringyl and guaiacyl units, whereas the low-molecular-weight pyrolytic lignin had more abundant syringyl units, reactive carbonyl groups and hydroxyl groups. Meanwhile, thermogravimetric study revealed that the final char residue yield of low-molecular-weight pyrolytic lignin was lower than that of high-molecular-weight pyrolytic lignin. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rhodosporidium toruloides AS 2.1389 has been considered a promising oleaginous strain due to its flexible substrate adaptability, high lipid content, and coproduction of some pigments. In previous work, R. toruloides has shown good potential to directly convert crude glycerol into intracellular lipids. However, the difference in nutritional demand between cell growth and lipid accumulation was found to be a dilemma. Therefore, a glycerol-based two-stage process was proposed in the present work to separately meet the nutritional demand of both the cell proliferation phase and lipid accumulation phase. Factors that affect microbial conversion of glycerol into lipid were investigated, statistically analyzed, and optimized. As a result, 26.5 g L−1 biomass with 10 g L−1 lipid was obtained in the two-stage process. Lipid yield (0.20 g g−1) and productivity (0.083 g L−1 h−1) achieved were significantly higher than the previously optimized batch culture. In R. toruloides lipids, the dominant fatty acid compositions are palmitic acid (28.5%), stearic acid (12.9%), oleic acid (41.3%), and linoleic acid (12.8%). Phospholipids accounts for 0.63% in total lipid. Lipase-catalyzed methanolysis could achieve up to 95% biodiesel yield. The characterization of R. toruloides lipid suggests its great application potential for biodiesel and specialty-type lipid products. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Lubrication is one of the most essential requirements for proper working of internal combustion engines, and mineral lubricants are extensively used for that. However, their disposal causes environmental degradation. A logical solution for this may be achieved by using bio-degradable and environmentally acceptable lubricants. A few recent researches have focused on utilizing biofuels, which are primarily used as alternative engine fuels, as lubricants to address environmentally related issues with mineral lubricant. In this context, straight vegetable oils seem to be a promising option. The available literature suggests that 20 % biodiesel has superior effects on the lubricating oil properties compared to diesel when mineral oil is used as lubricant. Therefore, the study of the effect of infiltration of lubricant into the fuel side on the performance and emission characteristics on one hand and infiltration of fuel in the lubricant on the other have been considered in the present work for long-term engine operation. For that, the performance and emission characteristics of palm biodiesel blends with palm oil as lubricant were compared with those of conventional diesel fuel with mineral lubricant for 60 h operation. The variations in viscosity and density of both the lubricants for 60 h operation were also considered. Based on the comparative assessment of the considered fuel–lubricant combinations, it is concluded that the same B30 palm biodiesel fuel blend with palm straight vegetable oil as lubricant may be considered as the most suitable combination. This fuel–lubricant combination will surely reduce the dependency on fossil fuel to a large extent and earn more carbon credits. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - 1-Hexanol is a high-carbon bio-alcohol with higher cetane number and higher energy density than the popularly researched 1-butanol that makes it an attractive fuel for diesel engines. Studies are rapidly emerging on high-yield bio-synthesis of 1-hexanol from glucose and ligno-cellulosic biomass feedstock using engineered micro-organisms like E. coli and Clostridium species. Despite its favorable properties and promising prospects for production in bio-refineries, 1-hexanol has been barely investigated in engines. This study utilized three blends of 1-hexanol viz., HEX10, HEX20 and HEX30 obtained by mixing 10, 20 and 30% by vol. as blend component with diesel respectively. Engine tests were carried out at all loads to study the effects of 1-hexanol addition on combustion and emission characteristics of a direct injection diesel engine. Results indicated that addition of 1-hexanol to fossil diesel resulted in longer ignition delays with enhanced premixed combustion phase characterized by higher peaks of pressures and heat release rates (HRR) at the engines standard injection timing without exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). NOx emissions increased at high loads while smoke density reduced at all loads with increasing 1-hexanol content in the blends. Later tests were extended to investigate the effects of injection timing (21°, 23° and 25° CA bTDC) and EGR rates (10, 20 and 30%) on engine characteristics for all blends at high engine loads. HEX30 injected at 25°CA bTDC under 30% EGR presented the longest ignition delay with ≈2% increase in peak pressure and peak HRRs when compared to baseline diesel operation. HEX30 at similar conditions was also beneficial in terms of reduced smoke density by 35.9% with a slight penalty in NOx emissions by ≈3%. Biomass-derived 1-hexanol could be a promising and viable biofuel for existing diesel engines with some modifications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A feasibility study on utilization of non edible oil of Scleropyrum pentandrum was carried out to see its potential as a new source for biodiesel production. Nonedible oil seeds of Scleropyrum pentandrum have oil content of 55–60%. Transesterification of freshly extracted oil in the presence of anhydrous sodium hydroxide at a concentration 1% (w/v oil) and methanol-oil ratio of 40% (v/v oil) yields 90.8% methyl esters under conventional heating. Month old oil requires sulfuric acid pretreatment (esterification) before transesterification. The transesterified oil has a density 889–893 kg/m3; kinematic viscosity of 4.21–5.7 mm2/s; cetane index 46.03; pour point of −15°C and gross calorific value of 40.135 MJ/kg and oxidative stability of 2.35 hours. The properties are well within the Indian, European and American standard limits recommended for biodiesel except the oxidation stability, which can be improved by adding antioxidant additives. The engine performance studies of B10 and B20 blends of Scleropyrum pentandrum biodiesel (SP biodiesel) with statistical inference confirmed that it can be used as a fuel in CI engines without any engine modifications. The engine exhaust emission analysis showed that the emission of hydrocarbons can be minimized by at least 15–20%, CO emission by 15%, smoke opacity by 10–12% and moderately lesser CO2 and NOx emissions. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article addresses the question of whether the production and use of biofuels could be appropriate to support productive inclusion. After an overview of the main drivers of biofuels development in the last decade, the article analyses the Brazilian experience, the most ambitious programme to promote inclusive development through biofuel policy. It focuses on the institutional settings and its distributional effects, as well as the organisational dynamics in a semi-arid region, and concludes that even in a country like Brazil, with a long and successful tradition in biofuel policies, the productive inclusion of small-scale family farmers faces severe difficulties. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Sewage sludge liquefaction bio-oil is capturing extensive attention for its sustainability and easy availability. However, some limitations of bio-oil such as high viscosity and poor cold flow properties hamper its direct application in engines. Two microemulsions including ethanol-in-diesel (M1) and diesel microemulsion (M2) were produced to upgrade bio-oil. Adding ethanol in M1 facilitated bio-oil solubilization and improved fuel properties of bio-oil. Because of low viscosity and low pour point of ethanol, M1 with ethanol as polar phase produced a more promising biofuel with acceptable viscosity and better cold flow properties compared with M2. Through microemulsification in diesel, hydrophilic and hydrophobic bio-oil components may penetrate into the polar core and the continuous phase, respectively, while amphiphilic components mainly located at the interface. The hydrogen bonding between ethanol and hydrophilic bio-oil components could enhance solubility and improve stability. Besides, polar phase ethanol could also act as a solvent to dissolve more less-hydrophilic bio-oil components into the polar core. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The high-temperature reaction pathways of bio-oil oxidation were investigated by simulations of a 24-component bio-oil model using reactive force field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics. Evolution profiles of fuel, O2, and major products, including radicals, with time and temperature during the initial stage of bio-oil oxidation were obtained. Major products generated during the simulations are consistent with observations reported in the literature. A kinetic model obtained from the simulated bio-oil oxidation is able to predict a long-time evolution trend of fuel consumption. Reaction networks of five representative components of the bio-oil model were revealed. The bio-oil oxidation is initiated by a series of homolysis and H-abstraction reactions and then propagation reactions involving H-shift, H-abstraction, and β-scission reactions. Oxidation of the unsaturated C-C bond, ring reduction of the phenolic radical, and abscission of the -CO structure (decarbonylation) appear frequently. Reaction pathways obtained from the comprehensive observations of simulation results employing VARxMD are in broad agreement with the literature. This work demonstrated a methodology that ReaxFF molecular dynamic simulations combined with the capability of VARxMD for reaction analysis can provide useful insights into the reaction pathway of bio-oil combustion. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A multivariate approach was used for classification of fuel blends using the combined information from Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and stable carbon isotopes analysis by Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS). Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) were applied to the classification of biodiesel/diesel fuel blends containing 0–100% (v/v) of biodiesel. The LDA and PLS-DA methods were able to discriminate samples ranging from 10% to 100% biodiesel (v/v) using the combined information from FTIR and IRMS. Since the global trend is toward a gradual increase in the percentage of biodiesel in fuel blends, the technique presented in this paper could be an important development in improving the traceability and identification of different raw materials used in biodiesel production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - 2-Methyl tetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF) is one of the promising second-generation biofuel candidates, raising increasing interest because of the recent breakthrough in producing 2-MTHF from biomass. As a potential gasoline extender and renewable oxygenate, its high energy density and avoidance of competing with food make it attractive compared with ethanol. In the current work, the laminar burning characteristics of 2-MTHF-air mixtures are studied with varying equivalent ratios (0.88–1.43) and initial temperatures (333 K, 363 K and 393 K) at ambient pressure in a constant-volume vessel. The results are compared with ethanol and isooctane, a representative component in gasoline. The stretched flame speed, un-stretched flame speed, Markstein length, flame thickness, Markstein number, laminar burning velocity and burning flux are calculated and analyzed. The result shows that for most tests, the ranking of un-stretched flame propagation speed is ethanol, 2-MTHF and isooctane. The peaks of un-stretched flame speeds against varying equivalent ratios appear at Φ = 1.1–1.2 for three tested fuels. The Markstein length indicates that generally isooctane has the most diffusion-thermal stable flame than 2-MTHF and ethanol when Φ < 1.2 at 393 K. Ethanol shows the smallest flame thickness in most of the test points. The laminar burning velocity of 2-MTHF is much faster than isooctane and is comparative with ethanol, indicating its fast-burning property and potential of improving engine thermal efficiency. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - WOx promoted Pt/AlPO4-5 catalysts with varying Pt and W contents were prepared by wet-impregnation method and characterized. Catalysts with Pt to W weight ratio of 1:2 exhibited higher catalytic performance than the other compositions in deoxygenation of oleic acid (OA). WOx enhanced significantly the catalytic activity of Pt and enabled quantitative conversion of OA to linear alkanes (predominantly C18/C17) at a temperature as low as 280 °C. It changed the reaction pathway from decarbonylation/decarboxylation (DCO for Pt/AlPO4-5) to hydrodeoxygenation (HDO for Pt-WOx/AlPO4-5). It affected the particle size and redox behaviour of Pt. The enhanced H-spill over (by 14.8 %) and presence of strong acid sites (300 - 500 °C) are the cause for the high activity of Pt-WOx/AlPO4-5 catalysts even at lower temperatures. Partially reduced WOx activates OA and leads to the HDO product (C18). In the absence of WOx, Lewis acid sites of the support activate OA through the C=O group and Pt facilitates C−C cleavage and formation of DCO product (C17). © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Background: Microalgae have the potential to rapidly accumulate lipids of high interest for the food, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and energy (e.g. biodiesel) industries. However, current lipid extraction methods show efficiency limitation and until now, extraction protocols have not been fully optimized for specific lipid compounds. The present study thus presents a novel lipid extraction method, consisting in the addition of a water treatment of biomass between the two-stage solvent extraction steps of current extraction methods. The resulting modified method not only enhances lipid extraction efficiency, but also yields a higher triacylglycerols (TAG) ratio, which is highly desirable for biodiesel production. Results: Modification of four existing methods using acetone, chloroform/methanol (Chl/Met), chloroform/methanol/H2O (Chl/Met/H2O) and dichloromethane/methanol (Dic/Met) showed respective lipid extraction yield enhancement of 72.3, 35.8, 60.3 and 60.9%. The modified acetone method resulted in the highest extraction yield, with 68.9 ± 0.2% DW total lipids. Extraction of TAG was particularly improved with the water treatment, especially for the Chl/Met/H2O and Dic/Met methods. The acetone method with the water treatment led to the highest extraction level of TAG with 73.7 ± 7.3 μg/mg DW, which is 130.8 ± 10.6% higher than the maximum value obtained for the four classical methods (31.9 ± 4.6 μg/mg DW). Interestingly, the water treatment preferentially improved the extraction of intracellular fractions, i.e. TAG, sterols, and free fatty acids, compared to the lipid fractions of the cell membranes, which are constituted of phospholipids (PL), acetone mobile polar lipids and hydrocarbons. Finally, from the 32 fatty acids analyzed for both neutral lipids (NL) and polar lipids (PL) fractions, it is clear that the water treatment greatly improves NL-to-PL ratio for the four standard methods assessed. Conclusion: Water treatment of biomass after the first solvent extraction step helps the subsequent release of intracellular lipids in the second extraction step, thus improving the global lipids extraction yield. In addition, the water treatment positively modifies the intracellular lipid class ratios of the final extract, in which TAG ratio is significantly increased without changes in the fatty acids composition. The novel method thus provides an efficient way to improve lipid extraction yield of existing methods, as well as selectively favoring TAG, a lipid of the upmost interest for biodiesel production. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Butanol is thought to be a promising alternative biofuel for fossil fuels, which has four different isomers, i.e., 1-butanol, 2-butanol, iso-butanol and tert-butanol. Detailed kinetic analysis of H2effects on laminar rich premixed flames of these four butanol isomers are performed at atmospheric pressure and the H2chemical effects are emphasized. The detailed chemical mechanism for high-temperature oxidation and combustion of butanol isomers developed by Sarathy et al. [Combust Flame 2012;159:2028-55] which consists of 286 species and 1892 reactions was used in this study. The equivalence ratios for all the flames are kept constant to be 1.5. The chemical effects of H2additions on the four butanol isomers flames are separated from the H2dilution and thermal effects. The effects of H2addition on major species, intermediate stable species and radicals are analyzed and compared in details for different butanol flames. The rates of production of acetylene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and key radicals are given to obtain the responsible reactions during the butanol combustion with and without H2additions. In addition, the pathway analyses for these flames are presented and discussed. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The use of biodiesel and renewable diesel fuels in compression ignition engines and aftertreatment technologies may affect vehicle exhaust emissions. In this study two 2012 light-duty vehicles equipped with direct injection diesel engines, diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), diesel particulate filter (DPF), and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) were tested on a chassis dynamometer. One vehicle was tested over the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) cycle on seven biodiesel and renewable diesel fuel blends. Both vehicles were exercised over double Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Highway fuel economy test (HWFET) cycles on ultralow sulfur diesel (ULSD) and a soy-based biodiesel blend to investigate the aerosol hygroscopicity during the regeneration of the DPF. Overall, the apparent hygroscopicity of emissions during nonregeneration events is consistently low (κ < 0.1) for all fuels over the FTP cycle. Aerosol emitted during filter regeneration is significantly more CCN active and hygroscopic; average κ values range from 0.242 to 0.439 and are as high as 0.843. Regardless of fuel, the current classification of "fresh" tailpipe emissions as nonhygroscopic remains true during nonregeneration operation. However, aftertreatment technologies such as DPF, will produce significantly more hygroscopic particles during regeneration. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show a significant enhancement of hygroscopic materials emitted during DPF regeneration of on-road diesel vehicles. As such, the contribution of regeneration emissions from a growing fleet of diesel vehicles will be important. (Graph Presented). © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Diesel engines are important sources of fine particle pollution in urban environments, but their contribution to the atmospheric formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is not well constrained. We investigated direct emissions of primary organic aerosol (POA) and photochemical production of SOA from a diesel engine using an oxidation flow reactor (OFR). In less than a day of simulated atmospheric aging, SOA production exceeded POA emissions by an order of magnitude or more. Efficient combustion at higher engine loads coupled to the removal of SOA precursors and particle emissions by aftertreatment systems reduced POA emission factors by an order of magnitude and SOA production factors by factors of 2-10. The only exception was that the retrofitted aftertreatment did not reduce SOA production at idle loads where exhaust temperatures were low enough to limit removal of SOA precursors in the oxidation catalyst. Use of biodiesel resulted in nearly identical POA and SOA compared to diesel. The effective SOA yield of diesel exhaust was similar to that of unburned diesel fuel. While OFRs can help study the multiday evolution, at low particle concentrations OFRs may not allow for complete gas/particle partitioning and bias the potential of precursors to form SOA.

AB  - To design diesel engines with low environmental impact, it is important to link health and climate-relevant soot (black carbon) emission characteristics to specific combustion conditions. The in-cylinder evolution of soot properties over the combustion cycle and as a function of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) was investigated in a modern heavy-duty diesel engine. A novel combination of a fast gas-sampling valve and a soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SP-AMS) enabled online measurements of the in-cylinder soot chemistry. The results show that EGR reduced the soot formation rate. However, the late cycle soot oxidation rate (soot removal) was reduced even more, and the net effect was increased soot emissions. EGR resulted in an accumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) during combustion, and led to increased PAH emissions. We show that mass spectral and optical signatures of the in-cylinder soot and associated low volatility organics change dramatically from the soot formation dominated phase to the soot oxidation dominated phase. These signatures include a class of fullerene carbon clusters that we hypothesize represent less graphitized, C5-containing fullerenic (high tortuosity or curved) soot nanostructures arising from decreased combustion temperatures and increased premixing of air and fuel with EGR. Altered soot properties are of key importance when designing emission control strategies such as diesel particulate filters and when introducing novel biofuels.

AB  - This study investigates the costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of a commercial-scale, 2000 dry MT/day, red oak biorefinery designed to stabilize and upgrade pyrolysis oil into drop-in fuels. Stabilization improves the compatibility of bio-oil with crude refinery intermediate streams and equipment, but the costs of this process are not known. A discounted cash flow rate of return (DCFROR) analysis is conducted to evaluate the economic feasibility of the bio-oil stabilization biorefinery based on a 30-year plant life and 10% internal rate of return. Four economic scenarios representing different biorefinery configurations and byproducts are analyzed. The installed equipment cost for the standalone hydrocarbons (SH) is estimated as $277 million, and the minimum fuel-selling price (MFSP) for the SH scenario is evaluated as $2.85 per gallon. With mixed alcohols as a byproduct, the MFSP can be lowered to $2.77 per gallon or to $2.33 per gallon by colocating with a refinery. Sensitivity analysis of the system indicates that feedstock cost has the most significant impact on the MFSP followed by fixed capital cost, catalyst life, and product yield. Life-cycle analysis indicates that the GHG emission reduction potential of a bio-oil stabilization biorefinery is up to 66% compared to petroleumderived gasoline. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The aim of this experimental work is to figure out the optimized the combustion bowl geometry on a constant speed diesel engine for its efficient functioning with a novel biofuel. The novel biofuel considered for this research work was Cymbopogon flexuosus biofuel. To improve the performance level, 20% Cymbopogon flexuosus biofuel was blended with 80% of diesel fuel (C20-D80) and to further reduce the emission magnitude, 20 ppm of cerium oxide was added to the blended fuel (C20-D80 + 20 ppm). For this study four different combustion bowls were designed based on the keen literature survey. They were hemispherical combustion bowl (BB), shallow depth re-entrant combustion bowl (CB1), Toroidal re-entrant combustion bowl (CB2), Toroidal combustion bowl (CB3). Based on the experimental evaluation, the results have been discussed for low load and full load conditions for better understanding. Regarding the fuel modification, C20-D80 + 20 ppm resulted in better engine characteristics owing to combined effect of the oxygen molecule bearing fuel and superior thermal stability and activation energy of the cerium oxide nanoparticle. Of the various bowls considered for the tests, the combustion bowl CB2 showed superior performance and emission reduction compared with its competitors CB1, CB2, and BB. It could have ascribed to the better mixing rate, gain of swirl velocity and the turbulence level of the bowl. CB2 resulted in higher BTE and lower BSEC of 4.1% and 12.02% in low and full load conditions for C20-D80 + 20 ppm. Emission reduction observed was 17% of HC, 43.66% of CO and smoke emission of 12.28% at full load condition. Peak pressure at low load resulted in negligible change but at full load for CB2 10.08% rise was achieved. It was concluded that Toroidal re-entrant combustion bowl (CB2) was the most optimized combustion bowl for C20-D80 + 20 ppm cerium nano particle powered by a single cylinder diesel engine. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Studies are unanimous that the greatest fraction of the energy necessary to produce hydrous ethanol fuel (HEF), i.e. above 95%v/v of ethanol in water, is spent on water removal (distillation). Previous works have assessed the energy efficiency of HEF; but few, if any, have done the same for wet ethanol fuel (sub-azeotropic hydrous ethanol). Hence, a new metric called net energy factor (NEF) is proposed to calculate the energy efficiency of wet ethanol and HEF. NEF calculates the ratio of Lower Heating Value (LHV) derived from ethanol fuel, total energy out, to energy used to obtain ethanol fuel as distillate, total energy in. Distillation tests were performed batchwise to obtain as distillate HEF and four different fuel blends of wet ethanol with a range from 60%v/v to 90%v/v of ethanol and the amount of energy spent to distillate each ethanol fuel calculated. The efficiency parameters of a SI engine operating with the produced ethanol fuels was tested to calculate their respective conversion efficiency. The results of net energy factors show a clear advantage of wet ethanol fuels over HEF; the optimal efficiency was wet ethanol fuel with 70%v/v of ethanol. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuels are important alternative for fossil-based fuel but they have either relatively low density or high freezing point and viscosity. Here we reported a simple and efficient route to synthesis biofuel with density comparable to widely used JP-10 fuel as well as good low-temperature properties. Substituted diphenyl methane was synthesized by acid catalytic alkylation of lignin-derived phenols (phenol, anisole, guaiacol) with benzyl ether or benzyl alcohols, and MMT-K10 exhibits better activity than HPW, Amberlyst-15, and Al-MCM-41, due to the modest acid strength and open lamellar structure. High selectivity along with good-to-excellent conversion was obtained under optimized conditions regardless of different reactant used. Then the alkylated product was subjected to hydrogenation with the presence of Pd/C and HZSM-5, and interestingly, intramolecular cyclization reaction occurred to produce a large amount of perhydrofluorene as well as dicyclohexylmethane. Subsequently, biofuel with density as high as 0.93 g/mL and freezing point as low as −40.0 °C was obtained, which surpasses the state-of-art of biofuel reported. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fossil fuel crisis and depletion, environmental pollution and ever-increase in vehicle and transportation means have renewed the scientist’s interest in the world in order to look for potential alternative fuels, which are attractive such as biodiesel, bioethanol, DME and vegetable oils. Inedible vegetable oils such as coconut oil, Jatropha oil, linseed oil or animal fat are full of potential for using directly or manufacturing biodiesel. This work is carried out in order to study the four stroke diesel engine D240 performance characteristics fueled with preheated pure coconut oil (PCO), Jatropha oil methyl ester (JOME) and compare with diesel oil (DO). The test diesel engine performance such as power (Ne), torque (Me), specific fuel consumption (ge) and thermal efficiency (ηe) is determined, calculated and evaluated while using JOME, preheated PCO and compared to DO. The results show that, power (Ne), torque (Me) and thermal efficiency (ηe) while engine is fueled with JOME and PCO are lower, otherwise specific fuel consumption (ge) is higher than those of diesel fuel, the test engine performance are gained the best for JOME and PCO100. © IJRED.

AB  - Hydroxyalkylation/alkylation of biomass-derived 2-methylfuran with cyclic ketones (cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone) has great potential in synthesizing high-density biofuel. But the conversion and selectivity are still unsatisfactory because the in-situ formed water decreases the acidity of catalyst and induces side reaction. Herein, hydrophobic mesoporous resins with sulfonic acid group (PS) and fluoride sulfonic acid group (PCS) were synthesized by a simple solvothermal reaction and ion exchange treatment, which have good mesoporous structure with surface area of 300–700 m2/g. Notably, PS and PCS have better hydrophobicity and oleophilicity as compared to widely used sulfonic acid functional amberlyst-15 and fluoride sulfonic acid functional nafion-212. In the hydroxyalkylation/alkylation reaction, PS shows higher activity and selectivity than amberlyst-15 while PCS surpasses nafion-212. Furthermore, both PS and PCS have good recycling stability in consecutive 5 runs. After hydrodeoxygenation, two high-density biofuels with density of 0.819 and 0.825 g/mL were obtained. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 63: 680–688, 2017. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - With the alarming increase in vehicular population, there is depletion of fossil fuel availability. Hence to overcome the difficulties, alternative fuels are tested and used in parts of the world. One of the difficulties with usage of alternate fuels is their high viscosity in comparison to fossil fuels. To overcome this, preheating of biofuel is a good option as it makes the fuel less viscous. In our research, we have used a helical coil heat exchanger to preheat the inlet fuel using the engine’s exhaust gas, making the system more sustainable since no external energy is used. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of preheating device a simulation study has been carried for the ethanol based biofuels. For simulation work, a set of boundary conditions has been arrived based on the experimental analysis. The results from the experiment such as velocity of air and fuel inlet were utilized as input for simulation work. The simulation study was carried out using Fluent solver, to compare the effectiveness of proposed preheating device for the ethanol blends (E20 and E30). The simulations results are obtained for various temperature and pressure profiles for air outlet, fuel outlet & outer wall of preheating device. These were analyzed and a comparative study between ethanol blends. The result shows that the temperature profile of E30 is slightly higher than E20, this is solely due to viscosity of E20 being higher than E30. With the preheating device the fuel’s viscosity reduces which helps in better fuel flow and improved atomization. Also the preheating of ethanol leads to improve vaporization characteristic and hence the improved combustion can be accomplished. Hence preheating is a viable solution for in biofuels. The focus of the research is to validate the effectiveness of preheating device. © 2017 SAE International.

AB  - There is heavy dependence on fossil fuels for energy production. These are not only depletable but also are the main cause of emissions and global warming. Renewable energy and biofuels can play significant role in this concern. This research is concerned with the efficient production of biodiesel from Jatropha seeds. We designed and operated an efficient screw press for continuous production of biodiesel. The effects of many parameters which affect the oil yield from the press were studied in order to determine the optimum operating conditions for maximum yield. The objective of this paper is to obtain the optimum speed and preheating temperature of our screw press to get improved properties of extraction oil, minimum extraction time and minimum motor power. The present screw press is specially designed on laboratory scale. The influence of different motors speeds of 20, 60, 100 and 140 rpm and preheating temperatures 50, 75, 100 and 125 °C on oil extraction yield were investigated. The results show that extraction Jatropha oil by screw press is more efficient in producing Jatropha yield than other methods. There is a limiting minimum extraction temperature for reducing free fatty acid percentage in the produced oil. An extraction temperature of 75 or 100 °C at motor speed of 20 or 60 rpm give the maximum Jatropha extraction yield. These conditions also are related to low motor power and torque. © April 2017 IJENS.

AB  - Chemical plants, petroleum refining, and paper processing remain the largest users of combined heat and power (CHP), with great demand also coming from food processing, breweries, and biofuel producers. In 2014, Massachusetts' Erving Paper Mill turned to New Hampshire-based Waldron Engineering & Construction, which partnered with Maine firm Engineered Construction Services to supply a new gas-fired, gas turbine-based CHP plant. Built around a dual-fuel Solar Taurus 60 turbine and a 600-psig heat recovery steam generator equipped with Honeywell Eclipse duct burners, the plant now supplies most of the mill's power and all of its process steam. Emissions are kept low by a selective catalytic reduction system. The plant completed testing and entered operations, having met all the mill's targets for improving costs and efficiency. The case of SAIC Volkswagen's new CHP plant at its factory in Shanghai, China, supplied by MAN Diesel & Turbo, replaced a set of old, inefficient coal-fired boilers and helps reduce massive air pollution in the area while substantially improving efficiency and reducing power costs. The new plant supplies power and steam to both a car plant and a neighboring gearbox plant.

AB  - This work investigates the load limits of reactivity controlled compression ignition combustion, a dual-fuel concept which combines port fuel injection of low-reactivity fuels with direct injection of diesel fuel, in a medium-duty diesel engine. The experiments were conducted in a single-cylinder diesel engine derived from the multi-cylinder production engine. In this sense, the stock turbocharger and exhaust gas recirculation systems were replaced by an external compressor and dedicated low-pressure exhaust gas recirculation loop, respectively. Additionally, a port fuel injector was installed in the intake manifold to allow gasoline injection. First, this article presents some results highlighting the effect of the exhaust gas recirculation rate, gasoline fraction, diesel start of injection, diesel injection strategy and intake temperature on the emissions, performance and combustion development in a representative operating condition: 1200 r/min and 6.5 bar indicated mean effective pressure (25% load). Later, with the aim of showing the reactivity controlled compression ignition potential, the best results in terms of performance and emissions at 25% load are compared against the multi-cylinder diesel engine from 950 to 2200 r/min. Reactivity controlled compression ignition engine tests were developed taking into account limitations in nitrogen oxides (NOx) and soot emissions, in-cylinder pressure and maximum pressure rise rate. Finally, keeping the same constraints for testing, the load limits of reactivity controlled compression ignition concept are evaluated for all the engine speeds. Results suggest that reactivity controlled compression ignition allows fulfilling EURO VI limits for NOx and soot emissions without using selective catalytic reduction and diesel particulate filter aftertreatment systems at 25% load at all the engines speeds, providing better indicated efficiency than conventional diesel operation in most operating points. In addition, the maximum engine load that ensured the aforementioned constraints was around 35% for all the engine speeds, with a maximum indicated mean effective pressure of 8.8 bar at 2200 r/min. In this case, a strong reduction in carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbon (HC) emissions compared to the cases of 25% load was achieved at all the engine speeds. © IMechE 2017.

AB  - Physic nut (Jatropha curcas L) seed oil is a natural resource for the alternative production of fossil fuel. Seed oil production is mainly depended on seed yield, which was restricted by the low ratio of staminate flowers to pistillate flowers. Further, the mechanism of physic nut flower sex differentiation has not been fully understood yet. Quantitative Real Time - Polymerase Chain Reaction is a reliable and widely used technique to quantify the gene expression pattern in biological samples. However, for accuracy of qRT-PCR, appropriate reference gene is highly desirable to quantify the target gene level. Hence, the present study was aimed to identify the stable reference genes in staminate and pistillate flowers of J. curcas. In this study, 10 candidate reference genes were selected and evaluated for their expression stability in staminate and pistillate flowers, and their stability was validated by five different algorithms (ΔCt, BestKeeper, NormFinder, GeNorm and RefFinder). Resulting, TUB and EF found to be the two most stably expressed reference for staminate flower; while GAPDH1 and EF found to be the most stably expressed reference gene for pistillate flowers. Finally, RT-qPCR assays of target gene AGAMOUS using the identified most stable reference genes confirmed the reliability of selected reference genes in different stages of flower development. AGAMOUS gene expression levels at different stages were further proved by gene copy number analysis. Therefore, the present study provides guidance for selecting appropriate reference genes for analyzing the expression pattern of floral developmental genes in staminate and pistillate flowers of J. curcas. © 2017 Karuppaiya et al.

AB  - Biodiesel is a widely used fuel that meets the renewable fuel standards developed under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. However, biodiesel is known to pose a series of abiotic and biotic corrosion risks to storage tanks. A typical practice (incumbent system) used to protect the tanks from these risks include (i) coating the interior surface of the tank with a solvent-free epoxy (SFE) liner, and (ii) adding a biocide to the tank. Herein, we present a screening-level life-cycle assessment study to compare the environmental performance of a graphene oxide (GO)-epoxy (GOE) liner with the incumbent system. TRACI was used as an impact assessment tool to model the midpoint environmental impacts in ten categories: global warming potential (GWP, kg CO2 eq.); acidification potential (AP, kg SO2 eq.); potential human health damage impacts due to carcinogens (HH-CP, CTUh) and non-carcinogens (HH-NCP, CTUh); potential respiratory effects (REP, kg PM2.5 eq.); eutrophication potential (EP, kg N eq.); ozone depletion potential (ODP kg CFC-11 eq.); ecotoxicity potential (ETXP, CTUe); smog formation potential (SFP kg O3 eq.) and fossil fuel depletion potential (FFDP MJ surplus). The equivalent functional unit of the LCA study was designed to protect 30 m2 of the interior surface (unalloyed steel sheet) of a 10000 liter biodiesel tank against abiotic and biotic corrosion during its service life of 20 years. Overall, this LCA study highlights the improved environmental performance for the GOE liner compared to the incumbent system, whereby the GOE liner showed 91% lower impacts in ODP impact category, 59% smaller in REP, 62% smaller in AP, 67-69% smaller in GWP and HH-CP, 72-76% smaller in EP, SFP, and FFDP, and 81-83% smaller ETXP and HH-NCP category results. The scenario analysis study revealed that these potential impacts change by less than 15% when the GOE liners are functionalized with silanized-GO nanosheets or GO-reinforced polyvinyl carbazole to improve the antimicrobial properties. The results from an uncertainty analysis indicated that the impacts for the incumbent system were more sensitive to changes in the key modeling parameters compared to that for the GOE liner system. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - While there is ample scholarly work on regulatory science within the state, or single-sited global institutions, there is less on its operation within complex modes of global governance that are decentered, overlapping, multi-sectorial and multi-leveled. Using a co-productionist framework, this study identifies ‘epistemic jurisdiction’ – the power to produce or warrant technical knowledge for a given political community, topical arena or geographical territory – as a central problem for regulatory science in complex governance. We explore these dynamics in the arena of global sustainability standards for biofuels. We select three institutional fora as sites of inquiry: the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive, the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials, and the International Organization for Standardization. These cases allow us to analyze how the co-production of sustainability science responds to problems of epistemic jurisdiction in the global regulatory order. First, different problems of epistemic jurisdiction beset different standard-setting bodies, and these problems shape both the content of regulatory science and the procedures designed to make it authoritative. Second, in order to produce global regulatory science, technical bodies must manage an array of conflicting imperatives – including scientific virtue, due process and the need to recruit adoptees to perpetuate the standard. At different levels of governance, standard drafters struggle to balance loyalties to country, to company or constituency and to the larger project of internationalization. Confronted with these sometimes conflicting pressures, actors across the standards system quite self-consciously maneuver to build or retain authority for their forum through a combination of scientific adjustment and political negotiation. Third, the evidentiary demands of regulatory science in global administrative spaces are deeply affected by 1) a market for standards, in which firms and states can choose the cheapest sustainability certification, and 2) the international trade regime, in which the long shadow of WTO law exerts a powerful disciplining function. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - The efficient use of solid organic waste materials is an issue of particular importance for the wine industry. This paper focuses on the valorization of grape marc, the major component of winery organic waste (60–70%). Two methods were designed and compared: combustion to generate electricity, and the pyrolysis for the production of bio-char, bio-oil, and bio-gas. Each of these processes was analysed to determine their economic and environmental viability. The flow-sheeting software, ASPEN PLUS, was used to model the two cases. Data from the simulations was used to inform techno-economic and environmental analyses. Pyrolysis was found to be the superior method of utilizing grape marc from both economic and environmental perspectives. Both pyrolysis and combustion exploit the energy content of the waste, which is not recovered by the traditional treatments, composting or distillation. In addition to the production of energy, pyrolysis yielded 151 kg of bio-char and 140 kg of bio-oil per tonne of grape marc. These products may be used in place of fossil fuels, resulting in a net reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. However, the potential deleterious effects resulting from the replacement of the traditional treatments was not considered. Investment in either pyrolysis or combustion had a negligible impact on the price of the wine produced for wineries with an annual grape crush larger than 1000 tonnes. Composting has significant economic advantages in wineries with a small grape crush of less than 50 tonnes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Developing technologies for the production of biofuel from renewable resources is a field of interest for many researchers. Lipid extraction could be an important step in the microalgae biodiesel production process. Factors affecting intracellular lipid extraction from Chlorella sp. cultivated in outdoor raceway ponds were investigated; an optimized procedure for extraction of total and non-polar lipids using eco-friendly solvent combination of ethyl acetate and methanol was proposed. The effects of solvent, and extraction variables (temperature, time, ratio of solvent and biomass, ratio of ethyl acetate and methanol) on total lipid content, and lipid class were examined via single-factor experiments coupled with response surface methodology (RSM) using Box−Behnken design (BBD). The results revealed that the maximum lipid extraction yield was 18.1% obtained after extraction 120 min, extraction temperature 60 °C and M/EA ratio was 2:1. Fatty acid profiles of lipid were determined; palmitic acid (C16:0), palmitoleic (C16:1) oleic acid (C18:1), linoleic acid (C18:2) and linolenic acid (C18:3) are the most abundant fatty acids, indicating the great capacity of lipid extraction from microalgae for biodiesel production. © 2017 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - This work is a preliminary study for the development of a co-pyrolysis process of plastic wastes excavated from a landfill and used lubrication oils, with the aim to produce an alternative liquid fuel for industrial use. First, thermogravimetric experiments were carried out with pure plastics (HDPE, LDPE, PP and PS) and oils (a motor oil and a mixture of used lubrication oils) in order to highlight the interactions occurring between a plastic and an oil during their co-pyrolysis. It appears that the main decomposition event of each component takes place at higher temperatures when the components are mixed than when they are alone, possibly because the two components stabilize each other during their co-pyrolysis. These interactions depend on the nature of the plastic and the oil. In addition, co-pyrolysis experiments were led in a lab-scale reactor using a mixture of excavated plastic wastes and used lubrication oils. On the one hand, the influence of some key operating parameters on the outcome of the process was analyzed. It was possible to produce an alternative fuel for industrial use whose viscosity is lower than 1 Pa s at 90°C, from a plastic/oil mixture with an initial plastic mass fraction between 40% and 60%, by proceeding at a maximum temperature included in the range 350–400°C. On the other hand, the amount of energy required to successfully co-pyrolyze, in lab conditions, 1 kg of plastic/oil mixture with an initial plastic mass fraction of 60% was estimated at about 8 MJ. That amount of energy is largely used for the thermal cracking of the molecules. It is also shown that, per kg of mixture introduced in the lab reactor, 29 MJ can be recovered from the combustion of the liquid resulting from the co-pyrolysis. Hence, this co-pyrolysis process could be economically viable, provided heat losses are addressed carefully when designing an industrial reactor. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Yellow grease from restaurants is typically waste cooking oil (WCO) free from suspended food particles with free fatty acid (FFA) content less than 15%. This study proposes an approach to formulate a renewable, eco-friendly fuel by recycling WCO with diesel (D) and n-pentanol (P) to improve fuel-spray characteristics. Three ternary blends (D50-WCO45-P5, D50-WCO40-P10 and D50-WCO30-P20) were selected based on the stability tests and prepared with an objective to substitute diesel by 50% with up to 45% recycled component (WCO) and up to 20% bio-component (n-pentanol) by volume. The fuel properties of these ternary blends were measured and compared. The emission impacts of these blends on a diesel engine were analysed in comparison with diesel and D50-WCO50 (50% of diesel + 50% of WCO) under naturally articulated and EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) approaches. Doping of n-pentanol showed improved fuel properties when compared to D50-WCO50. Viscosity is reduced up to 45%. Cetane number and density were comparable to that of diesel. Addition of n-pentanol to D50-WCO50 presented improved brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) for all ternary blends. Brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of D50-WCO30-P20 blend is comparable to diesel due to improved atomization. Smoke opacity reduced, HC emissions increased and CO emissions remained unchanged with doping n-pentanol in the WCO. NOx emission increases with increase in n-pentanol and remained lower than diesel and all load conditions. However, NOx can be decreased by up to threefold using EGR. By adopting this approach, WCO can be effectively reused as a clean energy source by negating environmental hazards before and after its use in diesel engines, instead of being dumped into sewers and landfills. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The Department of Energy's Clean Cities program was created in 1993 to reduce petroleum usage in the transportation sector. The program promotes alternative fuels such as biofuels and fuel-saving strategies such as idle reduction and fleet management through coalitions of local government, non-profit, and private actors. Few studies have evaluated the impact of the program because of its complexity that include interrelated strategies of grants, education and training and diversity of participants. This paper uses a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach to evaluate the effectiveness of the program between 1990 and 2010. We quantify the effectiveness of the Clean Cities program by focusing on performance measures such as air quality, number of alternative fueling stations, private vehicle occupancy and transit ridership. We find that counties that participate in the program perform better on all these measures compared to counties that did not participate. Compared to the control group, counties in the Clean Cities program experienced a reduction in days with bad air quality (3.7%), a decrease in automobile commuters (2.9%), an overall increase in transit commuters (2.1%) and had greater numbers of new alternative fueling stations (12.9). The results suggest that the program is a qualified success. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Waste cooking oil (WCO)-for-biodiesel conversion is regarded as the “waste-to-wealthy” industry. This paper addresses the design of a WCO-for-biodiesel supply chain at both strategic and tactical levels. The supply chain of this problem is studied, which is based on a typical mode of the waste collection (from restaurants’ kitchen) and conversion in the cities. The supply chain comprises three stakeholders: WCO supplier, integrated bio-refinery and demand zone. Three key problems should be addressed for the optimal design of the supply chain: (1) the number, sizes and locations of bio-refinery; (2) the sites and amount of WCO collected; (3) the transportation plans of WCO and biodiesel. A robust mixed integer linear model with muti-objective (economic, environmental and social objectives) is proposed for these problems. Finally, a large-scale practical case study is adopted based on Suzhou, a city in the east of China, to verify the proposed models. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effects of H2/CO ratio in syngas from a biomass gasifier, the type of a Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalyst, addition of a reformer in a recycle mode, efficiency of CO2 removal, and co-feeding of biomass and natural gas on the overall thermal efficiency and costs for the production of FT liquid fuels from the biomass-derived syngas were analyzed using an Aspen Plus®-based process model. The overall thermal efficiency for biomass-fed processes was in a range of 41.3–45.5%. A cobalt catalyst-based FT process achieved slightly higher efficiency than an iron-based FT process mainly owing to the absence of water-gas shift activity on a cobalt FT catalyst. A proper amount of CO2 in the syngas can inhibit the amount of CO2 generated via the water-gas shift reaction in a FT reactor with an iron-based catalyst which yields a similar efficiency to a cobalt-based FT process. The lowest production costs were around $28.8 per GJ of FT liquids for the biomass fed processes with a reformer. However, the addition of a reformer in the gas recycle loop can improve the economics only when the operation of the plant is optimized for maximum fuel production rather than co-generation of fuels and power. A process with co-feeding of natural gas into the reformer can achieve more attractive economics than a solely biomass fed process. Co-feeding of biomass and natural gas each at 200 MWth for a total feedstock thermal energy input of 400 MWth reduced the costs of FT liquid production by about 30% to $19–$20 per GJ of FT liquids. However, production of FT biofuels would be economically viable only at very high oil price or if some premiums are considered for the production of green fuels and power. At an oil price of $60/barrel, production of FT biofuels in the process configurations considered in this study wouldn't be economically feasible. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The efficiency of oil extraction from Chlorella sp. and Scenedesmus sp. using different cell disruption and solvent system was investigated. The ultrasound cell disruption method showed the maximum oil extraction in both algae. Oil extraction with hexane resulted in maximum oil yield for both algae. The kinetic parameters were studied and the extraction followed the first-order kinetics. The activation energy and thermodynamic activation parameters were calculated for both microalgae and the results suggested that the extraction was endothermic, irreversible and spontaneous. The methyl ester yields by two-step transesterification and direct transesterification were 95 and 96% for Scenedesmus sp. and 89 and 92% for Chlorella sp. respectively. Both methods had similar net energy consumption suitable for industrial application. The methyl ester properties were analysed in comparison with those of American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D6751 standards. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Production of liquid bio-fuels (biodiesel and bio-oil) as well as activated carbon from one non-edible feedstock, apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) seed kernel was the main objective of the present research work. The oil was extracted from apricot seed kernel with a yield of 49.44% w/w of kernels. Potassium hydroxide-catalyzed transesterification of apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) seed kernel oil with methanol and ethanol was then applied to produce methylic and ethylic, respectively. Properties of the obtained biodiesels were evaluated and found conformed to ASTM D 6751 limits. The apricot de-oiled seed kernel was pyrolyzed in a semi-batch reactor for bio-oil production. The effect of the pyrolysis temperatures (350, 400, 450, 500, 550 and 600 °C), pyrolysis time (30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 min) and feed particles size (0.25, 0.40, 0.59 and 0.84 mm) on the bio-oil yield was investigated. The maximum production of bio-oil (43.66% w/w) was achieved at a pyrolysis temperature of 450 °C, 60 min pyrolysis time and a feed particles size of 0.25 mm. The bio-oil obtained under the optimal conditions was characterized by the elemental analysis, FTIR spectroscopy and column chromatography. The FTIR analysis of the produced bio-fuel indicated that it composes mainly of alkanes, alkenes, ketones, carboxylic acids and amines. Properties of the resulting bio-oil were analyzed in terms of calorific value, density, flash point, pH, acid value, pour point and refractive index. The properties were close to those of petroleum fractions and comparable to those of other bio-oils published in literature. Referring to the experimental results, the obtained bio-oil can be utilized as an important source of alternative fuel and chemicals. The chemical activation method by using sodium hydroxide as the activating agent was utilized to convert the bio-char into activated carbon. The effect of the process parameters including the activation temperatures (400, 500, 600, 700 and 800 °C), activation time (30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 min) and feed particles size (20, 30, 40 and 60 mesh size) on the yield, iodine adsorption number and surface area of the obtained activated carbons were investigated. The optimal activated carbon sample was obtained at 600 °C activation temperature, 90 min activation time and a feed size of 60 mesh. The resulting activated carbon showed good characteristics to be used as adsorbent in water purification as indicated by scanning electron microscope and FTIR spectroscopy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Energy is pivotal to the economic development of every nation. However, its production and utilization leads to undesirable carbon emissions that aggravate global warming which results in climate change. The agriculture sector is a significant user of energy. However, it has the potential to be a major contributor to Nigeria’s energy supply mix in meeting its energy deficit. More so, in the light of current and impending adverse effects of climate change, there is a need to contain GHG’s emissions. This paper focuses on bioenergy utilization as a climate change mitigation strategy and one that can, through effective waste management, enhance sustainable economic development in Nigeria. The paper employed a critical discourse analysis to examine the potential of the agricultural sector to provide biofuels from energy crops and other biomass sources. We conclude that Nigeria can reduce its GHG emissions and greatly contribute to global climate change mitigation while also alleviating its energy supply deficit if the agricultural and municipal wastes readily available in its towns and cities are converted to bioenergy. Such engagements will not only promote a clean and healthy environment but also create jobs for economic empowerment and a better standard of living for the people. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Unlike petroleum diesel, the chemical structure of biodiesel makes it prone to oxidation during long-term storage, thus involving fuel quality deterioration. Therefore, the addition of antioxidants is usually required to meet the quality standards for biodiesel commercialization. Synthetic sterically-hindered phenols have been usually employed for this purpose as free radical scavenging antioxidants. However, naturally occurring phenolics are also available, for example, in the bio-oil produced in the pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. In this work, the antioxidant potential of extracted fractions of lignocellulosic bio-oil has been evaluated. Different organic solvents were tested as extraction agents, acetate esters being the best ones for incorporating bio-oil antioxidant compounds into biodiesel. In the best case, the incorporation of a small concentration of bio-oil compounds (< 4 wt.%) led to an improvement of the biodiesel oxidation stability of 475% which, in our case, was enough to meet the European standard requirement. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Phenolic compounds in hydrolysate/pyrolysate and wastewater streams produced during the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel production present a significant challenge in downstream processes. Bioelectrochemical systems are increasingly recognized as an alternative technology to handle biomass-derived streams and to promote water reuse in biofuel production. Thus, a thorough understanding of the fate of phenolic compounds in bioanodes is urgently needed. The present study investigated the biotransformation of three structurally similar phenolic compounds (syringic acid, SA; vanillic acid, VA; 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, HBA), and their individual contribution to exoelectrogenesis in a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) bioanode. Fermentation of SA resulted in the highest exoelectrogenic activity among the three compounds tested, with 50% of the electron equivalents converted to current, compared to 12 and 9% for VA and HBA, respectively. The biotransformation of SA, VA and HBA was initiated by demethylation and decarboxylation reactions common to all three compounds, resulting in their corresponding hydroxylated analogs. SA was transformed to pyrogallol (1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene), whose aromatic ring was then cleaved via a phloroglucinol pathway, resulting in acetate production, which was then used in exoelectrogenesis. In contrast, more than 80% of VA and HBA was converted to catechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene) and phenol (hydroxybenzene) as their respective dead-end products. The persistence of catechol and phenol is explained by the fact that the phloroglucinol pathway does not apply to di- or mono-hydroxylated benzenes. Previously reported, alternative ring-cleaving pathways were either absent in the bioanode microbial community or unfavorable due to high energy-demand reactions. With the exception of acetate oxidation, all biotransformation steps in the bioanode occurred via fermentation, independently of exoelectrogenesis. Therefore, the observed exoelectrogenic activity in batch runs conducted with SA, VA and HBA was controlled by the extent of fermentative transformation of the three phenolic compounds in the bioanode, which is related to the number and position of the methoxy and hydroxyl substituents. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Turkey's ambitious Vision 2023 agenda foresees a significant growth in the country's aviation sector. However, forecasts for Turkey's jet fuel demand in the view of Vision 2023 are not available in the published literature. Also, there is no information about the country's potential bio-based jet fuel demand after 2020, when it is plausible to become a mandatory supplement to kerosene. As a result, for the first time in this study, semi-empirical models were generated to provide Turkey's jet fuel and bio-based jet fuel forecasts based on the country's Vision 2023 energy targets. These models were generated taking current market dynamics, business as usual, and the possibility of enhanced economic growth for Turkey based on Vision 2023 energy and economic targets. As a result, Turkey's jet fuel demand in 2023 was estimated at between 4.230 and 7.880 billion litres. Also, it was calculated that Turkey could need up to 0.307 billion litres of bio-based jet fuel in 2023, if its consumption becomes mandatory after 2020. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Screening of metagenomic library from Taptapani Hot Spring (Odisha) yielded a positive lipase clone (pUC-lip479). Sequence analysis showed an ORF (RK-lip479) of 416 amino acid residues which was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Optimum pH and temperature of purified lipase RK-lip479 were 8.0 and 65 °C, respectively, and found to be stable over a pH range of 7.0–9.0 and temperatures 55–75 °C. RK-lip479 could hydrolyse a wide range of 4-nitrophenyl esters (4-nitrophenyoctanoate, 4-nitrophenyldodecanoate, 4-nitrophenylpalmitate, 4-nitrophenylmyristate and 4-nitrophenylstearate), and maximum activity was observed with 4-nitrophenyldodecanoate. RK-lip479 was resistant to many organic solvents, especially isopropanol, DMSO, methanol, DMF, ethanol, dichloromethane, acetone, glycerol and ethyl acetate. RK-lip479 also showed activity in the presence of monovalent (Na+ and K+), divalent (Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, Hg2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Zn2+ and Ag2+ ) and trivalent cations (Fe3+ and Al3+). Yield of biodiesel production was in the range of 40–76% using various waste oils with RK-Lip479 under optimized conditions. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Sustainability guidelines and regulations in the United States often focus exclusively on carbon or petroleum reductions. Though some of these policies have resulted in substantial progress toward their goals, the effects of these efforts on other social and environmental externalities are often ignored. In this study, we examine the life-cycle air pollutant emissions for alternative fuel and vehicle purchase scenarios at a military installation near a typical urban area in the United States (U.S.). We find that scenarios which minimize petroleum use or greenhouse gas emissions do not concomitantly minimize criteria air pollutant emissions. We also employ social cost methodologies to quantify economic externalities due to climate change and health-related air pollutant impacts. Accounting for the social costs of climate change and air pollution from vehicle use reveals that criteria air pollutants may have a greater total impact than greenhouse gas emissions in locations similar to the urban area examined in this study. Use of first-generation biofuels, particularly corn grain ethanol, may reduce net petroleum use at the cost of increased total health impacts. More comprehensive policies may be needed to ensure that sustainability policies result in a net benefit to society. © 2016

AB  - Honne oil methyl ester which is derived from non-edible Honneoil was blended with petroleum diesel fuel and tested on the DI-CI engine. The experiments were conducted at different levels of operating parameters, viz. compression ratio, static injection timing, fuel injection pressure, load and blend. This study aims to determine optimal combination of engine operating parameters with objective of attaining better performance and lower emission. The multi-objective optimisation based on Genetic algorithm is performed which lead to multi pareto optimal solution. The performance parameters were BSEC, BTE and EGT. The emittants were CO2, CO, HC, NOX and smoke. The regression models for performance parameters and emittants as a function of the operating parameters are developed using Minitab. These models were used as a fitness function for optimisation. ANN model based on multi-layer perception was developed to predict the performance and emissions using the experimental data. Four different transfer functions were tried to develop the model and one which yields lowest mean absolute percentage error and highest prediction accuracy is chosen. Preprocessing of data is done by normalizing input data and logarithmic transformation of target data. Levenberg-Marqardt back propagation training algorithm trainlm is used with feed forward multi layer neural network. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, production of bio-oil and biochar from soapstock via microwave-assisted co-catalytic fast pyrolysis combining the advantages of in-situ and ex-situ catalysis was performed. The effects of catalyst and pyrolysis temperature on product fractional yields and bio-oil chemical compositions were investigated. From the perspective of bio-oil yield, the optimal pyrolysis temperature was 550 °C. The use of catalysts reduced the water content, and the addition of bentonite increased the bio-oil yield. Up to 84.16 wt.% selectivity of hydrocarbons in the bio-oil was obtained in the co-catalytic process. In addition, the co-catalytic process can reduce the proportion of oxygenates in the bio-oil to 15.84 wt.% and eliminate the N-containing compounds completely. The addition of bentonite enhanced the BET surface area of bio-char. In addition, the bio-char removal efficiency of Cd2+ from soapstock pyrolysis in presence of bentonite was 27.4 wt.% higher than without bentonite. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study presents an investigation of the ignition and pyrolysis kinetics of the two propanol isomers. Experiments are carried out behind reflected shock waves at average pressures of 3.5, 5.0, and 11 atm over a temperature range of 1150–1550 K. Oxidation experiments are carried out using mixtures with equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. Laser absorption measurement of CO is carried out near 4.6 µm on the basis of which a characteristic pyrolysis time scale is defined. By means of this pyrolysis time scale, the effects of reactor temperature, pressure, and fuel concentration on pyrolysis are established. Contrast is further made between the global kinetics of pyrolysis and purely oxidative kinetics during ignition. The measured ignition and pyrolysis time scales are also compared with predictions of three chemical kinetic models from the literature. The expected lower reactivity of iso-propanol relative to n-propanol during ignition and pyrolysis is observed. The study also reveals a distinctly higher global temperature sensitivity of the pyrolysis process (global activation energy > 60 kcal/mol) compared to the typical global activation energy of ignition (global activation energy in the range of 20–40 kcal/mol). This difference leads to a cross-over effect at a characteristic reactor temperature between ignition that is controlled by pyrolysis and one that is controlled by predominantly oxidative kinetics. While this is observed for the chosen molecular systems, the cross-over effect is a general feature of high-temperature fuel reaction kinetics. At lower temperatures the chemical time scales of predominantly pyrolytic reactions are much longer than the time scales of oxidative radical processes which dominate the ignition process whereas at higher temperatures the time scales of pyrolytic processes become shorter and dominate the global ignition kinetics. Selected CO concentration profiles obtained during pyrolysis are also compared with predictions of current chemical kinetic models, revealing varying degrees of agreement and discrepancies among the models. The study advances characterization of propanol combustion and demonstrates the use of global chemical time scales to characterize fuel pyrolysis kinetics. © 2016 The Combustion Institute

AB  - Two types of Animal Fatty Wastewater Sludges (AFWS 1 and 2) were analyzed and fully characterized to determine their suitability for conversion into biofuel. AFWS 1 was determined to be unsuitable as it contains 68.8 wt.% water and only 32.3 wt.% dry material, of which only around 80% is lipids to be converted. AFWS 2 has only 15.7 wt.% water and 84.3 wt.% dry material of which is assumed to 100% lipids as the protein and ash contents were determined to be negligible. The 4-dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) catalyzed esterification of AFWS with 1-butanol was performed in a novel batch reactor fitted with a drying chimney for the “in situ” removal of water and optimized using a non-conventional Doehlert surface response methodology. The optimized condition was found to be 1.66 mol equivalent of 1-butanol (with respect to total fatty acid chains), 10 wt.% of DBSA catalyst (with respect to AFWS) at 105 °C for 3 h. Fatty Acid Butyl Esters (FABEs) were isolated in good yields (95%+) as well as a blend of FABEs with 1-butanol (16%). The two potential biofuels were analyzed in comparison with current and analogous biofuels (FAME based biodiesel, and FABE products made from vegetable oils) and were found to exhibit high cetane numbers and flash point values. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recently, microalgae have been attracting a wide attention as a source of high-lipid feedstock to produce biodiesel. A total of twenty one halophilic microalgae were isolated from the hypersaline Bardawil lagoon North Sinai, Egypt. Nine of them were further characterized with respect to biomass and fatty acid productivities. Biomass productivity as cellular dry weight (CDW), fatty acid content and, consequently, fatty acid productivity of the chlorophyte Tetraselmis elliptica was the highest among alltested strains (0.122 g CDW L−1 d−1, 77.36 mg g−1 CDW and 14.1 mg L−1 d−1, respectively). Lipid fractionation showed that total lipids represented 12.96 mg g−1 CDW and neutral lipids represented 37% of the total lipids with corresponding iodine value of 70.3 g I2/100 g oil. In all fractions, C16:0 and C18:1n-9 were predominant, being as high as 31 and 20% of total fatty acids in neutral lipids, 26 and 24% of total fatty acids in polar lipids and 28 and 26% of total fatty acids in phospholipids, respectively. This study demonstrates that the halophilic microalga T. elliptica isolated from hypersaline water is a promising species for biodiesel feedstock. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigates the effect of using terpineol as an octane booster for gasoline fuel. Unlike ethanol, terpineol is a high energy density biofuel that is unlikely to result in increased volumetric fuel consumption when used in engines. In this study, terpineol is added to non-oxygenated FACE F gasoline (Research Octane Number = 94.5) in volumetric proportions of 10%, 20% and 30% and tested in a single cylinder spark ignited engine. The performance of terpineol blended fuels are compared against a standard oxygenated EURO V (ethanol blended) gasoline. It was determined that the addition of terpineol to FACE F gasoline enhanced the octane number of the blend, resulting in improved brake thermal efficiency and total fuel consumption. For FACE F + 30% terpineol, break thermal efficiency was improved by 12.1% over FACE F gasoline at full load for maximum brake torque operating point, and similar performance as EURO V gasoline was achieved. Due to its high energy density, total fuel consumption was reduced by 6.2% and 9.7% with 30% terpineol in the blend when compared to FACE F gasoline at low and full load conditions, respectively. Gaseous emissions such as total hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emission were reduced by 36.8% and 22.7% for FACE F + 30% terpineol compared to FACE F gasoline at full load condition. On the other hand, nitrogen oxide and soot emissions are increased for terpineol blended FACE F gasoline when compared to FACE F and EURO V gasoline. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Triglycerides represent a type of sustainable energy source and robust catalysts for triglycerides refining to biofuels are very challenging. Herein, we report supported ruthenium catalysts, optimized from group VIII metal catalysts, for the selective conversion of triglycerides to diesel-range alkanes under mild conditions. The catalyst supports and ruthenium loadings show significant impacts on the performance of ruthenium catalysts, and Ru/TiO2 with ruthenium weight loading of 1.68% is optimized for the reaction. Typically, the platform compound stearic acid could be directly converted, or via 1-octadecanol as an intermediate product, to n-heptadecane and n-octadecane in n-heptane solvent using the optimized Ru/TiO2 catalyst at 473 K and under 3 MPa H2. On the basis of catalytic and spectroscopic characterization results, large ruthenium metal particles are established as the preferred active sites for stearic acid conversion. The complete reaction network of stearic acid deoxygenation on flat Ru (0001) is investigated by theoretical calculations. It is revealed that different pathways run simultaneously during the reaction and the adsorbed acyl species C17H35CO* are the key reaction intermediates for the catalytic deoxygenation on Ru (0001). The removal of adsorbed CO by hydrogenation is the rate-controlling step contributing to the highest energy barrier within the reaction network. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Vegetable oil was examined to determine if high volume blends with No. 2 ultra-low-sulfur diesel could be successfully utilized in micro gas turbine engines. Property data, and atomization and micro-gas turbine engine studies were examined for blends of up to 75% by volume soybean oil with No. 2 ultra-low-sulfur-diesel (ULSD). Kay's and Grunberg-Nissan mixing rules were found to predict specific gravity and viscosity, respectively, based on composition to a high level of accuracy. For Kay's mixing rule the AADs were below 1%, while AADs for the Grunberg-Nissan equation stayed under 4%. Atomization tests showed an increase in cone angle of 18° for a 30-degree nozzle with a mixture of 50% soybean oil/ULSD over that of pure soybean oil. The pour point for blends of V50 and V75 were found to meet the ASTM D2880-13b Fuel Oil Specifications for gas turbine engines. For a V50 blend the spray angle was increased by 50% over that of pure SBO. The micro-gas turbine engine performed well for fuel blends up to 75% vegetable oil, with comparable engine efficiencies to that of ULSD. Engine efficiency and thrust increase with increasing RPM. The studies indicate that high volume blends of straight vegetable oil with ULSD are suitable in micro-gas turbine engines. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the combustion characteristics, performance and exhaust emissions of conventional diesel fuel and biodiesel produced from waste fish oil (WFO) and its blends (B25, B50, B75) were compared experimentally. A single cylinder E6 Ricardo engine was used to perform the tests under steady state conditions and engine load range. In-cylinder pressure, exhaust emissions, fuel consumption and also intake and exhaust gas temperatures were recorded during experiments to analyze the gathered data. Results revealed that waste fish oil biodiesel leads to higher in-cylinder pressure together with shorter heat release rate duration when compared to common diesel fuel. Also, more stable combustion without large cycle-to-cycle variations could be reached by using biodiesel and its blends. Analyzes showed that biodiesel has about 2.92% more gross thermal efficiency and about 1.1% lower combustion loss when compared with the diesel fuel, averagely throughout all engine loads. CO emission concentration for biodiesel and its blends is reduced with gentle slope (5.2–27%) while signiﬁcantly reduction occurred for UHC (11.6–70%). Oxygen content of biodiesel led to more efficient combustion and as result about 7.2% increase in CO2 averagely while NOx emission is increased also (1.9–12.8%) by using the biodiesel and its blends. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This research present an alternative raw material of rubber seed which is non-edible crops as a source to produce oil for biodiesel production in Thailand. The rubber seed powder was extracted with hexane at room temperature to give rubber seed oil with the yield of 24 wt%. The composition and key properties of the extracted oil were analyzed including fatty acid compositions, density, kinematic viscosity, flash point, water content and acid value. This high FFAs oil (5.20 wt%) was successfully transesterified by various heterogeneous catalysts such as CaO-based waste coral fragment, sodium metasilicate and CaO-based eggshell to biodiesel in high yield and high %FAME of >97% in single step. Thermal stability of biodiesel obtained from rubber seed oil was evaluated by using thermogravimetric analysis and compared with petrol-diesel fuels. The biodiesel obtained from rubber seed oil was examined and found to meet the EN 14214 standard for bio-auto fuel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study was conducted on thermal pyrolysis and thermal-catalytic pyrolysis using the AlMCM-41 catalyst with a Si/Al ratio of 50, as an alternative process for turning sunflower oil into biofuel. The catalyst was characterized by X ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption/desorption and total acidity by adsorption of n-butylamine, in which it was confirmed an obtainment of AlMCM-41 with an excellent surface area of 857.7 m2 g−1 and good total acidity. TG curves were used to determine the calcination temperature (450 °C) and the infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed a complete removal of the CTMA+. Two liquid fractions were obtained from the thermal and thermal-catalytic pyrolysis of sunflower oil: the first, named bio-oil, is a mixture of hydrocarbons similar to mineral diesel; the second, which was named acid fraction, is composed mainly of high acidity components. It was found by gas chromatography (GC/MS) and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) that the proportion of acid present in the fraction of bio-oil without catalyst is higher than the proportion of acids in the fraction of bio-oil with catalyst, which indicates that the deoxygenation of the products occurred. Thus, it can be noted that the thermal catalytic sample of the bio-oil features more appropriate results to the diesel range, indicating that the acid sites found in AlMCM-41 catalysts were effective for the oil pyrolysis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of the purification process on the stability of Jatropha curcas biodiesel. The biodiesel was obtained using a variety of purification processes: three wet methods with different drying processes (vacuum oven, conventional oven and anhydrous sodium sulfate) and one dry method (purification with adsorbent magnesium silicate). Biodiesel was characterized through the analysis of carbon residue, acidity index, infrared and gas chromatography. The composition J. curcas oil indicated 56.3 % of unsaturated fatty acids and 43.7 % of saturated fatty acids. Jatropha oil presented high quantity of saturated acids, which are less susceptible at oxidation. The biodiesel sample that was chemically purified (PUsq) presented better purity, indicating be the process more efficient in remove the residues of synthesis. Thermogravimetric curves of purified biodiesel by wet method, PUsq, with chemical drying using anhydrous sodium sulfate, and PUsv, with vacuum drying, showed the highest initial decomposition temperatures, indicating higher thermal stability. The carbon residue and infrared analyses suggested that contamination by catalyst residue is a determining factor in reduction of the oxidative stability of biodiesel. The oxidative stability was evaluated using Rancimat and pressure differential scanning calorimetry. Biodiesel samples showing better oxidative stability were purified using PUsq and PUsv, which obtained stability of 6 h using the Rancimat technique, the minimum limit set by Brazilian legislation, without the addition of antioxidant, suggesting that these methods least influenced the stability of biodiesel. © 2016, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - In this experimental work, ethanol was mixed with neat lemongrass oil (LGO) – diesel fuel blend and the effect of ethanol concentration on combustion, emission, and performance of direct injection diesel engine was investigated. Low concentrations of ethanol (2.5% and 5%) were studied in the blend of neat lemongrass oil-diesel blend. The test results obtained with these blends were compared with those obtained with diesel fuel. The tested blends yielded different performance, emission and combustion characteristics compared to diesel fuel. The ethanol blends resulted in a higher combustion pressure and heat release rate, brake specific fuel consumption and brake thermal efficiency than diesel and LGO25(75% neat diesel + 25% neat lemongrass oil) while they resulted in a higher NOx emission, CO2 emission and lower smoke, HC emissions. Further, it is observed that higher combustion duration and ignition delay period for LGO25-ethanol blends than neat diesel and LGO25 fuels. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel comprises fatty acid esters and is used as an alternative fuel for diesel engines. However, biodiesel has poor cold flow properties (i.e., CP, CFPP and PP) than mineral diesel fuel. This study aims to reduce the PP, CFPP and CP of coconut biodiesel (CB) blends using poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) additives and investigate their effects on single-cylinder four-stroke diesel engine performance and exhaust gas emission. DSC and TGA were used to observe crystal behavior and thermal stability of the biodiesel fuel blends. Engine performance and emission were analyzed by Dynomax-2000 software and gas analyzer, respectively. Results showed that 20% of CB blended with diesel and 0.03 wt% of PMA showed significant improvement in the PP, CFPP and CP. Other properties of B20 with additives met the requirements of ASTM D6751. The BSFC of B20 with PMA was reduced by 3.247%, whereas the BTE was increased by 2.16%, compared with those of B20. Burning B20 with PMA increased the NO emission by 2.15%, whereas HC, CO and smoke emissions were 19.81%, 13.35% and 3.93% lower than those of B20, respectively. Therefore, CB20 blend with 0.03 wt% PMA can be used as an alternative fuel in cold regions without compromising fuel quality. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae biodiesel has captured the attention as a clean renewable fuel for diesel engines due to their positive characterizations such as high productivity, fast growing rate and their ability to convert CO2 to fuel. This work investigates the use of microalgae biodiesel from Chlorella Protothecoides (MCP-B) as alternative fuel for Compression Ignitions (CI) engines. Engine performance and emissions along with the fuel properties of the MCP-B100, MCP-B50, and MCP-B20 were evaluated and compared with petroleum diesel (PD). Analysis of variance statistical test (ANOVA) was conducted to evaluate the significance of the differences between the parameters means. The results showed that MCP-B100 produces less emission compared to PD. Statistically significant differences were found in the engine brake power, torque, BSFC, exhaust gas temperature, CO, O2 and NOx when MCP-B100 and its blends were used compare to PD. MCP-B100 showed a reduction of 7, 4.9, 6.1, 28, 4.2 and 7.4% in brake power, torque, exhaust gas temperature, CO, CO2 and NOx, respectively. Contrarily, the use of MCP-B100 resulted in an increase of 10.2 and 15.8% in BSFC and O2, respectively compared to PD. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - SrO/SiO2 composite was synthesized in a few minutes by reacting Strontium acetylacetonate in benzyl alcohol with mm size SiO2 beads using microwave radiation under argon atmosphere. The current work illustrates the optimization of a one-stage method whereby Nannochloropsis microalgae is converted to biodiesel using direct transesterification by microwave irradiation, the SrO/SiO2 serving as a base catalyst. Microwave radiation accelerates the disruption of the microalgae cells, and eases the release of oil. The SrO/SiO2 has been characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron micrograph (SEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The activity of the catalyst particles in the transesterification reaction was studied using 1H NMR spectroscopy. The catalyst was reused for six cycles without appreciable loss in catalytic activity and the biodiesel yield of the Nannochloropsis microalgae was measured. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production, property, and utilization of un-preheated degummed/esterified mixed crude palm oil (DgMCPO/EMCPO)-diesel blends in an agricultural engine were studied. The results reveal that DgMCPO and EMCPO can be produced easily with costs comparable to diesel. They had a poor liquid phase and high viscosity. Through blending with diesel at maximum portions of 20 vol% (DgMCPO20) and 30 vol% (EMCPO30), clear liquid blends were produced. Almost important fuel properties of these blends met Thailand agricultural engine diesel standard with slightly higher densities and viscosities than diesel, significantly higher oxygen content than diesel, good cetane numbers, and slightly lower heating values than diesel. At 2200 rpm under loads in the range of 1.28–5.6 kW, un-preheated blends were able to well operate the engine as same as diesel. Comparing this with diesel; the blends resulted in slightly higher brake specific fuel consumptions (+4.5% and +5.0%), slightly lower brake thermal efficiencies (−0.9% and −1.2%), significantly lower levels of carbon monoxide (−33.7% and −33.2%), slightly lower exhaust gas temperatures (−5.1% and −5.5%), and significantly higher levels of nitrogen oxides (+8.9% and +15.9%); (all paired values, DgMCPO20 and EMCPO30 respectively). In conclusion, these blends are recommended as effective diesel substitutes for use in agricultural engines. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Producing biofuel feedstocks on current agricultural land raises questions of a ‘food-vs.-fuel’ trade-off. The use of current or former Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land offers an alternative; yet the volumes of ethanol that could be produced and the potential environmental impacts of such a policy are unclear. Here, we applied the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate model to a US Department of Agriculture database of over 200 000 CRP polygons in Iowa, USA, as a case study. We simulated yields and environmental impacts of growing three cellulosic biofuel feedstocks on CRP land: (i) an Alamo-variety switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.); (ii) a generalized mixture of C4 and C3 grasses; (iii) and no-till corn (Zea mays L.) with residue removal. We simulated yields, soil erosion, and soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks and fluxes. We found that although no-till corn with residue removal produced approximately 2.6–4.4 times more ethanol per area compared to switchgrass and the grass mixture, it also led to 3.9–4.5 times more erosion, 4.4–5.2 times more cumulative N loss, and a 10% reduction in total soil carbon as opposed to a 6–11% increase. Switchgrass resulted in the best environmental outcomes even when expressed on a per liter ethanol basis. Our results suggest planting no-till corn with residue removal should only be done on low slope soils to minimize environmental concerns. Overall, this analysis provides additional information to policy makers on the potential outcome and effects of producing biofuel feedstocks on current or former conservation lands. Published 2016.

AB  - In this paper we propose a multi-objective, mixed integer linear programming model to design and manage the supply chain for biofuels. This model captures the trade-offs that exist between costs, environmental and social impacts of delivering biofuels. The in-bound supply chain for biofuel plants relies on a hub-and-spoke structure which optimizes transportation costs of biomass. The model proposed optimizes the CO 2 emissions due to transportation-related activities in the supply chain. The model also optimizes the social impact of biofuels. The social impacts are evaluated by the number of jobs created. The multi-objective optimization model is solved using an augmented ϵ-constraint method. The method provides a set of Pareto optimal solutions. We develop a case study using data from the Midwest region of the USA. The numerical analyses estimates the quantity and cost of cellulosic ethanol delivered under different scenarios generated. The insights we provide will help policy makers design policies which encourage and support renewable energy production. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Decentralized power generation, using locally available biofuels from non-edible oilseeds, is an option for rural electrification in many developing countries. However, due to prevailing high price of non-edible oilseeds, such as Jatropha curcas, the cost of electricity generation is very high. This paper provides detailed financial analysis of straight vegetable oil (SVO)-based decentralized power project and proposes an innovative model for enhancing their financial viability. While for implementing agency operational cost recovery is the key for viability, affordable tariff is crucial for end-users. The paper attempts to estimate minimum desired price of electricity from the stakeholders' (producer and users) perspective using data gathered from selected operational SVO-based power generation projects in India. Analysis carried out in this paper indicates that operating the decentralized power plant at higher capacity utilization factor, by introduction of productive load, and differentiated tariffs for commercial and domestic consumers may not alone be sufficient to achieve the financial viability. The paper proposes an innovative integrated model of using biogas, obtained from the by-product de-oiled cake of non-edible oilseeds, as a feedstock for power generation, instead of using the SVO in engines. This reduces the fuel cost of power generation, thereby helping to bring down the tariff within the paying capacity of rural consumers. The main produce, viz. extracted non-edible oil, which was otherwise used as fuel for generating power, can be sold in local market for earning revenue, thereby enhancing the project’s economic viability. This paper sets forth the proposed integrated model as a viable biofuel-based decentralized power project for sustainable rural development in areas with adequate availability of oilseeds. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The non-recyclable fraction of municipal solid waste (MSW refuse) represents over half of the total MSW production in Europe, with an energetic potential of 1250 PJ/year, a similar quantity to the current potential for energy production from agricultural residues. Currently, there are no alternative uses for MSW refuse other than landfilling or incineration. Thus, it represents an important untapped resource for biofuel production in Europe. Standard attributional LCAs have not been able to capture some of the bioenergy interactions with the climate system and neither to properly assess the climate change mitigation potential of bioenergy technologies. This study aims to fill this gap and properly assess the impact of the production of biofuels from MSW refuse on climate change by applying several methodological improvements in a time-dependent assessment, i.e., an explicit consideration of biogenic carbon flows using a dynamic LCA and an absolute formulation of the cumulative and instantaneous climate metrics. Two diverging examples of current MSW management systems are selected as references against which to assess the potential climate benefit of biofuel production: with or without dominant landfill disposal and with high or low GHG emissions from the power generation sector. The results show that in countries with current negligible landfilling, the production of biofuels would lead to a clear climate benefit. For landfill-dominant countries, the climate benefit would only be temporarily achieved in the medium term as the impact of landfills on climate decreases in the long term. However, considering a progressive banning of landfilling promoted by other policies for environmental protection and resource efficiency, the results would become positive for both countries with climate change mitigation guaranteed by using MSW refuse for biofuel production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-hydrogenated diesel (BHD) produced from two different raw materials—palm oil fatty acid distillate and fatty acid methyl ester—was compared in terms of environmental impacts using the life cycle assessment (LCA) technique with the SimaPro 7.3 software. The energy consumption, greenhouse gas emission, and environmental impacts reported in unit points (Pt.) were assessed using the Eco-indicator 95, IPCC 2007, and CML 2 Baseline 2000 methodologies, respectively. The functional unit was 1 kg of biofuel product. The system boundary defined included three main processes in the bio-hydrogenated diesel production phase—catalytic hydroprocessing, separation, and upgrading. The results indicated that the energy consumption of bio-hydrogenated diesel production from palm oil fatty acid distillate was 1.26 times (or 9.69 × 10−3 MJ higher) that of the bio-hydrogenated diesel production from fatty acid methyl ester. On the other hand, the greenhouse gas emission from bio-hydrogenated diesel production from palm oil fatty acid distillate was 2.29 times lower than that from fatty acid methyl ester due to the palm trees absorption of CO2 for photosynthesis being greater than the amount released into the atmosphere during the oil palm cultivation stage. The major contributor was crude palm oil as a feedstock to produce either palm oil fatty acid distillate (physical refining) or fatty acid methyl ester (transesterification), which were about 93% and 84% of the total energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission, respectively. The results of environmental impacts showed that the bio-hydrogenated diesel production from palm oil fatty acid distillate was 1.37 times (2.05 × 10−12 Pt) greater than that from fatty acid methyl ester. Consumption of palm oil fatty acid distillate and fatty acid methyl ester in both processes made the largest contribution to most environmental impacts (99% of the total impact score was from both processes). The main impacts of both bio-hydrogenated diesel production from palm oil fatty acid distillate and fatty acid methyl ester were the terrestrial ecotoxicity potential, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity potential, and marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential. An essential factor which caused these impacts was the use of crude palm oil during the production of palm oil fatty acid distillate and fatty acid methyl ester. Therefore, fatty acid methyl ester was found to be a suitable raw material for bio-hydrogenated diesel production based on the economic evaluation and the lower environmental impacts during the production stage. This present work highlights the benefit of by-products as feedstock for alternative fuel production in order to increase the by-product marketing value. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Thailand has recently implemented the Alternative Energy Development Plan (2015–2036) aiming to reduce the dependency on conventional fuels, notably diesel from oil palm. To ensure sustainability of substituting diesel, this study aims to assess the environmental effects of three promising biofuels namely, conventional biodiesel or Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), Bio-hydrogenated diesel (BHD) and the newest alternative fuel, Partially Hydrogenated Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (H-FAME) compared to diesel in transport sector. The system boundary is “Well-to-Wheels. This study does not show a significant difference in the energy performances and environmental effects of the studied biofuels. The partial substitution of diesel by FAME, H-FAME and BHD can decrease fossil use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions significantly. In terms of global warming potential GWP, more than 100 million tonnes CO2eq would be reduced in the next 20 years according to the projection of 25% replaced conventional diesel consumption. To improve the performance in terms of resource use and GHG mitigation, the study results suggest encouraging the use of H-FAME and BHD as a good choice. Both these alternative fuels can be blended with conventional diesel more than 2 times compared with FAME. In the initial stage, substitution could start with implementing H-FAME and slightly reduce the use of FAME after which BHD could be implemented along with FAMEand H-FAME. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Butanol has received significant research attention as a second-generation biofuel in the past few years. In the present study, skeletal mechanisms for four butanol isomers were generated from two widely accepted, well-validated detailed chemical kinetic models for the butanol isomers. The detailed models were reduced using a two-stage approach consisting of the directed relation graph with error propagation and sensitivity analysis. During the reduction process, issues were encountered with pressure-dependent reactions formulated using the logarithmic pressure interpolation approach; these issues are discussed and recommendations are made to avoid ambiguity in its future implementation in mechanism development. The performance of the skeletal mechanisms generated here was compared with that of detailed mechanisms in simulations of autoignition delay times, laminar flame speeds, and perfectly stirred reactor temperature response curves and extinction residence times, over a wide range of pressures, temperatures, and equivalence ratios. Good agreement was observed between the detailed and skeletal mechanisms, demonstrating the adequacy of the resulting reduced chemistry for all the butanol isomers in predicting global combustion phenomena. In addition, the skeletal mechanisms closely predicted the time-histories of fuel mass fractions in homogeneous compression-ignition engine simulations. The performance of each butanol isomer was additionally compared with that of a gasoline surrogate with an antiknock index of 87 in a homogeneous compression-ignition engine simulation. The gasoline surrogate was consumed faster than any of the butanol isomers, with tert-butanol exhibiting the slowest fuel consumption rate. While n-butanol and isobutanol displayed the most similar consumption profiles relative to the gasoline surrogate, the two literature chemical kinetic models predicted different orderings. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The successful implementation of innovative fuels relies on many factors and requires a precise description of the combustion characteristics. In practice, traditional indicators, such as octane or cetane numbers, are used. Obtaining these numbers however requires a specific setup. Moreover, they are not sufficient to predict the combustion timing for innovative concepts, such as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI). Evaluating and reporting the characteristics of new fuels is therefore challenging. Using a regular diesel engine converted to HCCI operation, we developed a screening methodology to easily characterize and present key features of new fuels. This paper describes the methodology and then applies it to new fuels produced from biomass: valeric biofuels. The methodology presented in this study intends to bridge the work on fundamental chemical kinetics with conventional engine experiments. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) is one of the technical feasible biofuel technologies. It produces jet fuel from sugary, starchy, and lignocellulosic biomass, such as sugarcane, corn grain, and switchgrass, via fermentation of sugars to ethanol or other alcohols. This study assesses the ATJ biofuel production pathway for these three biomass feedstocks, and advances existing techno-economic analyses of biofuels in three ways. First, we incorporate technical uncertainty for all by-products and co-products though statistical linkages between conversion efficiencies and input and output levels. Second, future price uncertainty is based on case-by-case time-series estimation, and a local sensitivity analysis is conducted with respect to each uncertain variable. Third, breakeven price distributions are developed to communicate the inherent uncertainty in breakeven price. This research also considers uncertainties in utility input requirements, fuel and by-product outputs, as well as price uncertainties for all major inputs, products, and co-products. All analyses are done from the perspective of a private firm. Results: The stochastic dominance results of net present values (NPV) and breakeven price distributions show that sugarcane is the lowest cost feedstock over the entire range of uncertainty with the least risks, followed by corn grain and switchgrass, with the mean breakeven jet fuel prices being $0.96/L ($3.65/gal), $1.01/L ($3.84/gal), and $1.38/L ($5.21/gal), respectively. The variation of revenues from by-products in corn grain pathway can significantly impact its profitability. Sensitivity analyses show that technical uncertainty significantly impacts breakeven price and NPV distributions. Conclusions: Technical uncertainty is critical in determining the economic performance of the ATJ fuel pathway. Technical uncertainty needs to be considered in future economic analyses. The variation of revenues from by-products plays a significant role in profitability. With the distribution of breakeven prices, potential investors can apply whatever risk preferences they like to determine an appropriate bid or breakeven price that matches their risk profile. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Decreasing fossil fuel resources, coupled with the steady increase in energy consumption, have urged the research interest in renewable and alternative energy sources. Biodiesel is a well-known alternative fuel. Since India invests more on importing edible oils, the exploitation of edible oils for engine fuel is not affordable. Therefore, consideration has been redirected toward non-edible feedstock that does not rely on food supply. One of the challenging alternatives is the macroalgae. In the present investigation, nonedible toxic marine macroalgae species (Botryococcus braunii algal oil) with high calorific value and high FFA, which are abundantly available in India and are underutilized, have been selected as a feedstock for the production of biodiesel. Thus, marine macroalgae serve as a potential renewable raw material for biodiesel production. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this paper, the macroscopic spray characteristics of four next-generation biofuels, namely, hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), Palm oil methyl ester (PME), Soybean oil methyl ester (SME) and used cooking oil methyl ester (UCOME) were investigated in detail using a constant volume spray vessel, and benchmarked against reference mineral diesel (B0). During experiments, fuels were heated to 80 °C to achieve an engine-like environment before being injected at various compression ignition engine relevant operating conditions. The fuel spray tip penetration, spray cone angle and spray area were investigated analysing images obtained using a direct photography technique. Furthermore, a modified spray model was proposed to extend its scope to include alternative fuels by considering fuel density as part of the spray model. The results show that HVO with the lowest density of all fuels achieves the shortest penetration distance and the highest cone angle, resulting in a more distributed fuel-air mixture. All fuels have very similar spray areas for the same injection conditions, but the specific spray area per injected mass is highest for HVO followed by the three methyl esters. It was concluded that the fuel liquid viscosity was a significant factor on the observed air-fuel mixing process. The spray characteristics were compared with our engine test results and can be used to explain observed engine behaviour when fuelled with biofuels. © 2016 The Author(s)

AB  - Raw bio-oil produced from fast pyrolysis of pine woodchips was co-processed with standard Brazilian vacuum gasoil (VGO) and tested in a 200 kg⋅h−1 fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) demonstration-scale unit using a commercial FCC equilibrium catalyst. Two different bio-oil/VGO weight ratios were used: 5/95 and 10/90. Co-processing of raw bio-oil in FCC was shown to be technically feasible. Bio-oil could be directly co-processed with a regular gasoil FCC feed up to 10 wt%. The bio-oil and the conventional gasoil were cracked into valuable liquid products such as gasoline and diesel range products. Most of the oxygen present in the bio-oil was eliminated as water and carbon monoxide as these yields were always higher than that of carbon dioxide. Product quality analysis shows that trace oxygenates, primarily alkyl phenols, in FCC gasoline and diesel products are present with or without co-processing oxygenated intermediates. The oxygenate concentrations increase with co-processing, but have not resulted in increased concerns with quality of fuel properties. The presence of renewable carbon was confirmed in gasoline and diesel cuts through 14C isotopic analysis, showing that renewable carbon is not only being converted into coke, CO, and CO2, but also into valuable refining liquid products. Thus, gasoline and diesel could be produced from lignocellulosic raw materials through a conventional refining scheme, which uses the catalytic cracking process. The bio-oil renewable carbon conversion into liquid products (carbon efficiency) was approximately 30%, well above the efficiency found in literature for FCC bio-oil upgrading. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Biodiesel is the potential substitute to petroleum diesel due to its renewable nature as it is derived from bio-based feedstocks. Both methanol and ethanol have been used as alcohol in transesterification reaction, but as methanol is normally derived from fossil resources, biodiesel produced cannot be termed as completely renewable. As per policies of government of India, Ethanol is being promoted as potential biofuel because it is derived from biomass feedstock. Along with its direct use as biofuel, ethanol can also be incorporated as solvent alcohol in transesterification reaction. This work is an attempt to investigate the potential of ethanol in Karanja biodiesel production by analysis of kinetics of transesterification and its comparison with methanol transesterification. The result of experimental investigation shows that maximum yield of 88.7% and 77% was obtained for methanolysis and ethanolysis respectively at reaction temperature 60 °C, 9:1 molar ratio (alcohol to oil), 1.25 wt.% catalyst loading (KOH) and reaction time of 120 min. It was observed that rate constant and activation energy was 0.007105 min−1 and 20.19 kJ/mol for methanolysis respectively whereas same for ethanolysis was 0.006294 min−1 and 23.35 kJ/mol for ethanolysis. This shows that transesterification reaction proceeds slower when ethanol is used and more energy is required. Fuel properties of ethyl ester of Karanja Oil were found to be superior as compared to corresponding methyl ester. Still it is viable option from Indian prospective because Government of India is promoting the use of ethanol as a potential source of biofuel due to its renewable nature. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work demonstrated that triglycerides based vegetable oils were directly converted into cycloparaffinic and aromatic components in jet fuel by a three-step process. This process involved the catalytic cracking of vegetable oils into light aromatics over the zeolite catalyst (HZSM-5(80)), followed by the aromatic alkylation of light aromatics using the ionic liquid of [bmim]Cl-2AlCl3 and the hydrogenation of aromatics over the Pd/AC catalyst. The production of C8–C15 aromatics with an 86.2 wt% in the aromatic biofuel was achieved by the room temperature alkylation at 25 °C for 30 min. The carbon number distribution in the resulting biofuels was readily adjustable to the desired range by varying the reaction time. The aromatic and cycloparaffinic biofuels obtained basically meet the requirements of jet fuels based on the combustion heat, the H/C mol ratio and the average molecular formulation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Technical and economic modelling and performance analysis of biofuel fired trigeneration systems equipped with energy storage for remote households were carried out. To adapt the dynamic energy demand for electricity, heating and cooling, both electrical and thermal energy storage devices were integrated to balance larger load changes. The proposed systems were modelled and simulated by using the ECLIPSE process simulation package. Based on the results achieved, technical performance and emissions from the system had been examined. The impact of electrical and thermal energy storages was also investigated. Finally, an economic evaluation of the systems was performed. It was found that for a household, the internal combustion (IC) engine based trigeneration/combined heat and power (CHP) system is more suitable for heat to electricity ratio value below 1.5 and the biomass boiler and Stirling engine based system is beneficial for heat to electricity energy demand ratio lying between 3 and 3.4. Techno-economic analysis of the modelled trigeneration systems showed efficiencies of around 64–70% and Break-even Electricity Selling Prices of around 313/MW h to 357/MW h when fired by biofuels. Results also indicated that the economic viability of this type of trigeneration systems is significantly improved by the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) and Feed-In Tariffs schemes (FITs) by up to 46%. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Electrolysis of biomass-derived carbonyl compounds is an alternative to condensation chemistry for supplying products with chain length &gt;C6for biofuels and renewable materials production. Kolbe coupling of biomass-derived levulinic acid is used to obtain 2,7-octanedione, a new platform molecule only two low process-intensity steps removed from raw biomass. Hydrogenation to 2,7-octanediol provides a chiral secondary diol largely unknown to polymer chemistry, whereas intramolecular aldol condensation followed by hydrogenation yields branched cycloalkanes suitable for use as high-octane, cellulosic gasoline. Analogous electrolysis of an itaconic acid-derived methylsuccinic monoester yields a chiral 2,5-dimethyladipic acid diester, another underutilized monomer owing to lack of availability. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Combustion of fossil fuels in the transport sector represents the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, governments are fostering diversification of energy sources by creating a set of governmental environmental policies and initiatives. In this context, biofuels are expected to represent a substantial part of source diversification, but it is necessary to assess the sustainability of their market to explore its effect on economical, technological, social, political and environmental dimensions. This research presents a dynamic simulation modelling of the Colombian biodiesel market and analyzes the policy support instruments for creating and managing it. A system dynamics based model is proposed to enable decision-makers to understand the influences between the different variables that describe the system and the impact of the biodiesel government policy in Colombia. The primary focus of this paper is to establish the characteristics of each sustainability dimension for the case of study and apply the system dynamics methodology with different types of validation. Finally, the Colombian market status and a sensitivity analysis are developed. The results show that in order to support the development of this sector, it is necessary to diversify the raw materials for the production of biodiesel in the medium term, which means raw materials without competence for the primary rainforest or competition with food productive lands. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Secondary organic aerosol (SOA), formed in the photooxidation of diesel fuel, biodiesel fuel, and 20% biodiesel fuel/80% diesel fuel mixture, are prepared under high-NOx conditions in the presence and absence of sulfur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3), and relative humidity (RH). The composition of condensed-phase organic compounds in SOA is measured using several complementary techniques including aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS), high-resolution nanospray desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nano-DESI/HRMS), and ultrahigh resolution and mass accuracy 21T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (21T FT-ICR MS). Results demonstrate that sulfuric acid and condensed organosulfur species formed in photooxidation experiments with SO2 are present in the SOA particles. Fewer organosulfur species are formed in the high humidity experiments, performed at RH 90%, in comparison with experiments done under dry conditions. There is a strong overlap of organosulfur species observed in this study with previous field and chamber studies of SOA. Many MS peaks of organosulfates (R-OS(O)2OH) previously designated as biogenic or of unknown origin in field studies might have originated from anthropogenic sources, such as photooxidation of hydrocarbons present in diesel and biodiesel fuel.

AB  - Gumweed (Grindelia squarrosa) has potential as a biofuel/biomaterial crop in arid lands. Two years of biomass production data at University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) field plots varied from 6700 kg/ha up to 14900 kg/ha with an average of 9950 kg/ha. Gumweed was planted in 4 m × 4 m plots at spacings of 15, 20, 25, 30, and 37 cm with three replications each. Acetone extraction of the ground, dried biomass yielded about 12.5% extractable hydrocarbons, called biocrude or crude resin. Approximately 52% of the biocrude extract consists of the C20 diterpene acid grindelic acid, which is also approximately 6.5% of the dried plant biomass. Additional carboxylic acids bring the total carboxylic acid fraction to approximately 68% of the biocrude. Also found in the biocrude is approximately 4.7% monoterpenes, including pinene, limonene, germacrene, elemene, and camphene. Acid-catalyzed methylation of the biocrude followed by hexane extraction and removal of the hexane and remaining methanol produced an approximately 72.5% yield of biofuel materials from the original extract. This mixture contained the methyl esters of the carboxylic acids, terpenes, and other unidentified compounds. When mixed with diesel fuel up to 20%, this blend produced a biofuel that met biofuel standards, although viscosity issues limit the percentage of gumweed biocrude that can be used in the blend. Grindelic acid methyl ester and a second ester produced during the acid-catalyzed methylation reaction (also identified as grindelic acid by GC-MS) eluted toward the end of a diesel fuel chromatogram. The Grindelia biofuel materials can be produced up to 1290 L/ha on a biennial basis, which is equivalent to 138 gal/acre, when extracted in hexane. This potential fuel can be produced on the arid lands of Nevada with minimal inputs of water, nutrients, and other agricultural services. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The possibility of application of black liquor for oil-riched algae cultivation is inspected. The results show that after ligin removal and enzymatic hydrolysis, the hydrolysate of black liquor contained 9.18 g L−1 of reducing sugar. When the hydrolysate was used for Scenedesmus obliquus (S. obliquus) cultivation, a 1.23 g L−1, 24.52%, and 23.20 mg L−1d−1 was obtained for growth yield, oil content, and the lipid productivity, seperately. The hemicellulose was extracted from black liquor and hydrolyzed. With addition of 3 g L−1 yeast extract, the growth yield of S. obliquus in hemicellulose hydrolysate increased to 2.7 g L−1, an increase of 26.8% than that of in glucose medium, oil content was 25.7% and the final lipid productivity reached 53.37 mg L−1d−1. The results indicate that black liquor can not be directly used by microalgae, but with approprate treatment, the carbohydrate of it could be recovered and uitilized for the oil production from microalgae. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

At local level, the short chain production of vegetable oils is currently important in terms of sustainability and use of rural area. This present work investigates the development of vegetable oils production chain in the Tuscany territory, focusing also to valorisation of the co-products (i.e., oil cake). The work is based on the study of the cultivation of rapeseed and sunflower, and the creation of an extraction plant based on cold-screw pressing technology, in order to obtain a raw vegetable oil suitable as biofuel. The German DIN 51623 standard was adopted to investigate the quality of vegetable oils obtained from different oil crops. Vegetable oils quality was evaluated by comparing the oil produced by a bench press at lab scale, comparing the results in terms of process yields and lipid fraction recovered. Due to the high phosphorous content of rapeseed oil, out of the DIN limits, an experimental procedure to remove P content and restore the oxidation stability of the oils was performed. The results showed a substantial P reduction by adding 2 wt% of P-removing additive. The oil cake properties were evaluated in view of its potential use for bioenergy production, in particular in terms of metals content.

AB  - As one of the leading global producers of palm oil, Malaysia has the potential to play a pivotal role in global palm oil diesel production. However, such potential will be difficult to exploit based on the industry’s current scenario. The new framework, known as “Strategic Dimensions and Implementation of the National Biofuel Policy in Malaysia”, is vague and the current level of implementation is limited. Thus, a comprehensive and well-structured policy framework for Malaysia’s palm oil biofuel industry is not only important in ensuring that its products, such as biodiesel, meet global standards but also to provide greater benefit to the industry as a whole. This paper presented a brief overview of German rapeseed biodiesel and US corn ethanol policies, aimed at providing a new perspective that can be adopted to reshuffle the existing policies governing the Malaysian palm oil biofuel industry. Throughout this paper, different strategies and policies designed to protect the biofuel industry in the US and Germany are discussed in this study. Such policies would be a good benchmark for the Malaysian government to emulate in an effort to improve its existing policies, strategies and blueprints relating to the palm oil biofuel industry development. This review also contributes to the oil palm industry, particularly in developing countries, by highlighting the importance of comprehensive policies and strategies in accelerating its development. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Emissions of black carbon (BC), a product of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels and biomass, are high in the Asia-Pacific region, yet input pathways and rates to the ocean are not well constrained. Atmospheric and riverine inputs of BC in Halong Bay (Vietnam), a hotspot of atmospheric BC, were studied at monthly intervals during one year. Climate in Halong Bay is governed by the monsoon regime, characterized by a northeast winter monsoon (dry season) and southeast summer monsoon (wet season). During the dry season, atmospheric BC concentrations averaged twice those observed during the wet season. In the sea surface microlayer (SML) and underlying water (ULW), concentrations of particulate BC (PBC) averaged 539 and 11 µmol C L –1 , respectively. Dissolved BC (DBC) concentrations averaged 2.6 µmol C L –1 in both the SML and ULW. Seasonal variations indicated that PBC concentration in the SML was controlled by atmospheric deposition during the dry season, while riverine inputs controlled both PBC and DBC concentrations in ULW during the wet season. Spatiotemporal variations of PBC and DBC during the wet season suggest that river runoff was efficient in transporting PBC that had accumulated on land during the dry season, and in mobilizing and transporting DBC to the ocean. The annual river flux of PBC was about 3.8 times higher than that of DBC. The monsoon regime controls BC input to Halong Bay by favoring dry deposition of BC originating from the north during the dry season, and wet deposition and river runoff during the wet season. High PBC concentrations seem to enhance the transfer of organic carbon from dissolved to particulate phase by adsorbing dissolved organic carbon and stimulating aggregation. Such processes may impact the availability and biogeochemical cycling of other dissolved substances, including nutrients, for the coastal marine ecosystem. Copyright: © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Process designs for prospective first-of-a-kind (FOAK) catalytic hydropyrolysis facilities converting woody biomass residues into "drop-in" transportation fuels were developed, including some designs incorporating CO2 capture and storage (CCS). The energetic, carbon, and economic performances of these designs were simulated and analyzed. Estimated greenhouse gas emissions for the resulting fuels are far below those of conventional petroleum-derived fuels. For plant designs with CCS, the biofuels are characterized by strongly negative emissions. The additional capital costs and energy penalties for CO2 capture range from modest to high, depending on the extent of capture employed. The fuel production cost at a commercial-scale FOAK plant without CCS corresponds to a break-even crude oil price of 95 $ per bbl. At a 120 $ per t CO2,eq. greenhouse gas (GHG) emission price, the plant design that would capture about half of the CO2 available for capture would have identical production cost as the design without any CO2 capture; in both cases the break-even oil price would be 28 $ per bbl. A design maximizing CO2 capture would produce fuels with a break-even oil price of 44 $ per bbl at this GHG emission price. The prospective economics of drop-in fuels from biomass produced via catalytic hydropyrolysis appear quite favorable relative to other biofuel production systems, but can only be confirmed via demonstrations at scale. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - A short review of the interrelation between the structure of fatty acids and the characteristics of biofuel obtained on their basis is represented. The fatty acid composition of yeast and phototrophic microorganisms' lipids was analyzed. Based on this analysis, the main parameters of biodiesel (iodine value, cetane number, density, and kinematic viscosity) that can be obtained from those lipids were calculated and compared with the existing standards. It was shown that the lipids of the Rhodosporidium toruloides VKPM Y-3349 yeast are the most suitable source for the biodiesel obtaining judging by the fatty acid composition and content. The ways to reduce the cost of microbial lipids in order to make them competitive material along with plant oils for biofuel production are discussed. © 2017.

AB  - Fast depletion of fossil fuels, rapid increase in the prices of petroleum products and harmful exhaust emissions from the engine are the driving factors in undertaking this research for finding the suitable alternative fuels. The present work deals with the Performance, Emission and Combustion characteristics of Biodiesel derived from acidic oil, which is a by-product of soybean oil refining process. Biodiesel was extracted using two-step esterification and transesterification process from the raw acidic oil. Different blends were prepared on the volume basis and one separate blend was prepared using 2% antigel additives in one of the combination. Tests were conducted with diesel and prepared blends on single cylinder, four strokes, multi-fuel, water cooled engine at compression ratio of 17.5 with different loading conditions. Present investigation indicates reduction in performance parameters as the engine is fuelled with different blends of biodiesel, but significant changes are observed with regard to combustion parameters and reduction in CO, HC. Further, increase in NOx, CO2 is observed during the use of similar blends of bio-diesel. Further the same engine is run with the addition of 2% Antigel Additives in one of the blend, BD20, which has given results which include significant reduction in BSFC, exhaust gas temperature, NOx percentage and integrated heat release rate. Simultaneously it is associated with increase in brake thermal efficiency, HC and CO percentage and peak in cylinder pressure. The prospective results have opened a new avenue of opportunity with regard to conversion of available waste oil to useful biofuel. © 2017 AMSE Press. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Aldehydes are major intermediates in oxidation and pyrolysis of hydrocarbons and particularly biofuels. While the high temperature oxidation chemistry of C3-C5 aldehydes have been studied in the literature, a comprehensive low temperature kinetics remains unaddressed. In this work, acetaldehyde, propanal, and 2-propenal (acrolein) oxidation was investigated at lowerature combustion condition (500-700 K). The isomer-specific product concentrations as well as the time-resolved profiles were studied using Sandia's multiplexed photoionization mass spectroscopy (MPIMS) with synchrotron radiation from the advanced light source (ALS). The laser-pulsed photolysis generates chlorine atoms which react with aldehydes to form the parent radicals. In the presence of excess oxygen, these radicals react with O2 and form RO2 radicals. The temperature-dependent product yields are determined for 500 K to 700 K and the competition between the channels contributing to the formation of each product is discussed. In acetaldehyde oxidation, the formation of the main products is associated with HO2 elimination channel from QOOH or direct H atom elimination from the parent radicals. In propanal oxidation, the most intensive signal peak was associated with acetaldehyde (m/z = 44) which was formed through the reaction of α′-R with O2.The α′-RO2 intermediate decomposes to acetaldehyde+OH+CO via Waddington mechanism and formation of five-member ring transition state. In 2-propenal oxidation, the unsaturated radical produced from α-R reacts with O2 to form the primary products. © 2017 by ASME.

AB  - Oleaginous yeasts have gained increasing attention as feedstock for biodiesel and other value-added products due to their high growth rates coupled with lipid accumulation abilities. However, the development of a technologically and economically sustainable biodiesel manufacturing process from yeasts necessitates the use of low-cost substrates and co-production of value-added by-products in a biorefinery model. Thus, the present study endeavors to concomitantly produce lipid and bioemulsifier from the isolated oleaginous yeast Pichia guilliermondii using inexpensive raw materials. Various low-cost raw materials, such as molasses, crude glycerol, distillery wastewater (DWW) and corn steep liquor (CSL), are tested to develop a judicious combination of substrates for the optimal production of yeast biomass and lipid for biodiesel application. Among the various combinations tested, crude glycerol when supplemented with CSL and mineral salts results in a maximum biomass concentration of 24.47 ± 0.78 g L-1 with 52.09 ± 2.03% lipid on a dry weight basis. Gas chromatographic analysis of the transesterified yeast lipid reveals that the compositions of fatty acid methyl esters vary with the substrates used for lipid production. However, the biodiesel properties are found to comply with the international standards, ASTM D6751 and EN14214. Studies on the emulsification activity reveal the extracellular production of bioemulsifer by the oleaginous yeast. Further biochemical analysis of the lipid-extracted biomass shows that it contains up to 24.6% ± 0.83% protein and 44.2% ± 1.41% carbohydrate, which indicate its potential use as animal feed. A preliminary cost estimate of lipid production shows the economic advantages of cheaper raw materials over synthetic media. Thus, as a proof of a novel biorefinery concept, an efficient and sustainable yeast biorefinery is successfully developed for the concomitant production of biodiesel, bioemulsifier and animal feed-components with simultaneous valorization of waste as low-cost substrates. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Environmental pollution and reducing fossil fuel reserves are the twin crisis that forces the automotive industry today to develop bio-based sustainable alternative fuel. This work aims to study the performance and emission characteristics of a direct injection diesel engine fuelled with blends of diesel, biodiesel blends derived from linseed oil and cottonseed oil as fuel. Four samples namely diesel, bio diesel blends of 5%, 10% and 15% which are referred as samples 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively are used as fuel. Experimental study shows significant increase in smoke emission by around 24% and 47% with samples 3 and 4 when compared with sample 1. On average, reduction in unburned hydrocarbon emission by 52% and 37% was achieved with samples 2 and 3 when compared to sample 1. When compared to sample 1, NOx emission was observed to be reduced by 24% when the engine was operated with sample 4. © Copyright 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Waste vegetable fats are standardised by biobutanol in this article while replacing biodiesel. Viscosity, density, cold filter plugging point of fuel blend, oxidation stability, and flash point were measured to confirm that a fuel is so close to a fuel standard that it is possible to use it in engines without modification. Results of this analysis have allowed us to propose a new fuel product with the preliminary title BUTVO_60, which symbolises 60% biobutanol and 40% waste vegetable oil. Performance and emission parameters of this new fuel product were tested in a Zetor 8641 tractor with a Forterra supercharged diesel engine. The resulting 30% decrease in power was reached by measuring with an AW NEB 400 dynamometer at PTO, while maintaining 38% torque reserve. But by increasing fuel intake the engine maintained a stable performance. Nitrate emissions and BUTVO_60 particles were considerably lower at the non-road steady cycle (NRSC) test. In contrast to biodiesel, BUTVO_60 fuel also has kept the fuel system cleaner while minimizing carbon, impurities, sediments, and so on. The objective of this article is to allow the use of waste vegetable cooking oils as fuel while replacing biodiesel. The side effect of the proposed method is the ability of decentralised blending at places where local waste cooking oil emerges. No technology in either investment is needed in fuel processing or engine adaptation of fuel oils. © 2017, HARD Publishing Company. All rights reserved.

AB  - This research aims to study the effect of nickel impregnation into hydrotalcite catalyst that use to convert Calophyllum inophyllum oil into biofuel through hydrocracking process. Hydrocracking process was carried out under mild condition (350°C and 20 bar) for two hours in a slurry batch reactor. The adding nickel affected the reaction conversion, yield, and selectivity of gasoil. The process of oxygen removal from the compounds in the oil was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and the compositions of the products were determined by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The results of the study successfully proved that nickel impregnated into hydrotalcite catalyst increased the conversion, yield, and selectivity of gasoil up to 98.57 %, 54.15 %, and 81.31 %, respectively.

AB  - The global interest in biofuels production is agued to have substantial impacts on food security. A slew of studies have identified a nexus between biofuel production intensification and food price hikes in the international market. Regardless of the results of these studies, global biofuels production keeps increasing and it is projected to escalate even further within the next decade. A major concern is that some sub-Saharan African countries with food security worries have policies to enhance the production and use of first generation biofuels. In view of that, this paper examines the potential consequences of diverting food and agricultural lands for biofuels production with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa. It reviews the current and projected trends in the production of biofuels and trade of feedstocks, analyses the potential of "food gap", land use change and associated carbon emissions and the effects on biodiversity and water resources within the region. In conclusion, the study accentuates the doubt on the potential of first generation biofuels as a realistic source of energy particularly in sub-Saharan Africa as it could have substantial effects on the regions' food security as well as on its natural resource. It also suggests ways to enhance the sustainability of the region's biofuel policies to maximize welfare gains and enhance food security. © Renewable Energy Research, 2017.

AB  - Biofuel feedstock development is in limelight because of its pronounced capability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). The move towards renewable energy intensified researches to provide concrete attestations that could be benefited from the effort. This research assessed the GHG reduction potential of biodiesel produced from Jatropha curcas L., relative to that of the conventional petroleum diesel. Computations were based on a standard 30-MLPY biodiesel plant with a co-generation facility, utilizing the byproducts of the process for electricity production. The GHG emissions were standardized and presented as equivalent carbon dioxide emission (CO2e). The boundary set for the analysis was from cradle to grave, considering the life-cycle from the production of the feedstock to the production of biodiesel, and eventually, its end-use. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) resulted to a negative net carbon footprint due to the carbon dioxide sequestration capability of the Jatropha plants. The whole system has a net CO2e footprint equivalent to 1,706,365.26 Mg CO2e a-1. Without considering the carbon dioxide absorbed by the plants, LCA of Jatropha biodiesel is still about 25% cleaner than petroleum diesel fuel. With sequestration, the GHG emission reduction can go as high as 548.38%. With the current Philippine biodiesel blending of 2%, if Jatropha methyl ester was used for the blending, this study shows that emission can be cut by 11%. And with increase in the blending, a more positive amount of savings will be achieved, which if at B100, savings could go as high as 581.18%. © 2017, University of the Philippines Los Banos.

AB  - The biooil is thermally cracked under catalytic environment in a catalytic crack-ing process. This process is able to replace the transesterification process to match the biofuel properties with diesel. In this study the silicon dioxide and ce-rium oxide were chosen as catalyst for cracking the jatropha vegetable oil. The catalytically cracked jatropha biofuel gas is delivered at constant rate to the inlet manifold of the diesel engine. Before and after cracking, the characteristics of the catalysts were analyzed using scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffrac-tion. The condensed cracked jatropha biofuel properties were analyzed with the results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analy-sis, and differential scanning calorimetry analysis, and it matches with the diesel fuel. From the experimental results, the increase in brake thermal efficiency of the engine with higher oxides of nitrogen emission was observed compared with diesel for both the catalytically cracked jatropha biofuels. Notably, SiO2 as cata-lyst showed the better mixing towards homogeneity with higher performance and emission results than the CeO2 as catalyst. © 2017 Society of Thermal Engineers of Serbia.

AB  - Herein, nanoplates of crystalline zinc aluminum phosphate exhibiting hexagonal and square planar morphology were successfully synthesized by adopting a novel and simple synthesis method; in this method, a single template, TPABr, was used in minute amounts and a shorter synthesis time of 24 h was required. The materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, FTIR, SEM, XPS, TEM, thermal analysis, ICP, and ammonia TPD. The synthesis temperature governed the morphology of the nanoplates; however, irrespective of the shape of the nanoplates, the materials exhibited promising catalytic activity towards the production of bio-fuel solketal (2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-methanol), a valuable bio-fuel, via acetalization of biodiesel waste glycerol under solvent-free reaction conditions. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The lack of sustainability and negative environmental impacts of using fossil fuel resources for energy production and their consequent increase in prices during last decades have led to an increasing interest in the development of renewable biofuels. Among possible biomass fuel sources, microalgae represent one of the most promising solutions. The present work is based on the implementation of a model that facilitates identification of optimal geographic locations for large-scale open ponds for microalgae cultivation for biofuels production. The combination of a biomass production model with specific site location parameters such as irradiance, geographical constraints, land use, topography, temperatures and CO2 for biofuels plants were identified in Sicily (Italy). A simulation of CO2 saved by using the theoretical biofuel produced in place of traditional fuel was implemented. Results indicate that the territory of Sicily offers a good prospective for these technologies and the results identify ideal locations for locating biomass fuel production facilities. Moreover, the research provides a robust method that can be tailored to the specific requirements and data availability of other territories. © Research India Publications.

AB  - Due to the demand in biofuel, the plant species that are not eatable and do not compete with traditional crops in Colombia, such as Jatropha curcas L., have become an important option. To produce more knowledge on the growth of this species, the research was carried out with different amounts of N and K fertilizers applied during the first 435 days after sowing (das) under dry tropical forest conditions. With the highest N dose (150 kg ha-1), the largest leaf area index was obtained in all evaluation period. The highest net assimilation rate (NAR) values were seen in the treatment with 150 kg ha-1of N at 75 das, 1.852 g m-2d-1, with no differences presented among the treatments with fertilizer application. The highest absolute growth rate (AGR) was observed when 150 kg ha-1of N+180 kg ha-1of K2O were applied at the start of the reproductive phase (345 das), 24.5 g d-1. The specific leaf area (SLA) did not present a response to the treatments. The relative growth rate (RGR) reached zero value at 402 das for the plants without fertilizers. The accumulation of biomass in J. curcas was influenced by the fertilizers with N and K, presenting rapid initial vegetative growth (first 165 das) which decreased with the starting of the reproductive phase. © 2017, Universidad Nacional de Colombia1.

AB  - In the present global scenario, fossil fuels are exhausting in fast manner and hence we are in need of research for alternate fuels where a huge demand of fuel in transport sector. The main objective of this research work is to analyse and compare the performance and emission characteristics of rapeseed and pongamia biofuel in diesel engine. The main problem occurs in biodiesel is its higher viscosity than the regular diesel. Experimental results revealed that the biofuel and bio lubricant based on rapeseed oil exhibited better performance with significant reduction in particulate, CO and NOx emissions under similar operating conditions and in terms of wear rate. Also it was found that, all performance characteristics like BSFC, BTE, ME and BP were better for rapeseed blends. It was observed that biodiesel will replace diesel as a source of fuel in near future and thus plant of biofuel in long run may have a positive impact on engine life. © Copyright EM International.

AB  - The effect of various reaction temperature on the hydrocracking of Cerbera manghas oil to produce a paraffin-rich mixture of hydrocarbons with Co-Ni/HZSM-5 as doubled promoted catalyst were studied. The Co-Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst with various metal loading and metal ratio was prepared by incipient wet-ness impregnation. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, AAS, and N2 adsorption-desorption. Sur-face area, pore diameter, and pore volume of catalysts decreased with the increasing of metals loading. The hydrocracking process was conducted under initial hydrogen pressure in a batch reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer. The reaction was carried out at a temperature of 300-375°C for 2 h. De-pending on the experimental condition, the reaction pressure changed between 10 bar and 15 bar. Several parameters were used to evaluate biofuel produced, including oxygen removal, hydrocarbon composition and gasoline/kerosene/diesel yields. Biofuel was analyzed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopic (FTIR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The composition of hydro-carbon compounds in liquid products was similar to the compounds in the gasoil sold in unit of Per-tamina Gas Stations, namely pentadecane, hexadecane, heptadecane, octadecane, and nonadecane with different amounts for each biofuel produced at different reaction temperatures. However, isopa-raffin compounds were not formed at all operating conditions. Pentadecane (n-C15) and heptadecane (n-C17) were the most abundant composition in gasoil when Co-Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst was used. Cerbera Manghas oil can be recommended as the source of non-edible vegetable oil to produce gasoil as an envi-ronmentally friendly transportation fuel. Copyright © 2017 BCREC Group.

AB  - Biofuel has been considered as one of the environmentally friendly energy sources to substitute fossil fuel derived from non-edible vegetable oil. This research aims to investigate the effect of the non-edible vegetable oil composition on a specific hydrocarbons distribution contained in biofuel and the aromatics formation through hydrocracking reaction with the Co-Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst. The formation of aromatics from non-edible vegetable oils, such as: Cerbera manghas, rubber seed, and sunan candlenut oils, containing saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids is presented. The hydrocracking reaction was carried out in a pressure batch reactor, a reaction temperature of 350 °C for 2 h, reactor pressure of 15 bar after flowing H2 for 1 hour, and a catalyst/oil ratio of 1 g/200 mL. Liquid hydrocarbon product was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Based on the GC-MS analysis, hydrocracking on three different oils indicated that polyunsaturated fatty acids were required to produce relatively high aromatics content. The sunan candlenut oil can be converted to gasoil range hydrocarbons containing a small amount of aromatic through hydrocracking reaction. Meanwhile, the aromatics in liquid product from hydrocracking of Cerbera manghas and rubber seed oils were not found. Copyright © 2017 BCREC Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fatty acid deoxygenation is a method for producing renewable hydrocarbon fuels such as green diesel, jet biofuel and biogasoline. In the present commercial method, deoxygenation is directly applied to vegetable oils through liquid phase hydrotreatment. This method is expensive because it consumes a large amount of hydrogen and requires severe operating conditions. The objective of this study was the production of a diesel-like hydrocarbon fuel that can be considered as drop-in replacement for petroleum-based diesel fuels, by catalytic thermal decarboxylation of Mg-Zn basic soap. In particular, this study investigated the decarboxylation of Mg-Zn basic soap at low temperature and pressure, without external supply of hydrogen. The Mg-Zn basic soap (9/1 mole ratio of Mg/Zn) was derived from palm stearin and decarboxylated at 350°C and atmospheric pressure for 5 hours. The basic soap effectively decarboxylated, yielding a diesel-like hydrocarbon fuel with a liquid product yield of 62%- weight. The resulting hydrocarbon product is a complex mixture consisting of normal paraffins in the range of carbon chain length C8-C19, iso-paraffins and various olefin products. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The analysis of biological resources for biofuels production in Ukraine has been carried out, and it has been shown that usage of alternative energy sources has great potential for substantially improving energy supply of the state and solving environmental problems. The directions of development and new technologies of obtaining motor fuels from biomass are systematized. It has been established that usage of different types of biofuels and their mixtures for feeding internal combustion engines involves application of modified engines in terms of structure and algorithms and usage of traditional designs of cars without significant structural changes. Moreover, the impact of biofuels on the efficient operation of the engine requires further integrated research.

AB  - In the late 1850s, Charles Friedel's dry distillation of calcium acetate gave the world a novel route to the commercial production of acetone, a process that would later be referred to as decarboxylative dehydration (ketonization). While the subsequent development of the petrochemical industry made this route to acetone uncompetitive, today there is considerable interest in ketonization as means for converting biomass-derived fatty acids to produce longer-chained ketones, which could serve as precursors to fuels and lubricants. However, the lack of strategies beyond direct hydrogenation of the ketones into hydrocarbons has limited the practical application of ketonization for producing biofuels. We describe here integrated catalytic sequences for converting a range of biomass-derived carboxylic acids, sourced through fermentation of sugars, hydrolysis of lipids, or biomass pyrolysis, to compounds that are fully compatible with the existing energy infrastructure and require minimal hydrogen input. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Petroleum is non renewable source of energy and the diminution of natural fuel resources, results in search for alternative fuels for automobiles. The demanding alternative search for fuels for compression ignition engines has been paying interest on fuels obtained from bio mass and cashew nut oil plays a vital role in alternate fuel for C.I Engines. The aim of this research effort is to appraise the property of cashew nut shell oil blends recital on a compression ignition diesel engine. This actually gives the discharge uniqueness of cashew nut oil, and its blends with diesel. In this paper cashew nut shell oil with diesel blends are taken up for study on vertical, four stroke, water cooled procedure of the investigation engine with cashew nut shell oil blends for a extensive series of engine load conditions such as B20, B40, B60, B80 and B100 were performed. The possessions of cashew nut oil are acquired by means of appropriate analysis methods. During the experiments, the performance uniqueness of the test engine was analyzed and compared with the precise diesel fuel performance. The results were successful even without any engine modifications. The brake thermal competence of B20 is found nearly closer to diesel fuel. The elevated discharge level of the blends can be compact by mixing suitable additives with CNSL and Diesel blends. © Research India Publications.

AB  - Biodiesel is a very attractive, biodegradable, renewable, and virtually nontoxic form of fuel. It is derived through base-catalysed transesterification of vegetable oils or animal fats. Analysis of biodiesel has become relevant, since the higher quality of the fuel is a key factor in commercialisation and market acceptance. The analytical methods employed are being constantly improved to meet this requirement. The most popular techniques for analysis of biodiesel include mainly chromatography and molecular spectroscopy. FTIR infrared spectroscopy is one of the most important spectroscopic techniques. The article presents the results of UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and FTIR infrared spectroscopy analysis employed for investigating methyl esters of higher fatty acids obtained with laboratory methods from selected sunflower and rapeseed oils and waste animal fats provided by a slaughterhouse. Commercial methyl esters were included in the analyses for comparison. In all samples, the contents of free glycerol, methanol, esters, and linolenic acid methyl ester in FAME were determined mainly to facilitate the spectroscopic analysis. The results of the investigations conducted with the aforementioned methods clearly indicate that the analysed WCO esters can be successfully used as potential industrial-scale biofuels. © 2017, HARD Publishing Company.

AB  - Bio-energy (like other renewable energy sources) is proposed as a solution for climate change and other energy-related and economic issues. The predominant production model, however, which is based on firstgeneration biofuels developed on a global scale, creates ecological impacts throughout the production chain, resulting in a sustainability paradox, as well as social unrest and territorial conflict. Therefore, attention here is focussed on agro-energy and second-generation biofuels, investigating the structural differences the advantages, the potential problems and the possible solutions of some local biofuel initiatives in North Western Europe. Finally, we propose a regional agrarian model to avoid the impacts and contradictions of the global industrial model, to produce a better ecological balance at both the local and the global levels, and to improve the democratic character of energy governance. In addition, we suggest a paradigmatic reading to better understand the cultural, political and socio-economic implications of the two models.

AB  - This research article mainly discusses the impact of emissions and fuel economy rules as well as the range of design options and technological advances, required to reduce emissions, improving engine efficiency, and developing fuel economy. Today's energy needs are meeting all the way through fossil fuel and natural gas. As an outcome the amount of natural fuels, such as coal or gas from the remains of living organisms, is on receding for many years. This research confirms the concept of coconut oil as a renewable and substitute fuel for marine engines. Since, a diesel engine has flexible uses including small power generation and transportation sectors. In this article principally the focus is on the performance and emission level even a biofuel used as an alternative for marine engine. Experimentation shows a variety of studies based on the performance of a low speed diesel engine use of variant blends of biofuel obtained with a mixing coconut oil and diesel. While using biofuel blends as a fuel in test engine, it was running in a fine manner. Various blends of biofuel (i.e. B25, B50, and B 75 etc.) have been used to keep away from difficult alteration of the engine. As the outset compares the engine performance for biodiesel blends it was accepted to conclude the most excellent feasible blend for various working condition. As concerns this research work diesel fuel-coconut oil blends performed in lower smoke density and oxides of nitrogen emissions. Finally, this research work shows a pollution free environment with the support of biofuel concentrations.

AB  - The present study aimed at the use of cheese whey as substrate for ethanol production by Kluyveromyces marxianus. The effect of the initial cheese whey concentration (M1 57.60; M2 45.60; M3 32.50 and M4 18.80 g L-1) on the alcoholic fermentation was studied. After sterilization, the in natura media were incubated at 30ºC for 48 hours, and then lactose, protein, ethanol, cell growth and chemical oxygen demand were analyzed. According to the results, M1 medium (the highest concentration) showed a greater production and volumetric productivity of ethanol 16.90 and 1.26 g L-1hour-1, respectively, and resulted in the greatest cell production and volumetric productivity of 5.80 and 0.40 g L-1hour-1, respectively. However, in terms of ethanol yield, the most satisfactory result was obtained using the M3 medium, pro 82.30% in 12 hours of fermentation. With respect to the COD, the organic substance content of M4 medium was reduced by 82.28%. © 2017, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigates stakeholder knowledge, attitudes, and public perception concerning biofuels as an enabler towards a bio-based economy. In innovation and adoption studies, perceptions play a critical role in the acceptance of a technology. Biofuels have been touted as a clean fuel with an ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while simultaneously creating employment and growing economies. South Africa is in the process of transitioning towards a bio-based economy. Accordingly, policies and institutions have been developed to promote biofuels production and distribution. Knowledge, at-titude and perception (KAP) surveys were carried out to deepen knowledge and understanding of the stakeholder's KAP. Emails as well as telephonic and group interviews based on open questions and social media were used to gather data. The study employed cluster, purposive random and snowball sampling to select the participants with descriptive statistics, thematic analysis and discourse analysis used to analyse the data. The study found that the introduction of biofuels presents many opportunities and benefits for the economy and unlocking the po-tentials for rural entrepreneurs. Stakeholders have concerns and issues regarding the use of biofuels on their internal combustion engines. The study recommends proper communication and education should be done on the benefits of biofuels in a biobased economy.

AB  - Nowadays, biodiesel is being promoted worldwide as a sustainable and alternative to diesel fuel. However, there is still a lack of a biodiesel market in Mexico. Hence, a new initiative to reform the Mexican biofuels framework by decree includes the production and use of biodiesel. This regulation can ensure and contribute to the development of the biodiesel market in Mexico. The initiative proposes to start from the B5.8 blend by the end of 2017 and reach the B10 by 2020. Therefore, the objective of the present work was the quality assessment of biodiesel blends proposed by the new Mexican policy framework. The techniques applied were Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence analysis, scanning electron microscopy analysis, viscosity, higher heating value, thermogravimetric analysis, refractive index, acid number, specific gravity, flash point, and copper strip corrosion based on ASTM standards. The results indicate that the biodiesel and its blends B5.8 and B10 fulfilled relevant quality specifications established in the ASTM D6751 and EN14214 standards for fuels. However, the fuel blends presented a higher heating value (HHV) diminution. The experimental HHV percentages decrease for the mandatory mixtures compared to diesel were 2.29% (B10), and 0.29% (B5.8). © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Organic load present in wastewater and local environmental conditions, encourage the growth of biomass potentially exploitable in biotechnological processes, microbiota produced in Colombian wastewater treatment plants presents high biomass productivity and high lipid yield compared with other third generation biofuels sources. In this research, three routes of biodiesel production from Wastewater microbiota (WTP) were evaluated by varying the method of lipid extraction: Hexane-Based Extraction (HBE), extraction assisted with High-Speed Homogenization (SHE) and extraction using Ethanol/Hexane mixture (EHE), the evaluation was carried out under a technical approach by process simulation and evaluation of potential environmental impacts. Simulation was performed using Aspen Plus v.8.8, based on real macroscopic composition of the WTP microbiota and real process efficiencies based on experimental information. The environmental assessment was performed using the WAR algorithm taking into account 8 impact categories. Results shows that for a processing capacity of 47 kt/y, SHE pathway presents the highest lipid recovery efficiency in comparison to HBE and EHE pathways, however, the best alternative is not suitable for large-scale processing due to high energy requirements. In the other hand, EHE route presents a lower potential environmental impact generated due to complete transformation of highly harmful substances into other with lower toxicity. In addition, HBE topology presents higher risks associated with toxicity of the solvents used. © Medwell Journals, 2017.

AB  - The area of automotive fuel, or fuel components, which can be produced from biomass also includes dimethyl ether, otherwise known as DME. The issue of the use of DME as a fuel is one which has been monitored until recently. Biomass can also be used as the raw material for the production of DME. DME has therefore replaced the previously-used CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), which are now banned for their role in dangerous levels of ozone depletion. With regard to its physical properties and combustion characteristics, it is currently expected that DME will soon apply significantly as a fuel in the municipal sector and in households, and as an alternative fuel for motor vehicles with diesel engines. DME is a suitable fuel for diesel engines and can be considered as one of the most promising diesel fuel replacements. DME is a suitable fuel for diesel engines mainly due to its low self-ignition temperature and good cetane figures. It is well miscible with most organic solvents and because the polar solvent is water-immiscible. The advantage is its high levels of purity, and its being free of sulphur, nitrogen, or metals. The physical properties of DME are very similar to the physical properties of LPG. DME requires relatively complex and costly fuel accessories, but the original compression ratio of the diesel engine is maintained. A diagram of the fuel system is illustrated in the paper. The paper analyses the dependence of vapour pressure on temperature, the dependence of the density on temperature, kinematic viscosity, the flash point, the boiling point, and the solubility of water. The objective is to evaluate this interesting energy source for applications in diesel engines. © 2017, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool. All rights reserved.

AB  - Performance parameters of different commercial diesel fuels is a subject of interest for fuel consumers. Fuel retailer Neste recently introduced a new brand of WWFC 5th grade diesel fuel in Baltic market, consisting of diesel fuel and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) blend. Fuel samples have been recently tested on chassis dynamometer, measuring wheel power and torque and in road conditions, measuring fuel consumption. Evaluation of fuel consumption and performance parameters in road or laboratory conditions may yield uncertain results due to complexity of modern automobile engine management and emission reduction systems. To better evaluate the combustion, fuel samples have been tested in modified CFR engine at various intake air pressure, temperature and compression ratio settings. Engine indicated performance parameters and combustion phasing of regular diesel fuel and diesel fuel-HVO blend are presented. Comparing to regular diesel fuel, fuel blend with HVO showed reduced apparent heat release rate (AHRR) during premixed combustion phase at low inlet air temperature and low compression ratio conditions, comparing to regular diesel fuel. Premixed combustion phase AHRR of diesel-HVO blend increased above AHRR of regular diesel fuel at higher inlet air temperature and higher compression ratio conditions. Diffusion controlled combustion phase AHRR of diesel-HVO blend increased above AHRR of regular diesel fuel at higher inlet air temperature, higher compression ratio conditions and supercharged air supply. © 2017, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) refers to the conversion of carbonaceous resources into oily substances in hot pressurized liquid water. During this process, constitutive biomass molecules decompose into thousands of organic compounds, following complex reaction mechanisms. The chemistry behind HTL processes is highly complex and still poorly understood to date, in spite of many research efforts. After a detailed analysis of a wet bioresource, blackcurrant pomace, a selection of representative model compounds was subjected to hydrothermal liquefaction conditions (300 °C, 60 min), either alone or as binary, ternary and quaternary mixtures: glucose, xylose, and microcrystalline cellulose were chosen to represent carbohydrates; guaiacol and alkali lignin for native lignin; glutamic acid for proteins; and linoleic acid for lipids. The results show that the reaction products mainly arise from degradation of individual compounds. The main reactions that can be identified are decarboxylation, dehydration, and condensation reactions producing heavy compounds found in the bio-oil and the char. Some binary interactions have been identified such as the Maillard reaction between carbohydrates and proteins, and also a strong interaction between carbohydrates and lipids for bio-oil formation. Comparative experiments showed that HTL of the real resource (blackcurrant pomace) could be qualitatively represented by model mixtures, in terms of the molecular composition of the products, especially when model fibres were used. The quantitative representativeness of the simulating monomers is lower than that obtained by using model polymers. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Energy market conditions have shifted dramatically since the USA renewable fuel standards (RFS1 in 2005; RFS2 in 2007) were enacted. The USA has transitioned from an increasing dependence on oil imports to abundant domestic oil production. In addition, increases in the use of ethanol, the main biofuel currently produced in the USA, is now limited by the blend wall constraint. Given this, the current study evaluates alternative biofuel deployment scenarios in the USA, accounting for changes in market conditions. The analysis is performed with a general equilibrium model that reflects the structure of the USA biofuel market as the transition to advanced biofuels begins. Results suggest that ethanol consumption would increase, albeit slowly, if current biofuel deployment rates of about 10% are maintained as persistently lower oil prices lead to a gradual increase in the consumption of liquid transportation fuels. Without the blend wall constraint, this study finds that the overall economic impact of a full implementation of the USA RFS2 policy is largely neutral before 2022. However, the economic impacts become slightly negative under the blend wall constraint since more expensive bio-hydrocarbons are needed to meet the RFS2 mandates. Results for a scenario with reduced advanced biofuel deployment based on current policy plans show near neutral economic impacts up to 2027. This scenario is also consistent with another scenario where the volume of bio-hydrocarbons deployed is reduced to adjust for its higher cost and energy content relative to deploying the mandated RFS2 advanced biofuel volumes as ethanol. The important role of technological change is demonstrated under pioneer and accelerated technology scenarios, with the latter leading to neutral or positive economic effects up to 2023 under most blend wall scenarios. All scenarios evaluated in this study are found to have positive long-term benefits for the USA economy. © 2017 Gbadebo Oladosu.

AB  - A new simple, rapid and inexpensive analytical method was developed to determine the biodiesel percentage in biodiesel/ diesel blends through simple digital images of samples obtained by scanning with a commercial scanner. Soybean biodiesel and petroleum diesel samples were acquired from refineries currently in operation. There were prepared several mixtures within the range 1.5 to 12.0% of biodiesel in diesel oil, using the same procedure as is done in industry. The analytical signals were images recorded with a scanner. This data was decomposed with different color systems: RGB, HSV, HLS, CMYK and Grayscale. Chemometrics models based on color signals obtained from different mixtures of biodiesel/diesel were built. The quantification by using partial least squares (PLS) resulted in a RMSEP value for biodiesel of 0.9% (w/w); this load approximately 10-times smaller than the corresponding calibration range, with a correlation of 0.96 between predicted and reference values. © 2017 The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry.

AB  - The vast majority of the biofuels presently used in the EU are so called first generation biofuels produced from crops. Concerns of food security, displacement of food crop production and indirect land use change (iLUC) has led to the introduction of measures to reduce the use of first generations biofuels and promote so called advanced biofuels based on feedstock that does not compete with food/feed crops, such as waste and agricultural residues. In Sweden, 60% of the biofuel consumption is already based on waste/residual feedstock, and a unique feature of the Swedish biofuel supply is the relatively large use of biogas for transport, representing 9% of the current use of biofuels. The use of waste/residues dominates the biogas production, but agricultural residues, representing a large domestic feedstock potential, are barely used at present. This could indicate that biofuels from such feedstock is non-competitive compared both to fossil fuels and to biofuels produced from crops and waste under existing policy framework. This study show that without subsidies, the production cost of biogas as biofuel from all non-food feedstocks investigated (grass, crop residues and manure) is higher than from food crops. A shift from food crops to residues, as desired according to EU directives, would thus require additional policy instruments favoring advanced biofuel feedstock. Investment or production subsidies must however be substantial in order for biogas from residues to be competitive with biogas from crops. © 2017 Mikael Lantz, et al.

AB  - In this research, biodiesel from karanja (Pongamia pinnata) oil was produced by transesterification process. Fuel properties of KBD, KBD with 4% DEE and KBD with 8% DEE were tested and compared with mineral diesel fuel. Additive DEE 4% and 8% was added in karanja biodiesel to improve the fuel properties. Electric generator set was fuelled with KBD, KBD with 4% DEE and KBD with 8% DEE operated at 1.5 kW, 3 kW and 5 kW load and performance was compared with mineral diesel fuel. Research revealed that in electric generator set increasing trend of overall efficiency and decreasing in BSFC were observed when 4% and 8% DEE was added in karanja biodiesel under different load conditions. A decreasing trend in CO and CO2 emission of electric generator set was recorded when 4% and 8% DEE added in KBD as compared to pure KBD under different load conditions. NOx emission of electric generator set increases by adding 4% and 8% DEE in KBD at different load conditions. It is concluded that the overall efficiency of electric generator set improves, and exhaust emission reduces by adding additives in karanja biodiesel. Karanja biodiesel with additive 8% DEE is recommended as a substitute of mineral diesel for electric generator set.

AB  - Oil spillage accidents can cause severe short-term effects to marine organisms and may lead to devastating long-term impact to marine environments. This study determined the influence of water accommodated fractions (WAFs) of diesel oil, chemically enhanced WAFs (CEWAFs) of diesel oil and oil dispersant (IPAC-OCD) to the toxicity of green algae, Tetraselmis chuii, and marine diatom, Chaetocheros calcitrans. Both the phytoplankton species were exposed to different concentrations of WAFs, CEWAFs and dispersant (0%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 80%). All of the toxicants significantly reduced the growth of phytoplankton, however, the level of response varied by solution and species. The dispersant has the highest impact among all the chemicals studied. The dispersant is very highly toxic to C. calcitrans, but still practically non-toxic to T. chuii. Even though, WAFs have higher impact to T. chuii than C. calcitrans, the chemicals are practically non-toxic to both phytoplankton species and, moreover, in short-term exposure, low concentration of WAFs may stimulate the growth of C. calcitrans. However, the mixture of diesel oil WAFs and dispersant cause synergistic toxicity to C. calcitrans that increases the WAFs toxicity. This finding implies that the dispersant application to mitigate the oil spills may negatively impact the marine phytoplankton.

AB  - Bioethanol is one of the most important alternative renewable energy sources that substitute the fossil fuels. Sugarcane bagasse has a content of cellulose and hemicelluloses, which make it suitable as fermentation substrate when hydrolyzed. The objective of work is ethanol production from sugarcane bagasse (SCB) by the fermentation process. Eight laboratory experiments were conducted to produce bioethanol from sugarcane bagasse. By using Design Expert, it was formulated the dilute acid hydrolysis step to investigate the effects of hydrolysis parameters on a yield of ethanol and optimum condition. All the three hydrolysis parameters were significant variables for the yield of ethanol. The optimum combinations of the three factors maximum ethanol yield were 10.86 ml at 50 g sample, 92.59 °C hydrolysis temperature, 30 min hydrolysis time and 1%v/v acid concentration. From this study following point were concluded: • Lignocellulosic containing material are sustainable for clean energy production• Production of bioethanol from waste sugarcane baggage's is possible• Operating parameters (time, temperature and acid concentration) can be optimized by surface response methodology.• Process parameters hydrolysis, fermentation and distillation have significant role on bioethanol yield. © 2017

AB  - The paper presents results of the research on the Influence of fuels on numbers of selected metabolic groups of soil microorganisms. Response of proteolytic, amylolytic, lipolytic and cellulolytic microorganisms to the presence of diesel oil, biodiesel and their mixtures in soil at the concentration of 5% (w/w per dry mass of soil) was analyzed. The research was carried out on soils with varied mechanical composition (loamy sand and sandy loam) and organic matter content. Negative response of all microbial groups in the loamy sand was noted, regardless of contamination type, and the inhibition was maintained throughout the whole incubation period. In the sandy loam, the adverse impact of fuels was demonstrated mainly for cellulolytic microorganisms, while for other microbial groups it increased with the biodiesel soil content. The higher soil organic matter content facilitated development of microbiocenoses. It could therefore limit adverse impact of fuels in sandy clay, similarly to adsorption of contaminants on the soil organic matter. Analysis of the research results indicates that biodiesel might limit metabolic activity of microorganisms to a higher extent than conventional fuel. Biodiesel as a biofuel is a foreign substance in the environment and may therefore trigger changes in the soil structure and its pH as well as toxic metabolite production upon its degradation.

AB  - Biofuels from Biomass are meant to decrease significantly dependence on fossil oil and reduce the environmental influences in energy use. Fusel oil one of biofuel that composed of a mixture of alcohols. Fusel oil obtained by-product during fermentation of agricultural products such as beet, cone, sweet molasses, grains, potatoes. According to the high research and motor octane rating also a high density of fusel oil compared with other fuels maybe it will get an essential place in the alternative. The main objective of this study was to determine the impacts of moisture on performance and emissions characteristics of a four-cylinder engine running with fusel oil –gasoline blends.The experiments were performed on spark ignition engine under 4500 rpm engine speed, different engine loads and the different blending ratio of gasoline- fusel oil (G100, FBWE20, and FAWE20). In addition, the effects of test fuels upon brake power, brake thermal efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption, maximum in-cylinder pressure, and emissions (nitrogen oxide NOx, hydrocarbon HC, carbon monoxide CO, and carbon dioxide CO2) were examined. The heating value of fusel oil after water extracted (FAWE) become 33.8 MJ/kg that improved by 13% compared with original one (FBWE) 29.9 MJ/kg. Mostly at all blending of fusel oil –gasoline the brake power is slightly increased than that of gasoline. Also, the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and thermal efficiency improved by reduced the water content of fuel oil. Furthermore, the NOx emission decreased with fusel oil -gasoline blends compared with pure gasoline at all engine loads. However, HC, CO, and CO2 emissions increased with fusel oil -gasoline blends. In general, the higher oxygen content and octane number of fusel oil with reducing water content led to improving the engine performance and NOx emission. © 2017, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

AB  - Exhaust particle emissions from a heavy duty diesel engine using B20 biodiesel (20% biodiesel blend with 80% diesel by volume) were investigated, and the engine was equipped with three kinds of exhaust aftertreatment devices: DOC (diesel oxidation catalyst), DOC + DPF (diesel particle filter), and DOC + CDPF (catalyzed diesel particle filter). Particle mass, particle number and size distribution, and PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and inorganic ions in the particle emissions from the engine were studied. Compared with the engine without exhaust aftertreatments, DOC decreased nucleation mode particle number by 19.83%, while accumulation mode particles exhibited slight changes. The DOC + DPF reduced the total particle number by 82.54%, while the DOC + CDPF reduced it by 91.71%. Compared with the engine without exhaust aftertreatments, the three aftertreatments were shown to reduce total PAH emissions. DOC + DPF and DOC + CDPF can decrease total TEQ (toxicity equivalent quantity) effectively with a sharp decrease in PAH mass. The DOC increased the TEQ of particles by 46.9%. The catalyst in the DOC increased some high molecular weight PAHs such as BaA, BbF + BkF, and BaP, which led to the increase in TEQ. The DOC increased the total inorganic ions by 2%, while the DOC + DPF and DOC + CDPF decreased inorganic ions by 89.5% and 82.9%, respectively. Catalysts in DOC and CDPF promotes the formation of SO42− and NO3−, which leads to higher inorganic ion emissions with DOC than no aftertreatments and higher inorganic ion emissions with a DOC + CDPF than with a DOC + DPF. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Elastomer seals in fuel systems have to evince required mechanical properties also at exposure to fuels. The aim of the research was to determine an influence of various concentrations of rapeseed methyl ester (RME) on a change of mechanical properties of sealing O-rings made from polyacrylate elastomer (an indication ACM). A permanent deformation - compression set (CS), a tensile strength and an elongation after the exposure to the tested environment for the time 20 months were evaluated within the experiment. A fall of the tensile strength, the elongation and the permanent deformation - compression set CS was proved depending on the type of the fuel. The increased negative influence of various concentrations of RME (20% to 100%) on the tested properties of the sealing O-rings compared with the diesel oil complying with the standard EN 590:2004 was not proved. So a significant negative influence of degradation aspects on the tested properties of the O-rings of the ACM type (polyacrylate elastomer) was not proved.

AB  - This study investigated the performance of different mixed microbial cultures (MMC) able to ferment crude glycerol generated from animal fat-based biodiesel to produce 1,3 propanediol (1,3 PDO) and butyric acid, under non-sterile conditions. Eight different continuous flow stirred-tank reactors (CSTR) were set up with different inoculum types and growth media. The distribution of metabolic products under variable operating conditions was determined. All MMC were characterized from a kinetic point of view and overall stoichiometric reactions were constructed. Changes in the microbial communities were monitored by means of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Maximum substrate degradation rate reached approximately 110 g/L/d of glycerol (with a productivity of 38 g/L/d and 11 g/L/d for 1,3 PDO and butyric acid, respectively), obtained with an hydraulic retention time of 12 h and 60 g/L feed. The maximum feed concentration reached almost 90 g/L, leading though to an incomplete substrate degradation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many researchers pointed out that the need of research in the areas of operating parameters so as to suit the higher proportion of biodiesel diesel blend in diesel engine without drop on its performance. The operating parameters such as compression ratio (CR), injection timing (IT) and injection pressure (IP) are effectively used in diesel engine for improving the performance and also reducing the exhaust emissions. Hence, in the present investigation an attempt has been made to investigate the effect of CR, IT and IP on the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of diesel engine using 20% proportion of biodiesel diesel blend (A20). Further, this paper also aims at to find out the optimum operating parameters. It was found from experimental investigation that at high of CR (19.5), IP (250 bar) and IT (33° CA) showed improved BTE of approximately 7.14% than that of original operating parameters. Further, the HC, CO and smoke emissions were reduced by 4.78, 5.54 and 2.3% respectively than that of original operating parameters except NOx emission. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Investigation of the high-pressure thermophysical properties of biofuels, e.g., bulk modulus, surface tension, and viscosity is of paramount importance in fuel injection systems in diesel engines. Another crucial and dangerous phenomenon that may occur in biofuels at high pressures is phase transition (solidification), which can drastically increase the viscosity of the biofuel. This effect may hamper proper operation of the engine, especially under cold-start conditions. Unfortunately, the availability of high-pressure thermophysical properties of biofuels is still limited. The goal of this paper is to investigate the impact of high pressures on thermophysical properties of biofuels on the example of rapeseed fatty acid methyl esters (RME) in a wide range of pressures (0.1to250MPa) and temperatures (5to20°C). To this end we employed innovative ultrasonic techniques, i.e., the Bleustein-Gulyaev surface acoustic waves for measuring RME viscosity, and ultrasonic bulk compressional waves for measuring sound velocity in RME and consequently evaluating RME thermophysical parameters, e.g., bulk modulus and surface tension. The viscosity of the measured RME displayed an abrupt increase at pressures: 260 MPa (t=20°C), 230 MPa (t=15°C), 190 MPa (t=10°C), and 130 MPa (t=5°C). Evidently it was a signature of the phase transition (solidification) occurring in the RME. The discovered high viscosity high-pressure phase in RME can be very detrimental for operation of modern common rail Diesel engines. Therefore, the results of research presented in this paper should be interesting for engineers and designers working with modern common rail Diesel engines using biofuels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The whole world is trying to increase energy production from renewable energy sources. Biomass, mainly solid fuel (e.g. wood chips, sawdust, etc.), takes first place in Lithuania’s efforts to increase energy production from renewables. There are a lot off studies about minimization of greenhouse gases (GHGs) during biomass combustion for energy production due to biogenic CO2. Unfortunately, such aspects as biofuel production, in-cluding biomass collection in harvesting sites, delivery to special interim sites, processing, produced biofuel transportation to combustion plants is rarely estimated in this studies. A considerable amount of diesel fuel is used within these processes by various mechanisms (e.g., skidders, tractors, crushers, chippers, etc.); therefo¬re woody biomass production and delivery processes have significant environmental impact to air quality and climate change due to air emissions (CO, NOx, NMVOC, PM, NH3) and GHGs (CO2, N2O, NH4) from off-road and road mobile sources. This paper presents the method of evaluation and results of analysis of material and energy flows of wood chips production from traditional raw materials – firewood and forest logging waste (residues). It was estimated that up to 0.038 toe of diesel fuel is used for one toe of produced woody biomass, incl. over 52% - for biofuel delivery to combustion plant; 0.293 kg of air emissions and over 22.5 kg of GHGs are emitted to the air during production of one tonne of wood chips. Results of comparison analysis show that in case of biofuel production from logging residues, volume of GHGs is 57% higher in comparison to wood chips are produced from firewood. Several recommendations how to minimize significant environmental impact due to usage of logging residues to energy purposes are presented in article. Received environmental indicators can be successfully used for further detailed life-cycle assessment of woody biomass production and usage for alternative energy. © Kaunas University of Technology.

AB  - Hydroconversion of soybean oils to aviation fuel-like hydrocarbons was investigated over aggregated hierarchical ZSM-5 microspheres composed of small ZSM-5 nanoparticles, which were synthesized via a hydrothermal method by controlling the Si/Al ratio with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the template. The prepared ZSM-5 microspheres were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption and desorption (N2-BET) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A low Si/Al ratio resulted in small-sized seed crystals, which then grew into ZSM-5 microspheres through 3D island growth. A high Si/Al ratio resulted in the opposite growth behavior and was prone to forming well-formed individual "classic-boat" ZSM-5 by 2D layer growth. The CNTs acted not only as a mesopore template, but also as a cage to offer suitable space making the ZSM-5 grow into the nanoparticles and form microspheres. The obtained ZSM-5 microspheres had a uniform size (2-3 μm) with a hierarchical structure containing intracrystalline and intercrystalline mesopores. The spherical ZSM-5 zeolites supporting a NiMo catalyst showed high activity and selectivity toward hydroconversion of soybean oil to aviation-like biofuel (C9-C15 hydrocarbons). © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Measuring the ethanol/water ratio in biofuel of high ethanol content, such as E85, is important when used in a flex-fuel engine. A capacitive probe is generally used for measuring the ethanol/gasoline ratio. However, the water content in E85 biofuel cannot be disregarded or considered constant and full composition measurement of biofuel is required. Electric impedance spectroscopy with a customized coaxial probe operating in the 10 kHz to 1 MHz frequency range was investigated. An in-depth investigation of the electrical impedance domain has led to the conclusion that additional information is required to unambiguously determine the composition of the ternary biofuel mixture. Among the different options of measurement domains and techniques, optical absorption spectroscopy in the UV spectral range between 230 and 300 nm was found to be the most appropriate. The typical absorbance in the UV range is highly dominated by gasoline, while ethanol and water are almost transparent. This approach is experimentally validated using actual fuels. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Biodiesel is one of the promising alternative biofuel to petro-diesel. Efficient and effective utilization of low value feedstock is required to meet the current demand on biodiesel. Rice bran is a byproduct of rice milling that contains significant amounts of sugar (~ 48%) and lipids (~ 14%). Immediate recovery of the lipids is uneconomical owing to its moderate lipid content. In this work, hydrolysis of raw rice bran was firstly carried out to concentrate lipids in the hydrolyzed bran to ~ 42%. Hydrolysis of rice bran using 2% sulfuric acid at 90 °C for 3.5 h with stirring at 300 rpm resulted in hydrolysates containing ~ 41 g/L sugars and 3.75 g/L proteins. Rice bran hydrolysate (RBH) obtained was further utilized as growth media for Lipomyces starkeyi, an oleaginous yeast. Lipid content of 40 to 65% can be achieved, suggesting the potential of using RBH in single cell oil production. Composition of microbial oils obtained was similar to that of vegetable oils, which may potentially be adopted as a feedstock for biodiesel production. Furthermore, dried hydrolyzed rice bran was subjected to in-situ (trans)esterification with methanol under subcritical condition which resulted in high FAME yield (87.81%) and conversion (94.82%). This work demonstrated the maximized utilization of rice bran in the production of hydrolysate for fermentation and as biodiesel feedstock. This is to further support the use of direct acid hydrolysis of biomass in the recovery and use of its content of sugars and lipids. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although many combinations of biofuel blends are available in the market, it is more beneficial to vary the ratio of biofuel blends at different engine operating conditions for optimal engine performance. Dual-injection engines have the potential to implement such function. However, while optimal engine calibration is critical for achieving high performance, the use of two injection systems, together with other modern engine technologies, leads the calibration of the dual-injection engines to a very complicated task. Traditional trial-and-error-based calibration approach can no longer be adopted as it would be time-, fuel- and labor-consuming. Therefore, a new and fast calibration method based on sparse Bayesian extreme learning machine (SBELM) and metaheuristic optimization is proposed to optimize the dual-injection engines operating with biofuels. A dual-injection spark-ignition engine fueled with ethanol and gasoline is employed for demonstration purpose. The engine response for various parameters is firstly acquired, and an engine model is then constructed using SBELM. With the engine model, the optimal engine settings are determined based on recently proposed metaheuristic optimization methods. Experimental results validate the optimal settings obtained with the proposed methodology, indicating that the use of machine learning and metaheuristic optimization for dual-injection engine calibration is effective and promising. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Decresing the sulfur content of a fuel reduces its lubricity, thus damaging engines and fuel systems. Therefore, promoting the use of a biofuel must involve assessing the functionality and lubricity of the fuel. The ball-on-ring wear tester was applied to determine the optimal additive concentration and the mechanism of reduction of the wear and friction of the diesel engine fuel injection system. The lubricating efficiency of the fuels was estimated by using a photomicroscope to measure the average diameter of the wear scar produced on the test ball. An optical microscope and scanning electronic microscope were used for wear surface examinations. The wear test revealed that the wear diameter of the steel ball lubricated with either the pure petrodiesel or 20 wt% Jatropha curcas biodiesel blends was 1.36 or 1.05 mm, respectively. The experimental results indicated that when Jatropha curcas biodiesel was added into petrodiesels to reduce friction, the wear resistance of the fuel blends increased concurrently with increasing Jatropha curcas biodiesel concentration. This was attributed to the presence of stearic acid in Jatropha curcas biodiesel blends. Stearic acid has a strong affinity for metal surfaces; therefore, a chemical coating was formed between the two motion surfaces to protect the two contacted surfaces from wear. Therefore, the proposed Jatropha curcas biodiesel can be used to effectively enhance the lubricity of a petrodiesel under the condition of boundary lubrication.

AB  - Gasoline anti-knock quality, defined by the research and motor octane numbers (RON and MON), is important for increasing spark ignition (SI) engine efficiency. Gasoline knock resistance can be increased using a number of blending components. For over two decades, ethanol has become a popular anti-knock blending agent with gasoline fuels due to its production from bio-derived resources. This work explores the oxidation behavior of two oxygenated certification gasoline fuels and the variation of fuel reactivity with molecular composition. Ignition delay times of Haltermann (RON = 91) and Coryton (RON = 97.5) gasolines have been measured in a high-pressure shock tube and in a rapid compression machine at three pressures of 10, 20 and 40 bar, at equivalence ratios of φ = 0.45, 0.9 and 1.8, and in the temperature range of 650–1250 K. The results indicate that the effects of fuel octane number and fuel composition on ignition characteristics are strongest in the intermediate temperature (negative temperature coefficient) region. To simulate the reactivity of these gasolines, three kinds of surrogates, consisting of three, four and eight components, are proposed and compared with the gasoline ignition delay times. It is shown that more complex surrogate mixtures are needed to emulate the reactivity of gasoline with higher octane sensitivity (S = RON–MON). Detailed kinetic analyses are performed to illustrate the dependence of gasoline ignition delay times on fuel composition and, in particular, on ethanol content. © 2017 The Combustion Institute

AB  - We analyzed the economic feasibility and environmental benefits of an alternative technology that converts coal and biomass to liquid fuels (CBTL), using West Virginia as a real case scenario. A mixed integer linear programming model was developed to analyze the economic feasibility. A cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) model was also developed to analyze the environmental benefits. Sensitivity analyses on required selling price (RSP) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of CBTL fuels were conducted according to feedstock availability and price, biomass to coal mix ratio, conversion rate, internal rate of return (IRR), capital cost, operational and maintenance cost. The results showed the price of coal had a more dominant effect on RSP than that of biomass. Different mix ratios and conversion rates led to RSP ranging from $104.3 – $157.9/bbl. LCA results indicated that GHG emissions ranged from 80.62 kg CO2 eq to 101.46 kg CO2 eq/1000 MJ of liquid fuel at various biomass to coal mix ratios and conversion rates if carbon capture and storage (CCS) was applied. Most of the water and fossil energy were consumed in the conversion process. Compared to petroleum-derived-liquid fuels, the reduction in GHG emissions could be between −2.7% and 16.2% with CBTL substitution. © 2017

AB  - Bioenergy sources have been introduced as a means to address challenges of conventional energy sources. The uncertainties of supply-side (upstream) externalities (e.g., collection and logistics) represent the key challenges in bioenergy supply chains and lead to reduce cross-cutting sustainability benefits. We propose a mixed biomass-based energy supply chain (consisting of mixed-mode bio-refineries and mixed-pathway transportation) and a multi-criteria decision making framework to address the upstream challenges. Our developed framework supports decisions influencing the economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Economic analysis employs a support vector machine technique, to predict the pattern of uncertainty parameters, and a stochastic optimization model, to incorporate uncertainties into the model. The stochastic model minimizes the total annual cost of the proposed mixed supply chain network by using a genetic algorithm. Environmental impact analysis employs life cycle assessment to evaluate the global warming potential of the cost-effective supply chain network. Our presented approach is capable of enhancing sustainability benefits of bioenergy industry infrastructure. A case study for the Pacific Northwest is used to demonstrate the application of the methodology and to verify the models. The results indicate that mixed supply chains can improve sustainability performance over traditional supply infrastructures by reducing costs (up to 24%) and environmental impacts (up to 5%). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The operating conditions for the catalytic conversion of residual crude palm oil from empty fruit bunch to diesel-like biofuels were optimized to determine and characterize the liquid product to define its properties as a diesel-like fuel for further use a renewable fuel and value-added chemical in industry. A 2-level factorial experimental design and statistical methods were applied together with a statistical mathematical model to predict the optimal conditions that maximize the yield and diesel-like product distribution. The response surface methodology, which is a statistical model used to conduct multiple regression analysis, was used to identify the appropriate multivariable equations in the experimental design. The optimal temperature contributed to the breakdown of triglyceride fatty acids due to secondary cracking reactions similar to those that produce diesel fuel due to the high efficiency and selectivity of the MgO catalyst.

AB  - Tung’s fruits (Aleurites fordii) produce oil of great applicability in the market of painting and covering due to its drying characteristics. Tung’s oil may be an alternative for the production of new biofuels. In this study, it was evaluated the energetic potential of the fruit, oil and biodiesel obtained from the Tung. The average yielding of the extracted seed oil was 50.6%, a value similar to those presented in literature. Moreover, its density presented a value of 931.5 g L-1 and its acid index, 4.5 mg KOH g-1. In the last step of this study, biodiesel was produced by basic methyl route using potassium hydroxide. The specific mass of the produced biodiesel was 909.2 kg m-3 at 20°C; its acid index was 0.473 mg KOH g-1 and its flash point was 178°C. The values of heating values in natura and the low level of ashes in the residual biomass makes the Tung’s fruits a promising renewable clean source of energy of second generation fuel. © 2017 Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - The formation of nitrogen-containing compounds in bio-oil during microwave pyrolysis of Chlorella and Spirulina microalgae has been investigated in this study. Activated carbon (AC) and magnetite (Fe3O4) were used as microwave receptors during microwave pyrolysis experiments. It has been found that the use of Fe3O4 increased the total yield of bio-oil. The use of different microwave receptors did not seem to have affected the total yield of nitrogen-containing compounds in the bio-oil. However, Fe3O4 promoted the formation of nitrogen-containing aliphatics, thereby reducing the formation of nitrogen-containing aromatics. The use of AC promoted the dehydration reactions during amino acid decomposition, thereby enhancing the formation of nitrogen-containing aromatics during pyrolysis. From the gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis results, the major high-value nitrogen-containing compounds in the pyrolysis bio-oil of Chlorella and Spirulina were identified as indole and dodecamide. The formation mechanisms of nitrogen-containing compounds were proposed and discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the swelling of climatic and environmental hazards, Biodiesel is playing the most potential and significant role as the sustainable source of energy. As a substitute for diesel, biodiesel has been getting the attention of researchers/scientists of all over the world. The R &amp; D have indicated sustainability of biodiesel production from non-edible oil sources such as Jatropha and algal oil. The objective of the present study was to optimize the process parameters for the transesterification of algal oil using CaO and 80% wt. CaO.Al2O3 as catalysts. A low temperature transesterification process was selected. A biodiesel yield of 88.89% was achieved with methanol/oil volumetric ratio (3.2:10) using 80% wt. CaO.Al2O3 as catalyst (1.56% w/w) in 125 min time at 50 °C temperature using Response Surface Methodology. It was observed that catalyst concentration, reaction time and methanol/oil volumetric ratio had a significant effect on yield. Also, this model involving heterogeneous catalyst can be used in the industry for efficient biodiesel production from algal oil, thereby saving time and cost of the process in optimizing the process parameters. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The chemical effects of carbon dioxide on the oxidation of biodiesel surrogate, methyl butanoate (MB) were investigated experimentally in the SJTU laminar flow reactor at equivalence ratios of 1.5, 1 and 0.5, at atmospheric pressure. Generally, there are three kinds of effects from carbon dioxide (CO2): thermal, dilution and chemical effects. In this study, argon was replaced by CO2 as the dilute gas as a way to isolate the chemical effects by keeping the factors of temperature profile and dilution ratio constant. Therefore, the differences in concentrations of species at the exit from the flow reactor could be attributed to the chemical effects of CO2. Good agreement was found between the experimental and the computational results. The chemical effects were classified into two types. First, there was the radical factor, by which the reaction CO2 + H = OH + CO played a significant role in the oxidation of MB. In CO2 atmosphere, radical factors led to the reduction in reactivity and suppressed the decomposition of MB. The second effect was the collision factor, which derived from the high frequency of third-body collisions of CO2. This collision factor contributed to the formation of carbon monoxide and ethane. Moreover, in the combustion of biodiesel engine with EGR, pure chemical effects of CO2 addition decreased the concentration of acetylene as well as suppressed formation of larger PAHs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to fluctuation in fuel prices in recent times the Indian economy is facing a heavy burden on the economic front to meet the energy supply demand. Due to large gap between the supply and demand of petroleum products. The government of India and various other organizations are working on the development of alternative fuel to petro diesel. Pongamia oil (PO) is being identified as second most important source of biodiesel production in India after Jatropha. But the poor stability and cold flow property associated with the Pongamia biodiesel make it difficult for using it as alternative fuel to diesel. The storage of biodiesel is the major issue for its long term utilization. The aim of current work is to investigate the storage impact of various metals on oxidation stability and cold flow property of Pongamia biofuel. The experimental results shows that oxidation stability of various metal varies in order of Iron>Aluminum> Zinc while all these material deteriorate the cloud and pour point of Pongamia biodiesel and make it unsuitable for its long term use. But the use of antioxidant Pyrogallol improves the oxidation stability of Pongamia biodiesel but it has no significant effect on its cold flow properties. The finding also reveals that Pongamia biodiesel can be stored in metal container only when there is addition of antioxidant to meet the standard of biodiesel.

AB  - In this work, we address the optimal design of an integrated microalgae-based biorefinery through the formulation of a mixed integer nonlinear programming model for the production of biodiesel and potential high-added value products. Main bioproducts are poly (hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and astaxanthin. A combined heat and power cycle to transform biogas generated by the anaerobic digestion of waste streams is also included in the superstructure. Mass and energy balances are formulated for the biorefinery. Different alternatives for PHB extraction are taken into account. The anaerobic digestion model accounts for detailed composition of the different feed streams. Detailed capital cost models for process equipment are formulated and implemented in GAMS to maximize net present value (NPV). Results show that the production of astaxanthin and PHB provides a way to make biodiesel production economically feasible. Open pond and surfactant-chelate are selected for microalgae cultivation and PHB extraction method, respectively. Biodiesel price can be reduced to $0.48 due to incomes from astaxanthin and PHB sales. Also, an economic sensitivity analysis is performed. Further comparison between domestic and international cost conditions is carried out, showing higher NPV in the domestic case. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fossil fuel reserves which supplying a major portion of energy needs, are depleting rapidly, and its environmental damages increases day by day. Therefore, like all developed and developing countries, our country have focused on the use of renewable energy sources. Within this scope in the our country, it was aimed gain of renewable energy sources to economy, promotion of sustainable energy production, and protection of environmental. Recently, one of the growing importance of renewable energy sources is the biomass energy. As an biomass energy source, all vegetable and animal organic substances which the main components are comprising carbohydrate compounds can be used. In these energy sources, microalgae seem promising for biofuel production due to their many advantages such as they have high photosynthetic efficiency, high biomass production, and they grow quickly. From microalgae, by using biochemical methods electricity, ethanol, hydrogen, methane and biodiesel and thermochemical methods syngas, biochar, biodiesel and electricity can be produced. In this review article, isolation of microalgae, microalgal biomass production, the methods used to biomass harvesting, and the availability of microalgae as a source of raw materials for renewable biofuels were viewed.

AB  - There is a significant difference in the performance of waste cooking oil-to-energy companies in China. Most biofuel companies face a loss while a few others have high recovery rates and strong profitability. To shed light on this phenomenon and to aide in formulating policy, this paper constructs a framework from the two dimensions of X-Y and investigates the impact of government intervention on biofuel companies' performance by taking two companies located in the kitchen waste-to-resource pilot cities of Changzhou and Suzhou. Results indicate that: (1) the basic policy instruments of information disclosed and fee and penalty mechanisms in Changzhou are inferior to those of Suzhou. On the other hand, capital investment and cooperation between stakeholders are better in Changzhou. As for the value chain dimension, the policies are similar in both cities. This means that companies involved in the recycling of waste cooking oil and biofuel production equally neglect research and development, preferential loan and product sales by government. (2) In terms of effectiveness, recycling rates and company profits for Changzhou Yueda Kate New Energy Co. Ltd. are far below those of Suzhou Clean Environmental Technology Co. Ltd. Whether the biofuel companies are authorized by government or not, fee and penalty mechanisms and information disclosure are the key determinants affecting performance of biofuel companies. (3) There is still some room to improve the performance of Suzhou Clean Environmental Technology Co. Ltd. Policies can focus on the following: strengthening R & D, which improves the technological supply and diffusion capability of biofuel companies; building the demand-typed policy frame and adjusting policy structure; improving the market structure of biofuel companies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A new process to produce low-temperature Fischer-Tropsch products from the syngas obtained by supercritical water reforming technology of the bio-oil aqueous phase is developed and analyzed. The process includes four sections: syngas production from supercritical water reforming, syngas upgrading by water–gas-shift and dry reforming reactors as well as pressure swing adsorption systems, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and products refining and upgrading through a distillation columns train and hydrocracking reactor. The aim is to produce maximum biofuels and electrical power, achieving the overall energy self-sufficiency. The energy scheme also involves cogeneration (e.g., hot water for district heating) and removal of CO2 for sequestration. Process simulations were carried out by Aspen Plus. The effect of the main operating parameters (feed concentration and composition, as well as operating conditions of Fischer-Tropsch reactor) on the process performance (carbon efficiency with or without refining, biofuel and electricity production) was studied by a sensitivity analysis. This way, the optimal conditions were found, so for a feeding of 60 t/h with a total organic concentration of 35 wt%, carbon efficiency with refining is 38.5% (4.6 t/h biofuel) and 5.3 MWe is generated. The CO2 for sequestration is 0.50 kg/kg of organic feeding. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microwave technique was applied for the synthesis of Argemone biodiesel from Argemone oil under defined experimental conditions. The method presented has the potential to synthesize quality biofuel in timeefficient manner. It also results in higher yield of biodiesel while decreasing the reaction time by almost 75% when compared with conventional heating method. The biodiesel produced was tested for various physico-chemical properties and found to maintain the quality as recommended by various specifications. Reduction in the wear scar diameter of low-sulphur diesel from 432 to 256 μm at a very low concentration of biodiesel (1.0%) was an additional advantage to produce biofuel.

AB  - The effects have been studied for two extraction systems: stirring and Soxhlet, and four different solvents: acetone, chloroform, ethyl acetate and petroleum ether on the physicochemical tomato seed oil properties, for an edible use and for biodiesel production. Oil yield was higher after Soxhlet-petroleum ether extraction (21.19%). Free acidity was always above 2.50%, only Soxhlet-ethyl acetate extracted a tomato seed oil with a very high free acidity (9.51%). The p-anisidine value was lower than 10 after both Sox and stir extractions with ethyl acetate and chloroform. Soxhlet extraction always produced the tomato seed oil with the highest Totox index. Spectrophotometric characteristics described a non-oxidized vegetable oil. Physicochemical properties for biofuel production were: density (20°C) 912.8-926.6 kg/m3; acid value 5.44-18.93 mg KOH (g of oil)-1; oxidative stability index 1.4-8.0 (h). The highest heating value and cetane number were always above 36 MJ (kg of oil)-1 and 39 respectively indicated by DIN 51605 standard for a rapeseed oil for biodiesel production. Essential fatty acids were 57-58% of the total fatty acid methyl ester content. Total mono-unsaturated fatty acid, poly-unsaturated fatty acid and unsaturated fatty acid content was also calculated. The results suggest that tomato seed oil can be used as a feedstock for biodiesel production and as a food. Stirring-chloroform extraction produced the best oil for an edible use except for phenol content and 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl index which were highest when ethyl acetate was used for both stirrer and Soxhlet. Stirring-chloroform and stirring petroleum ether extractions showed the best performances for biodiesel production.

AB  - T{(NPI), 1999 #117}his research compares the effects of oxygenated fuels on engine blow-by during engine cold and hot start operation using a common rail, turbocharged diesel engine. Diesel, waste cooking biodiesel and a highly oxygenated additive, triacetin, were used to make a range of fuel oxygen contents (0–13.57%). This study investigated engine blow-by and its correlation with indicated, brake and friction power; and blow-by normalised by different parameters. Result showed that neat diesel produces higher blow-by during cold start than the oxygenated fuels. There was a strong correlation between blow-by and indicated power, and the fuel calorific value was identified as a leading factor. To further analyse the results, this study normalised the engine blow-by by power to reveal the other influences on engine blow-by. The result verified the strong influence of power. This study also furthered the analysis by normalising the blow-by data by exhaust flow rate, intake air flow rate and injected fuel flow rate. It was discovered that oxygenated fuels perform better between hot and cold start, when compared to diesel. The blow-by inhibited properties of oxygenated fuels, such as higher lubricity and viscosity may be the cause for better performance of oxygenated fuels during cold start. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper aims at investigating the effect of parameters like load and blend on the performance and emission characteristics of a CI engine fueled with Mahua oil. By varying the two input parameters, the performance responses such as Brake thermal efficiency, Brake specific fuel consumption, exhaust gas temperature and emission responses such as NOx emissions were investigated. Though biodiesel helps in better fuel consumption due to enhanced CO2, negative impact like increased NOx emissions occurs. Hence optimization of biofuel content is important. Optimization of these input variables were performed using Response Surface Methodology (RSM), a statistical tool in Design of Experiments(DoE). The desirability approach was used for this optimization. Experimental validation of the optimized results was done. The performance parameters for different Mahua oil blends were found near to diesel with a slight rise in NOx emissions. The RSM study revealed that at the optimum input parameters, the values of BTE, BSFC, EGT and NOx are 31%, 0.26kg/kW-hr, 348°C and 749 ppm respectively. The optimum input parameters for the blend with diesel are B20 and 4.32 kW. The interaction between the input parameters are best understood by this statistical tool.

AB  - The demand for the energy has increased drastically as a result of the rapid growth in industrialization, urbanisation and higher standard of living. One such potential substitute to fossil fuels is biodiesel that ensures sustainable energy source. The selection of appropriate source of biodiesel and proper blending of biodiesel plays a major role in alternate energy production. In the present work, a novel hybrid Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique was proposed to evaluate and select the optimum fuel biodiesel blend for the IC engine with conflicting criteria to enhance the energy efficiency. Exploratory analysis were carried out on a single cylinder four stroke, air cooled, constant speed, direct injection diesel engine with a rated output of 4.4 kW at 1500 rpm at different loads. Two hybrid MCDM models, namely Fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy VIKOR were proposed. Fuzzy was applied to determine the relative weights of the evaluation criteria whereas TOPSIS and VIKOR were applied to obtain the final ranking of alternatives. Diesel, B20, B40, B60, B80 and B100 fuel blend alternatives are prepared by varying the proportion of biodiesel for MCDM model. Similarly BTE, MRPR, NOx CO2, CO, HC, SMOKE, ID, CD and Exhaust gas temperature were considered as the evaluation criteria. The ranking order by Fuzzy TOPSIS is based on closeness coefficient and Fuzzy VIKOR is based on VIKOR index. In Fuzzy TOPSIS, B40 stands first at 50% and 75% load conditions and second at 25% and full load conditions respectively. In Fuzzy VIKOR, B40 stands first at 25% and 50% conditions and second at no load, 75% and full load conditions respectively. The ranking of alternatives as obtained by both Fuzzy-TOPSIS and Fuzzy-VIKOR is B40 &gt; B20 &gt; Diesel &gt; B80 &gt; B60 &gt; B100 and B40 &gt; B20 &gt; Diesel &gt; B60 &gt; B80 &gt; B100. From the results, it was observed that both the methods indicated that B40 is the best blend to operate the engine. Hence, it is concluded that mixing 40% biodiesel with diesel is suggested as a good partial replacement for diesel. This paper highlights a new insight into MCDM techniques to evaluate the best fuel blend for the decision makers such as engine manufactures and R&amp; D engineers to meet the fuel economy and emission norms to empower the green revolution and energy management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present experimental study, CI engine is made to run on 100% Calophyllum Inophyllum Methly Ester (CIME) biodiesel and the same dozed with fuel additives. The study mainly focuses on the influence of two types of fuel additives namely Zinc oxide (ZnO) which is a metal oxide nanoparticle and Ethanox which is an antioxidant. ZnO was added to CIME in the form of nanofluid at different constituent levels of 50 ppm and 10 ppm while Ethanox was added at concentration levels of 200 ppm and 500 ppm. Addition of 100 ppm of ZnO improves the efficiency by 4.7% and 12.6% reduction of NOx at full load. These improvements arise due to the catalytic effect of nanoparticle and micro explosion of water molecules present in the fuel. Antioxidants inhibit the formation of free radicals, Ethanox was found to be better fuel additives in terms of NOx reduction and 500 ppm of Ethanox results in maximum decrease of 17.8%. But this improvement was found to be achieved at the expense of HC and CO. A slight improvement achieved in efficiency for fuel samples containing antioxidant can be attributed to the volumetric effect which arises due to unmodified injection rate and increase in density of the fuel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The catalyst-free transesterification of castor oil under supercritical conditions, using methanol, was studied in this research to determine the molar ratio (methanol:castor oil) and reaction time that produced the biodiesel with the highest conversion by using a 10 L stainless steel batch reactor. The experiments were carried out with 30:1, 40:1, 50:1 and 60:1 molar ratios and reaction times of 5 min, 15 min, 25 min and 35 min under the critical temperature and pressure values according to the molar ratio tested. The reaction conversion was monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The biodiesel was characterized in order to evaluate its accordance to the ASTM D6751 specification and to plot the thermogravimetric and calorimetric profiles of the biodiesel with the highest conversion obtained by TGA and DSC analysis. A regression model was obtained as a reference to calculate the conversion under the studied range of molar ratios and reaction times in future experiments with a coefficient of determination of 95,22% and a standard error of ±1,37% from the observed conversion. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Over 700 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa depend on solid biomass fuel and use simple cookstoves in poorly ventilated kitchens, which results in high indoor concentrations of household air pollutants. Switching from biomass to biogas as a cooking fuel can reduce airborne emissions of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO), but households often only partially convert to biogas, continuing to use solid biomass fuels for part of their daily cooking needs. There is little evidence of the benefits of partial switching to biogas. This study monitored real-time PM2.5 and CO concentrations in 35 households in Cameroon and Uganda where biogas and firewood (or charcoal) were used. The 24 h mean PM2.5 concentrations in households that used: (1) firewood and charcoal; (2) both firewood (mean 54% cooking time) and biogas (mean 46% cooking time); and (3) only biogas, were 449 μg m−3, 173 μg m−3 and 18 μg m−3 respectively. The corresponding 24 h mean CO concentrations were 14.2 ppm, 2.7 ppm and 0.5 ppm. Concentrations of both PM2.5 and CO were high and exceeded the World Health Organisation guidelines when firewood and charcoal were used. Partially switching to biogas reduced CO exposure to below the World Health Organisation guidelines, but PM2.5 concentrations were only below the 24 h recommended limits when households fully converted to biogas fuel. These results indicate that partial switching from solid fuels to biogas is not sufficient and continues to produce concentrations of household air pollution that are likely to harm the health of those exposed. Programmes introducing biogas should aim to ensure that household energy needs can be fully achieved using biogas with no requirement to continue using solid fuels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Concern over unsustainability of petroleum fuels has necessitated the interest in research for alternative fuels. Biodiesel has popped up as promising choice for detailed study as it is renewable and biodegradable with reduced emissions. Since completely miscible with petroleum diesel, various blends of diesel-biodiesel were used along with the additives to improve the efficiency. In this study pongamia biodiesel blends of B20 with ferrofluid as the additive with various volumetric proportions were used as fuel. Ferrofluid was prepared by adding ferrous based nanoparticles with water as base and citric acid as the surfactant. The investigation was done on Kirloskar TV1 single cylinder four stroke diesel engine at different loads, keeping a constant speed of 1500 rpm. The engine performance and emission parameters were analysed. The results indicated that adding of ferrofluid had a positive effect on fuel, decreasing BSFC by 8% as compared to non-additive fuel. CO and HC emission were found to be lower for nano additive biodiesel blend compared to neat biodiesel blend. The blend B20 with 1% ferrofluid resulted maximum efficiency with reduced emission compared to all the fuel blends. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bioenergy is regarded as an attractive, low-carbon energy source because it supports environmentally friendly conversion of biomass to bioenergy, and has low CO2 emissions. Forecasting the development of bioenergy using econometric models can help decision makers to optimize strategies and plan roadmaps for the bioenergy industry and its supply chain. This investigation surveys nine econometric assessments that are relevant to the development of bioenergy, including those based on regression, time-series models, simultaneous equations, input-output model, linear/nonlinear programming model, computable general equilibrium models, engineering economics, data envelopment analysis, and the integrated assessment model. The fundamentals of each model are reviewed, their advantages and disadvantages are addressed; representative models in various categories are provided and compared. Eleven aspects of these models are rated. The results provide useful references for choosing econometric model to evaluate numerical impacts of circular economy, bioeconomy and bioenergy economy for decision makers of countries. © 2017

AB  - Jatropha has been highlighted as an oleaginous potential for the production of biofuel. The cake, produced by oil extraction, could be used in animal feed. However, some varieties of jatropha are toxic by limiting their incorporation into animal diets. The objective of this study was to evaluate the hepatotoxicity of diets added with jatropha cake – JC (Jatropha curcas) in rats. Thirty-five (35) male Wistar adults rats (Rattus norvegicus) with initial weight of 352.1 ± 26.8 g were used. The animals were fed for 21 days with the diets: control, 10, 25, 40 and 50% JC. In the feeding with 50% JC the animals presented themselves prostrate and with piloerection. Development and survival decreased, since the inclusion of JC in diets increased. In rats submitted to 10 and 25% JC there was an increase of 17.52% in the hepatosomatic index in relation to the control group. Increase of JC in the rat diet promoted an increase in the activity of ALT and AST enzymes. Anatomic-histopathological evaluation demonstrated that, regardless of the levels tested, JC in rat diet causes hypertrophy of the hepatocytes, with a reduction in energy reserves. This study demonstrated that the use of JC resulted in decreased food intake, associated with weight loss due to the clinical pattern of toxicity, demonstrated by biochemical and histopathological changes in the liver. It was concluded that the inclusion of jatropha cake in rat feeding presents high hepatotoxic potential leading to lesions in the liver parenchyma. © 2017, Universidade de Sao Paulo.

AB  - Polyoxymethylene Dimethyl Ethers (PODE), with excellent volatility and oxygen content of up to 49%, have great potential to improve engine performance and emission characteristics, especially for soot reduction. In this study, experiments were carried out in a single-cylinder engine fueled with diesel, biodiesel and BP15 (15% PODE and 85% biodiesel by volume). The effects of CA50 and EGR rates on the combustion and emission characteristics have been carefully examined. As CA50 was retarded, diesel always had the shortest ignition delay and longest combustion duration, while BP15 had similar ignition delay, but shorter combustion duration in contrast to biodiesel. As EGR rate varied from 20% to 40%, diesel still presented the shortest ignition delay and longest combustion duration, while BP15 had shorter ignition delay and combustion duration than biodiesel. Regarding to the emissions, BP15 showed the lowest soot emissions and can break the trade-off between NOx and soot emissions. Notably, emissions of NOx and soot can reach 0.05 g/kW h and 0.0009 g/kW h, respectively. In addition, BP15 had the highest thermal efficiency over the test conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increasing demand in transport fuel lead to discovery of Jatropha, Pongatnia plants along with Microalgae for biofuel production. In the present work Biodiesel was produced from Lipase mediated trans-esterification of Algal oil obtained from Botryococcus braunii. Before trans-esterification, Free Fatty Acid(FFA) content in algal oil was reduced and yield of biodiesel was 68.70%, 92% before and after the reduction of FFA respectively. Since lipase is non-toxic, recyclable, and lipase mediated trans-esterification can be carried out at 35°-40° C. Based on these observations lipase mediated trans-esterification is more beneficial than chemical trans-esterification, which can be carried out at 60°-65°C. Copyright © EM International.

AB  - Soy methyl ester and butanol are attractive alternatives to liquid petroleum fuels that can be produced from renewable resources. The combustion characteristics of spray flames of blends of Jet-A, soy methyl ester, and butanol were studied in a porous media combustor. The spray was generated using a swirl air blast atomizer and injected into a heated co-flow environment. The air-fuel mixture was passed through two porous media of different porosities and ignited downstream. The flow rates were adjusted to two different equivalence ratios in the fuel lean regime: 0.5 and 0.6. Measurements of the volumetric concentration of CO, CO2 and NOx in the exhaust were carried out with sampling probes and gas analyzers. The in-flame temperature profiles were measured using an R-type thermocouple. The blue region in the flames increased with the oxygen content in the fuel. The CO and NO emission indices were comparable in all the flames. Peak temperature was recorded at 25% flame height near the flame axis. The measurements highlighted the effectiveness of the porous media in the spray evaporation and mixing, and the impact of fuel-bound oxygen in soot reduction. © 2017 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.

AB  - The Fischer-Tropsch process is one of the possible routes to produce synthetic liquid fuels and chemicals employed on large scale in Gas-to-Liquid and Coal-to-Liquid processes, after appropriate transformation of respective fossil sources into syngas. However, syngas can be produced by biomass gasification as well. One of the main problems is the need to ensure high H2/CO ratio to allow the Fischer-Tropsch reaction to occur, operation commonly achieved by resorting to a Water-gas shift step. The present work reports an experimental study on biomass gasification. The aim was to set up a more efficient Biomass-to-Liquid process, which ensures a high H2/CO ratio syngas suitable for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis directly from biomass gasification. In this way, it is possible to remove the Water-gas shift section and consequently make biofuels production more attractive, reducing costs and plant complexity. Two types of biomass have been tested: softwood from forest residues and fast growing crops. Moreover, a bubbling fluidized bed reactor and an indirect gasifier with internal circulating fluidized bed have been used. Gasification tests have been conducted by running gasifiers with both inert and catalytic bed materials. The results have shown that, using the direct gasifier with catalytic bed and a proper configuration, H2/CO molar ratio of 2 can been obtained even at low temperature and low steam/biomass ratio, whereas this is not the case in the indirect one. However, tests suggest that an inverted configuration would make it possible to obtain values near two also with indirect gasifiers, resulting in a new interesting approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is receiving increasing attention as an alternative fuel due to the ever-growing demand for energy. However, the inferior physiochemical properties of biodiesel render it incompatible for gas turbine application, which needs to meet the standard requirement of gas turbine fuel accordance to ASTM D2880. In this quest, the biodiesel-diesel- bioethanol blends might be a good option. In this paper, the research work was carried out to study experimentally the performance and exhaust emission characteristics of a 25kW micro gas turbine engine (Capstone Model C30) fuelled with biodiesel-dieselbioethanol blends. The assessment on the improved fuel properties of biodiesel by blending with bio-ethanol had shown more superior atomisation characteristics performance compared to unmodified biodiesel. Moreover, the performance test in the micro gas turbine was limited up to 20% blend of biofuel, which showed improved thermal efficiency during the test. Subsequently, the emission test carried out in this work also showed significant enhancement in emissions, except nitrogen oxides (NOx) which contributed to the higher formation in comparison with the distillate diesel. Finally, B80E20 (80:20 of biodiesel-bioethanol) was proposed to be selected as an ideal blended fuel ratio to be applied in micro gas turbine engine due to its adaptability to replace diesel fuel, while showed better performance and emission properties as compared to the pure petroleum diesel. © Universiti Malaysia Pahang Publishing.

AB  - Biodiesel fuels are increasingly attracting interest in the scientific community and in the world motor industry. The morphological analysis of injected sprays is a key factor to increase engine performances using new biodiesel fuels and to compare them with those related to the use of conventional fuels. In this paper, an experimental setup is realised to carry out test campaigns, in order to analyse and compare the spray injections of different fuel typologies. A PC-interfaced electronic system was realised for driving BOSCH injectors and for varying the injection pressure and opening time. Hence, the morphological analysis was performed for each tested fuel by characterising the shaperatio and penetration depth inside the velocimetric chamber. The results show higher penetration values for biodiesel fuels due to their viscosity and drops in superficial tension, which facilitate a deeper penetration compared to those obtained with conventional diesel fuels. Although used biodiesels contain only 20% of renewable vegetable-origin diesel fuels, the viscosity and superficial tension are slightly higher than those of petroleum diesel, thus determining a weak vaporisation and formation of larger drops. By knowing the morphological behaviour of sprays using biofuels and conventional fuel, it is possible, by using programmable electronic systems, to adjust and improve the spray parameters in order to obtain better engine performances. The results reported in this instance could be utilised by future research works for choosing the most suitable biofuel based on the desired morphological behaviour of the injected sprays. © Universiti Malaysia Pahang Publishing.

AB  - Pakistan is facing acute shortage of energy which, in turn, is adversely affecting its economic growth besides discomfort to its vast population. Concurrently, the country is faced with gigantic challenges of rapid increase in population, increased number of motor vehicles on the roads, and urbanization; these adverse developments are leading to ever increasing demand for energy. Having inadequate indigenous energy resources, Pakistan relies heavily on expensive oil imports in the face of foreign exchange scarcity. Thus, the import bill for oil is a big drain on its financial resources. Therefore, alternate sources of energy are need of the hour. Biofuels offer a number of benefits: environmental, economic and geo-political benefits. This article reports an in-depth secondary research with the objective of addressing energy shortages by utilizing an alternate means. The issues related to use of ethanol and biodiesel are energy sources are discussed; and it appears that use of biofuels in Pakistan can help in reducing energy shortage to some extent. © Pakistan Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Wood-derived bio-oil was investigated as a feedstock for the production of renewable hydrocarbons over commercial hydrotreating CoMoS and NiMoS catalysts. Alumina-supported CoMoS active phase showed better selectivity to diesel-like products than NiMoS phase and higher activity in removal of gaseous intermediates (COx) by hydrogenation. This reaction can play an important role in the reduction of corrosivity at the reactor outlet and determine the process economy. The disadvantage of alumina as a support material was its low stability at high temperatures in presence of water. NiMoS catalyst was found to be more active in decarboxylation and it was possible to reach a steady state production of hydrocarbons having a comparable boiling point distribution with crude oil middle distillates. A test performed with a combination of NiMoS (at the top of the catalyst bed) and CoMoS (at the bottom of the reactor) revealed the key role of the catalyst type and reaction conditions in the first zone of the reactor. The experiments with elevated feeding rates showed the undesirable presence of the not-stabilized reactants behind the first reactor zone. Reaction conditions, catalyst selection and presence of additives (methanol to modify viscosity, DMDS/H2S to stabilize active centers) were combined and optimized to tune the product composition and properties. The catalyst low-temperature activity in the first reactor zone was the limiting factor for the maximum feed rate and reactor capacity. The reaction temperature in this zone strongly affects the boiling point distribution of the product. In case of NiMo catalyst, the reaction temperature above 360 °C in the 3rd zone can reduce molecular weight of the product due to mild cracking. In contrast, temperatures above 400 °C result in fast deactivation preventing thus the establishment of the steady state operating regime. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of sulfonic acid-functionalized heterogeneous catalysts in conjunction with the use of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as co-solvent in the catalytic transformation of fructose in ethanol to produce 5-ethoxymethyl furfural (EMF) is shown as an interesting alternative route for the production of this advanced biofuel. Arenesulfonic acid-modified SBA-15 mesostructured silica (Ar-SO3H-SBA-15) has been the most active catalyst, ascribing its higher catalytic performance to the combination of excellent textural properties, acid sites surface concentration and acid strength. Noticeably, DMSO promotes the formation of EMF and HMF, reducing the extent of side reactions. Reaction conditions (temperature, catalyst loading and DMSO concentration) where optimized for Ar-SO3H-SBA-15 via response surface methodology leading to a maximum EMF yield of 63.4% at 116 °C, 13.5 mol% catalyst loading based on starting fructose and 8.3 vol.% of DMSO in ethanol after 4 h of reaction. Catalyst was reused up to 4 consecutive times, without regeneration treatment, showing a slight gradual decay in activity attributed to the formation of organic deposits on the catalyst's surface. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dedicated bioenergy crops grown on marginal lands such as reclaimed mine lands and other non-arable lands are auspicious cellulosic sources for sustainable bioenergy production. In this study, characterization of pyrolysis products were documented for two dedicated bioenergy crops grown on reclaimed coal-mine lands in West Virginia. Two clonal varieties (Private and Public varieties) of Miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus) and two varieties (Bomaster and Kanlow varieties) of Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L) were used in this study. The oven-dried samples were pyrolyzed in a fixed-bed batch reactor under an inert condition and at a temperature of 500 °C to produce biochar and bio-oil (vapor condensate). The pyrolysis product, energy and carbon conversion yields were calculated. Additionally, biochar and bio-oil were characterized for elemental composition, volatile, ash and calorific values. Results showed that there was no significant difference in the biochar yields (about 30.00% yield) obtained from the clonal varieties of Switchgrass and Miscanthus. The bio-oil yields were in the range of 45.00–51.00% with the Miscanthus (Private variety) having the highest bio-oil yield of 50.61%. The carbon content of the biomass, biochar and bio-oil were found to be 46.80–48.02%, 77.72–80.23% and 54.68–59.68%, respectively. Average calorific values were found to be 19.49 MJ/kg, 29.01 MJ/kg and 24.98 MJ/kg for the biomass, biochar and bio-oil, respectively. Results for the surface chemistry of the biochars showed carbon and oxygen to be the major chemical constituents of the surfaces of the biochars. Carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2) and carbon monoxide (CO) were found to be the major components of the non-condensable gas and the CO:CO2ratio showed that the non-condensable gas cannot be used as a fluidizing medium. © 2016

AB  - In this work, the influence of catalyst content on the physicochemical properties (acid value, saponification value, specific gravity, kinematic viscosity, and flash point), yield and chemical composition (hydrocarbons and oxygenates) of organic liquid products (OLP) obtained by thermal-catalytic cracking of palm oil (Elaeis guineensis, Jacq.) has been systematically investigated in technical scale. The pilot experiments were carry out in a stirred tank slurry reactor of 143 L, operating in batch mode at 450 °C and 1.0 atm, using 5, 10, 15, and 20% (wt.) Na2CO3as catalyst. The catalyst has been characterized by XRF and SEM techniques. The organic liquid products have been physicochemical characterized for acid and saponification values, specific gravity, refractive index, kinematics viscosity, copper strip corrosion, and flash point. The chemical composition of organic liquid products was determined by GC–MS. The experimental results indicate that initial cracking temperature, as well as specific gravity, kinematic viscosity, acid value, and saponification value of OLP show a tendency to decrease with increasing catalyst content. Hydrocarbons and oxygenates were the major chemical compounds present in OLP, with chemical composition strongly dependent on the catalyst content. The major hydrocarbons present in the organic liquid products have carbon chain length ranging from C12to C15and its summation shows a tendency to increase with increasing catalyst content, while the summation of oxygenate compounds shows a tendency to decrease. In addition, the distribution of hydrocarbons classes (normal paraffins, olefins, and naphthenics) present in OLP shows a maximum concentration for normal paraffins and naphthenics and a minimum concentration for olefins using 10% (wt.) Na2CO3as catalyst. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As a biofuel feedstock, microalgae has good scalability and potential to supply a significant proportion of world energy compared to most types of biofuel feedstock. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is well-suited to wet biomass (such as microalgae) as it greatly reduces the energy requirements associated with dewatering and drying. This article presents experimental analyses of chemical and physical properties of bio-crude oil produced via HTL using a high growth-rate microalga Scenedesmus sp. in a large batch reactor. The overarching goal was to investigate the suitability of microalgae HTL bio-crude produced in a large batch reactor for direct application in marine diesel engines. To this end we characterized the chemical and physical properties of the bio-crudes produced. HTL literature mostly reports work using very small batch reactors which are preferred by researchers, so there are few experimental and parametric measurements for bio-crude physical properties, such as viscosity and density. In the course of this study, a difference between traditionally calculated values and measured values was noted. In the parametric study, the bio-crude viscosity was significantly closer to regular diesel and biodiesel standards than transesterified (FAME) microalgae biodiesel. Under optimised conditions, HTL bio-crude's high density (0.97'1.04 kg-1) and its high viscosity (70.77-73.89 mm2s-1) had enough similarity to marine heavy fuels. although the measured higher heating value, HHV, was lower (29.8 MJ-kg-1). The reaction temperature was explored in the range 280-350°C and bio-crude oil yield and HHV reached their maxima at the highest temperature. Slurry concentration was explored between 15% and 30% at this temperature and the best HHV, O:C, and N:C were found to occur at 25%. Two solvents (dichloromethane and n-hexane) were used to recover the bio-crude oil, affecting the yield and chemical composition of the bio-crude. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Ni/CMK-3 catalyst, the mesoporous carbon material loading Ni activity, was prepared and used in the in-situ hydrogenation of mixed model compounds (including acetone, acetic acid, furfural, o-cresol, ethanediol and water) of bio-oil (MCB) and actual bio-oil in this paper. The effects of hydrogen donors, solvents and the dosages of catalyst were all investigated in the in-situ hydrogenation process. The results showed that the hydrogen donor of methanol, ethanol and formic acid could all provide hydrogen for the in-situ hydrogenation but the product distributions of bio-oils were different after in-situ hydrogenation. Using alcohols as hydrogen donors, esterification reaction happened between the hydrogen donors and acetic acid. The formic acid could promote the phenols conversion but the conversion of acetic acid was restrained. When the radio of water and methanol was 10:3 and 10:5, most of ketones and aldehydes in the raw bio-oil converted to alcohols and the conversion of acids and phenols was beyond 50%. The contents of alcohols and esters in raw bio-oil increased from 18.52% to 51.14% and 48.21%. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents a comparative techno-economic analysis (TEA) of five conversion pathways from biomass to gasoline-, jet-, and diesel-range hydrocarbons via indirect liquefaction with a specific focus on pathways utilizing oxygenated intermediates. The four emerging pathways of interest are compared with one conventional pathway (Fischer-Tropsch) for the production of the hydrocarbon blendstocks. The processing steps of the four emerging pathways include biomass-to-syngas via indirect gasification, syngas clean-up, conversion of syngas to alcohols/oxygenates followed by conversion of alcohols/oxygenates to hydrocarbon blendstocks via dehydration, oligomerization, and hydrogenation. Conversion of biomass-derived syngas to oxygenated intermediates occurs via three different pathways, producing: (i) mixed alcohols over a MoS2catalyst, (ii) mixed oxygenates (a mixture of C2+oxygenated compounds, predominantly ethanol, acetic acid, acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate) using an Rh-based catalyst, and (iii) ethanol from syngas fermentation. This is followed by the conversion of oxygenates/alcohols to fuel-range olefins in two approaches: (i) mixed alcohols/ethanol to 1-butanol rich mixture via Guerbet reaction, followed by alcohol dehydration, oligomerization, and hydrogenation, and (ii) mixed oxygenates/ethanol to isobutene rich mixture and followed by oligomerization and hydrogenation. The design features a processing capacity of 2000 tonnes/day (2205 short tons) of dry biomass. The minimum fuel selling prices (MFSPs) for the four developing pathways range from $3.40 to $5.04 per gasoline-gallon equivalent (GGE), in 2011 US dollars. Sensitivity studies show that MFSPs can be improved with co-product credits and are comparable to the commercial Fischer-Tropsch benchmark ($3.58/GGE). Overall, this comparative TEA study documents potential economics for the developmental biofuel pathways via mixed oxygenates. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Brazil is a leader in the production of biodiesel, and some challenges still exist in improving the energy usage and feedstocks alternatives for the transesterification process. In this paper, an industrial scale simulation was conducted to show a comparison of the traditional alkali-catalyzed process using catalysis sodium hydroxide with an enzyme-catalyzed process novel developed by the research team of one of the authors. LCA methodology was used to evaluate the potential multiple effects on the environment in Brazilian scenarios. In this regard, three basic cases were carried out: Case 1, where 1 t of soybean biodiesel was produced from the alkali-catalyzed process; Case 2 and 3, where 1 t of biodiesel, using the enzyme-catalyzed process, was produced from soybean oil and waste cooking oil respectively. The results reveal that considerable contribution can be made to the environment in Case 3 when waste cooking oil (WCO) is considered as a nearly environment-burden-free resource. Additionally, as illustrated in Case 2, not only the feedstock but also the technologic process can generate great influence on the environment when producing biodiesel in a large-scale plant. The efficiency of electric and thermal energy usage should be appropriately considered to diminish these impacts as much as possible. Likewise, chemicals and waste disposal also need to be well managed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel has been widely proposed as an alternative to fossil fuels and its environmental impacts have been commonly assessed using life cycle assessment (LCA). However, the results of LCA can be affected by parameter uncertainties. The rigorous treatment of such uncertainties is thus essential to improve decision-making based on the LCA. In this work, the Latin hypercube design of experiments (DOE) approach is proposed for global sensitivity analysis in LCA. In this novel approach, the LCA input parameters are used as the factors for the experimental design. The LCA of biodiesel from different feedstocks, namely, jatropha, waste cooking oil (WCO), and fish oil (FO), under the current conditions in Vietnam was chosen as a test case. The LCA focuses on the global warming potential (GWP), photochemical ozone formation potential (POFP), acidification potential (AP), and eutrophication potential (EP) of the biodiesel system. These impact categories were then combined into an overall environmental impact (OEI) score using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The effect of changes in the LCA model parameters on the OEI was then observed through computational experiments using a Latin hypercube design. From the computational experiments, the input parameters significantly affecting the results of LCA were identified, and a proxy polynomial regression model was derived to enable global sensitivity analysis to be performed. The results show that agricultural yield, oil content of jatropha seed, transesterification yield, total transportation, and biodiesel blending fraction are the factors that have significant effects on the OEI of jatropha biodiesel; biodiesel blend fraction and total transportation are significant in the case of WCO diesel, while the only significant effect factor in FO biodiesel case is biodiesel blend fraction. Biodiesel blend fraction is the most significant parameter for all feedstocks. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this article we analyze the community capital implications of an emerging canola biofuel value chain within wheat-producing regions of the United States as radical changes are taking place in energy markets and prices drop. We analyze the intersections of the motivations that encourage and sustain value chain participation and stocks and investments of community capitals. We use the Community Capitals Framework (Flora et al. 2016) to analyze the ways that new biofuel value chains affect various types of capital within rural communities, and to understand the context, processes, and impacts of decision-making within the biofuel value chain. Interviews and focus groups with actors along the value chain including farmers, processors, transporters, plant breeders, extension professionals, and farm service suppliers identify motivational factors and how community resources affect participation decisions. © 2017 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

AB  - Alcohols are gaining interest as an alternate biofuel for compression ignition engines because they contain oxygen and are produced using biomass. Since they have lower cetane number, they are suitable for premixed combustion applications. In this investigation, the authors have tried to improve a single cylinder diesel engine's performance by injecting ethanol into the intake port during the suction stroke. Rubber seed oil (RSO), rubber seed oil methyl ester (RSOME) and diesel are the primary fuels injected directly into the combustion chamber. The injection timing and duration of ethanol injection were optimized for dual fuel operation. The results indicate that increasing ethanol quantity with RSO and RSOME lead to an increase in brake thermal efficiency and reduction in smoke emissions. The maximum brake thermal efficiency achieved at full load is 31%, 29.9% and 29.3% with diesel, RSOME and RSO at ethanol energy shares of 35.2%, 33.5% and 31.6%, respectively. Smoke reduces by 44.26% with RSO, 43.63% with RSOME and 26.47% with diesel at maximum thermal efficiency point. However, HC, CO, and NOx emissions increases with increase in ethanol energy share at all loads. Peak pressure and maximum rate of pressure rise increases with increase in ethanol injection. Combustion duration reduces with ethanol injection, which in turn contributes to a higher heat release rate. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Methanol is an alternative fuel offering a lower well-to-wheel CO2 emission as well as a higher efficiency, given that the fuel is derived from biomass. In addition to reduced CO2, methanol does not emit soot particles when combusted which is a great advantage when attempting to reduce NOX levels due to the effectively non-existing NOX-soot trade-off. The engine setup used was a Scania D13 engine modified to run on one cylinder, utilizing a high compression piston with a rc of 27:1. This study analyzes the effects of four control parameters on gross indicated efficiency and the indicated specific emissions; CO, THC and NOX. The control parameters chosen in this work was common rail pressure (PRAIL), EGR, λ and CA50, running at 6 bar IMEPG and 1200 rpm. The effects of the control parameters on performance and emissions was analyzed using a surface response method of the Box-Behnken type. Predictive mathematical models were obtained from regression analysis performed on the responses from the experiments. The highest gross indicated efficiency achieved was ∼53%, when a high level of EGR was applied together with the combustion phasing set to its low level at CA50 = 6 CAD ATDC. The control parameters influencing the CO emissions are λ and the interaction between PRAIL and λ, while THC is only controlled by PRAIL and EGR. NOX emissions was, as expected, influenced mainly by EGR and λ, although PRAIL and CA50 also had minor effects. The effect of increased PRAIL, increased THC emissions which in its turn reduced the gross indicated efficiency. Throughout the experiment, THC concentration never decreased below ∼150 ppm due to utilization of high rc in combination with the volatility of methanol. It was also concluded that a rc = 27 is rather high if operation flexibility is required, especially at the higher load range. © 2017

AB  - The early 2000s witnessed a global awareness on adoption of renewable and environmentally friendly energy with anticipated socio-economic benefits in developing countries. Jatropha curcas. L. (Jatropha) was the main bioenergy crop adopted for production under out-grower schemes in Zambia. However, recent studies report worldwide abandonment of Jatropha production. This study therefore investigated factors responsible for the abandonment of Jatropha production under out-grower schemes in Chibombo District, Zambia. A total of 110 smallholder farmers who participated in these out-grower schemes and one key informant were selected using snowball sampling. Primary data was collected using field observations and a cross-sectional survey using a structured questionnaire administered through face-to-face interviews. Findings reveal that abandonment of Jatropha production was mainly driven by lack of market for the produce, and non-commitment of the sponsoring firm to contractual agreements under the out-grower schemes. Thus, more than 90% of the farmers did not earn income from the sale of Jatropha. To achieve optimal performance of these out-grower schemes, a supporting policy environment and legal framework enforcing compliance to contractual agreements are required. Further, such should be accompanied by creation of market opportunities for the crop as well as its price regulation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Immense potential is seen in Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines as an alternative to conventional Compression Ignition (CI) engines as it can simultaneously reduce oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and soot while maintaining high efficiency. The challenges are predominantly control of combustion and limited operating ranges. Mitigation of these challenges using PCCI-DI is explored in this work. A pilot injector is used to supply a small quantity of premixed charge of fuel and air to the engine followed by direct injection through the main injector. An added advantage is dual fuel capability and improvement of combustion characteristics. Two fuels namely diesel and a blend of ethanol and diesel (containing 15% of ethanol by volume, called E15D) are used in four different combinations for the pilot and main injection. The emission characteristics of each combination were then compared with the conventional mode of operation. The four combinations or modes of operation with PCCI setup were Diesel-Diesel (pilot-main fuel), Diesel-E15D, E15D-Diesel, and E15D-E15D. The results of the experiment indicate that the Diesel-E15D mode is comparatively the best mode of operation due to its lower NOx and smoke emissions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A process of much future-potential for upgrading of biofuels derived from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is catalytic hydrotreatment. HTL bio-oil, manufactured from Chlorella microalgae in a reactor operating in continuous flow mode was processed via hydrotreatment using a bio-Pd/C catalyst. This catalyst comprises a bacterial biomass support decorated with Pd(0) nanoparticles. The hydrotreatment performance of commercial Pd/C catalyst and bio-Pd/C was compared in order to benchmark the latter catalyst preparation. Oil:catalyst ratio, time and temperature were investigated as three variables for optimization. Similar conversion was observed for both Pd/C (76% liquid yield, 4.2% O) and bio-Pd/C (77% liquid yield, 3.9% O) catalysts under equivalent conditions (4 h reaction time, 5 wt% Pd loading, 325 °C). The oxygen content was reduced by 65%, whilst the nitrogen content decreased by 35%, with a bio-oil:catalyst ratio of 20, at a temperature of 325 °C and reaction time of 4 h. The upgraded oil was further studied by elemental analysis, Simulated Distillation and GC–MS, in order to quantify the improvement in fuel properties. The fresh and spent catalysts were analyzed using elemental analysis, TGA and ICP-MS, showing that the bio-oil yield was augmented by conversion of the biomass component from bio-Pd/C. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - The ambitious targets of the aviation industry to reduce greenhouse gas emissions require the use of biofuels in this transport sector in the short and medium term. While five biogenic aviation turbine fuels have already been certified by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM D7566), the search for suitable alternatives continues, seeking higher possible blending ratios or better fuel qualities. Fluidized-bed catalytic cracking (FCC) of algae oil, followed by hydrotreatment of intermediates, could be such a potential option. This conversion concept has several potential advantages, such as aromatic compounds in the biokerosene and the use of a non-food biogenic oil as feedstock. Material and energy balances are obtained from flowsheet simulation using ASPEN Plus®, with the aim to assess the efficiency of the process. The simulation model contains all relevant conversion and separation steps, and auxiliary components such as a steam reformer and a furnace. Simulation parameters for all unit operations were based on current literature to represent the state-of-the-art of the involved technologies. Additionally, the process was optimized by heat integration and waste heat utilization. The established simulation model is proposed to serve as a concept study and basis for the implementation of future experimental results and perceptions. With an energy efficiency of 95% and a biokerosene yield of 41%, the results emphasize the potential of this conversion process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The major drawbacks of using biodiesel as a neat fuel are low oxidation stability, high viscosity, lower thermal efficiency and higher NOx emission. Many studies have been attempted to reduce the drawbacks of biodiesel and to use it as a conventional fuel. The present work aims to reduce the problems associated with neat biodiesel using addition of non-polluting additives. Mahua oil has been chosen as a biodiesel due to its non-edible nature and properties similar to diesel. Mahua oil methyl ester (MOME) was prepared by conventional transesterification. Ferrofluid, comprising of magnetite of 14 nm size was added to the base fuel and is referred to as MOMEF (Mahua Oil Methyl Ester with the addition of Ferrofluid). The advantage of ferrofluid is that, unlike other additives, it can be extracted from the exhaust gas. Ferrofluid releases additional heat during the course of the combustion process which reduces its conventional drawbacks. Furthermore, it can be easily diluted to biodiesel and as a result it can collect the benefits of water-biodiesel emulsions. This fuel modification is expected to improve the properties of mahua oil methyl-ester and to eliminate problems associated with it. Performance, combustion and emission tests were carried out in a 21 kW power, four-stroke, twin-cylinder, direct-injection, compression-ignition engine. Experimentally, it was observed that methyl esters of mahua oil can be combusted in an IC engine like other biofuels without any major modifications. Experiments were conducted with MOME and MOMEF and are compared with conventional diesel. The experimental analysis revealed an increase in brake thermal efficiency of about 5.27% and a decrease in brake specific fuel consumption of about 5.37%. In addition the HC, CO and NOx emissions were reduced by 10.8%, 6.44% and 9.49% respectively. © 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Catalytic hydropyrolysis is an emerging and promising technology for producing cellulosic biofuels. Ex situ catalytic hydropyrolysis offers additional benefits of operational flexibility and catalyst performance. The unique feature of a two-step ex situ hydropyrolysis vapor upgrading process has been demonstrated for the first time using a double fluidized-bed reactor system. Product distribution (35.2-46.7% C5+ organic yield on a carbon basis) and oxygen content of the organic liquid product (2-17 wt%) can be tailored by adjusting process conditions. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to identify oxygen functionalities and representative species in the organic liquid products. The structural information was further related to product stability, a key property pertaining to product storage, transportation, and processing. Unlike pyrolysis oil, the products contained minimal amounts of reactive oxygenates (e.g., aldehydes, acids, sugars, and other multifunctional oxygenates) that could cause stability issues. As a result, the products were stable in storage at 40°C for 2 months. Further thermal stability tests show that all of the products were more stable than pyrolysis oil and soybean oil at elevated temperatures. The products with 6 wt% oxygen or less showed high thermal stability (behaving much like a petroleum distillate hydrotreater feed in the tests) and possessed low total acid number (<1 mg KOH per g), indicating good petroleum refinery compatibility. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - The performance, combustion and emission characteristics of diesel engine fuelled with corn stalk pyrolysis bio-oil/diesel emulsions (CBDEs) with Ce0.7Zr0.3O2 nanoadditive were studied. The density and viscosity of CBDEs increased by 10.7% and 159.3% with increasing bio-oil concentration up to 25%, respectively. Meanwhile, the calorific value was correspondingly reduced by 18.5%. Compared to diesel, a lower specific fuel consumption was achieved with the CBDE fuels at medium and high powers. This was attributed to micro-explosion, which resulted in more thorough splitting of fuel droplets caused by the instantaneous and intense vaporization of water, thereby significantly improving fuel vaporization and combustion process. In addition, the addition of Ce0.7Zr0.3O2 nanoparticles led to reduced ignition delay and rapid oxidation, thus resulting in more complete combustion. The specific fuel consumption of CBDEs first decreased and then increased in correlation to the increased bio-oil content, in which CBDEs with bio-oil proportion of 20% showed the lowest and had the highest fuel saving rate close to 8.4%. By comparison of diesel, the CBDEs with lower bio-oil proportion than 20% reduced CO, HC and smoke emission, which were decreased by reducing bio-oil content. Increasing bio-oil proportion led to the effective reduction of NOx emission. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Integrating a range of complementary energy models is becoming an increasingly common method for informing low carbon energy pathways at both national and global levels. Multi-modelling approaches facilitate improved understanding of the detailed technology pathways required to meet decarbonisation targets; however, to-date there has been limited attention on the policy roadmaps and enabling measures that might achieve these decarbonisation targets. This paper addresses this gap by developing a multi-model approach using an energy systems optimisation model, a sectoral simulation model together with scrutiny of individual policy measures to explore decarbonisation of the private car sector in the Irish transport system commensurate with an 80% reduction in national carbon emissions by 2050. The results comprise a cost optimal technology pathway for private cars in a future energy system constrained by a maximum level of carbon emissions, a policy roadmap identifying annual changes in energy efficiency, renewable energy and electrification, and a suite of enabling measures including changes to vehicle registration tax, a biofuel obligation on suppliers and a suite of measures to increase the share of electric vehicles in the fleet. The level of confidence in the different enabling measures to achieve the policy goals is compared and discussed. © 2017

AB  - In this study, electrically-facilitated forward osmosis (FO) employing proton exchange membrane (PEM) was established for the purpose of microalgae dewatering. An increase in water flux was observed when an external voltage was applied to the FO equipped with the PEM; as expected, the trend became more dramatic with both concentration of draw solution and applied voltage raised. With this FO used for microalgae dewatering, 247% of increase in flux and 86% in final biomass concentration were observed. In addition to the effect on flux improvement, the electrically-facilitated FO exhibited the ability to remove chlorophyll from the dewatered biomass, down to 0.021 ± 0015 mg/g cell. All these suggest that the newly suggested electrically-facilitated FO, one particularly employed PEM, can indeed offer a workable way of dewatering of microalgae; it appeared to be so because it can also remove the ever-problematic chlorophyll from extracted lipids in a simultaneous fashion. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper reports the effect of post-injection on pollutant emissions from a four-cylinder, direct-injection diesel engine fueled with biodiesel. Characteristics of exhaust pollutants were measured and evaluated for different main-post intervals (MPIs) and post-injection rates (PIRs). Measurements included emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), total hydrocarbons (THC), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), the particle number concentration distribution, and the reactivity and graphitization degree of the soot particles. Increasing the MPI or PIR increased the emissions of CO and THC but decreased those of NOx. At both low and high MPI values, higher PM emissions and particle number concentrations were observed for the 12 and 20% PIRs. At a PIR of 4%, PM emissions and particle number concentration increased with the increase in MPI. The size distributions of exhaust particulates exhibited a trimodal character under the applied operating conditions. The particle geometric mean diameter decreased with the increase in MPI, probably as a result of an increased yield of soluble organic compounds. Post-injection significantly impacted the reactivity of emitted soot particles, as evidenced by changes in the graphitization degree of soot. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In consideration of the CO2 saving potentials of biofuels, a quota of biodiesel in fossil diesel fuel is established in a number of countries all over the world. However, primary investigations on fossil diesel fuel/biodiesel blends showed a certain tendency to form precipitates, which can be considered as oligomers. They result from aging of biodiesel. However, the tendency of fuel blends to form precipitates during long term storage could jeopardize the operational safety in plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV). In PHEV, the combustion engine is only used when the power supply from the battery is too low. On short distance rides, the combustion engine is not necessary, because of frequent battery recharging. Consequently, the storage time of the fuel in the tank is much longer than usual. For this reason the fuel long-term stability in PHEV is of particular importance. A mixture design based on a simplex-lattice design fourth-degree was used to obtain variable fuel composition. Aged samples containing linoeleic acid methyl ester (C18:2) formed precipitates that could sediment at the bottom of the vials. After a waiting period of 30 and 300 s of sedimentation time, samples of the upper phase of the vial were taken and investigated by dielectric- and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to determine the stability of the suspension. For reasons of comparison size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used too. It was shown, that the stability of the suspension is very much dependent on the fuel mixture. The lowest stability was found in the range of 15 to 22.5% C18:2. Finally, a fourth-order regression model for the real part of the permittivity was found, which could estimate the composition of fresh fuels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The increasing demand on energy due to population growth and rise of living standards has led to considerable use of fossil fuels which cause environmental pollution and depletion of fossil fuels. Biodiesel proves to be a good alternative for fossil fuels. But sustainability of biodiesel is the key factor for determining it as a fuel in diesel engines. It needs identification of proper blend of biodiesel and diesel to meet the efficiency, engine suitability and environmental acceptability. Alternative fuel blend evaluation in IC engine fuel technologies is a very important strategic decision tool involving balancing between a number of criteria such as performance, emission and combustion parameters and opinions from different decision maker of IC engine experts. Hence, it is a MCDM problem. This paper describes the application of hybrid Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques for the selection of optimum biodiesel blend in IC engine. FAHP-TOPSIS, FAHP-VIKOR and FAHP-ELECTRE, are the three methods that are used to evaluate the best blend. The performances of these MCDM methods are also compared with each other. Here, FAHP is used to determine the relative weights of the criteria, whereas TOPSIS, VIKOR and ELECTRE are used for obtaining the final ranking of alternatives. A single cylinder, constant speed and direct injection diesel engine with a rated output of 4.4 kW is used for exploratory analysis of evaluation criteria at different load conditions. Diesel, B20, B40, B60, B80 and B100 fuel blends are prepared by varying the proportion of biodiesel. Similarly, Brake thermal efficiency (BTE), Exhaust gas temperature (EGT), Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), Smoke, Hydrocarbon (HC), Carbon monoxide (CO), Carbon dioxide (CO2), Ignition Delay, Combustion Duration and Maximum Rate of Pressure Rise are considered as the evaluation criteria. The ranking of alternatives obtained by FAHP-TOPSIS, FAHP-VIKOR and FAHP-ELECTRE are B20 &gt; Diesel &gt; B40 &gt; B60 &gt; B80 &gt; B100 for 21°bTDC and 24°bTDC and Diesel &gt; B20 &gt; B40 &gt; B60 &gt; B80 &gt; B100 for 27°bTDC. It shows that B20 is ranked first for 21°bTDC and 24°bTDC and second for 27°bTDC injection timing. Hence, it is concluded that mixing 20% biodiesel with diesel is suggested as a good replacement for diesel. This paper provides a new insight of applying MCDM techniques to evaluate the best fuel blend by decision makers such as engine manufactures and R&amp;D engineers to meet the fuel economy and emission norms to empower green revolution. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of nine algae species were performed at two reaction temperatures (280 and 320 °C) to compare the effect of their biomass composition on product yields and properties. Results obtained after HTL indicate large variations in terms of bio-oil yields and its properties. The maximum bio-oil yield (66 wt%) was obtained at 320 °C with a high lipid containing algae Nannochloropsis. The higher heating value of bio-oils ranged from 31 to 36 MJ/kg and around 50% of the bio-oils was in the vacuum gas oil range while high lipid containing algae Nannochloropsis contained a significant portion (33–42%) in the diesel range. A predictive relationship between bio-oil yields and biochemical compositions was developed and showed a broad agreement between predictive and experimental yields. The aqueous phases obtained had high amount of TOC (12–43 g/L), COD (35–160 g/L), TN (1–18 g/L), ammonium (0.34–12 g/L) and phosphate (0.7–12 g/L). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The primary aim of this study is to analyse the efficiency of heating systems focusing attention on the consistency between the estimated consumption based on the declarations made by greenhouse operators and the selected estimation model, and the amounts of fuel officially assigned by the public body. The Italian greenhouse cultivation systems are characterized by a relevant use of economic and material resources. Based on the periodical survey on agriculture carried out by the Italian government, the total national surface devoted to production under greenhouse was about 42,500 ha (ISTAT, 2016) according to ISTAT in 2011. Although many are the contributors to the equivalent energy consumption (about 16 Mtoe for the entire agriculture sector) (Campiotti, 2016), the protected cropping systems account for a consistent part of the total load (considering the limited cultivation area). The average consumption of fossil resources (for heating) and electricity was 23 MWh/ha and 0.8 MWh/ha respectively. In Marche region, the surface covered by greenhouses was about 203 ha (0.7 % of the total in Italy in 2011) (ISTAT, 2011). Focusing on consumption and related emission of fuels used for direct heating, the diesel (the most used fuel in Marche region) (Campiotti, 2013) is responsible of a medium emission level (266 g CO2 eq/kWh). In this study, the authors investigated the use of energy as fuel for heating in nursery systems, considering different production systems. Greenhouse types were grouped considering the characteristics of building structure, crops and type of heating system. Collected information regards: type of greenhouse and cover; heated surface; plants produced; installed power of heating system; operational period; fuel type; average fuel consumption; efficiency and greenhouse requirements. More in detail, based on bearing structure, the typologies of greenhouse individuated are three, eighteen types of cover considering the material used and five typologies of fuels/biofuels or a mix of them. The original sample consists of 62 Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) involved in nursery productions. Regarding the type of structure, the most represented types are tunnels with or without vertical walls or mixed systems. Plastic materials are the most used for cover representing the 76 % of all the materials employed. The most used fuel for heating is diesel (in 84% of enterprises). The covered surface varies between 0.004 ha and 4 ha and 89 % of nurseries have a covered area smaller than 1ha (mean 0.2 ha). The average heating power installed for diesel systems is about 250 kW, with about 59 l/day of fuel combusted. The research highlights the relation between the different aspects characterizing each greenhouse type. The goal of the study is to give useful information to the policy maker for a correct incentivization of greenhouse production by providing data of energy consumption more linked to the real greenhouse system employed in the region. The results of this study could support the creation of a more virtuous production chain and could support regional policies also on energy use efficiency and GHG emissions reduction.

AB  - In this work, 1,4-sultone and benzimidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs) with four different anions were synthesized, and their structures were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and elemental analysis (CHNS). The acidity of the synthesized ILs was studied using Hammett acidity function and COSMO-RS. The waste cooking oil was used as a raw material for biodiesel production and their different fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography coupled with flame ionization detector (GC-FID). These four ILs, as catalysts, were screened and comparatively IL 3-methyl-1-(4-sulfo-butyl)-benzimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate [BSMBIM][CF3SO3] was selected for further detailed optimization study. This IL experimental efficiency results supported the Hammett acidity function and COSMO-RS study. The catalyst performance was studied and optimised the different parameters. The catalyst efficiency was studied in one and two-step reactions. [BSMBIM][CF3SO3] as a catalyst showed the esterification of waste cooking oil up to 78.13% in a single step reaction. Potassium hydroxide was used in the second step to trans-esterify the waste cooking oil up to 94.52%. The catalyst was reused for seven times with high-yield production. The obtained biodiesel was characterized by GC, NMR, FTIR, thermogravimetric (TGA) and their physicochemical properties were compared with the already established standards. The kinetic study of this transesterification reaction was evaluated and followed the first-order reaction mechanism. © 2017

AB  - Multi-cyclic hydrocarbons from biomass are sustainable alternative for jet fuel. Here we report an unexpected hydrogenated intramolecular cyclization of diphenylmethane derivatives synthesized by alkylation of bio-derived compounds. With the presence of commonly used zeolite-Pd/C dual catalyst, conventional hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) occurs to produce dicyclohexylmethane. However, when only hydrogenation catalysts like Pd/C or Ni is used, novel intramolecular cyclization takes place to produce perhydrofluorene with the selectivity as high as 96.0%. The two pathways were illustrated by step-by-step controlled reactions in detail and a mechanism was proposed to explain the reason for perhydrofluorene formation. Moreover, this intramolecular cyclization is versatile for diphenylmethane with –OCH3 or –OH group at any position. The synthesized perhydrofluorene shows density of 0.96 g/mL, much higher than any biofuels reported and even higher than the widely used high-density fuel JP-10 derived from petroleum. It is believed that this biofuel can be excellent additive to improve the density of other jet fuels. © 2017

AB  - Three new advanced biofuels have been produced from sesquiterpene feedstocks. Cedarwood oil, which is primarily composed of the sesquiterpenes thujopsene, α-cedrene, and β-cedrene, was hydrogenated to generate a fuel blend (HCWO) with a cetane number of 31 and a volumetric net heat of combustion (NHOC) more than 12% higher than conventional jet fuel. Hydrogenation under pressures ranging from 400 to 440 psi allowed for reduction of the double bond in thujopsene while keeping the cyclopropane ring intact. A single component high density fuel containing only hydrogenated α-cedrene (cedrane) was then prepared by dehydration and hydrogenation of α-cedrol, and found to have an even higher NHOC and lower viscosity than HCWO. Cedrane was then isomerized to 1-ethyl-3,5,7-trimethyladamantane (ETMA) and a mixture of other alkyl adamantanes. The adamantane mixture had a cetane number of 46 and a viscosity suitable for use in a conventional diesel engine. This work shows that sustainable multicyclic sesquiterpenes are versatile feedstocks to ultra-performance fuels that combine high densities with high cetane numbers. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - In the present work, the spray characteristics of bio-ethanol and its blends have been experimentally and theoretically investigated. To have a comprehensive study, the effects of ambient condition and injection pressure on the spray of different blends have been considered. Macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of spray such as tip penetration length, cone angle, projected area, volume, Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD), and Ohnesorge number are investigated precisely. Besides, air entrainment and atomization analyses have been carried out to improve mixture formation process. Using curve fitting and least squares method, theoretical correlations have been suggested in such a way to predict experimental results with the accuracy of 9.9%. To have a good estimation of the calculated parameters, uncertainty analysis has been performed. The results demonstrate that enhancing the injection pressure or decreasing the ambient pressure improves the atomization characteristics of spray. Moreover, outcomes of this study indicate that spray tip penetration is enhanced by increasing the injection pressure or bio-ethanol percentage in the blend, while spray cone angle showing the opposite behavior. © 2017 Sharif University of Technology.

AB  - Biomass is an interesting renewable energy resource as it is widespread in nature and low cost. The development of bio-oil derived from biomass as a fuel is still a scientific and industrial challenge. In this context, we demonstrate the synthetic method of bio-oil upgrading catalysts based on hierarchical zeolites and open up interesting perspectives for bio-oil upgrading processes. The hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite has been successfully prepared via a direct hydrothermal synthesis with the aid of a commercial organosilane surfactant (TPOAC). The influences of TPOAC content and Si/Al ratio on hierarchical structures were also systematically studied. To illustrate their catalytic performances, an esterification reaction of various organic acids such as (acetic acid and levulinic acid) and alcohols was performed as the model reaction representing the bio-oil upgrading application. The synergic effect of acidity and the hierarchical structure of catalysts can greatly enhance the catalytic performance in terms of activity, product yield, coke formation, and reusability of the catalysts. For example, they can convert almost 100% of reactant in 8 h in the esterification of acetic acid and alcohols, whereas the conventional zeolite reveals significantly lower activity (<20%). Interestingly, the hierarchical zeolite can also greatly improve the catalytic activity of the esterification of levulinic acid and ethanol to produce ethyl levulinate that can be used as a diesel miscible biofuel (DMB). In addition, the efficiency of hierarchical catalysts obtained by different synthesis methods is also discussed. This first example demonstrates that the hierarchical zeolite obtained via a direct synthesis approach can benefit bio-oil upgrading applications via the esterification of various carboxylic acids. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This study compares the techno-economic feasibility of five forest-based biofuel conversion pathways for road transportation in the Nordic countries with particular focus paid to feedstock cost effects on total costs in a partial equilibrium model environment. We present (I) a literature review of techno-economic estimates detailing biofuel costs at various capacities, (II) estimate a capacity-wise normalized cost-comparison of the conversion pathways, and (III) estimate the feedstock cost changes with increasing biofuel facility deployment in the Nordic Forest Sector Model. The results indicate that fast pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction are the most cost-competitive options among the reviewed conversion pathways. We found average costs of FASTPYR and HTL to range from 0.84 €−L to 0.91 €−L (0.93 $−L to 1.01 $−L) and 0.84 €−L to 0.88 €−L (0.93 $−L to 0.98 $−L) depending on the techno-economic data used and forest biomass marked demand. Technology learning may reduce these costs further. The conversion pathways are not cost-competitive with current fossil alternatives but may be cost-competitive with current biofuel conversion pathways, given nth plant cost levels. At a biofuel production level corresponding to 20% of the Nordic fossil fuel consumption for road transport, feedstock costs increase 12.0–35.2%, depending on the conversion pathway and the restrictions imposed on what constitutes biofuel feedstock. This corresponds to an increase ranging from 9.9% to 26.2% on the total costs. Technology learning may outweigh the effect of feedstock cost increases on the total costs depending on the learning rate and the conversion pathway. The results of this study can potentially aid policy creation for conversion pathway evaluation and support schemes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of non-edible, second-generation feedstocks for the production of biodiesel has been an active area of research, due to its potential in replacing fossil diesel as well as its environmentally friendly qualities. Despite this, more needs to be done to remove the technical barriers associated with biodiesel production and usage, to increase its quality as well as to widen the choice of available feedstocks; so as to avoid over-dependence on limited sources. This paper assesses the feasibility of using a local plant, Reutealis trisperma, whose seeds contain a high percentage of oil of up to 51%, as one of the possible feedstocks. The techno-economic and sensitivity analysis of biodiesel production from Reutealis trisperma oil as well as implementation aspects and environmental effects of the biodiesel plant are discussed. Analysis indicates that the 50 kt Reutealis trisperma biodiesel production plant has a life cycle cost of approximately 710 million, yielding a payback period of 4.34 years. The unit cost of the biodiesel is calculated to be 0.69/L with the feedstock cost accounting for the bulk of the cost. The most important finding from this study is that the biodiesel from Reutealis trisperma oil can compete with fossil diesel, provided that appropriate policies of tax exemptions and subsidies can be put in place. To conclude, further studies on biodiesel production and its limitations are necessary before the use of biodiesel from Reutealis trisperma oil may be used as a fuel source to replace fossil diesel. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - A well-to-wheel life cycle assessment (LCA) model is developed to characterize the life cycle energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions profiles of a series of novel multistage torrefaction and pyrolysis systems for targeted thermochemical conversion of short rotation woody crops to bio-oil and in situ catalytic upgrading to hydrocarbon transportation fuels, and to benchmark the results against a base-case fast pyrolysis and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) platform. Multistage systems utilize a staged thermal gradient to fractionate bio-oil into product streams consisting of distinct functional groups, and multi-step chemical synthesis for downstream processing of bio-oil fractions to hydrocarbon fuels. Results at the process scale reveal that multistage systems have several advantages over the base-case including: (1) ∼40% reduction in process hydrogen consumption and (2) the product distribution for multistage systems are skewed towards longer carbon chain compounds that are fungible with diesel-range fuels. LCA reveals that the median Energy Return On Investment (EROI) and life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for multistage systems range from 1.32 to 3.76 MJ-fuel/MJ-primary fossil energy and 17.1 to 52.8 gCO2e/MJ-fuel respectively, over the host of co-product scenarios and allocation schemes analyzed, with fossil-derived hydrogen constituting the principle GHG and primary energy burden across all systems. These results are compelling and indicate that multistage systems exhibit comparatively higher gasoline/diesel-range fuel yield relative to current technology, and produce a high quality infrastructure-compatible hydrocarbon transportation fuel capable of achieving over 80% reduction in life cycle GHG emissions relative to baseline petroleum diesel. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Proteomics and metabolomics analysis has become a powerful tool for characterization of microbial ability for fixation of Carbon dioxide. Bacterial community of palaeoproterozoic metasediments was enriched in the shake flask culture in the presence of NaHCO3. One of the isolate showed resistance to NaHCO3 (100 mM) and was identified as Serratia sp. ISTD04 by 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Carbon dioxide fixing ability of the bacterium was established by carbonic anhydrase enzyme assay along with proteomic analysis by LC–MS/MS. In proteomic analysis 96 proteins were identified out of these 6 protein involved in carbon dioxide fixation, 11 in fatty acid metabolism, indicating the carbon dioxide fixing potency of bacterium along with production of biofuel. GC–MS analysis revealed that hydrocarbons and FAMEs produced by bacteria within the range of C13–C24 and C11–C19 respectively. Presence of 59% saturated and 41% unsaturated organic compounds, make it a better fuel composition. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The lubrication properties of biofuel (ethanol) blends and pure unleaded gasoline were compared to prolong engine life and reduce exhaust pollution caused by gasoline engines. Biofuels with a concentration of 0% 1% 2% 5% and 10% were added to unleaded gasoline to form ethanol-blended fuels named E0 E1 E2 E5 and E10 respectively. The ethanol-blended fuels and unleaded gasoline were used to power engines to facilitate comparisons between the pollution created from exhaust emissions. Using ethanol as a fuel additive in pure unleaded gasoline enhanced engine performance and reduced exhaust emissions. Since bioethanol does not contain Pb but contains low aromatic and high oxygen content it induced more complete combustion compared with conventional unleaded gasoline. Thus using biofuels as auxiliary fuel reduces environmental pollution strengthens local agricultural economy creates employment opportunities and reduces demand for fossil fuels.

The catalysts were used for hydrodeoxygenation of pre-treated poor quality lipids to produce hydrocarbon biofuels, and tested for two samples in a fixed bed reactor. The loading amounts of active metals Mo and Ni were optimized through the hydrodeoxygenation reaction yields of pre-treated waste cooking oil (transformed to methyl ester). Considering hydrodeoxygenation yields and compositions of the obtained products, the optimal loading amounts of Mo and Ni were 10% and 5% by weight, respectively. Using this catalyst, the hydrodeoxygenation yield of enzymatically pre-treated waste cooking oil could reach 97%. © 2017

AB  - The cluster of excellence “Tailor-Made Fuels from Biomass” (TMFB) at RWTH Aachen University seeks to identify and investigate new potential biofuels and their production routes. To ensure a safe handling in common-rail systems the lubricity of future biofuels is part of the investigations. To further deepen the understanding of the behaviour of such fluids in the regime of boundary lubrication a group of twelve potential biofuels and systematically derived fluids was investigated by a modified version of the standardised High Frequency Reciprocating Rig test procedure for Diesel lubricity. Insufficient lubricity is observed for most biofuels whereas linear molecules with polar head groups provide good or very good lubrication. For all studied groups longer molecules provide better lubricities. The position of the functional group significantly influences the overall lubricity and impact of the carbon chain length. © 2017 SAE International.

AB  - Within the Cluster of Excellence “Tailor-Made Fuels from Biomass” (TMFB) at the RWTH Aachen University, two novel biogenic fuels, namely 1-octanol and its isomer dibutyl ether (DBE), were identified and extensively analyzed in respect of their suitability for combustion in a Diesel engine. Both biofuels feature very different properties, especially regarding their ignitability. In previous works of the research cluster, promising synthesis routes with excellent yields for both fuels were found, using lignocellulosic biomass as source material. Both fuels were investigated as pure components in optical and thermodynamic single cylinder engines (SCE). For 1-octanol at lower part load, almost no soot emission could be measured, while with DBE the soot emissions were only about a quarter of that with conventional Diesel fuel. At high part load (2400 min-1, 14.8 bar IMEP), the soot reduction of 1-octanol was more than 50% and for DBE more than 80 % respectively. Based on these promising initial results, this paper will report about additional experimental investigations that were initiated to exploit the complete potential of both advanced biofuels in terms of emissions and efficiency. A single cylinder research engine was utilized and the engine calibration was optimized using design of experiments at lower and higher part load. At high part load, it was possible to increase the efficiency by more than one percent point compared to the Diesel reference in the same load point. Furthermore, the already low soot emissions of both biofuels, compared to Diesel fuel, could also be further halved compared to the base calibration. In a last step, a sensitivity analysis was performed in order to validate the previously built models and to get further insight into the influence of the single calibration parameters on engine performance. © 2017 SAE International.

AB  - The oxidation of dibutyl-ether, a potential lignocellulosic biofuel was studied in a jet-stirred reactor. Fuel-lean, stoichiometric and fuel-rich mixtures were oxidized at a constant fuel mole fraction (1000 ppm), at temperatures ranging from 470 to 1250 K, pressures of 1 and 10 atm, and constant residence time (70 and 700 ms, respectively). The mole fraction profiles obtained through sonic probe sampling, gas chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry were used to develop a detailed kinetic mechanism for the oxidation of DBE. The carbon neighboring the ether group was found to be the most favorable site for H-abstraction reactions and the chemistry of the corresponding fuel radical drives the overall reactivity. The fuel concentration profiles indicated strong low-temperature chemistry at both pressures: two negative temperature coefficient regions were observed, notably on the 10 atm experiments. This unusual behavior was investigated by means of a rate of production analysis using the mechanism developed in this work. This analysis showed that the low-temperature reactivity stems from the low-temperature chemistry of the fuel and of smaller species such as C4H9 which are triggered at different threshold temperatures. The proposed mechanism shows good performances for representing the present experimental data, as well as ignition delay time and flame speed data available from the literature. © 2017 The Combustion Institute

AB  - We develop an integrated strategy for the production of ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass. Cellulose and hemicellulose fractions are first hydrolyzed into sugars using a mixture of γ-valerolactone (GVL), water, and toluene as a solvent containing dilute sulfuric acid as a catalyst, and the sugars are then co-fermented into ethanol over engineered yeast strains. Separation subsystems are designed to effectively recover GVL and toluene for reuse in biomass hydrolysis and to recover lignin and humins for heat and power generation. We also develop an alternative process, in which we recover sugars and GVL from the residual biomass. To minimize utility requirements, we conduct heat integration, which allows us to meet all heating requirements using biomass residues. Finally, we perform a range of system-level analyses to identify the major cost and technological drivers. The proposed strategy is shown to be cost-competitive with other strategies. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Multi-stage thermal biomass decomposition coupled with catalytic upgrading has a number of advantages over conventional single-stage pyrolysis with hydrotreating. However, significant gaps still exist in our understanding of the design of such processes. In this paper, we synthesize alternative catalytic upgrading strategies through integration of different chemistries. Using experimental data, we develop a process model for all strategies and conduct heat integration to minimize utility requirements. Then, using a wide range of technoeconomic analyses, we identify (1) the relationship between process complexity and the resulting fuel-range carbon yields and economic feasibility, (2) the economic advantage of integrating different thermal decomposition fractions, and (3) the key cost drivers of the integrated processes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The growing concern about air quality and the impact exhaust particles can have on the environment has resulted in the increased use of alternative fuels. A sampling campaign from a conventional heavy diesel engine operated in typical transient cycle or steady-state condition, and running on diesel, 30% biodiesel in diesel, and 100% biodiesel was carried out. The particulate composition was characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Two-step Laser Mass Spectrometry (L2MS), Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS), thermo-optical analysis, and capillary electrophoresis. Elemental carbon is demonstrated to decrease from diesel to 100% biodiesel, in agreement with the evolution of aromatic bands and the MS abundance of Cn– fragments, while organic carbon exhibits a constant level irrespective of the working regime. Aliphatic, aromatic, carboxyl, carbonyl, hydroxyl functionalities, and nitro compounds are found to depend on the engine-working regime. Mass spectra are mainly characterized by alkyl fragments (CnH2n+1+), associated to normal and branched alkanes, PAHs and their alkylated derivatives. The addition of biodiesel to diesel changes the particulate composition towards more oxygenated constituents, such as carbonyl groups attributed to methyl ester CH3O+ fragments of unburned biodiesel. Fuel-specific fragments have been identified, such as C3H7O+ for diesel, and C2H3O2+ and CH3O– for biodiesel. Nitrogenized compounds are revealed by -NO2 functionalities and N-containing fragments. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was successfully applied to discriminate the engine operating conditions, with a higher variance given by the fuel, thus allowing to better evaluate the environmental impacts of alternative energy source emissions. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.

AB  - The function of ethanol and Brønsted acid for the dehydration-etherification of fructose to 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) has been theoretically investigated at G4 level in ethanol solution. Initially, fructose prefers to dehydration other than etherification with ethanol in the presence of Brønsted acid. The proton H+ should be solvated on ethanol other than fructose, resulting in [C2H5OH2]+ as the catalytically active species. Both protonation and [C2H5OH2]+ exhibit good catalytic performance, but ethanol does not. Furthermore, [C2H5OH2]+ displays better catalytic performance than protonation, which reflects the promotion catalytic role of C2H5OH on the proton H+. The turnover frequency analysis shows that the SN2 nucleophilic substitution for the etherification of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to EMF is the rate-controlling step in the whole reaction catalyzed by [C2H5OH2]+. The catalytic performance of [C2H5OH2]+ stems from the positive charge of –OH2 group, which assists both the H2O release of fructose to HMF and the etherification of HMF to EMF. For the dehydration of fructose, the catalytic superiority of [C2H5OH2]+ to protonation comes from the shift of the intramolecular H-shift catalyzed by protonation to the intermolecular H-shift catalyzed by [C2H5OH2]+, which lowers the activation energy barrier for the H2O release. The present study is useful for understanding the roles of ethanol and Brønsted acid in acid-catalyzed dehydration-etherification of carbohydrates to biofuel in ethanol solution. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Microalgae as feedstock of bioenergy, mainly biodiesel, is receiving an increased attention from scientific and industrial point of view. The selection of promising strains and optimization of the production process are essential keys to develop an economically viable project. In this context, fifty-seven strains of marine microalgae have been isolated from the Moroccan Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts. The selection of most promising strains was based on biomass productivity, lipid content and fatty acids profile. Nannochloropsis gaditana (24), Chlorella sp (67), Dunaliella tertiolecta (29), Isochrysis sp (77), Phaeodactylium tricornutum (23) and Chaetoceros sp (63) showed the best growth rate, whereas lipid content was highest in Navicula sp (up to 63%) and Tetraselmis sp (up to 56%), Dunaliella sp (up to 50%), Nannochloropsis sp (up to.60%) and Chaetoceros sp (up to 56%). Fatty Acids Methyl Ester profiles were analyzed and most strains studied showed a high rate of PUFA's mainly those belonging of Dunaliella, Tetraselmis, Isochrysis and Nannochlorpsis genuis. For Bacillariophyceae, despite their high content in lipids, their FAME profile was rich in PUFA's which affects the quality of biodiesel. This study describes the microalgae screening process and demonstrates that Nannochloropsis sp, Dunaliella tertiolecta, Isochrysis sp and Tetraselmis sp are among promising species as biodiesel feedstock. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 2-Methylfuran (MF), an environmental-friendly biofuel, has drawn extensive attention from fuel researchers. In this study, the particulate matter (PM) and unregulated emissions of diesel engine were investigated. All experiments were performed in a direct injection compression ignition (DICI) engine fueled with diesel–MF blends (10%, 20% and 30% mass fractions of MF were blended with diesel). The test conditions were a constant speed of 1800 rpm and load from 0.13 to 1.13 MPa brake mean effective pressure (BMEP). Among the tested fuels, the emissions of 1,3-butadiene, benzene and acetaldehyde are all decreased with the increase of engine load except benzene of M30 at 1.13 load. In addition, the diesel–MF blends promote acetaldehyde emissions, but reduce benzene and 1,3-butadiene emissions. At the engine load of 0.38 MPa BMEP, with the increase of MF fraction in blends, more particle numbers for both nucleation mode and accumulation mode are yielded than pure diesel. At 0.88 and 1.13 MPa BMEP, with the increment of MF ratio in blend fuels, the particle numbers rise at small diameter of particle (Dp) (5–10 nm) compared to pure diesel, but decline at large diameter of particle (Dp) (10–250 nm). The increment of MF blending ratio increases the particulate number concentration. Moreover, with the rise of MF mass fraction in the mixtures, the particulate mass concentration decreases gradually at above 0.63 MPa BMEP. However, particulate mass concentration of M30 is the highest at lower loads. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper explores the environmental and economic aspects of fast pyrolytic conversion of lignin, obtained from 2G ethanol plants, to transport fuels for both the marine and automotive markets. Various scenarios are explored, pertaining to aggregation of lignin from several sites, alternative energy carries to replace lignin, transport modalities, and allocation methodology. The results highlight two critical factors that ultimately determine the economic and/or environmental fuel viability. The first factor, the logistics scheme, exhibited the disadvantage of the centralized approach, owing to prohibitively expensive transportation costs of the low energy-dense lignin. Life cycle analysis (LCA) displayed the second critical factor related to alternative energy carrier selection. Natural gas (NG) chosen over additional biomass boosts well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions (WTW GHG) to a level incompatible with the reduction targets set by the U.S. renewable fuel standard (RFS). Adversely, the process’ economics revealed higher profits vs. fossil energy carrier. © 2017 The Author(s)

AB  - In the ever-increasing demand for alternative fuels, one promising solution is the partial substitution of conventional fossil fuel with biofuel rather than completely replacing it. In this experimental study, a 300 kWth (thermal power) oil-fired furnace is fueled with blends of crude castor oil and diesel to examine the feasibility of using these blends as a substitute for pure diesel in industrial applications. Castor oil is derived from castor seeds, which possesses low heating value, high oxygen content and high viscosity. A furnace test was conducted for pure diesel and castor oil/diesel blends with various mixing ratios. Pure diesel and blends with 5%, 10%, 20% and 30% castor oil were comparatively investigated by focusing on wall temperatures in the radiative section of the furnace, gas temperatures in the convective section and emission products from combustion. All experiments were performed under the operating condition of optimum (minimum) excess O2 concentration in the flue gas. The air supply rates for the minimum excess oxygen requirement were 245, 241, 240, 237 and 236 Nm3/h, respectively, for pure diesel and 5%, 10%, 20% and 30% blended castor oil at the fixed liquid-fuel supply rate of 20 L/h. Excellent stable combustion was observed during the experiments with the castor oil/diesel blended fuels. Both the wall temperature and gas temperature dropped slightly with increases in castor oil content in the blends; nevertheless, they were very close compared with pure diesel. Additionally, with increasing castor oil content in the blends, NO and CO emissions only slightly decreased and increased, respectively. Accordingly, it is verified that the use of 5–30% castor oil in the blends produces similar furnace temperature distributions and comparable emission levels of CO, NO and SO2 when compared to pristine diesel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Optimization and characterization of biodiesel production from fish oil extracted from rohu (Labeo rohita) processing waste were investigated in the present study. Wet reduction method showed highest oil yield (95.2%, v/v), compared to other methods (P < 0.05). Physicochemical properties of the oils were investigated before preparing biodiesel through transesterification reaction. Various alcohols, catalysts, reaction temperature and reaction time were evaluated for optimal biodiesel conversion of oil. The maximum yield of biodiesel (95.9%) was obtained with 0.75% KOH as catalyst, 1:0.5 (v/v) oil to methanol ratio and a reaction temperature of 55 °C for 60 min. TLC, FTIR and GC analysis suggested the triglycerides in the RPW oil have completely converted into biodiesel, which contained palmitic acid methyl ester and α-linolenic acid methyl ester as the dominant esters. Physicochemical characteristics of biodiesel were evaluated and the results suggested that quality of biodiesel were feasible. DSC study demonstrated the melting temperature of biodiesel were ranged from −52.56–4.11 °C, indicated the better cold flow property. Moreover, the oxidative stability of biodiesel was improved by adding BHT at 300 mg/kg. Therefore, extracted oil from rohu processing waste could well be used as an alternative source of low-cost feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The higher thermodynamic efficiency inherent in a detonation combustion based engine has already led to considerable interest in the development of wave rotor, pulse detonation, and rotating detonation engine configurations as alternative technologies offering improved performance for the next generation of aerospace propulsion systems, but it is now important to consider their emissions also. To assess both performance and emissions, this paper focuses on the feasibility of using alternative fuels in detonation combustion. Thus, the standard aviation fuels Jet-A, Acetylene, Jatropha Bio-synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene, Camelina Bio-synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene, Algal Biofuel, and Microalgae Biofuel are all asessed under detonation combustion conditions. An analytical model accounting for the Rankine-Hugoniot Equation, Rayleigh Line Equation, and Zel'dovich-von Neumann-Doering model, and taking into account single step chemistry and thermophysical properties for a stoichiometric mixture, is applied to a simple detonation tube test case configuration. The computed pressure rise and detonation velocity are shown to be in good agreement with published literature. Additional computations examine the effects of initial pressure, temperature, and mass flux on the physical properties of the flow. The results indicate that alternative fuels require higher initial mass flux and temperature to detonate. The benefits of alternative fuels appear significant. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - While biodiesel feedstock diversification is a main objective of the Brazilian National Program for the Production and Use of Biodiesel (PNPB in Portuguese), its achievement has remained elusive and biodiesel is predominantly produced from soybean (75%). This research uses the Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM) approach to evaluate the PNPB effects and compare the economic efficiency and the competitiveness of biodiesel from three oilseeds: soybean, rapeseed and sunflower. In contrast to papers that present results of experimental biodiesel production initiatives, this paper explores the case of “representative” production chains (best available technology and management practices). The findings indicate that biodiesel production is competitive from the three oilseeds, but the profitability of biodiesel from the soybean is notably higher. The tax breaks and subsidies provided by the PNPB have a positive impact on the profitability of biodiesel production chains (7.43% for soybean, 3.88% for rapeseed, 5.53% for sunflower). These results are encouraging and suggest two actions: i) to review the incentive policies (tax reduction) and payments to farmers of the different crops (pay for oil content instead of crop yield); and ii) to invest in organizational and managerial approaches in the alternative oilseed agricultural systems to improve their technical and economic efficiency. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The impact of fatty acids on the lubricity of diesel and biodiesel fuels was investigated in steel/steel contacts at two different temperatures of 40 °C and 100 °C. The addition of 7% v/v Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAMEs) to fuels, to form biodiesel, lubricates the steel-steel contact and the friction coefficient is reduced by about 30%. Further addition of fatty acids leads to a significant reduction in friction by a factor of 2 at the highest temperature of 100 °C. Some unsaturated fatty acid additives boost the friction reduction by a synergistic effect with the biofuel. The analysis of worn surfaces by XPS revealed the formation of an insulating film mainly located at the center of the tracks and the disappearance of carboxylic groups. PM-IRRAS analysis demonstrated the lack of carbon double bonds in the tribofilm and the presence of some esters (iron and/or organic soaps). By combining high-resolution photoemission soft X-ray absorption and SIMS studies, we found that the extreme surface of the tribofilm is formed by planar arrangements of sp2-rich molecules such as quinones and/or graphene oxides. It is thought that under the effects of shearing, temperature and possibly oxygen from air or fuel, complex chemical reactions between FAME and unsaturated additives occur in the diesel matrix generating a new tribofilm material on the steel surface. As double bonds are involved in the process, the basic tribochemistry mechanism is thought to be related to a reticulation process catalyzed by the formation of oxide particles in the sliding interfacial contact zone accompanied by an aromatization of the fatty acids at the extreme surface. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Hydrotreated biofuels are mainly composed of long straight-chain alkanes, which are the intermediate products in the production of biomass aviation fuels. The performance of hydrotreated biofuels in engines was studied. Also, the influence of linear alkanes C17 and C18 on the spray characteristics of conventiona jet fuel China RP-3 using a hollow cone pressure swirl nozzle was studied. Detailed flow structures and microscopic spray parameters of the spray cone were measured at injection pressure of 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 bar using phase Doppler anemometry. Results quantified the changes of spray characteristics caused by additional linear alkanes C17 or C18. Besides a narrowed spray cone angle and decreased Sauter mean diameter, air entrainment toward the spray cone center will be improved by additional linear alkanes C17 and C18.

AB  - The selective hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) is an important step in cellulosic biomass upgrading to biofuels, where bimetallic oxophilic catalysts have shown promising performance. Well controlled bimetallic NiCu and NiCu3 nanocrystals supported on carbon are shown to give high yields and selectivities to DMF. To shed light on the active phase, near-ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) was used to characterize the surface composition of these highly selective base-metal catalysts under reducing conditions relevant to the HDO reaction. Reactions were performed in a continuous flow reactor under reasonable conditions of 33 bar and 180°C. The Ni alloys were significantly more selective for DMF compared to monometallic Ni or Cu catalysts. With a well-controlled surface composition, the nanocrystal NiCu3/C catalyst exhibited a maximum DMF yield of 98.7%. NAP-XPS characterization showed that the Ni-Cu nanocrystals were completely reduced below 250°C in H2; this, together with bulk thermodynamic calculations, implies that the catalysts were completely reduced under the reaction conditions. NAP-XPS also indicated that the NiCu3 nanocrystal structure consisted of a Cu-rich core and a 1:1 molar Ni:Cu shell. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - This paper presents the techno-economic performance analysis of Jatropha biodiesel-fired power plants in comparison with natural gas- and diesel-fired plants. Jatropha biodiesel can be substituted for natural gas in industrial gas turbines at a slight loss in power output of ∼2% and plant efficiency of ∼1%. The exclusive use of the fuel in heavy duty industrial gas turbines is not economically viable at existing electricity generation prices in Nigeria, except fuels are restricted to combined cycle engines and considered as biomass power plants. The Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of the Jatropha biodiesel-fired plants varied from $0.203–0.252/kWh, values that are below the cost of self-generated electricity (SGE) in Nigeria —$0.45–0.70/kWh. To integrate Jatropha biodiesel into existing power plants, a minimum production-based incentive (PBI) of $0.052–0.082/kWh can be provided for up to nine years or maximum partial fuel substitution (PFS) of 33–40% can be mandated, depending on the mode of operation. A guaranteed fuel price of $0.18–5/gallon can be ensured, depending on electricity contract price. A carbon tax up to $100/tCO2 can also be imposed on natural gas-fired plants, but this does not ensure economic viability. The high cost of SGE in Nigeria uncovers an opportunity for embedded power generation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel can be considered to be the most capable alternate fuel for partial or complete replacement of the fossil fuel. Previous studies on biodiesel-oil blends have demonstrated that the use of double biofuels in engine can be a promising aspect for the complete elimination of diesel from compression-ignition (CI) engines. But its use increases the lubricating oil dilution to some extent due to the chemistry of biodiesel. The present experimental investigation describes the effect of biodiesel-oil blend, oxidized biodiesel-oil blend and diesel dilution in the engine oil by means of high frequency reciprocating rig (HFRR) and pin on disc (POD) friction monitor. Moreover, fresh lubricating oil, lubricating oil which was turned out from AB70EU30 operated engine with modified parameters after 100 h and lubricating oil which was turned out from diesel operated engine after 100 h were also considered for experimentation for clear comparison in results. The effects of engine oil dilution were studied on cylinder liner and piston ring as well as on cam and tappet on valve train. The present study revealed that the 10% dilution of biodiesel-oil blend in lubricating oil shows promising result in terms of coefficient of friction and diameter of wear scar as compared to other tested feedstocks. The effect of oxidation of the biodiesel-oil blend on the performance of engine oil is also assessed in the present study. Analytical ferrography of the used oil was also done to study the wear debris in oil. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Our objective was to synthesize hydrothermally stable metal catalysts with controlled particle size and distribution, with the goal of determining which catalyst(s) can selectively produce aromatics. Both precious and transition metal catalysts (Ru, Pt, Ni, Cu, 2Pt1Ru, NiCu) were deposited on mesoporous alumina (mA) and carbon, respectively, using the strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) method. Due to the alloying that occurs under SEA, our hypothesis was that controlled bimetallic combinations (precious and/or base metal) could enhance the HDO behavior. As verified by XRD, STEM, and TPR, the SEA method successfully deposited noble metal particles less than 2 nm in size onto alumina. Alloying of bimetallic particles was also confirmed. Hydrodeoxygenation of pyrolysis bio-oil was run for 3 h at 300 °C in an aqueous environment. While partial conversion of mesoporous alumina into boehmite phase occurred, the catalyst particles remained between 2 and 3 nm post-reaction, indicating a high degree of anchoring. Over carbon, base metal particles were initially larger in size (about 3.3 nm) and tended to sinter more. Bimetallic SEA catalysts produced aromatic hydrocarbons at a greater extent than those of Ni/C, or Cu/C, or commercial Ru/Al2O3, as evidenced by GC–MS and/or NMR. Bimetallic 2Pt1Ru/mA did not exhibit significantly greater activity than Pt or Ru or control catalysts made by dry impregnation (DI), whereas NiCu demonstrated improved oil quality and yields over single-metal Ni and Cu and DI-method control catalysts. With respect to product compounds, the effect of mA support is stronger than that of carbon support. © 2017

AB  - C9-C25 oxygen-containing compounds formed via the condensation reaction of furfuryl alcohol(FA) can be used as fuel intermediates for the production of bio-fuel. In this paper, the condensation reaction of FA was carried on over sulfuric acid catalyst in a batch aqueous phase reactor, in which the produced oligomers were separated from aqueous reaction system automatically before they went on further to form polymers. Reaction kinetics experiments showed that the values of reaction order of FA and sulfuric acid all were 1. The molecular structure and content of short chain-length oligomers B (C9-C25) were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography (GC) respectively. The molecular weight of FA condensate was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). According to the information provided by GC/MS and GPC, we revealed that two polymerization mechanisms, step-growth polymerization and chain-growth polymerization, coexist in FA condensation reaction process in aqueous system. A simplified kinetics model based on the present mechanisms was established, and condensation products were divided into short chain-length oligomers B (C9-C25) and long chain-length oligomers C (&gt;C25). © 2017

AB  - The identification of the influence of the reaction parameters is of paramount importance when defining a process design. In this work, non-edible castor oil was reacted with methanol to produce a possible component for biodiesel blends, using liquid enzymes as the catalyst. Temperature, alcohol-to-oil molar ratio, enzyme and added water contents were the reaction parameters evaluated in the transesterification reactions. The optimal conditions, giving the optimal final FAME yield and FFA content in the methyl ester-phase was identified. At 35 °C, 6.0 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, 5 wt% of enzyme and 5 wt% of water contents, 94% of FAME yield and 6.1% of FFA in the final composition were obtained. The investigation was completed with the analysis of the component profiles, showing that at least 8 h are necessary to reach a satisfactory FAME yield together with a minor FFA content. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A novel mathematical model for the quantitative assessment of the effect of dissolved nitrogen on the autotrophic batch-growth and lipid accumulation of C. sorokiniana, is proposed in this work. Model results have been validated through comparison with suitable experimental data performed in lab photobioreactors. Further experiments have been then performed using a BIOCOIL operated in fed-batch mode. The experimental results have been successfully predicted through the proposed model. Therefore, the model might represent a first step toward the development of a tool for the scale-up and optimization of the operating conditions of BIOCOIL photobioreactors. Furthermore, the fatty acid methyl esters obtained by transesterification of lipids extracted from C. sorokiniana, have been analysed in view of the assessment of their usability for producing biofuels. Subsequently, on the basis of the fatty acids profile, a wide range of biodiesel fuel properties have been predicted through suitable software. © Copyright 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - The production of liquid fuels from crude oil requires water. There has been limited focus on the assessment of life cycle water demand footprints for crude oil production and refining. The overall aim of this paper is address this gap. The objective of this research is to develop water demand coefficients over the life cycle of fuels produced from crude oil pathways. Five crude oil fields were selected in the three North American countries to reflect the impact of different spatial locations and technologies on water demand. These include the Alaska North Slope, California's Kern County heavy oil, and Mars in the U.S.; Maya in Mexico; and Bow River heavy oil in Alberta, Canada. A boundary for an assessment of the life cycle water footprint was set to cover the unit operations related to exploration, drilling, extraction, and refining. The recovery technology used to extract crude oil is one of the key determining factors for water demand. The amount of produced water that is re-injected to recover the oil is essential in determining the amount of fresh water that will be required. During the complete life cycle of one barrel of conventional crude oil, 1.71–8.25 barrels of fresh water are consumed and 2.4–9.51 barrels of fresh water are withdrawn. The lowest coefficients are for Bow River heavy oil and the highest coefficients are for Maya crude oil. Of all the unit operations, exploration and drilling require the least fresh water (less than 0.015 barrel of water per barrel of oil produced). A sensitivity analysis was conducted and uncertainty in the estimates was determined. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Brown grease breaks down into a mixture of alkanes and alkenes at temperatures above 300 °C without addition of hydrogen or an external catalyst. To better understand the reactions in this process, pyrolysis experiments were performed on palmitic and oleic acids as model systems for the saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in brown grease, respectively. Iron (III) sulfate was used in half of the experiments, as Fe(III) is normally found in brown grease; and the other experiments were performed without iron as controls. In the presence of Fe(III), palmitic acid forms a series of aliphatic hydrocarbons and some palmitone byproduct, while the iron-free control experiment yielded larger quantities of palmitone, up to more than 50%. However, regardless of Fe(III), oleic acid broke down into shorter saturated fatty acids, hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, and ketones, according to known thermal reactions of unsaturated fatty acids. The product fatty acids then reacted in a manner similar to palmitic acid. The major ketone and alcohol byproducts were also examined for reactions ultimately leading to the desired products. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Farnesene has been identified as suitable jet fuel substitutes and metabolic engineering for microbial production of farnesene is an alternative and attractive route. In this study, due to accumulation of toxic intermediate isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), an engineered Escherichia coli strain harboring heterologous mevalonate pathway produced only 4.11 mg/L β-farnesene. Through higher-level expression of isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase and farnesyl diphosphate synthase to minimize the accumulated IPP, another engineered strain with relatively balanced mevalonate pathway was constructed and had the highest production of β-farnesene to date (8.74 g/L) by Escherichia coli in a lab bioreactor. Furthermore, this is the first report on utilization of biodiesel by-product (simple purification) as substrate for high-production of β-farnesene by the engineered strain optimized and β-farnesene concentration reached 2.83 g/L in a lab bioreactor. Therefore, the engineered strain optimized could be used as a platform host for high-production of other terpenoids using biodiesel by-product as substrate. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In view of a desired transition from fossil fuels to sustainably produced biofuels that should contribute to a net reduction of CO2 emissions, promising fuel candidates have been identified including 2-butanone (methyl ethyl ketone, MEK) that is qualified for use in spark-ignition (SI) engines. To support a potential, rapid integration of such biofuels into the existing infrastructure, fundamental studies of their combustion and emission behavior are highly important. In the case of 2-butanone specifically, only very few fundamental combustion experiments have been performed to date, with a notable shortage of detailed speciation data. For predictive model development, accurate and reliable species measurements are needed to describe the oxidation and combustion of 2-butanone and to elucidate the kinetic mechanism. The present study relies on three different experiments: a laminar flow reactor coupled with molecular-beam mass spectrometry (MBMS, Bielefeld), a rapid compression machine (RCM, Aachen), and a shock tube using advanced laser absorption techniques (Stanford). This combination ensured coverage of a wide regime in temperature, pressure, and mixture composition while providing numerous species profiles. The species measurements in the flow reactor were performed at stoichiometric (Φ = 1.0) and fuel-rich (Φ = 2.0) equivalence ratios at temperatures between about 800–1100 K with an argon dilution of 95%. Ignition delay times in the RCM were measured in air for equivalence ratios of 0.5, 2.0 in the temperature range of 840–945 K to reflect application-relevant conditions. Shock tube measurements were performed at stoichiometric conditions at 1303–1509 K in argon. To provide insight into the oxidation mechanism of 2-butanone, the newly measured experimental data was used to develop and validate a detailed chemical kinetic model. To this end, the reactions for the low-temperature regime, especially concerning early fuel consumption, radical formation, and subsequent low-temperature oxidation, were examined in detail, and used to extend and adapt an existing reaction mechanism (Burke et al., 2016 [23]) to more accurately predict the new low-temperature conditions studied. The resulting model that incorporates the latest theoretical kinetic calculations available in the literature was compared to the measurements presented here as well as validated using literature data. To the authors' knowledge, the present model represents the most robustly validated mechanism available for the prediction of 2-butanone combustion targets to date. © 2017 The Combustion Institute

AB  - The issue of raw materials is a critical point that affects the economic feasibility of biodiesel production, since they account for about 80% of the total cost of biofuels. Today edible vegetable oils are the main raw materials for the production of biodiesel. Recently, lipid residues such as used cooking oil and inedible fats have also received considerable attention in the biofuels sector. White meat currently contributes over 40% of total meat consumption in Morocco [1]; so this sector generates a significant amount of wastes. The extents of treatment are poorly developed and wastes are haphazardly deposited in landfills. That is why we chose chicken skin as a raw material in our biodiesel synthesis process. We have selected for this work focusing on the study of the variation of two variables (temperature, time) during the first step of biodiesel synthesis process in order to have the maximum of extracted oil that can be used later. © 2017, University of Mohammed V Rabat Morocco.

The engine was operated at three engine speeds of 1000, 2100 and 3000 rpm, respectively. At each speed, three loads (20%, 50%, and 80%) were applied. Diesel and biodiesel-diesel blends up to 40 by step of 10 were emulsified with three different levels of water concentration (5%, 10% and 15%). Emulsifiers Sorbitan Monoleate (Span 80) and Polyoxyethylene Sorbitan Monoleate (Tween 80) were used to prepare emulsion fuels. Fuel properties, stability and particle size distribution were measured. Engine performance (brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and brake thermal efficiency (BTE)) and emissions were investigated. An increase in BTE was observed with increased water content in emulsions. A reduction in exhaust gas temperature (EGT) with an increase in water content was achieved. The nitrogen oxides (NOx) and smoke emissions were also significantly reduced with the increase in water content in the emulsion compared to their bases. Emulsion fuel containing a higher water content revealed a considerable increase in carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Few studies have been performed up to now on the emission factors and congener profiles of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) emitted from off-road diesel engines. This investigation elucidates the emission factors and congener profiles of various POPs, namely polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polybrominated dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), in the exhausts of a diesel generator fueled with different waste cooking oil-based biodiesel (WCO-based biodiesel) blends. The PCDD/Fs contributed 87.2% of total dioxin-like toxicity (PCDD/Fs + PCBs + PBDD/Fs) in the exhaust, while the PCBs and PBDD/Fs only contributed 8.2% and 4.6%, respectively. Compared with petroleum diesel, B20 (20 vol% WCO-based biodiesel + 80 vol% diesel) reduced total toxicity by 46.5% for PCDD/Fs, 47.1% for PCBs, and 24.5% for PBDD/Fs, while B40 (40 vol% WCO-based biodiesel + 60 vol% diesel) reduced it by 89.5% for PCDD/Fs, 57.1% for PCBs, and 63.2% for PBDD/Fs in POP emission factors. The use of WCO-based biodiesel not only solves the problem of waste oil disposal, but also lowers POP emissions from diesel generators. © 2017

AB  - Insufficient available energy has limited the economic growth of Nigeria. The country suffers from frequent power outages, and inconvenient black–outs while residents and industries are forced to depend on self-generated electricity. Life-cycle assessment methodology was used to assess the environmental burdens associated with self-generated electricity (SGE) and proposed embedded power generation in Nigeria. The study shows that SGE from 5 kVA diesel generators contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 1625 kg CO2 eq./MWh, along with other environmental burdens. Based on a point estimate of diesel electric generators in Nigeria, SGE can contribute 389 million tonnes CO2 eq. to climate change every year. This can reposition Nigeria as one of the top 20 emitters of CO2 globally. A mandatory diesel fuel displacement with Jatropha biodiesel can reduce annual GHG emissions from SGE by 76% provided combined cycle power plants are adopted for embedded power generation. The magnitude of these benefits would depend on material inputs, seed yield as well as the environmental status of the reference fuel. Minimal use of fertilizers, chemicals and resources and fossil fuel substitution with renewable options can minimize adverse environmental burdens. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The properties of biodiesel get aggravated when metals are exposed into it. The present study aims to investigate the effect of antioxidants on the fuel properties of palm biodiesel upon exposure to copper and mild steel. The used antioxidants include pyrogallol (PY) and butylated hydro-oxy toluene (BHT). Static immersion tests of metal coupons in palm biodiesel in the absence and presence (500 ppm) of antioxidants were conducted at room temperature (25˚C-27 °C) for 60 days. The investigated fuel properties include induction period, density, viscosity, acid number and calorific values. Results showed that pyrogallol was more effective to suppress the degradation of metal surface, fuel composition and fuel properties. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass harvested from invasive plant species has been proposed for use as lignocellulosic feedstock for the production of advanced biofuels as a way to mitigate the indirect land use issues associated with the production of dedicated energy crops. Encroachment of eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana L.) has reduced the forage productivity of North American Great Plains grasslands ranging from Texas in the South to Alberta in the North. The objective of this study is to develop and demonstrate a modeling system that can be used to determine the minimum selling price of biofuel. A fast pyrolysis process that exclusively uses eastern redcedar biomass to produce gasoline and diesel blend stock is assumed. A mixed integer mathematical programming model is constructed and applied to a 15 county case study region from which eastern redcedar may be collected. The modeling system considers the growth rate of unharvested trees to determine the optimal biorefinery location, the optimal harvest locations for each of 20 years, and the minimum selling biofuel price. To fulfill 2 Gg d−1 feedstock requirements for the expected life of the biorefinery, 73% of the trees growing in year zero in the case study region would be required. For a 313 dm3 Mg−1 conversion rate, and with biorefinery ownership, operating and maintenance cost of 630 $ m−3, the expected cost to deliver feedstock is estimated to be 61 $ Mg−1, and the estimated minimum selling biofuel price is 830 $ m−3. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The purposes of this study were to find the optimum level of supplementing CO2 for increasing the biomass and hydrocarbon production of B. braunii KMITL 2 (A race) and to determine the effects of CO2 level on CO2 fixation and biodiesel properties. The experimental results showed that the alga supplemented with 10% CO2 produced the highest biomass (1.48 ± 0.02 g L−1) and CO2 fixation rate (100.43 ± 1.42 mg L−1 d−1) that were 2.7 and 5.3 times higher than the control (0.04% CO2). The gravimetric hydrocarbon content (36.82 ± 3.39%) and hydrocarbon titer (0.35 ± 0.03 g L−1) of the alga supplemented with 5% CO2 were 1.6 and 2.7 times higher than the control. Cultivation of this strain under 5% CO2 gave the highest hydrocarbon yield and good biodiesel properties with the lowest iodine value and a higher CN value than the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 fuel standards. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) represent a dominant category of secondary organic aerosol precursors that are increasingly included in air quality models. In the present study, an experimental system was developed and applied to a light-duty diesel engine to determine the emission factors of particulate SVOCs (pSVOCs) and nonvolatile particulate matter (PM) components at dilution ratios representative of ambient conditions. The engine was tested under three steady-state operation modes, using ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD), three types of pure biodiesels and their blends with ULSD. For ULSD, the contribution of pSVOCs to total particulate organic matter (POM) mass in the engine exhaust ranged between 21 and 85%. Evaporation of pSVOCs from the diesel particles during dilution led to decreases in the hydrogen to carbon ratio of POM and the PM number emission factor of the particles. Substituting biodiesels for ULSD could increase pSVOCs emissions but brought on large reductions in black carbon (BC) emissions. Among the biodiesels tested, tallow/used cooking oil (UCO) biodiesel showed advantages over soybean and canola biodiesels in terms of both pSVOCs and nonvolatile PM emissions. It is noteworthy that PM properties, such as particle size and BC mass fraction, differed substantially between emissions from conventional diesel and biodiesels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ignition quality of diesel fuels used in compression ignition engines is mainly described by their respective Cetane Number (CN). The most widely accepted method for CN measurement is the ASTM D613, involving a variable compression ratio Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine. However in the recent years other alternative methods based on a Constant Volume Combustion Chamber (CVCC) concept have gained significant popularity mainly due to lower cost of acquisition, maintenance and operation, still being able to provide accurate results. Other widely accepted parameters for the characterization of ignition quality of diesel fuels are cetane indices. These are empirical mathematical equations, based on simple physicochemical properties (such as density and distillation characteristics) and usually correlate well with CN. However, they are accurate enough within narrow limits and are very prone to produce misleading results when involving modern fuels, or biofuels and their blends. In this work, an effort was made to investigate the room for improvement for the prediction of CN, apart from the use of the most widely accepted method of Calculated Cetane Index (CCI), standardized by ASTM D4737, with regard to today's used marine diesel fuels. A total of 47 distillate marine diesel fuels (with high sulfur content compared to automotive diesel fuels) has been employed in order to create multivariate regression models to predict CN equivalents. Thus, useful conclusions were drown in an attempt to evaluate the importance of various physicochemical properties with regard to ignition quality, as well as a first step to the potentiality of revaluation of empirical mathematical models currently in use. © 2017

AB  - Durian shell (DS) was pyrolyzed in a drop-type fixed-bed reactor to study the physicochemical properties of the products. The experiment was carried out with different particle sizes (up to 5 mm) and reaction temperatures (250–650 °C). The highest bio-oil yield was obtained at 650 °C (57.45 wt%) with DS size of 1–2 mm. The elemental composition and higher heating value of the feedstock, bio-oil (650 °C), and bio-char (650 °C) were determined and compared. The compositions of product gases were determined via gas chromatography with thermal conductivity detector. The chemical composition of bio-oil was analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The bio-oil produced at lower temperature yields more alcohols, whereas the bio-oil produced at higher temperature contains more aromatics and carbonyls. Bio-oil has potential to be used as liquid fuel or fine chemical precursor after further upgrading. The results further showed the potential of bio-char as a solid fuel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, we used Fructus Schisandrae as a raw material to produce biodiesel. The seed oil yield of Fructus Schisandrae was found to be 41.926±0.206%. In the seed oil, major fatty acids were linoleic acid (75.21%) and oleic acid (16.32%). For biodiesel transesterification, we found that immobilized lipase-base catalyzed transesterification using methanol and tert-butanol was the optimal method. In this method, the yield of biodiesel could reach 89.140±1.270%. Main components of the produced biodiesel were methyl palmitate, methyl oleate and methyl linoleate; methyl linoleate was the most abundant one. The physicochemical properties of the biodiesel met all the standards of biodiesel and the key technical indicators exceeded that of the number zero diesel oil. Our findings not only turn the excessive waste into raw materials for biodiesel, but also have broad application prospects in development of clean energy.

AB  - Due to the high protein content in algal species, these precursors require further catalytic removal of heteroatoms such as nitrogen, being upgraded to biofuels. In the current study, first, synthesis of Na+ZSM-5 nanocrystals with well-distribution in size was performed successfully with a novel technique in supercritical water. After converting to H+ZSM-5 type, it was applied for hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) of crude bio-oil, obtained from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of chlorella sp. microalgae, in the presence of high temperature water and formic acid (HCOOH) mixture. The effects of reaction temperature (250–500 °C), formic acid as a source of in-situ hydrogen, and nano-catalyst (compared with industrial type) on nitrogen elimination and H/C ratio were investigated comprehensively. Compared with non-catalytic upgrading conditions, a substantial amount of nitrogen removal was obtained in the presence of nano-catalyst and formic acid with the maximum amount of 75 wt% at 400 °C in comparison with the macron-size industrial catalyst (54 wt%) at the same temperature. Due to more miscibility and consequently high degree of liquid fuel recovery (Yliq) with less coking as well as more HDN, T = 400 °C was chosen as the optimum temperature. Furthermore, H/C ratio of upgraded bio-oil, as an index of aromatization, had similar trend which indicates that in the presence of H+ZSM-5, higher temperature is more favorable to aromatization than cracking which makes HDN more difficult. In the absence of a catalyst, H/C ratio showed no substantial trend with temperature which demonstrates the significance of H+ZSM-5 catalyst for cracking. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The authors have examined the influence of biocomponents of different origin on exhaust gases emitted from a light duty vehicle with a compression ignition engine. The car was fuelled with diesel fuel containing 20% V/V fatty acid methyl esters and diesel fuel with 13% V/V hydrotreated vegetable oils and 7% V/V fatty acid methyl esters. Commercial diesel fuel containing 7% V/V esters was a reference. The tests were performed on the chassis dynamometer in static engine operating conditions. It was stated that the addition of mentioned biocomponents into diesel fuel slightly changed the concentration of regulated components in exhaust gases with/without after-treatment devices. The presence of bio-components has reduced nitrogen oxide concentration in the treated exhaust gases as compared to the commercial diesel. We observed no trends of changes in unburned hydrocarbon concentrations depending on the type of tested fuels and presence of the diesel particle filter. Unburned hydrocarbons consisted mainly of fractions containing up to five carbon atoms per molecule. Whatever the type of fuel examined, carbonyl compounds such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were found only in the untreated exhaust gases. © 2017, HARD Publishing Company. All rights reserved.

AB  - Depending on the guarantee from the original equipment manufacturers, the acceptable percentage of biodiesel used in diesel engines is limited. The low oxidation stability of biodiesel is the major challenge limiting its use. Therefore, improving the quality of biodiesel may be a promising approach to increasing the usage amount. In this study, high quality biodiesel from jatropha upgraded by partial hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acid methyl ester (H-FAME) process, which reduced the polyunsaturated ester molecules, is introduced. The upgraded biodiesel significantly improved the oxidation stability. First, the properties of H-FAME were determined prior to its use in the engine. All properties satisfied the requirements of all biodiesel standards. Biodiesel content could improve the lubricity of petroleum diesel for application in a modern high pressure injection system. Then, the performance and emissions of a common rail diesel engine using 10% of H-FAME were investigated and compared with the commercial diesel. Finally, engine endurance was assessed by a 50,000 km on-road durability test. The results showed that 10% of H-FAME slightly decreased engine torque and marginally improved fuel consumption. Exhaust gas emissions including CO, HC, NOX and smoke decreased. There was no sign of engine deterioration caused by the H-FAME. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel or fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) is primarily synthesized using edible vegetable oils and methanol with a catalyst. However, in the present study, FAMEs were synthesized from a non-edible oil (Calophyllum inophyllum also called as sura honne, Punnagam, Alexandrian Laurel) in different supercritical fluids: methanol (MeOH), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), methyl acetate (MeOAc) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) non-catalytically. Reactions were performed from 523 K to 673 K at 30 MPa with a molar ratio of 40:1 with times varying from 3 min to 3 h. Conversions higher than 80% were obtained within 30 min for oil reaction with MeOH and DMC at 623 K and conversions of 60% and 70% were obtained at 673 K with MeOAc and MTBE, respectively. Pseudo first order kinetics was used to obtain the rate constants and the activation energies followed the order: EMeOH &lt; EDMC &lt; EMeOAc &lt; EMTBE. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, biodiesel production by using supercritical methyl acetate in a continuous flow reactor was investigated for the first time. The aim of this study was to elucidate the reaction kinetics of biodiesel production by using supercritical methyl. Experiments were conducted at various reaction temperatures (300–400 °C), residence times (5–30 min), oil-to-methyl acetate molar ratio of 1:40, and a fixed pressure of 20 MPa. Reaction kinetics of biodiesel production with supercritical methyl acetate was determined. Finally, biodiesel yield obtained from this method was compared to that obtained with supercritical methanol, ethanol, and MTBE (methyl tertiary-butyl ether). The results showed that biodiesel yield with supercritical methyl acetate increased with temperature and time. The developed kinetic model was found to fit the experimental data well. The reactivity of supercritical methyl acetate was the lowest, followed by that of supercritical MTBE, ethanol, and methanol, under the same conditions. © 2017

AB  - Due to their excellent physicochemical properties, biodiesel and n-pentanol are regarded as two promising alternative biofuels for automobile. However, the fundamental data of spray and combustion characteristics of n-pentanol/biodiesel blends are still scarce. The objective of this work is to investigate the effects of n-pentanol addition to waste cooking oil (WCO) biodiesel in different ratios (0%, 20%, and 40% in volume) on spray, ignition and combustion characteristics in a constant volume combustion bomb (CVCB). Ignition and combustion tests were performed at five ambient temperatures (800, 900, 1000, 1100 and 1200 K) with three oxygen concentration (10%, 15% and 21%), and spray tests were conducted at the same temperature ranges but with no oxygen involved to prevent combustion happening. The result shows liquid length decreases with increase of ambient temperature, and the falling slope increases significantly with the blended n-pentanol concentration. The liquid length of B60P40 is about 6% longer than that of B100 at 800 K condition, while it becomes about 10% shorter than B100 when ambient temperature rises to 1200 K. Although the cetane number of n-pentanol is much less than biodiesel, an increase of n-pentanol ratio has a promoting effect on the ignition event under most conditions. Under these conditions, addition of 40% n-pentanol has cut the ignition delay of biodiesel, on average, by 30.2%. The natural flame luminosity is found to be reduced significantly with an increasing n-pentanol ratio, meaning that addition of n-pentanol could reduce the soot level under all conditions. For example, the time integrated natural luminosity (TINL) of B60P40 is only 41.2% of that of B100 under 1000 K temperature conditions. The result also suggests that, for multi-component fuels, flame lift-off length (FL) is the most reliable factor that influence the soot concentration level under spray combustion processes, rather than ignition delay or soot formation time. Overall, blending n-pentanol into biodiesel has a great soot oxidation potential and could maintain suitable ignition phase at the same time. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Attention continues to be focused on biomass as a very promising alternative source of renewable materials for energy production. This research focused on the use of a heterogeneous base alkaline earth metal oxide incorporated with a transition metal oxide catalyst supported on gamma alumina oxide varied with different temperatures, Cr loading and number of alumina coatings that make the biodiesel easily separated, low cost and environmental friendly. The physicochemical properties of Cr/Ca(10:90)/γ-Al2O3 catalyst calcined at 700 °C investigated by BET surface area and CO2-TPD indicated high surface area, 164.32 m2/g and higher basicity, 3.38 mmol/g, respectively. FESEM-EDX mapping showed the homogeneous distribution of each element presence in Cr/Ca(10:90)/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was well-distributed and indicated that the Cr/Ca has a higher dispersion on the surface of the γ-Al2O3. The response surface methodology was used to optimize the catalytic activity of Cr/Ca/γ-Al2O3 catalyst for transesterification of biodiesel from low-grade cooking oil. The most important variable for biodiesel yield was the calcination temperature of the catalyst followed by the Cr loading and the number of alumina coatings. The experimental value achieved with 93.10% conversion of biodiesel closely agreed with the predicted result from RSM and validated the findings of response surface optimization. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The demand for petroleum based fuel has grown in an extensive way because of the increasing industrialization and the growth in transportation sector. This growth has a direct effect on the economy and remains a monopoly in the fuel trade. Bio-fuels are available in a larger volume across the world due to the advantage that they can be directly blended with the petroleum fuels and the results obtained are better when compared to the standard values of neat diesel fuel. Such kind of biofuels can be extracted from lemon fruit and its availability is abundance across globe. This work aims in introducing a new biofuel called as Lemon Essential Oil (LEO) which can be obtained through steam distillation process of lemon rinds. A 20% LEO is blended with diesel (LEO20+ Diesel80) and it is fed as fuel to the engine. The various properties of LEO are examined and they are compared to mineral diesel. The experimental investigation revealed that brake thermal efficiency of LEO20 is marginally higher than diesel at higher loads. Also significant reduction is observed for carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbon and smoke emissions. However, the oxides of nitrogen in LEO20 is comparatively higher than petroleum diesel at rated power output. Furthermore, the in-cylinder gas pressure of LEO20 is followed the similar trend with diesel fuel. In addition, higher heat release rate is also observed for LEO20 from the tested results. Hence, the present research work is showed that the 20% of Lemon Essential Oil could be partial substitute for conventional diesel engine in near future.

AB  - The next generation of alternative fuels is being investigated through advanced chemical and biological production techniques for the purpose of finding suitable replacements for diesel and gasoline while lowering production costs and increasing process yields. Chemical conversion of biomass to fuels provides a plethora of pathways with a variety of fuel molecules, both novel and traditional, which may be targeted. In the search for new fuels, an initial, intuition-driven evaluation of fuel compounds with desired properties is required. Due to the high cost and significant production time needed to synthesize these materials at a scale sufficient for exhaustive testing, a predictive model would allow chemists to preemptively screen fuel properties of potentially desirable fuel candidates. Recent work has shown that predictive models, in this case artificial neural networks (ANN's) analyzing quantitative structure property relationships (QSPR's), can predict the cetane number (CN) of a proposed fuel molecule with relatively small error. A fuel's CN is a measure of its ignition quality, typically defined using prescribed ASTM standards and a cetane testing engine. Alternatively, the analogous derived cetane number (DCN), obtained using an Ignition Quality Tester (IQT), is a direct measurement alternative to the CN that uses an empirical inverse relationship to the ignition delay found in the constant volume combustion chamber apparatus. DCN data points acquired using an IQT were utilized for model validation and expansion of the experimental database used in this study. The present work improves on an existing model by optimizing the model architecture along with the key learning variables of the ANN and by making the model more generalizable to a wider variety of fuel candidate types, specifically the class of furans and furan derivatives, by including specific molecules for the model to incorporate. The new molecules considered include tetrahydrofuran, 2-methylfuran, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, 5,5′-(furan-2-ylmethylene)bis(2-methylfuran), 5,5′-((tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methylene)bis(2-methyltetrahydrofuran), tris(5-methylfuran-2-yl)methane, and tris(5-methyltetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methane. Model architecture adjustments improved the overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the base database predictions by 5.54%. Additionally, through the targeted database expansion, it is shown that the predicted cetane number of the furan-based molecules improves on average by 49.21% (3.74 CN units) and significantly for a few of the individual molecules. This indicates that a selected subset of representative molecules can be used to extend the model's predictive accuracy to new molecular classes. The approach, bolstered by the improvements presented in this paper, enables chemists to focus on promising molecules by eliminating less favorable candidates in relation to their ignition quality. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study describes the development of performance and emission characteristics on partially stabilized zirconia (PSZ) coated diesel engine fuelled by biodiesel with cetane number enhancing additive of Di-tertiary-butyl peroxide (DTBP). Additive was added to biodiesel in 1% by volume. The biodiesel was prepared from palm oil using simple base catalyst transesterification process. Biodiesel with additive and petroleum diesel were used as the test fuels. The experiment was conducted on a single cylinder, four stroke, water cooled and direct injection coated engine and to determine the performance and emission characteristics of engine running on the test fuels. The results were compared to uncoated engine, running on test fuels. The thermal efficiency for biodiesel with additive fuel was found to be comparable to diesel fuel operation at part load and slightly higher at rest of the load in coated condition. Exhaust emission measurements showed that NOx levels could be significantly reduced using biodiesel with additive fuel compared to diesel fuel in the same experimental conditions. There was no significant improvement on performance and emissions (except HC and CO) of uncoated engine running on biodiesel with additive fuel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, the pyrolysis of three different rubber wastes used in the mining industry, i.e. milling (based on styrene butadiene rubber, SBR), sieves and conveyor belts (based on natural and butadiene rubber, NR/BR) and offroad waste tires (based on complex mixture of nitrile, butadiene, styrene and natural rubber) was investigated in a pilot plant at 450, 600 and 800°C. Reactions at 450°C showed incomplete pyrolysis whereas at 600 and 800°C the rubber wastes were completely converted into three products:15-25% gas, 34-45% liquid and 42-44% solids. The gas products analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) showed mainly the presence of C1-C4 hydrocarbons with LHV (Low Heating Value) values between 8496 and 7325 Kcal kg-1, similar to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The solid products analyzed by elemental analysis of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen (CHN), atomic emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (ICP AES) Spectro Ciros CCD for the determination of sulfur, thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA), fixed carbon, ash and volatile compounds showed the presence of 72-89% carbon and 2% sulfur. The liquid products analyzed by gas chromatography applied mass spectrometry (GC-MS) indicated the presence of complex mixtures of hydrocarbons containing mainly compounds up to C20. The NR/BR and waste offroad tire samples produced ca. 50% aromatics whereas SBR rubber resulted in the formation of near 87% aromatics. The mixtures of these liquids products (without any purification) with a commercial diesel fuel at 0.5, 1 and 3 vol% did not significantly change the fuel quality parameters defined by the ANP (Agency National Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels).

AB  - This study investigates the emission of a heavy-duty diesel engine generator fueled with waste cooking oil (WCO)-based biodiesel blends (W) and operated at 1.5 and 3.0 kW loads. A brand of pure fossil diesel was adopted as the base fuel, with 20% and 40% WCO-based biodiesel added into the based fuel to form W20 and W40 blends, respectively. The emission characteristics of PM, metals and PAHs were analyzed. Experimental results indicate that alternative WCO-based fuels had slightly higher fuel consumption rates (FCR) and brake specific fuel consumptions (BSFC) than conventional diesel (0.6–4.1% for FCR and 1.0–7.6% for BSFC), and similar engine thermal efficiency. The PM emissions reductions when using W20 and W40 were 19% and 6.5%, respectively, at 1.5 kW, and 27% and 19%, respectively, at 3.0 kW. The emissions of particle-bound metals were 13.6–13.8% lower when using W20 than using conventional diesel, but 12.0– 12.3% higher when using W40. The metal contents of PM rose with the addition of WCO-based biodiesel. The metal elements of PM were dominated (&gt; 90% mass) by Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, Fe and Zn, while the major trace metals were Mn, Cu, Sr and Pb. The use of WCO-based biodiesel blends reduced the emissions of total-PAHs (44.0% in average) and total-BaPeq (80.2% in average). The mass reductions of MMW- and HMW-PAHs using W20 and W40 were more significant at 3.0 kW than at 1.5 kW, while the reduction of LMW-PAHs was greater at 1.5 kW than at 3.0 kW. Thus, the reduction in total-BaPeq was greater at the higher engine load. Accordingly, we conclude that the WCO-based biodiesel is a potential candidate of cleaner alternative energy sources. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.

AB  - The consciousness of deteriorating fossil fuels and the adverse impact of its consumption on human health have diverted the research towards alternate energy sources. Biodiesel seems to be the best promising alternate fuel for diesel engines as it has potential to partially or completely eliminate diesel from compression ignition (CI) engine. Several investigations on performance and emissions had shown that use of double biofuels (biodiesel-oil blends) have ability to completely replace diesel. But, the lubricating properties of fuel also affect the performance of engine as some engine parts are lubricated by the fuel itself. In the present study, effects of concentration of biodiesel in blend, temperature and load on friction and wear are investigated with the help of four ball tester. As biodiesel is subjected to oxidation and has highly affected lubricity at higher temperature and load, so the effect of oxidation was also studied. The operating loads and temperatures were 147–392 N and 45–60–75 °C respectively. During operation of four ball wear monitor, frictional torque was recorded with the help of data acquisition system. The scars on the balls are investigated with the help of microscope. An analytical ferrography was also done to analyze the wear debris in the used oil after each test. It was found out from the present investigation that the operating parameters collectively affect the lubricity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The interest in microalgae for wastewater treatment and liquid bio-fuels production (i.e. biodiesel and bioethanol) is steadily increasing due to the energy demand of the ultra-modern technological world. The associated biomass and by-product residues generated from these processes can be utilized as a feedstock in anaerobic fermentation for the production of gaseous bio-fuels. In this context, dark fermentation coupled with anaerobic digestion can be a potential technology for the production of hydrogen and methane from these residual algal biomasses. The mixture of these gaseous bio-fuels, known as hythane, has superior characteristics and is increasingly regarded as an alternative to fossil fuels. This review provides the current developments achieved in the conversion of algal biomass to bio-hythane (H2 + CH4). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, kernel-based extreme learning machine (K-ELM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed in order to predict the conditions of an alkaline-catalysed transesterification process. The reliability of these models was assessed and compared based on the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RSME), mean average percent error (MAPE) and relative percent deviation (RPD). The K-ELM model had higher R2 (0.991) and lower RSME, MAPE and RPD (0.688, 0.388 and 0.380) compared to the ANN model (0.984, 0.913, 0.640 and 0.634). Based on these results, the K-ELM model is a more reliable prediction model and it was integrated with ant colony optimization (ACO) in order to achieve the highest Ceiba pentandra methyl ester yield. The optimum molar ratio of methanol to oil, KOH catalyst weight, reaction temperature, reaction time and agitation speed predicted by the K-ELM model integrated with ACO was 10:1, 1 %wt, 60 °C, 108 min and 1100 rpm, respectively. The Ceiba pentandra methyl ester yield attained under these optimum conditions was 99.80%. This novel integrated model provides insight on the effect of parameters investigated on the methyl ester yield, which may be useful for industries involved in biodiesel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyse the combustion, performance and emission characteristics of diesel engine fuelled with biodiesel-diesel-n-pentanol and biodiesel-diesel-n-hexanol blends without engine modification. The fuel constituents were varied between 0 and 100% in the range of 5%. In this, above 75% of biodiesel content, 5% of diesel and less than 20% of n-pentanol and n-hexanol content were selected. Based on the fuel characterization, B90-D5-P5, B85-D5-P10, B90-D5-H5 and B85-D5-H10 were selected for further experimental investigation. The lowest brake specific energy consumption of 12.64 MJ/kWh was obtained for B90-D5-H5 blend at full load condition. The maximum brake thermal efficiency of 31.0% was obtained in B90-D5-H5 blend. The B85-D5-H10 fuel has a maximum heat release rate of 44.53 J/°CA. The lowest carbon monoxide emission of 0.74% vol. was obtained from B85-D5-P10. At 100% load, least unburned hydrocarbons emission of 74 ppm was obtained in B85-D5-P10 blend. The maximum nitric oxide emission of 910 ppm was obtained in B85-D5-H10. Among the above mentioned blends B85-D5-P10 blend has the minimum emission of CO, UBHC and FSN. Thus, this paper discusses the viability of recommending biodiesel-diesel-alcohol blends to fulfill the future energy demands of the world. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - CASTOR oil as well as used cooking oil have been catalytically cracked using three types of catalysts being zinc chloride, sodium carbonate and calcium oxide and the products of cracking were tested for their chemical and physical properties relevant to their use as fuels. Products obtained by cracking castor oil were found to be more suitable as bio-kerosene while those obtained by catalytic cracking of used cooking oil were more suitable as biodiesel. Therefore, the product obtained by catalytic cracking of used cooking oil has been then tested for its effect on the performance of a diesel engine compared to regular diesel fuel. Blends of catalytically cracked used cooking oil with regular diesel fuel were used for running the engine at different engine loading and the specific fuel consumption as well as the exhaust temperature had been determined at each load. The results have shown that blending of regular diesel fuel with catalytically cracked oil resulted in a reduction in the thermal efficiency compared to that if the engine was run using regular diesel fuel only .Such blending resulted also an increase in the exhaust temperature. © 2017 The National Information & Documentation Center (NIDOC).

AB  - Pyrolysis characteristic of hydrogenated palm oil (HPO) was analyzed using TG, TG-FTIR-MS and Py-GC-MS. Bio-fuel oil (BFO) was obtained using catalytic cracking method. The BFO was analyzed by FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, GC-MS and ESI FT-ICR MS to provide complementary and comprehensive adequate information. TG-DTG results showed that the HPO pyrolysis was different with other plant oil. It was clear that HPO pyrolysis was mainly in temperature range of 350 °C–500 °C. The mean activation energy of HPO pyrolysis calculated from KAS and FWO models was 161.10 kJ/mol and 164.28 kJ/mol, respectively. According to TG-FTIR-MS results, little amount of gas components was detected. Py-GC-MS result found heavy compounds, which carbon number exceeds 18. FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and GC-MS results found the BFO mainly contained long-chain alkane and alkene. According to ESI FT-ICR MS, the oxygen containing compounds in BFO were from O2[sbnd]O6 classes, with the O2 being the major class. The RSFTIR was first used to analyze biomass pyrolysis. The results found that in the decarboxylation process, the carbon chain also was cracked to form short carbon chain carboxyl firstly. According to above experiments results, we can confirm HPO pyrolysis path was different with palm oil. The key conclusion was that HPO maybe was a good bio-resource to obtain BFO, and it was mainly contained diesel-like components. Compared to palm oil pyrolysis products, HPO pyrolysis products were mainly contained long-chain alkane and alkene. The recommended pyrolysis path was also proposed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is an eco-friendly, renewable biofuel derived primarily from vegetable oils and is a potential carbon neutral alternative to fossil diesel for compression ignition (CI) engine applications. The biodiesels produced from different feedstocks vary significantly in their fatty acid methyl ester composition and physico-chemical properties and thereby, engine performance and emissions. In the present work, experimental investigations are done with four candidate biodiesel fuels, viz. sunflower, rice-bran, palm and coconut in two different engine configurations, viz. light duty naturally aspirated (NA) and heavy duty turbocharged (TC) to establish the effects of biodiesel composition variations as well as engine type variations on the engine characteristics. To establish biodiesel composition effects on engine characteristics, two new parameters, viz. straight chain saturation factor (SCSF) and modified degree of unsaturation (DUm) are developed in this work, which can be estimated directly from the measured biodiesel composition. The obtained results show some contradicting trends with biodiesel compared to diesel in the two engines. The ignition delay is lower for biodiesel by 0.9 degree in the turbocharged engine, while, it is higher by 1 degree in the naturally aspirated engine. The dynamic start of injection timings are advanced for biodiesel in both the engines but the advance is relatively higher in the turbocharged engine. The heat release rates with biodiesel are premixed and diffusion phase dominant in the naturally aspirated and turbocharged engines respectively. The peak cylinder pressures and nitric oxide emissions are generally higher for biodiesel in both the engines. The smoke emissions with biodiesel are higher and lower respectively in the naturally aspirated and turbocharged engines. Further, investigations on biodiesel composition effects on the engine characteristics revealed a strong correlation between DUm, SCSF and engine parameters. An increase in DUm of biodiesel is found to deteriorate combustion quality, resulting in poor engine performance and higher emissions. However, biodiesel having higher SCSF exhibit better engine performance along with lower nitric oxide and smoke emissions. Thus, an estimate of DUm and SCSF of candidate biodiesel fuels provides a first approximation of the extent of variations in engine parameters compared to diesel and thereby, helps in making a careful choice of biodiesel feedstock for automotive engine applications. Further, based on the results obtained with four different biodiesels in two different engine configurations, the present study reveals that the contradicting engine trends with biodiesel compared to diesel are more influenced by engine type variations rather than by biodiesel composition variations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A techno-economic analysis (TEA) was performed on glucosamine and lipid production from a marine diatom Cyclotella sp. in raceway open pond (RWP) and tubular photobioreactor (PBR) cultivation systems. Two PBR operating schemes were assessed: one to produce high lipid (HL) content, and another to produce high chitin (HC) content. In order to generate 1 kg of glucosamine, 9700 kg (RWP)/1050 kg (PBR HL) freshwater, 40 kg CO2, 0.70 kg nitrogen, 0.18 kg phosphorus, and 1.2 kg silicon nutrients are required for algae cultivation with water and nutrient recovery. With a price of $1.5 for lipid as coproduct, the projected selling price of glucosamine were $35/kg, $106/kg and $82/kg for RWP, PBR HL, and PBR HC systems, respectively. Currently, these prices are not competitive with industrial shellfish-derived glucosamine, but can be reduced by technology improvements such as producing food grade lipid, increasing algal productivity or chitin content. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Inhalation of particulate matter (PM) from residential biomass combustion is epidemiologically associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. This study investigates PM0.4-1 emissions from combustion of commercial Miscanthus straw (MS), softwood chips (SWC) and beech wood chips (BWC) in a domestic-scale boiler (40 kW). The PM0.4-1 emitted during combustion of the MS, SWC and BWC were characterized by ICP-MS/OES, XRD, SEM, TEM, and DLS. Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in human alveolar epithelial A549 and human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells were assessed by the WST-1 assay and the DNA-Alkaline Unwinding Assay (DAUA). PM0.4-1 uptake/translocation in cells was investigated with a new method developed using a confocal reflection microscope. SWC and BWC had a inherently higher residual water content than MS. The PM0.4-1 emitted during combustion of SWC and BWC exhibited higher levels of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), a greater variety of mineral species and a higher heavy metal content than PM0.4-1 from MS combustion. Exposure to PM0.4-1 from combustion of SWC and BWC induced cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in human alveolar and bronchial cells, whereby the strongest effect was observed for BWC and was comparable to that caused by diesel PM (SRM 2 975), In contrast, PM0.4-1 from MS combustion did not induce cellular responses in the studied lung cells. A high PAH content in PM emissions seems to be a reliable chemical marker of both combustion efficiency and particle toxicity. Residual biomass water content strongly affects particulate emissions and their toxic potential. Therefore, to minimize the harmful effects of fine PM on health, improvement of combustion efficiency (aiming to reduce the presence of incomplete combustion products bound to PM) and application of fly ash capture technology, as well as use of novel biomass fuels like Miscanthus straw is recommended. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this work was to produce esters with potential application as biodiesel via esterification with short-chain alcohols of free fatty acids (FFA) obtained from soybean and palm oils refining. Esterification reactions were catalyzed by dry lipase immobilized in fermented solids (DFS), obtained by Rhizomucor miehei grown on babassu cake by solid-state fermentation (SSF). A final conversion above 80% was attained using palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) and soybean fatty acid distillate (SFAD) as raw materials in esterification reactions with ethanol. The biocatalyst could be reused 5 times in repeated 6 h reactions after its washing with 95% (v/v) ethanol or hexane (using SFAD as raw material). Moreover, the properties of the obtained fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE)-enriched products were characterized. Both products were in accordance with several limits established by biodiesel-related standardized tests from Brazilian specifications including ester content (97.3% for the product obtained from SFAD), water content (180 mg Kg−1 for the product obtained from PFAD), density (867.6 kg (m3)−1for the product obtained from SFAD), viscosity kinematic (3.14–4.29 mm2 s−1), flash point (&lt;100 °C), carbon residue (0.01 wt.%), ethanol (0.08–0.083 wt.%), free glycerol (&lt;0.001 wt.%) and total glycerol (0.028–0.10 wt.%), monoglycerides (0.076–0.211 wt.%), diglycerides (0.0196–0.218 wt.%) and triglycerides (0.053–0.114 wt.%). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Producing bio-intermediates from lignocellulosic biomass with minimal process steps has a far-reaching impact on the biofuel industry. We studied the metal chloride catalyzed aldol condensation of furfural with acetone under conditions compatible with the upstream polysaccharide conversions to furfurals. In situ far infrared spectroscopy (FIR) was applied to guide the screening of aldol condensation catalysts based on the distinguishing characteristics of metal chlorides in their coordination chemistries with carbonyl-containing compounds. NiCl2, CoCl2, CrCl3, VCl3, FeCl3, and CuCl2 were selected as the potential catalysts in this study. The FIR results further helped to rationalize the excellent catalytic performance of VCl3 in furfural condensation with acetone, with 94.7% yield of biofuel intermediates (C8, C13) in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM]Cl) solvent. Remarkably, addition of ethanol facilitated the acetal pathway of the condensation reaction, which dramatically increased the desired product selectivity over the furfural pathway. Most significantly, we demonstrate for the first time that VCl3 catalyzed aldol condensation in acidic medium is fully compatible with upstream polysaccharide hydrolysis to monosaccharide and the subsequent monosaccharide isomerization and dehydration to furfurals. Our preliminary results showed that a 44% yield of biofuel intermediates (C8, C13) can be obtained in one-pot conversion of xylose catalyzed by paired metal chlorides, CrCl2 and VCl3. A number of prior works have shown that the biofuel intermediates derived from the one-pot reaction of this work can be readily hydrogenated to biofuels. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - Every year, the production of coal-bed natural gas in the Powder River Basin results in the discharge of large amounts of coal-bed methane water (CBMW) in Wyoming; however, no sustainable disposal methods for CBMW are currently available. A greenhouse study was conducted to evaluate the potential to use CBMW as a source of irrigation water for camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz]. We assessed the effects of three CBMW concentrations (0% [1:0], 50% [1:1], and 100% [0:1] tap water to CBMW) on selected soil properties, growth, seed oil, and fatty acid composition of three camelina cultivars: Blaine Creek, Ligena, and Pronghorn. The 100% CBMW reduced seed and estimated biofuel yields by 24 and 23%, respectively, but increased the oil content by 3%, relative to the control. Additionally, the 100% CBMW visibly affected soil through formation of surface crust due to elevated levels of sodium (653 mg Na kg-1). The 50% CBMW had no significant effects on the seed yield, estimated biofuel yield, and oil content, but the soil Na levels were still high (464 mg kg-1), which could pose a long-term impact on soil structure. The CBMW tended to reduce the total saturated fatty acid, but it had no significant effects on the total monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids of camelina seeds. Overall, CBMW diluted with an equal amount of good-quality water could be used to irrigate camelina in the short term. Afterward, only good-quality water would have to be used until the accumulated dissolved solids are flushed out. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America. 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711 USA.

AB  - The potential use of bio-oil as a small-dosage additive for improving biodiesel oxidation stability has been investigated in this work. Lignocellulosic bio-oil was high-pressure processed under different mixtures of water and organic solvents in order to promote depolymerization of the high molecular lignin still present in bio-oil and increase the content of phenolics, whose antioxidant potential is known. In fact, the antioxidant potential of bio-oil was found to noticeably enhance after the hydrothermal treatment. While the addition of 2% of crude bio-oil improved biodiesel oxidation stability by 135%, the same amount of hydrotreated bio-oil (water, 300 °C, 8.5 MPa) led to an oxidation stability improvement of 400%, which was related to the increase in the concentration of catechol, as well as to the modification of antioxidant properties of the pyrolytic lignin fraction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The main problems of the conventional biodiesel production technology are high production costs and energy consumption, long residence time, and low efficiency. In order to overcome those problems and to improve the biodiesel production process from the ecological and economical points of view, intensive research activities on the development of new, sustainable technologies are undergone. Microreactors are known to increase the dispersion of two phases considerably as needed for the biodiesel reactants (alcohol and oil). This provides much higher interface area that by elimination of mass-transfer hindrance has shown to lead to shorter reaction time. On this background, this study gives (a) an overview of today's industrial biodiesel production, (b) the vision of small-scaled, intensified (micro) flow reactors as integral element in translatable biodiesel factories, (c) the advantages and disadvantages of the lipase catalysed transesterification process in microreactors as chosen case of study, and (d) cost analysis of biodiesel production for the showcase estimating the performance of industrial-scale in enzyme packed-bed microreactors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Heterotrophic fermentation and high valuable co-product producing are thought to be effective ways to improve the economic viability and feasibility of commercial production of microalgae biofuels. This work reported the heterotrophic cultivation of Tribonema minus for lipid and palmitoleic acid (a novel functional fatty acid) production. Firstly, the heterotrophic ability of T. minus was identified for the first time with significant promotion in biomass and lipid productivity, and glucose and urea were then selected as the optimal carbon and nitrogen sources. Moreover, nutrient concentrations and culture conditions were optimized. Highest biomass and lipid productivity of 30.8 g L−1 and 730 mg L−1 d−1 were obtained respectively by adding 80 g L−1 glucose at once. In addition, 2 g L−1 urea, 0.8 g L−1 K2HPO4, 24 mg L−1 ammonium ferric citrate, initial pH of 6, and temperature of 27 °C were determined as the appropriate conditions for heterotrophic growth and lipid production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Used waste cooking oil (WCO) or frying oils are being considered as rich sources of economical feedstock for biodiesel production. To carry out the process of trans-esterification of WCO to methyl esters (biodiesel), zeolite/chitosan/KOH composite was used as solid heterogeneous catalysts. The composite was analyzed using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Scanning Electron Microscope coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) analysis, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. It was found that the treatment of the natural zeolite (clinoptilolite zeolite) with KOH significantly decreased its silica content by desilication and increased its K+ content by formation of hydroxylpotaslite. Electrolysis method (EM) is used as an applicable technology for recovery of energy and resources during waste treatment. Theoretically, EM can convert any biodegradable waste into H2, O2, biofuels, as well as other by-products such as glycerol. However, the system efficacy can vary significantly under different circumstances. The conversion of biodiesel from WCO was obtained for 1 wt.% catalyst concentration and alcohol/oil ratio of 1:7 at 40 V in the presence of water as 2 wt.% of the whole solution in 3 h, produced 93% yield. The optimum conversion process was achieved as a result of using co-solvent as acetone. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) and Viscosity characterization were used the assessing techniques for detection of WCO and biodiesel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The role of catalyst is essential in processes of upgrading biomass pyrolysis bio-oil into hydrocarbon biofuel. While the majority of heterogeneous catalytic processes are conducted in the presence of gas (nearly ideal) or liquid phase, a growing number of processes are utilizing supercritical fluids (SCFs) as reaction media. Although hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is proven a promising process for pyrolysis bio-oil upgrading to hydrocarbon biofuel, catalyst efficiency remains a challenge. Integrating heterogeneous catalysts with SCFs in a bio-oil HDO process was investigated in this study. Bifunctional Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts were firstly used to upgrade bio-oil to biofuel in supercritical methanol. The loading of Co and Zn did not change HZSM-5 crystalline structure. Physicochemical properties of biofuel produced by Co and/or Zn loaded HZSM-5 catalysts such as water content, total acid number, viscosity and higher heating value improved. Bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts showed enhanced reactions of decarboxylation and decarbonylation that resulted in higher yields of CO and CO2. Bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts were more effective for bio-oil HDO than monometallic Co/HZSM-5 or Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst which was attributed to the synergistic effect of Co and Zn on HZSM-5 support. Bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts increased biofuel yields and hydrocarbons contents in biofuels in comparison with monometallic Co/HZSM-5 and Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts. 5%Co15%Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst generated the highest biofuel yield at 22.13 wt.%, and 15%Co5%Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst produced biofuel with the highest hydrocarbons content at 35.33%. Hydrogenation and esterification are two dominant reactions in bio-oil HDO over Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts in supercritical methanol. The energy efficiency of biofuel product was 30.99–58.80% for Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts. Co-Zn/HZSM-5 is a promising catalyst to produce biofuel with high quality in bio-oil HDO. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A mixture of vegetable oil and animal fat as raw materials was optimized by simplexcentroid mixture design to produce a type of biodiesel with good oxidative stability, flow properties and reaction yield. Further, kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of oxidation reaction were determined by the accelerated method at different temperatures. Biodiesel produced with sodium methoxide as catalyst presented 6.5°C of cloud point, 2.0°C of pour point, and oxidative stability at 110°C equal to 8.98h, with a reaction yield of 96.04%. Activation energy of the oxidation reaction was 81.03 kJ mol-1 for biodiesel produced with sodium hydroxide and 90.51 kJ mol-1 for sodium methoxide. The positive values for ΔH‡ and ΔG‡ indicate that the oxidation process is endothermic and endergonic. The less negative ΔS‡ for biodiesel produced with sodium methoxide (-28.87 JK-1 mol-1) showed that the process of degradation of this biofuel was slower than that produced with NaOH. The mixture of raw materials proposed, transesterified with the methoxide catalyst, resulted in a biofuel that resisted oxidation for longer periods, making unnecessary the addition of antioxidant © 2017, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - In the present study Trichoderma reesei, a wood isolate can yield high biomass quantities up to 30 g/L, yielding 32.4% of lipids of dry cell weight (DCW). Biodiesel production from Trichoderma reesei involved simple unit operations like filtration and ultrasonication, yet giving good lipid yield with desirable bio-diesel properties. Optimization of ultrasonication conditions was done to ensure maximum lipid extraction. SEM analysis of ultrasonicated samples showed distinct breakage of fungal hyphae. The lipids were found to contain 49.7% saturated fatty acids. Transesterification using chemical and biological catalysts were compared and 96.09% efficiency was observed for lipase-catalyzed transesterification. The bio-diesel properties satisfied ASTM and EN specifications with cetane number: 53.1, iodine value: 63.34 g, saponification value: 235.07 mg KOH/g, cold flow plugging point: 9.13 °C. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - From an environmental point of view, diesel substitution with biodiesel shows many advantages but often involves environmental issues that must be assessed case by case. The environmental impact of Linum usitatissimum and Camelina sativa oilseed crops for biodiesel production was assessed by Life Cycle Assessment approach considering a cradle-to-gate perspective. The study included three steps: cultivation, oil seed transportation from farm to pressing plant and biodiesel production from vegetable oil by transesterification. The cultivation was carried out in Mediterranean conditions, with low inputs (minimum use of fertilisers and pesticides) and no irrigation. Seed production is responsible for more than 85–90% of the environmental impact of biodiesel; seed pressing represents less than 2% of the biodiesel environmental impact for most of the evaluated impact categories and transesterification ranges between 2% and 10%. For seed production, diesel fuel and exhaust gases emissions from the tractors' engines are the main factors responsible for the environmental impact, while pesticide and fertiliser production accounts for a small environmental load. In general, the differences between the performances of the two biodiesel fuels arise almost completely from the difference in the environmental impact of seed production and, in particular, from seed yield, which is higher for flax. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this work was to study the synthesis of medium-chain length alkanes (MCLA), as bio-aviation product. To control the chain length of alkanes and increase the production of MCLA, Escherichia coli cells were engineered by incorporating (i) a chain length specific thioesterase from Umbellularia californica (UC), (ii) a plant origin acyl carrier protein (ACP) gene and (iii) the whole fatty acid synthesis system (FASs) from Jatropha curcas (JC). The genetic combination was designed to control the product spectrum towards optimum MCLA. Decanoic, lauric and myristic acid were produced at concentrations of 0.011, 0.093 and 1.657 mg/g, respectively. The concentration of final products nonane, undecane and tridecane were 0.00062 mg/g, 0.0052 mg/g, and 0.249 mg/g respectively. Thioesterase from UC controlled the fatty acid chain length in a range of 10–14 carbons and the ACP gene with whole FASs from JC significantly increased the production of MCLA. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The relationship between uncertainty and risk–taking behaviour towards innovations and Common Market protection are investigated in this article. Therefore, the aim of this article is to assess points of control over market regulation protecting innovative products. It was found that risk of creative destruction due to implementation of innovations is increased by regulators due to antimonopoly metric they use. EU fiscal policy implementation in renewable fuels in Czech Republic of both EU and CZ calculations is compared. Historical data has shown that regulators have collapsed market of high condensed biofuels. Pattern of fine calculation has explained a market collapse. Comparison of excise duty of favoured biofuels was compared with subsidies for photovoltaics. Substitution of former fossil fuels taking into account excise duty and subsidies of alternative or renewable energies is less market distorting than recent tariffs of excise duty and fines to first generation biofuels. © 2017, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

AB  - In this study, the aim was to find out if mixing two common fuels together could be beneficial for both the environment and storage stability of fuel. It is obvious, that adding biodiesel to fossil fuel will decrease its sulphur content and reduce its carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon, sulphur dioxide and soot emissions. But will the high sulphur content enhance the storage stability of the biodiesel? Four B20 samples were produced, consisting of 20 vol% biodiesel and 80 vol% fossil diesel. The samples were prepared from rapeseed methyl ester (RME), low sulphuric fossil diesel fuel and high sulphuric diesel solvent. The blends had different sulphur contents of 6, 76, 149 and 226 mg kg-1. For these B20 fuel samples, the parameters were compared that correlate with the storage stability of the fuel blends. The studied parameters were the oxidation stability (OSI, according to EN 15751:2015), acid number (AN, according to EN 14104:2003) and kinematic viscosity (KV, by Stabinger SVM 3000 rotational viscometer). The measurements were carried out straight after mixing the blends, and again after 4, 8 and 12 weeks. According to the results, the fuel containing less sulphur slightly lost its oxidation stability within three months. Instead, the oxidation stability of high sulphuric samples improved within the same time frame. As a conclusion, the study gave a reason to assume that – in spite of its known drawbacks – the sulphur may be favourable to fuel blends’ storage stability but the phenomenon and chemistry should be studied in more detail. © 2017, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

AB  - Energy sector had growth significantly over the year which cause serious global warming issues. This problem arises from the results of carbon emission. Thus, a proper mitigation strategies are needed to tackle this issues. This paper is aim to apply carbon emission pinch analysis (CEPA) for transportation sector in Iskandar Malaysia (IM). The modified method is applied to study the minimum requirement of electricity need to be generated to implement electric vehicle (EV) based on current policy available and to reach the new emission target by year 2025. The road transportation and rail transportation were considered in the transport composite curve. The alternatives available to reduce emission in IM are by increasing public transport modal share, fuel switching from petrol and diesel to natural gas and biofuels, and increase transport efficiency by plug-in hybrid and EV. As a results, the estimated total amount of 0.25 TJ of electricity is needed for EV to be implemented. Copyright © 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l..

AB  - Renewable sources of fuels are important for environmental sustainability. Biofuels are produced from renewable feedstocks through biological processes and can be found in the form of liquid, gas and solid. Isobutanol, a branched chain butanol isomer, is a type of biofuel that can be produced through the fermentation of biomass using microorganisms. In an aerobic fermentation, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) produced certain amount of isobutanol as by-product during the degradation of valine through the Ehrlich pathway. In the fermentation process, the determination of growth kinetics gives a better explanation regarding the relationship between specific growth rate and the concentration of a substrate. Kinetic coefficients are useful in providing information regarding the progression of either the chemical or biological reaction occurring in a system. In this study, the microbial growth kinetics, glucose utilisation and isobutanol productivity were investigated. The growth kinetics coefficients were determined by the Monod's model while the Ledeuking-Piret's model were used in investigating the parameters involved in substrate's consumption and product's formation. The maximum specific growth rate, μmax and the substrate saturation constant, Ks were determined from the slope and interception point (a plot between 1/μ and 1/S) during 48 h of fermentation period. The value of μmax and Ks obtained were 0.74 h-1 and 57 g/L. The isobutanol yield (YP/S), biomass yield (YX/S) and the correlation between isobutanol production and yeast growth (YP/X) were found to be 4.79 mg/g, 0.1 g/g and 49.4 mg/g. The Monod's and Leudeking-Piret's models were found to be suitable to represent the experimental data of growth kinetics and product's formation kinetics in this study.

AB  - The current scenario of greenhouse gasses emissions is witnessing major impetus as a result of the ever expanding transportation sector across the globe, of which the aviation sector has played a major role. The Malaysian transportation sector, specifically the aviation sector, has a poor record of high carbon emissions, inspite of its history of biofuel and sustainable fuel policy. However, researchers around the globe are now diverting their attention from the conventional fossil fuels to biofuels, because it is cheaper to produce, increases the efficiency of the aircrafts and also reduces the environmental threat fossil fuel emissions pose to the planet. Alternative fuels like bioethanol and biodiesels are increasingly used in aviation industry, as a direct consequence of the global targets set by the International Air Transport Association. In the present study, the possibility of increased biofuel by the aviation industry of Malaysia is analyzed with specific focus on the global initiatives taken for the same, as well as the past and current trends of Malaysia's general biofuel production and consumption. It has been estimated that the use of alternative fuels in aviation industry could reduce the flight related greenhouse gas emission by approximately 60 to 80 %. The recent trials that have been conducted on the importance of biofuels in aviation industry have indicated that these fuels are technically feasible. In this respect, the European community in conjunction with private airline companies and major biofuels producers in their area have played a very prominent role in commercializing the use of biofuels in air transport. But in Malaysia to see biofuels as anything other than their consumption in the food and healthcare industry is still a debatable topic. By addressing these research gaps, this paper focuses on the possibility of manufacturing biofuel products at a commercial scale in Malaysia to be used in the aviation industry to power jet engines in commercial aviation and for reduced carbon emission for increased sustainability of the environment.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of biodiesel production from Salvia macrosiphon oil (SMO) using the ultrasonic system. The major properties of Salvia macrosiphon methyl ester was compared with ASTM standards and the specifications met the requirements of biodiesel standards. This allows Salvia macrosiphon oil to be utilized for biodiesel production and be a potential substitute to diesel fuel; it can also be blended with diesel fuel. The performance and the exhaust emissions of a diesel engine operating on Salvia macrosiphon biodiesel-diesel blended fuels have been investigated. The experimental test results indicated that by using biodiesel-diesel blends, brake power, torque and concentrations of the CO2 and NOx emissions increased while the specific fuel consumption (SFC) and concentration of CO and HC emissions decreased. The results obtained revealed that high oxygen content of Salvia macrosiphon biodiesel resulted in significant overall improvements in the combustion reaction especially in B20 (20 vol% biodiesel and 80 vol% diesel fuel). CO and HC were reduced by up to 25% and 31.82% respectively in B20 compared to neat diesel fuel (B0). The innovated fuel blend also increased engine performances, which are the power and torque, by up to 18% and 15.8% respectively, and decreased specific fuel consumption by 4.6%. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Producing energy from biomass and other organic waste residues is essential for sustainable development. Like biodiesel, green diesel is a next generation biofuels emerging due to the need for a renewable replacement of petrodiesel. Green diesel is a mixture of carbon chains which are derived from lignocellulosic biomass and the fuel properties are naturally similar to the petrodiesel. This paper discussed an integrated green diesel production route from non-food biomass resources. A systematic literature for lignocellulosic biomass resources has been developed. The systematic literature focuses on hydrodeoxygenation or catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction. Copyright © 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l..

AB  - A Single Particle Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (SPAMS) was deployed in the urban area of Chongqing to characterize the particles present during a severe particulate pollution event that occurred in winter 2014–2015. The measurements were made at a time when residents engaged in traditional outdoor meat smoking activities to preserve meat before the Chinese Spring Festival. The measurement period was predominantly characterized by stagnant weather conditions, highly elevated levels of PM2.5, and low visibility. Eleven major single particle types were identified, with over 92.5% of the particles attributed to biomass burning emissions. Most of the particle types showed appreciable signs of aging in the stagnant air conditions. To simulate the meat smoking activities, a series of controlled smoldering experiments was conducted using freshly cut pine and cypress branches, both with and without wood logs. SPAMS data obtained from these experiments revealed a number of biomass burning particle types, including an elemental and organic carbon (ECOC) type that proved to be the most suitable marker for meat smoking activities. The traditional activity of making preserved meat in southwestern China is shown here to be a major source of particulate pollution. Improved measures to reduce emissions from the smoking of meat should be introduced to improve air quality in regions where smoking meat activity prevails. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass is a potential renewable feedstock that can be used as a replacement for fossil resources. A variety of high end chemicals have been produced from biomass including ethyl levulinate, which is a viable biofuel for diesel engines. In this study, the capability of three types of imidazolium based ionic liquids (ILs) catalysts, i.e., 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM][Cl]), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ([BMIM][HSO4]) and 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ([HMIM][HSO4]) to convert oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) and oil palm mesocarp fiber (OPMF) biomass to ethyl levulinate were compared. The procedure entailed a sequential reaction of depolymerisation of biomass at 160 °C for 3 hours, followed by an esterification at 90 °C for 12 h in excess ethanol, with ILs-To-biomass ratio of 5 : 1 by weight and 20 wt% water. It was demonstrated that only the last two acidic [HSO4]- counteranion based ILs are able to convert the biomass to ethyl levulinate. Mono-Alkylated ILs, [HMIM][HSO4], consistently gave a higher efficiency than multi-Alkylated ILs, [BMIM][HSO4], for both OPEFB and OPMF biomass conversions, with ethyl levulinate yields of 11.61 % and 13.54 %, and the process efficiencies of 39.26 % and 50.79 %. OPMF appears to be a slightly more efficient feedstock in ethyl levulinate production than OPEFB. This indicates the performance of ILs was dependent upon the character of their cation side chain, seeing that both ILs used have the same acidic [HSO4]- counteranion. The experimental results suggested that [HMIM][HSO4] has the potential to be used in ethyl levulinate production from sustainable biomass feedstocks under mild operating conditions.

AB  - With a rich biomass resource from palm oil industry, Malaysia has high potential in developing the biofuel industry. Fast pyrolysis of biomass provides bio-oil, which has a wide range of projected applications that are comparable to that of the crude oil. Storage and processing of lignocellulosic bio-oil are not economically successful yet. Bio-oil has to undergo further downstream processing to attain right specifications for final applications. Emulsification of bio-oil with conventional fuel such as diesel is one of the direct applications projected for bio-oil. Since bio-oil is a complex mixture of polar and non-polar compounds, blending of bio-oil and diesel is a challenge. Fast pyrolysis of palm kernel shells (PKS) at 550 °C in a fixed bed reactor yielded 39.2 ± 5.0 wt% of bio-oil. The bio-oil was investigated for its properties and taken for emulsification studies. The impact of emulsification parameters on the combustion properties of bio-oil diesel emulsified mixture was performed by varying bio-oil, diesel, and surfactant ratios. With the aid of an optimisation tool, the emulsion samples achieved an optimised pH of 3.29, heating value of 42.19 MJ/kg and density of 0.86 g/cm3. Copyright © 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l..

AB  - Experimental trials have been conducted using an optical swirl burner to compare the heat release and emission profiles from the application of four different aviation fuel blends with changing inlet conditions. The mixtures comprised fossil Jet A-1 and a HRJ (Hydrotreated Renewable Jet fuel) batch produced from used cooking oil processing, and blended in discrete ratios. Changes in the produced emissions were quantified with varying combustor pressure and equivalence ratio, in addition to analysing the distribution of combustion heat release using OH∗ chemiluminescence, and monitoring operational rig temperatures. Results suggest the presence of HRJ can reduce emissions and lead to a more compacted and homogenous heat release zone, beneficial as localised hot-spots can lead to the generation of soot and thermal NOx. An increase in pressure was also shown to compact the flame brush at constant thermal power, due to density changes in the combustion air, and reduced bulk flow. The presented heat release distributions and experimental data are useful for the validation of numerical simulations, particularly for the use of alternative fuels. The work also highlights the correlation of flow/acoustic perturbations with heat release, crucial in characterising global combustion behaviour. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In present work, ordered mesoporous material SBA-15 was synthesized and used as the support for the dispersion of the nickel and cobalt active metal. XRD, N2 sorption, ICP, H2-TPR and TEM techniques were used for the Ni/SBA-15 and Co/SBA-15 catalysts characterization. Both Ni/SBA-15 and Co/SBA-15 catalysts were tested for the hydrogenation of the typical oxygen-containing molecule present in bio-oil in order to produce the renewable aromatic. Ni/SBA-15 catalyst exhibit much higher catalytic performance as compared with Co/SBA-15 catalyst for the hydrodeoxygenation reaction performance of anisole, but it is also obvious that the Ni/SBA-15 catalyst would inevitably lead to the emergence of partial hydrodeoxygenation product methoxycyclohexane. On the contrary, the direct hydrogenolysis of methoxy-functional group from anisole molecule could prevail over the Co/SBA-15, leading to much higher aromatic selectivity over the Co/SBA-15. Co/SBA-15 could selectively hydrogenolyse the C[sbnd]O bond and could act as the potential hydrodeoxygenation catalyst for aromatic production from the bio-oils because of its high efficiency in the removal of oxygen by a direct hydrogenolysis route. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - According to the Malaysia's biofuel policy, renewable fuels are crucial for energy sustainability in the transportation sector in the future. This study was aimed to evaluate the potential of bioethanol production from Sri Kanji 1 cassava in Malaysia in terms of energy efficiency and renewability, as well to estimate the potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction in CO2 equivalent. Bioethanol production process from cassava includes cassava farming, ethanol production, and transportation in which the primary energy consumption was considered. The Net Energy Balance (NEB) and Net Energy Ratio (NER) of 25.68 MJ/L and 3.98, respectively, indicated that bioethanol production from Sri Kanji 1 cassava in Malaysia was energy efficient. From the environmental perspective, the GHG balance results revealed that the production and distribution of 1 L of Cassava Fuel Ethanol (CFE) could reduce GHG emissions by 73.2%. Although found promising in the present study, Sri Kanji 1 cassava as bioethanol feedstock should be further investigated by constructing an actual ethanol plant to obtain real life data. © 2017 BRTeam.

AB  - Techno-economic variables for advanced biofuels produced from lignocellulosic biomass have been scrutinized and combined with a newly developed transparent model for simulating the competitiveness between conventional and advanced biofuels for road transport in the medium to long term in Germany. The influence of learning effects and feedstock cost developments has been highlighted, including also gaseous fuels. Thorough sensitivity analyses were undertaken. Previously reported cost assumptions for advanced biofuels were found to have been too optimistic. The most cost-competitive biofuels for most of the time period remained conventional biodiesel and bioethanol, but the costs of these options and biomethane and Synthetic Natural Gas (bio-SNG) converged in the medium term and thus other factors will play a decisive role for market developments of biofuels. Feedstock cost uncertainties for the future remain a challenge for long-term planning, and low-cost short-rotation coppice may change the picture more than any other parameter. Of the advanced biofuels, bio-SNG was found significantly more cost-competitive and resource efficient than Fischer-Tropsch-diesel and lignocellulose-based ethanol, but still requiring a dedicated long-term policy. The results and the large sensitivities of biofuel competitiveness stress the need for more data transparency and for thorough sensitivity analyses of the results in similar system studies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The European Commission has proposed a minimum share of 3.6% for advanced biofuels in transport in 2030. Satisfying this target using synthetic biofuels would require 48–62 Mt/a of forest residue feedstock. If all biofuel plants were maximally enhanced with additional hydrogen input, the biomass demand would be reduced by 35 Mt to 16–24 Mt/a. As sustainable biomass is a limited resource, such drastic improvements in the efficiency of biomass use have a favourable impact on biomass availability. In this work we assume electrolysis of water as the source of hydrogen and investigate the GHG emission balances of hydrogen enhanced biofuels using the calculation method provided in the European Union's sustainability criteria for biofuels. The required 70% emission saving compared to fossil fuels is achieved when the carbon intensity of electricity remains under 84–110 gCO2/kWh, depending on the process configuration. In addition, we study the possibility that an emission factor could be allocated to the wood biomass, referring to recent discussions on climate impacts of forest bioenergy. Without hydrogen enhancement, the emission factor needs to remain below 13 gCO2/MJwood to meet the 70% requirement, while for hydrogen-enhanced configurations it could increase to 36 gCO2/MJwood, under the assumption of zero emission electricity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Soybean is currently recognized as a high value crop, allowing the manufacture of a broad range of products. This contribution investigates the synergies resulting from coupling the production of biodiesel with soybean processing facilities, defining the core structure of a soy-based biorefinery. Simulations in Aspen Plus® were performed, employing a detailed modeling framework. A base case scenario was established, allowing a detailed economic assessment of the process, a profitability and risk analysis, as well as the identification of plant integration opportunities. Increased process integration leads to an 18% decrease of the biodiesel production costs, corresponding to a 9% reduction of the break-even price (from 875 to 798 $/t of biodiesel). This is accompanied by an overall decrease of hot and cold utilities consumption of 20%, with a heat exchanger network that performs closely to the energy recovery targets determined through pinch technology. The need for fresh water in biodiesel production is also completely eliminated and the generation of wastewater is mitigated by 9%. The risk analysis, carried out through Monte Carlo simulations, shows that the new plant configuration becomes more robust to variations in the key economic factors considered. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the accumulation of lipid and photosynthetic pigments from Tetraselmis marina. When the cells were grown in F/2-medium for seven days in the first stage, the carotenoid and lipid contents, and productivity were 44 g/kg (DW), 27% and 31 mg/L/d, respectively. After second stage of cultivation of T. marina for further 3-days under N-replete condition (4.41 mM NaNO3) increased biomass concentration of 1900 mg/L and lipid content of 50% were observed, with an enhanced lipid productivity of 86.36 mg/L/d and SFA and MUFA fractions of 70.76 and 13.14%, respectively. However, under P-repletion (2.08 mM NaH2PO4), its carotenoid content increased to 89.23 g/kg and its PUFA for 65% of total lipids. Results showed that N and P-replete conditions decreased SOD activity and increased H2O2 and TBARS levels of T. marina. Thus, this native microalga strain could be a potent candidate for feed,  food or biofuel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effect of weight ratio of plywood manufacturing by-product birch sawdust (BS) to water (1/2–1/8), reaction temperature (200–340 °C), initial H2 pressure (0–10 MPa), residence time (5–90 min), catalysts amount (0.25–7.0 wt.%) and type (FeSO4, ZnSO4, NiSO4, Raney-nickel, Ni65%/SiO2[sbnd]Al2O3, Na2CO3 and NaOH) on hydrothermal liquefaction of BS was investigated. High yield of bio-oil (54.1%) with calorific value (CV) 24.9 MJ/kg under developed optimal experimental conditions in the presence of NaOH (5 wt.%) utilizing weight ratio of BS to water 1/4, residence time 5 min, mixing speed 250 rpm at 300 °C without pressurized particular inert gas or H2 atmosphere was achieved. Compounds in bio-oil analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) have suitable chemical structures for conversion into renewable hydrocarbons. Marketable solid residue (SR) with yield 7.1%, high CV (29.8 MJ/kg) and perspective characteristics for industrial application was obtained.

AB  - The ketonization of aldehydes joins two molecules, with n carbon atoms each, to a ketone with 2n - 1 carbon atoms. When employing cerium oxide as a catalyst with nano-sized crystals (<15 nm) the ketone can be obtained in almost 80% yield. In addition, other ketones are observed so that the total ketone selectivity reached almost 90%. Water is consumed during the reaction when the aldehyde is oxidized to the corresponding carboxylic acid, which is established as a reaction intermediate, co-producing hydrogen. Consequently, water has to be co-fed in the reaction to enhance the reaction rate and to improve the catalyst stability with time on stream. In contrast to zirconium oxide which possesses catalytic activity for the aldol condensation liberating water, with cerium oxide water is not abundant on the surface and the reaction kinetics show that the reaction rate depends on the concentration of the water in the gas-phase, in addition to the dependence on the gas-phase concentration of the aldehyde. The liberated hydrogen can be consumed in the hydrodeoxygenation of the ketone product. Doing so, when starting from heptanal, a biomass derived aldehyde, an alkane mixture was obtained with almost 90% diesel content. For the whole cascade reaction with five single steps no reagents are necessary and the only by-product is one molecule of innocuous carbon dioxide (related to two molecules of aldehyde). This shows that cerium oxide possesses a big potential to convert biomass derived aldehydes into biofuels in a very sustainable way. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - The influence of cultural conditions on lipid production was investigated in two species, Trichosporon oleaginosus and Rhodosporidium azoricum. We showed that nitrogen limitation is not the main factor triggering the mechanism of lipid accumulation in T. oleaginosus. Moreover, a scarce availability of oxygen negatively affected lipid synthesis to a lesser extent in T. oleaginosus than in R. azoricum. This highlights how the importance of controlling fermentation parameters is strictly linked to the yeast species employed. We showed that these parameters affect the activity of important enzymes, influencing the metabolic fluxes into different pathways, in particular pentose phosphate pathway and cytoplasmic pyruvate bypass. Furthermore, T. oleaginosus exhibited wider substrate flexibility, faster growth and higher lipid accumulation in fed-batch cultivation. Microbial oils obtained from both yeasts proved a valuable feedstock, alternative to vegetable oils, for advanced diesel biofuel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Oxygenates present in partially hydro processed lignocellulosic-biomass pyrolysis oil to be component of second generation bio-fuels have been examined for their compact on the laminar flame speed of gasoline. Experiments were performed in an elevated pressure combustion vessel designed around a concept of a premixed Bunsen flame. Laminar flame speed measurements were firstly conducted for neat oxygenate fuel (anisole, 4-methylanisole and ethylvalerate)/N2/O2 mixtures at conditions T = 423 K, P = 0.1 MPa and φ = 0.6–1.3. It has been observed that anisole has a higher flame speed compared to 4-methylanisole and ethylvalerate. Meanwhile, very similar values of flame speeds have been obtained for 4-mythlanisole and ethylvalerate fuels. To learn the potential effect of these oxygenates present in biofuels acting as drop-in additives on the petroleum-based gasoline fuel, a five components surrogate gasoline fuel (hexane, 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene, cyclohexane, isooctane, and toluene) was then proposed and validated by comparing its laminar flame speed with commercial gasoline. Laminar flame speeds measurements were finally performed for the blends mixed by the proposed surrogate gasoline and different percentage of oxygenates over a large working condition range including T = 400–473 K, φ = 0.6–1.3 and P = 0.1–0.8 MPa. The influence of studied oxygenates as additives on gasoline has been found to be negligible for values up to 10% (wt) which is insensitive to the variation of pressure and temperature. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The environmental degradation and the health hazards caused by the petroleum fuels needs a compelling research for the alternate energy source. This paper analysis the pongamia methyl ester (PME) as an alternate source of fuel for CI engines without making much changes in the existing engine technology and without causing much difficulties for the scientists and engineers. The study reveals the use of PME as either an alternate fuel or substitute for the diesel may definitely reduces the green house gases at the same time the employability in the agricultural field will be increased by retaining the migration of the farmer community towards cities or towns for search of employment. It was observed that the use of PME as fuel reduces carbon monoxide to an extent of 8.2% compared to diesel at the same time HC reduced by 8.9% also there is considerable reduction in oxides of nitrogen. There was increase in BSFC of 4.2% and the thermal efficiency reduced by 2.4%. But the environmental sustainability and the employability for local community and promotion of agriculture prefers the PME as an alternate fuel for the transport, agricultural and power sector. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - During the gasoline storage, gums are formed by a slow oxidation of some unstable compounds, such as olefins. The high molecular mass oxidation products can become insoluble and form deposits. Its excess affects the injection pattern, the fuel combustion, the durability of the fuel line parts and increases the pollutant emissions. Consequently, a robust knowledge is required to assess better the behavior of the fuel, in particular the impact of biofuels. This article discussed the certainties and challenges in modeling gum formation in blends of Brazilian gasoline with anhydrous ethanol. The impact of experimental and mathematical procedures on the robustness of the model was investigated. They make possible to assess quantitatively the impact of aging period, temperature, ethanol and additive contents in the formation of unwashed and washed gums. The results confirmed the promotion of the process with the increase of the temperature and aging period and showed the complex role of ethanol, strongly dependent on the values of the other factors. Moreover, the comparison with former literature showed that the models from this study were more robust and the dependence with chemical matrix of gasoline and ethanol quality was reduced. Recommendations were given to overcome the remaining challenges. © 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Converting chemicals that can be derived from lignocellulose to cyclic hydrocarbons is a promising route for the synthesis of high-density biofuels. But the low-temperature properties of most synthesized fuels are not good, with high viscosity and freezing point. Herein, we presented the synthesis of cyclohexane derivatives by the alkylation of aromatic oxygenates (anisole, guaiacol and phenol) with furfural alcohol (furfuryl alcohol and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural), followed with hydrodeoxygenation. It is found that FeCl3 exhibits relatively high activity and selectivity for the alkylation of anisole (guaiacol), and AlCl3 is the best catalyst for phenol. The selectivity of mono-alkylation product is 71.0%, 92.4% and 84.3% for the alkylation of anisole, guaiacol and phenol with furfuryl alcohol when the reactant ratio is 10, respectively. A semi-continuous operation was adopted for the alkylation of furfuryl alcohol to improve the conversion of aromatic oxygenates. When furfuryl alcohol is replaced by 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, the selectivity reaches almost 100%, but the reaction is a little slower and longer time is needed to get full conversion. After hydrodeoxygenation by combination of Pd/C and HZSM-5, the alkylation product was converted to branched cyclohexane with density of 0.804 g/cm3 at 20 °C, kinematic viscosity of 34.4 mm2/s at − 60 °C and freezing point lower than − 80 °C, which shows great potential as additive to promote the low-temperature properties of other fuels. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to investigate the anti-knock quality of sugar-derived levulinic esters (methyl levulinate (ML) and ethyl levulinate (EL)) and cyclic ethers (furfuryl ethyl ether (FEE) and ethyl tetrahydrofurfuryl ether (ETE)). To this end, combustion experiments were carried out in both an engine and a constant volume autoignition device (modified ignition quality tester (IQT)). The results from both apparatuses demonstrate that ML, EL and FEE have superior anti-knock quality to the reference Euro95 gasoline. ETE, conversely, performed markedly worse than the reference fuel on both setups and might therefore be a more appropriate fuel additive for compression ignition engines. The main reason of the distinctions in anti-knock quality can be found in the molecular structure of the neat biofuels. ML and EL are levulinic esters, with a ketone (C[dbnd]O) functionality and an ester (C([dbnd]O)–O) group on the carbon chain. They can readily produce stable intermediates during the auto-ignition process, thereby slowing down the overall reaction rate. The unsaturated cyclic ether (FEE) has very strong ring C–H bonds. However, the saturated cyclic ether (ETE) has weak ring C–H bonds, which facilitate more readily ring opening reactions. Ethyl side chains on the cyclic ethers further accelerate the reaction rate. Importantly for future research, our results suggest that the modified (IQT) and engine experiments are interchangeable setups with respect to qualitative anti-knock quality evaluation of novel compounds. © 2017 The Author(s)

AB  - Algae-fungus co-culture was investigated as an alternative biodiesel feedstock. An oleaginous filamentous fungus Aspergillus awamori was co-cultured with Chlorella minutissima MCC 27 and Chlorella minutissima UTEX 2219, respectively in N11 medium furnished with different carbon and nitrogen sources. The biomass and lipid production potential of the two C. minutissima–A. awamori co-cultures was compared against the monocultures. A substantial enhancement in biomass and lipid accumulation was observed in both the co-cultures. When supplemented with different carbon and nitrogen sources, glycerol and potassium nitrate were found to be the most effective. In the presence of glycerol, a 2.6–3.9-fold increase of biomass and 3.4–5.1-fold increase of total lipid yields were observed in the co-cultures as compared to the axenic monocultures. Furthermore, C16:0 (31.26–35.02%) and C18:1 (21.14–24.21%) fatty acids were the major composites of the co-culture oils, which suggest co-culture as a promising strategy for biodiesel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The kinetic behavior and evolution characteristics of gaseous products during the combustion of biocrude oil from solvolysis liquefaction of Chlorella pyrenoidosa were investigated by thermogravimetry–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG–FTIR). The results indicated the biocrude oil obtained from different ethanol/water mixed ratio had obvious difference with each other. The ignition temperature of biocrude oil from ethanol–water co-solvent was lower than that from pure water solvent, which promoted the comprehensive combustion index. Especially, BO40 (biocrude oil obtained from 40% ethanol content) achieved the lowest ignition temperature (163.4 °C) and high comprehensive combustion index (1.24 × 10−06 min−2 °C−3). C[sbnd]H, C[dbnd]O, C[dbnd]C, CO2, CO and HCN were the main gaseous products. Compared to other biocrude oil samples, BO40 had high first peak intensity of C[sbnd]H, C[dbnd]O and C[dbnd]C, and low peak intensity of CO, which performed better combustion characteristic. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the effectiveness of the ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) of crambe seed oil was evaluated with the aim of biodiesel synthesis by in situ interesterification. An experimental design was applied, using a mixture of n-hexane and methyl acetate as the solvent, to evaluate the effect of the process variables and determine the conditions that maximize the removal of oil from the seeds. The results indicated that the extraction time and temperature have a greater influence on the oil extraction than the solvent:seed ratio (p &lt; 0.05). The extraction carried out at 60 °C using a solvent to seed ratio of 10 (mL g−1) for 90 min provided the maximum oil yield (∼37%), representing ∼92% of the yield obtained by the conventional method and a 20% increase compared with the yield obtained without ultrasound. The fatty acids compositions of oils obtained by UAE and conventional extraction were similar (p &gt; 0.05), showing a predominance of erucic, oleic and linoleic acids, which accounted for ∼86.5% of the oil composition. The water and free fatty acids contents indicate that the oils obtained cannot be processed by the conventional method using alkaline homogeneous catalysis for the production of biodiesel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, a new pretreatment strategy for lignocellulosic was developed using a fully recyclable solid acid, Toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH). A combined hydrolysis factor (CHF) as a pretreatment severity was used to balance enzymatic saccharification and the structural characteristics of lignin. The results from degradation of carbohydrates, enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose and characterization of lignin by FT-IR, 31P NMR, GPC, 2D-HSQC NMR indicated that a CHF of approximately 3.90 was the optimal pretreatment severity to facilitate enzymatic saccharification and the potential serviceability of lignin. Then approximately 90% of the xylan was removed to result in a reasonable sugar yield of 76%. Residual lignin showed low molecular weight (Mw, 5783 g/mol), narrow polydispersities (Mw/Mn, 1.10) and high content of phenolic hydroxyl groups (3.702 mmol/g); it may be a potential feedstock for phenol monomer and polymeric materials production. In short, this process was regarded as a promising approach to achieve an efficient conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to sugar products and lignin-based materials. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Tropospheric lifetimes of two lactones, gamma-valerolactone (GVL) and alpha-methyl gamma-butyrolactone (AMGBL) in terms of their reactions with two important tropospheric oxidants- OH and Cl - are estimated, after determining the respective rate coefficients of their reactions in the gas phase using relative rate method. Values of the rate coefficients of the reactions of GVL (kOH = (1.95 ± 0.58) x 10−12; kCl = 2.26 ± 0.53 × 10−11 cm3molecule−1s−1) and AMGBL (kOH = 1.81 ± 0.43 × 10−12; kCl = 3.42 ± 0.63 × 10−11 cm3molecule−1s−1) at 298 K imply that reaction with OH is the dominant reaction in the ambient conditions, and that reaction with Cl atom becomes relevant under marine boundary layer (MBL) conditions, reducing the tropospheric lifetimes to almost half. The tropospheric life times of GVL and AMGBL based on their reaction with OH under ambient conditions are comparable, 71.2 and 76.7 h respectively. However, the products of the reactions are found to be different. In GVL, a promising second generation biofuel component, only ring opening reactions are important, acetic acid and CO2 being the only observed volatile products. In AMGBL, additional ring oxidized products are also formed, of which 3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-2,5-furandione is the most dominant one. The absence of such ring oxidized products in GVL is assigned to the difference in the preferred position of H atom abstraction, based on the computed rate coefficients of individual channels reported in the literature. This suggests that the impact in terms of aerosol generation in the troposphere may also be different for GVL and AMGBL, which differ only in the position of methyl substitution. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper intend to investigate the effects of biodiesel fuel blends comprising of waste-cooking oil and butanol-diesel (B10W10–B10W40) under steady-state conditions. Both particulate organic carbon (OC) and PM including PM2.5 and PM10 significantly decreased with the increasing percentage of biodiesel fuel blends. The fuel blend of B10W40 also demonstrated the most effective function in reducing the emissions of PM10 and PM2.5 in the volume by 59.4% and 57.7%, respectively. Moreover, the emissions of nitrogen oxides decreased with the blending of B10W10-B10W40 (13.9–28.5%), while the brake specific fuel consumption was substantially increased (5.69–13.4%). The overall biological toxicity of PM10 generated from the fuel tested in this study was determined according to Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis assay in human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells and micronucleus assay in CHO-K1 cells. In addition, the volume of more than 20% waste-cooking oil (B10W20 and B10W40) significantly reduced diesel-induced genotoxicity in lung cells and micronucleus formation in CHO-K1 cells. Collectively, these results indicated that biodiesel fuel blends with the butanol could be a potential alternative fuels for diesel engines because of its substantial property with a significant reduction of the PM-related genotoxicity and the emissions of PM, particulate OC, and NOX. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study demonstrated that the bio-oil derived from fast pyrolysis of lignin was excellent candidate to be converted into the jet and diesel fuel range hydrocarbons by catalytic upgrading process. This research addresses specifically the kinetic and mechanism of cyclohexanone conversion using sulfided CoMo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in a fixed-bed flow reactor. The main routes of cyclohexanone upgrading included hydrodeoxygenations (HDO), dehydrogenation, hydrogenation and coupling. The selectivity-conversion analyses at different operating condition indicate that benzene, cyclohexene, phenol, and 2-cyclohexen-1-one formed as primary products and the other main products, 2-methylphenol, cyclohexylbenzene, biphenyl, 2-phenylphenol, 2-cyclohexylcyclohexan-1-one, 2-cyclohexylidenecyclohexane-1-one and 2-cyclohexylphenol appeared as non-primary products. An approximate reaction network and a first order kinetic model are developed to determine kinetic parameters. Kinetic investigations indicate that among the various reactions on sulfided CoMo/Al2O3, HDO is characterized by the highest rate and that selectivities for oxygen removal are favored by operation at higher temperatures and pressures. The apparent activation energy for the HDO reaction that leads to benzene formation is approximately 35.6 kJ/mol; coupling is the reaction class characterized by the highest apparent activation energy. The pseudo-first-order rate constants for formation of the main products of cyclohexanone conversion decrease in the following order: benzene &gt;2-cyclohexylidenecyclohexane-1-one &gt; cyclohexylbenzene &gt; 2-cyclohexen-1-one &gt; 2-phenylphenol &gt; phenol &gt; cyclohexene &gt; 2-cyclohexylphenol &gt; 2-methylphenol &gt; 2-cyclohexylcyclohexan-1-one &gt; biphenyl. © 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - In this study, an interval two-stage double-stochastic single-sided fuzzy chance-constrained programming model is developed for supporting fuel management of a community-level district heating system (DHS) fed with both traditional fossil fuels and renewable biofuels under multiple uncertainties. The proposed model is based on the integration of interval parameter programming and single-sided fuzzy chance-constrained programming within an improved stochastic programming framework to tackle the uncertainties expressed as crisp intervals, fuzzy relationship, and probability distributions. Through transforming and solving the model, the related fuzzy and stochastic information can be effectively reflected in the generated solutions. A real fuel management case of a DHS located in Junpu New District of Dalian is utilized to demonstrate the model applicability. The obtained solutions provides an effective linkage in terms of both ‘‘quality’’ and ‘‘quantity’’ aspects for fuel management under various scenarios associated with multiple factors, and thus can help the decision makers to identify desired fuel allotment patterns. Moreover, this study is also useful for decision makers to address the other challenges (e.g. the imbalance between fuel supply and demand, the contradiction between air-pollution emission and environmental protection, as well as the tradeoff between the total heating cost and system satisfaction degree) generated in the fuel management processes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects on performance, emission, and combustion characteristics of adding biodiesel and bioethanol to diesel fuel. Diesel fuel and blend fuels were tested in a water-cooled compression ignition engine with direct injection. Test results showed that brake specific fuel consumption and volumetric efficiency increased by about 30.6% and 3.7%, respectively, with the addition of bioethanol to binary blend fuels. The results of the blend fuel's combustion analysis were similar to the diesel fuel's results. Bioethanol increased maximal in-cylinder pressure compared to biodiesel and diesel fuel at both 1400 rpm and 2800 rpm. Emissions of CO increased by an amount of about 80% for fuels containing a high level of bioethanol when compared to CO emissions for diesel fuel. Using biodiesel, NO emissions increased by an average of 31.3%, HC emissions decreased by an average of 39.25%, and smoke opacity decreased by an average of 6.5% when compared with diesel fuel. In addition, when using bioethanol, NO emissions and smoke opacity decreased by 55% and 17% on average, respectively, and HC emissions increased by an average of 53% compared with diesel fuel. © 2017 Society of Thermal Engineers of Serbia.

AB  - In the present investigation, toxic algal bloom, a copious and low-cost nutrient source was deployed for cultivating Chlorella pyrenoidosa. Various pre-treatment methods using combinations of acid/alkali and autoclave/microwave were tested for preparing hydrolysates and compared with minimal media (BG-11). Acid autoclave treatment resulted in maximum carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous content which substantially boosted the growth of the microalgal cells (4.36 g/L) as compared to rest of the media. The microalga grown in this media also showed enhanced lipid content (43.2%) and lipid productivity (188 mg/L/d) as compared to BG-11 (19.42 mg/L/d). The biochemical composition showed 1.6-fold declines in protein while 1.27 folds in carbohydrate content as compared to BG-11. The fatty acid profile revealed the presence of C14-C22 with increased amount of monounsaturated fatty acids as compared to BG-11. The results obtained showed that algal bloom can be used as a potential nutrient source for microalgae. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Petroleum-based fuels are now widely known as environmentally unfriendly because of non-renewable supplies and its contribution to environmental pollution. The challenge, therefore is to ensure appropriate energy supplies at minimum cost. There is an increasing energy demand in the world and nowadays it can be fulfilled only on the basis of fossil fuels. Therefore, it is necessary to evolve a renewable energy source with lower environmental impact. One alternative solution can be oils of plant origin, like vegetable oils and non-edible oils. With waste vegetable oil methyl ester, biofuel dependency can be decreased. Therefore, the aim of this research paper is to analyze the economic and environmental effect of waste vegetable oil methyl ester compared to fossil fuels. In some cases only the age of vehicles could raise burdens to biofuel utilization in road vehicles. Transport and energy policy - on a large scale - can play an important role in fuel consumption. Author is aware that waste vegetable oil methyl ester can play only a limited role in biofuel substitution. © 2017 Society of Thermal Engineers of Serbia.

AB  - This paper presents an experimental study on the effect of different high octane fuels (such as eucalyptus oil, ethanol, and methanol) on engine's performance behaviour of a biofuel based dual fuel engine. A single cylinder Diesel engine was modified and tested under dual fuel mode of operation. Initially the engine was run using neat diesel, neat mahua oil as fuels. In the second phase, the engine was operated in dual fuel mode by using a specially designed variable jet carburettor to supply the high octane fuels. Engine trials were made at 100% and 40% loads (power outputs) with varying amounts of high octane fuels up-to the maximum possible limit. The performance and emission characteristics of the engine were obtained and analysed. Results indicated significant improvement in brake thermal efficiency simultaneous reduction in smoke and NO emissions in dual fuel operation with all the inducted fuels. At 100% load the brake thermal efficiency increased from 25.6% to a maximum of 32.3, 30.5, and 28.4%, respectively, with eucalyptus oil, ethanol, and methanol as primary fuels. Smoke was reduced drastically from 78% with neat mahua oil a minimum of 41, 48, and 53%, respectively, with eucalyptus oil, ethanol, and methanol at the maximum efficiency point. The optimal energy share for the best engine behaviour was found to be 44.6, 27.3, and 23.2%, respectively, for eucalyptus oil, ethanol, and methanol at 100% load. Among the primary fuels tested, eucalyptus oil showed the maximum brake thermal efficiency, minimum smoke and NO emissions and maximum energy replacement for the optimal operation of the engine. © 2017 Society of Thermal Engineers of Serbia.

AB  - Biodiesel is presently available all over the world and can be produced from several types of biomass. Biodiesel fuels are gaining more and more importance as an attractive alternate fuel in various transport sectors due to their renewable nature and lower pollution impact. However, the ports and the shipping sector are still in the early stage of orientation towards biofuels. In the present work, an experimental investigation on the use of diesterol blend (a mixture of diesel, ethanol with biodiesel) with cerium oxide as a nanoadditive (D80JBD15E4S1 + cerium oxide) in a compression ignition engine is performed to assess the emission characteristics. The results reveal that the presence of the cerium oxide nanoparticle changes the reaction patterns and heat transfer rate that reduces both the CO and CO2 percentage concentration in the exhaust gas appreciably. Further, the reduction in CO2 emission in the port of Chennai is quantified considering the replacement of neat diesel with those of modified diesel blend in port owned trucks and vehicles. © 2017 Society of Thermal Engineers of Serbia.

AB  - A new continuous process for the selective production of castor-oil green diesel was developed, leading to 95.3% purity and ca. 98% relative yield. Castor oil was hydrotreated in fixed-bed continuous reactors, with one or two stages, using NiMo/Al2O3 as catalyst. It was demonstrated that performing the process in a single hydrotreating bed the presence of hydroxyl groups in castor oil afforded secondary reactions that led to low values of purity and yield. Running the reactions in a two-stage continuous system allowed to remove, in the first bed at 270 °C, hydroxyl groups and unsaturations before the deoxygenation of the carboxylic groups in the second bed at 350 °C, improving in this way the purity and the yield considerably. Physicochemical properties of the so-obtained product met most of the specifications of the European standard EN 590 but the CFPP. Blending of green diesel (20% vol) with petro-diesel satisfied CFPP specifications for diesel grade B. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) and Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) after treatment systems integrated 3L diesel engine fueled with BDF20, BDF50, BDF100 biodiesel fuels and JIS#2 diesel fuel are experimentally analyzed at 100 Nm, 200 Nm and full load (294 Nm); while the engine speed and cooling water temperature are constant at 1800 rpm and 80 °C, respectively. The advanced thermodynamic analyses, such as environmental and enviroeconomic analyses with energy, exergy, sustainability, thermoeconomic and exergoeconomic analyses, are applied. It is found that; (i) Utilization of the DOC is effective to reduce the fuel consumption of the BDF50 fuel; while the DOC and DOC + DPF are effective for the BDF100 fuel. (ii) DOC + DPF is more effective for biodiesel fuels. (iii) DOC + DPF decreases the soot concentration of all fuels. (iv) The maximum efficiency is found for the BDF100 fuel. (v) DOC + DPF is generally good option to reduce the CO2 of the fuels, especially for the BDF20 and BDF50. (vi) DOC + DPF is more effective for the BDF20 and BDF50 biodiesel blends; while both of the DOC and DOC + DPF are effective for the BDF50 fuel for reducing the prices of the released CO2. (vii) All fuels are more sustainable at full load. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is a growing trend in utilizing biological industrial wastes to produce biofuels. The dairy washed milk scum (DWMS) is one of such potential industrial waste and can be used as feedstock for the production of biodiesel. One of the inherent problems of DWMS biodiesel is its poor low temperature property. In this investigation, the influence of two bio-based cold flow improvers (CFIs) namely, ethyl acetoacetate (EAA) and ethyl levulinate (EL) was tested on low temperature properties of DWMS biodiesel. It was observed that the addition of 20% (v/v) of EAA and EL to DWMS biodiesel significantly decreased the cloud point (CP), cold filter plugging point (CFPP) and pour point (PP). The crystallization characteristics of neat biodiesel and biodiesel blended with CFIs (EAA and EL) were determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The viscosity, acid value and induction period, flash point of all samples were within the permissible limits of biodiesel standard (ASTM D6751-15c) with all the blends of EAA and EL. The present work demonstrates that EAA and EL are suitable cold flow improvers for DWMS biodiesel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic hydroprocessing of pyrolysis oils from biomass produces hydrocarbons that can be considered for liquid fuel production. This process requires removal of oxygen and cracking of the heavier molecular weight bio-oil constituents into smaller fragments at high temperatures and pressures under hydrogen. We present in this paper the characterization of a group of five distillate fractions from each of two types of hydroprocessed oils from oak pyrolysis oil: a low oxygen content (LOC, 1.8% O, wet basis) oil and a medium oxygen content (MOC, 6.4% O, wet basis) oil. The LOC oil was generated using a sulfided hydrotreating system consisting of RuS/C and xMoS/Al2O3 while the MOC was produced using non-sulfided catalysts, Ru/C and Pd/C. Elemental analysis and 13C NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) results suggest that the distillate fractions from both oils become more aromatic/unsaturated as they become heavier. Carbonyl and carboxylic groups were found in the MOC light fractions, while phenols were present in the heavier fractions for both MOC and LOC. Paraffin, iso-paraffin, olefin, naphthene, aromatic (PIONA) analysis of the light LOC fraction shows a predominance of paraffins with a minor amount of olefins. Sulfur analysis showed the comparative concentration of sulfur in the different fractions as well as the surprising similarity in content in some sulfided and non-sulfided fractions. These results can be used to direct future research on refinery integration and production of value-added product from specific upgraded oil streams. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the rise of restrictions imposed by law for gases emission, several technologies both for petrodiesel (PD) or diesel engines are been applied, such as the sulfur reduction and the injection electronic command, followed of gases recirculation and/or after-treatment. The utilization of biofuels is considered as an interesting option for pollutants reduction. In this study was evaluated the performance on short duration tests (minor period than the factory indication of the lubricant lifespan) of the Diesel engine fueled with four vegetable oils. With the aim to select the most interesting oils for future evaluations in long duration tests. The analyzed variables were fuel consumption, power relative loss and opacity, for oils of linseed, crambe, rapseed, jatropha, with 100 °C preheating and engine work temperature (60 °C) comparing those with the PD. It was verified that the vegetable oils, on average, present a lower consumption than the PD for the cases of working without load, however with load, they presented higher consumption. In addiction were observed that the oils show a higher relative power loss in relation of PD and provides lower emission of particulate matter. Crambe and canola presented the best performance among the evaluated oils.

AB  - A microalgae-based energy system, which is a combination of different microalgae-to-biodiesel chains and an integrated cogasification combined cycle (ICGCC) system, is presented. To address the low environmental impacts, the electricity is generated from ICGCC to meet the load demand from the microalgae-to-biodiesel chains and the flue gas exits from ICGCC to meet the demand of growing algal culture. To achieve the microalgae-based energy system with minimum life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the first step is to develop the superstructure model based on GAMS, the second step is to use the optimal heat exchanger network to maximize the heat recovery of ICGCC, and the third step is to find the optimal combination of the microalgae-to-biodiesel chain and optimal operating conditions of ICGCC by solving the global optimization of nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. For the scope of well-to-tank (WTT), the optimal microalgae-based energy system reduces 16.80% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to the other reported microalgae-to-biodiesel chains. For the scope of well-to-wheel (WTW), the optimal microalgae-based energy system reduces 45.77% GHG emissions compared to the conventional diesel process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Valeric biofuels stand for a promising energy source, since they are generated from the refining process of crop residues, which converts lignocellulose into the valeric biofuel (or valeric ester). In order to achieve a high grade valeric ester, several washing steps are required and eventually results in the formation of two liquid phases (water-rich and ester-rich phases). In this context, the objective of this study is the experimental determination of liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) concerning chemical species present during the ethyl esterification of valeric acid (valeric acid, ethanol, ethyl valerate and water). Results were obtained for the LLE of ternary systems comprised of binodal curves and tie-lines at atmospheric pressure (91.1 kPa) and 293.15 K and 318.15 K. The experimental values obtained were modelled using NRTL, UNIQUAC and UNIFAC-LL Gibbs energy models. Both NRTL and UNIQUAC models were able to correlate satisfactorily the experimental results, while UNIFAC-LL predictions provided greater deviations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work evaluated the influence of drought and nitrogen fertilization on the fatty acid composition of Jatropha curcas seeds by means of 1H HR-MAS NMR, a tool which allows obtaining chemical information directly from the seeds. It was found that only the drought conditions led to the decrease of polyunsaturated fatty acid contents and to the increase of those monounsaturated. No changes were observed for the contents of saturated fatty acids. The lipid profile reached without irrigation may be considered the most effective for improving biodiesel properties, such as cetane number and oxidative stability. At last, there was no influence on the fatty acid composition with different levels of nitrogen fertilizer application. © 2016

AB  - Procedures and operating conditions optimized in laboratory scale for the production of ethyl biodiesels from non-edible vegetable oils (NEVOs) were successfully transferred at pilot scale, with implementation of separation and purification stages. The three NEVOs candidates are Balanites aegyptiaca (BA), Azadirachta indica (AI), and Jatropha curcas (JC), converted into BAEEs, AIEEs and JCEEs respectively via homogeneous catalysis. Quality specifications of the produced biofuels were used to explain pollutant emissions and engine performance observed via a power generator. Under the same conditions, blends of petrodiesel with crude BA or JC oil (50 wt.%) were also investigated. The selected overall methodology “feedstock-conversion-engine” led to the proposal of a sustainable alternative fuel. The candidate NEVO is BA oil to which the proposed alkali route should lead to a low cost biodiesel production process thanks to easy operating conditions, associated with a two-stage procedure (glycerol recycling) and a dry-purification method (rice husk ashes). Glycerol addition should be carried out at ambient temperature to play positively at phenomena occurring in the reacting medium (chemical kinetics, chemical equilibrium, phase equilibrium). Tests on power generator demonstrated that BAEEs led to cleaner combustion than petrodiesel, particularly for the most harmful emissions (light carbonyls and ultrafine particulate matter). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this work was to generate high lipid accumulating mutants of Chlorella minutissima (CM) using ethyl methyl sulphonate (EMS) as a random chemical mutagen. Amid the 5% surviving cells after exposure to EMS (2 M), three fast growing mutants (CM2, CM5, CM7) were selected and compared with wild type for lipid productivity and biochemical composition. Among these mutants, CM7 showed the maximum biomass (2.4 g/L) and lipid content (42%) as compared to wild type (1.5 g/L; 27%). Further, the mutant showed high photosynthetic pigments with low starch content signifying the re-allocation of carbon flux to lipid. The obtained mutant showed no visible morphological changes in comparison to its WT. The fatty acid profile showed increase in monounsaturated fatty acids while decreased saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids signifying good quality biodiesel. The mutant strain thus obtained can be optimized further and applied for enhanced biodiesel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, the miscibility of hydrogenated biomass-pyrolysis-oil with diesel and its applicability in diesel engine has been tested by using its surrogate-ethylene glycol. The miscibility of ethylene glycol and 1,3-propylene glycol with diesel has been tested, finding that only 10% vol ethylene glycol could be mixed with diesel and 1,3-propylene glycol is immiscible with diesel. In order to make a direct comparison, 10% ethanol-90% diesel, 10% ethylene-90% diesel, and 10% ethyl acetate-90% diesel blends have been tested in a diesel engine under the same operation conditions. The engine performance of ethylene glycol is comparable to ethanol and ethyl acetate. There is no significant difference in brake specific fuel consumption and exhaust gas temperature for blends. The three oxygenated compounds all have lower CO emissions than diesel. Besides, ethylene glycol and ethyl acetate could reduce the NOx emission. All the three fuels have reported the reduction of soot emission. This work offers the possibility that ethylene glycol (hydrogenated bio-oil) could be used as a useful additive (up to 10% vol) in diesel. © 2017

AB  - The present experimental study aims to find the effect of the nozzle opening pressure (NOP) on the behaviour of a single cylinder, direct injection, compression ignition engine, run on a non-petroleum fuel; i.e. JMETPO20 blend, which contains 80% jatropha methyl ester and 20% tyre pyrolysis oil on a volume basis. In order to find an optimum NOP for the blend, tests were conducted at an optimized injection timing with five different NOPs viz. 210, 220, 230, 240 and 250 bar in addition to the original NOP of 200 bar, and the findings were matched with those of diesel operation. The combustion parameters were analysed for the blend and test results showed that the peak cylinder pressure and maximum heat release rate were marginally increased at the NOP of 220 bar in comparison to the original NOP of 200 bar at full load. Further, it was found from the results that for the blend with the NOP of 220 bar, the brake thermal efficiency increased by about 5.12%, while the smoke opacity, brake specific carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbon emissions were decreased by about 9.5%, 1.57% and 6.26% respectively when compared to those of the original operating condition at full load. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigated the influence of waste cooking oil (WCO) biodiesel on the combustion, unregulated gaseous emissions and particulate emissions of a diesel engine. Experiments were carried out on a direct-injection diesel engine fueled with diesel, B20 (20% biodiesel on volume basis), B50, B75 and biodiesel, under the Japanese 13-mode test cycle. Biodiesel increases the in-cylinder pressure, shortens the ignition delay and combustion duration, and lowers the maximum heat release rate. An increase of brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is also observed when using biodiesel. For brake thermal efficiency (BTE), no significant changes are found in most of the tested modes. Biodiesel increases the weighted brake specific emissions of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, propene, ethene, benzene, but reduces the weighted brake specific emissions of toluene and xylene. No significant changes are observed for the ozone formation potential of these unregulated gaseous emissions among the tested fuels. Biodiesel reduces the weighted particle mass concentration (PMC) and the weighted geometric mean diameter (GMD) of the particles, however, significant reductions in the weighted total number concentration (TNC) are only observed when using B75 or biodiesel. Overall, the influence of biodiesel on the investigated emissions is proportional to the biodiesel content in the tested fuels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper reports the gaseous pollutants and Particulate Matter (PM) emissions of a gas turbine combustor burning butyl butyrate and ethanol blends. The gas turbine has been tested under two operational conditions to represent the cruising (condition 1) and idling (condition 2) conditions of aero engines. Aviation kerosene RP-3 and four different biofuels using butyl butyrate (BB) and ethanol blends were tested and compared to evaluate the impact of fuel composition on CO, NOx, unburnt hydrocarbon (UHC) and PM emissions under selected two operational conditions. The PM number (PN) concentration and size distributions were measured by a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). The compositions of filter borne PM were analysed by ion chromatograph technique. The concentrations of CO, NOx and UHC were detected and analysed by a gas analyser. Results indicated that under idling and cruising conditions the CO emissions from butyl butyrate and ethanol blends were higher than that of RP-3 due to the relatively lower combustion temperature of the biofuels compared with that of RP-3. Results of the NOx emission comparison indicated the biofuels produced less NOx than RP-3 and the increase of ethanol content in the biofuels could reduce the NOx and UHC emissions. The particles smaller than 20 nm played a dominant role in PN emissions at condition 1 with the range from 2 × 106/cm3 to 4 × 107/cm3. There was a peak value of particle number concentration with the particle size ranging from about 25 nm and 40 nm. The PN emission index at condition 1 was higher than that at condition 2 for the biofuels, whilst the trend was opposite to that of RP-3. The ions analysis indicated Ca2+ and SO42− were the two dominant ions in the PM emissions of biofuels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cyclopentanone, a product of biomass pyrolysis of agricultural waste, has certain advantages as a biofuel candidate but so far little is known about its combustion characteristics. In this paper, the laminar flame characteristics of cyclopentanone, including stretched flame propagation speed, unstretched flame propagation speed, and laminar burning velocity, were measured and compared with gasoline and ethanol, using the outwardly propagating spherical flame method and the high-speed Schlieren photography technique. The experiments were conducted in a constant-volume vessel using various fuel-air equivalence ratios (ϕ = 0.8–1.6) at elevated initial temperatures (T0 = 423, 448 and 473 K) and a fixed initial pressure (P0 = 0.1 MPa). Linear and non-linear extrapolations were used to characterise the relationship between the stretch rate and the stretched flame propagation speed when Markstein length was near to or away from zero respectively. Empirical functions were obtained to calculate the laminar burning velocities of cyclopentanone for various fuel-air equivalence ratios and initial temperatures. The results show that Markstein length of cyclopentanone decreases when equivalence ratio is increased, and the turning point of equivalence ratio at which it changes from positive to negative is slightly below 1.4. The maximum laminar burning velocity of cyclopentanone appears at the equivalence ratio of approximately 1.2, regardless of the initial temperature. The laminar burning velocity of cyclopentanone has a smaller difference to that of ethanol and gasoline when equivalence ratio is leaner than stoichiometric, but when equivalence ratio increases from 1.0 to 1.4, it becomes increasingly lower than that of ethanol and higher than that of gasoline. The maximum laminar burning velocity of cyclopentanone is 0.82 m/s; for gasoline it is 0.72 m/s and for ethanol it is 0.86 m/s, at an initial temperature of 423 K and pressure of 0.1 MPa. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Experimental measurements and numerical simulations were conducted to examine the effects of varying O2 concentrations, oxidant velocity (Vo) levels, and bio-oil proportions on the combustion characteristics of the bio-oil/kerosene mixtures. The results indicated that when the O2 concentration was 30% and the liquid fuel flow rate in the spray combustor was fixed, the flame associated with the spray combustion of pure kerosene decreased in length and increased in luminosity as Vo increased; moreover, the flame temperature increased. When Vo = 5.53 m/s, this phenomenon was more visible when the bio-oil was added to the kerosene. When the bio-oil proportion was 15% and Vo = 3.87 m/s, the flame luminosity increased; however, the flame luminosity decreased when Vo exceeded 3.87 m/s. When the O2 concentration reached 40%, the length, luminosity, and temperature of the flame increased; nevertheless, when Vo = 5.53 m/s, the flame temperature decreased. The effect of the bio-oil proportion was not apparent. Because the bio-oil contained more volatile substances and O2 than did the kerosene, the combustion efficiency of the bio-oil-fossil fuel mixtures varied according to the bio-oil proportion and O2 concentration. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Producing transportation fuels from bio sources was of prime importance due to the strict environmental legislations for producing clean fuels from conventional oil resources. However, the economical impacts of the biofuel production should be considered. In this study, the production of bio-naphtha and biodiesel from palm oil using homogeneous catalyst, i.e. an aqueous phase of ammonium molybdate, was studied. This catalyst was prepared by dissolving sodium molybdate in de-ionized water with hydrochloric acid, and then neutralizing the mixture with ammonium hydroxide. The solution was dried at 90 °C for 24 h to obtain ammonium molybdate. Then, characterization of the catalyst was done by informative techniques, such as XRD and FT-IR. The results showed that the main phase of the synthesized catalyst was molybdate ammonium hydrates (4MoO3.2NH3.H2O), and also bands of Mo-O, Mo-O-Mo, N-H and surface hydroxyl groups were observed in the sample. Moreover, activity test confirms that the bio-naphtha produced from the proposed method has a few aromatic components, and its sulfur content was negligible. Moreover, ash, nitrogen, sulfur and carbon residue were not detected in the produced biodiesel, and its Cetane index was 66.3. Therefore, it was a suitable fuel for diesel engines vehicles.

AB  - Bio-fuel causes less pollution to the environment as compared with diesel fuel. However, sound and vibration resulting from the combustion in bio-fuel-powered engines adversely affect users. In this study, non-edible bio-fuel, i.e., Calophyllum inophyllum, and its blends were investigated for their performance as alternative fuel and were compared by using vibration as the engine parameter. Previous studies used overall engine vibration to determine the optimum bio-fuel blends with minimal vibration. Overall vibration could consist of vibration components due to combustion as well as other external vibration sources. This condition limits its effectiveness in identifying an optimum fuel blend mainly due to vibration caused by combustion effect. Advanced vibration analysis technique, which consists of time-domain, frequency-domain, and motion visualization analyses (i.e., operating deflection shape analysis), is first performed to isolate the effect of external vibration source due to torque from the overall vibration. Bio-fuel-powered engines at full speed and with the lowest engine torque are more suitable for the identification of an optimum fuel blend with minimal engine vibration. Bio-fuel blend B20 has the least vibration in overall root mean square acceleration at full speed compared with pure diesel and other bio-fuel blends. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Outdoor microalgae cultivation process is threatened by many issues, such as pest pollution and complex, changeable weather. Therefore, it is difficult to have identical growth rate for the microalgae cells and to keep their continuous growth. Outdoor cultivation requires the algae strains not only to have a strong ability to accumulate oil, but also to adapt to the complicated external environment. Using 18S rRNA technology, one wild strain Scenedesmus sp. FS was isolated and identified from the culture of Chlorella zofingiensis. Upon contamination by Scenedesmus sp., the species could quickly replace Chlorella zofingiensis G1 and occupy ecological niche in the outdoor column photobioreactors. The results indicated that Scenedesmus sp. FS showed high alkali resistance. It also showed that even under the condition of a low inoculum rate (OD680, 0.08), Scenedesmus sp. FS could still grow in the outdoor raceway pond under a high alkaline environment. Even under unoptimized conditions, the oil content of Scenedesmus sp. FS could reach more than 22% and C16-C18 content could reach up to 79.68%, showing that this species has the potential for the biodiesel production in the near future. © 2017 Shuhao Huo et al.

AB  - The search for alternative energy sources encompasses increasing the capacity of renewable energy, while reducing the amount of carbon dioxide emissions. The nontoxic and biodegradable character of biomass justifies its exploitation as a fuel to generate power. Specifically, Sapindus saponaria L. oil, with its high lipid content, thermal stability, suitable saponification values, and acid and iodine content, seems to be a promising source for the production of biocombustibles. In this work, biodiesel was produced from the methyl esterification of fatty acids from S. saponaria L. oil. In addition, blends were prepared from the mixture of petrodiesel and biofuel in proportions of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25% (v/v). The biodiesel and its blends were evaluated for their rheological properties, thermal profile (thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetric analyses), density, and refractive index. The biodiesel presented a Newtonian behavior and a kinematic viscosity value of 5.029 mm2/s at 40 °C, in accordance with the ASTM D6751, EN 14214, and CNS 15072 standards. The slight increase in the biodiesel's viscosity, compared to that of petrodiesel (3.442 mm2/s), is advantageous because it provides an increased lubricity and reduces engine wear. Blends B5 to B25 also presented kinematic viscosity values in accordance with the ASTM D976, ASTM D7467, EN 590, and CNS 1471 standards. The obtained biodiesel (Tonset = 188.14 °C) showed a superior thermal stability to petrodiesel (Tonset = 102.17 °C). Differential scanning calorimetry revealed the phase transition between the liquid state to the crystallization of fuels at low temperatures. The compilation of these results highlights the potential of S. saponaria L. oil to generate a biofuel suitable for future commercialization. © 2017

AB  - Biofuel production is not cost competitive and thus requires governmental intervention. The effect of the institutional framework on the development of the biofuel sector is not yet well understood. This paper aims to analyze how biofuel production and production capacity could have evolved in Germany in the period 1992–2014. The effects of an agricultural policy intervention (liberalization of the agricultural market) and a bioenergy policy intervention (a tax on biodiesel after an initial exemption) are explored. Elements of the Modeling Agent systems based on Institutional Analysis (MAIA) framework, complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory, and Neo Institutional Economics (NIE) theory were used to conceptualize and formalize the system in an agent-based model. It was found that an early liberalization of the agricultural market led to an under-production of biodiesel; a late liberalization led to the collapse of biodiesel production. An early introduction of the biodiesel tax led to stagnation in biodiesel production and production capacity; a late introduction led to an increase in sunk costs provided that the biofuel quota is binding. Also, a lack of agents’ adaptation mechanism to forecast prices led to a decrease in patterns of biodiesel production when an external shock was introduced in the system. In sum, we argue that system behavior is influenced by individual behavior which is shaped by institutions. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - The development of an economically viable biofuel industry rests on strong state subsidies for production and processing, creation of markets through government procurement, fuel-blending mandates, price controls, as well as foreign trade tariffs and quotas, and multiple interventions in agricultural, ecological, and other regulations. We use an approach grounded in agrarian political economy to critically analyze the literature on how biofuel policies interact with broader production, trade, and agro-ecological processes. We focus on policies involving the most prominent crops in the places where biofuel production has advanced the most (i.e. USA, Brazil, and the EU), but also extend analysis to their relations with broader transformations in production, commercial, and even governance practices around the world. We investigate the political and economic interests driving biofuel policies, and how these set the terms in which state interventions and policies are conceived and implemented. We find that these are not developed and implemented according to environmental or inclusive pro-poor development purposes, but according to state interests in energy security and its intersection with a tense alliance between corporate sectors, rendering many policy mechanisms ineffective or even outright counterproductive to effectively facilitate more socially and environmentally sustainable energy production and agricultural practices. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - High value-added reutilization of sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is essential in sustainable development in WWTPs. However, despite the advantage of high value reutilization, this process must be based on a detailed study of organics in sludge. We used the methods employed in life sciences to determine the profile of lipids (cellular lipids, free fatty acids (FFAs), and wax/gum) in five sludge samples obtained from three typical WWTPs in Beijing; these samples include one sludge sample from a primary sedimentation tank, two activated sludge samples from two Anaerobic-Anoxic-Oxic (A2/O) tanks, and two activated sludge samples from two membrane bioreactor tanks. The percentage of total raw lipids varied from 2.90% to 12.3%. Sludge from the primary sedimentation tank showed the highest concentrations of lipid, FFA, and wax/gum and the second highest concentration of cellular lipids. All activated sludge contained an abundance of cellular lipids (>54%). Cells in sludge can from plants, animals, microbes and so on in wastewater. Approximately 14 species of cellular lipids were identified, including considerable high value-potential ceramide (9567–38774 mg/kg), coenzyme (937–3897 mg/kg), and some phosphatidylcholine (75–548 mg/kg). The presence of those lipid constituents would thus require a wider range of recovery methods for sludge. Both cellular lipids and FFAs contain an abundance of C16–C18 lipids at high saturation level, and they serve as good resources for biodiesel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study the life cycle assessment (LCA) of three scenarios for biodiesel production from Scenedesmus dimorphus, a freshwater microalgae, cultivated in open raceway ponds using primary and secondary data was investigated. The main differences in the scenarios were related to biomass productivity, mode of culture mixing and type of energy source. The process steps included algal cultivation in open raceway ponds, harvesting by chemical flocculation, dewatering by mechanical drying option (MDO)/Spray Drying (SD) followed by extraction, reaction, and purification. Supplementation of the cultivation process with electricity derived from defatted algal biomass waste was also analyzed. The scenarios were evaluated for energy demand and environmental impacts amongst the boundary conditions based on a “cradle-to-gate” inventory. The results revealed that among all the scenarios, cultivation in raceway pond was ascertained to be the most energy intensive process with the mode of culture mixing and biomass productivity being the principal determinants. The impacts were found to be directly linked to energy demand and had an inverse relationship with biomass productivity. The geographic location of the energy sources affected the environmental implications of a given process. The integration of defatted algal biomass waste derived electricity with the cultivation system showed a minor reduction in the overall energy demand. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, effects of the canola biodiesel blends in 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% proportions (in vol.) with diesel fuel were investigated at four loads (4.8, 3.6, 2.4 and 1.2 bar BMEP) in a single-cylinder DI engine. Comprehensive combustion analyses showed that, although the start of injection timings were inadvertently advanced from the system response, the combustion of canola biodiesel blends generally resulted in shorter ignition delay period for all loads due to earlier combustion timing. The maximum heat release rate generally decreased gradually with the reduction of premixed combustion fractions and corresponding increase in the diffusion combustion fractions when the canola biodiesel ratio was increased. Slightly reducing the maximum in-cylinder pressures and maximum in-cylinder pressure rise rates were caused a slight retardation on the center of heat release locations and longer combustion durations. BSFC results increased up to 6.56% and BTE reduced up to 4.2% when the canola biodiesel ratio was increased to 20% at the high load. The canola biodiesel blends also resulted in higher NOx emissions of 8.9% as well as lower smoke, CO and THC but slightly higher CO2 emissions for all loads. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Three Ni-based catalysts were prepared for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of bio-oil with three different support materials (active carbon, SBA-15 and Al-SBA-15) and their catalytic effects were tested with crude bio-oil at 300 °C and under 3 MPa H2 pressure for 60 min. After the HDO reaction, gas, liquid phase (light oil and heavy oil) and char were obtained as the primary products. Heavy oil was produced at a yield of 45.8-48.1 wt%, with no significant differences among the three catalysts. Mesoporous silica-supported catalysts (Ni/SBA-15 and Ni/Al-SBA-15) produced large amounts of char (16.3-18.6%), while Ni/C yielded 8.5 wt% char. Active carbon-supported catalysts (Ni/C) yielded more gas (27.7%) than the Ni/SBA-15 and Ni/Al-SBA-15 catalysts (6.6-8.9%), due to high surface area and low char deposition on the active carbon-supported catalysts. The HDO reaction led to improvement in the fuel properties of crude bio-oil. The water content, acidity, viscosity and oxygen content decreased via de-moisturization, i.e., dehydration, as well as dehydroxylation, resulting in an increase in heating value. The heavy oil obtained from HDO with Ni/Al-SBA-15 exhibited a low water content (9.3 wt%), while that of Ni/SBA-15 revealed a high HHV (22.8 MJ kg-1), energy efficiency (62.8%), and degree of deoxygenation (54.9%). A major factor of bio/oil instability is unstable oxygen-containing compounds, such as acetic acid, furfural, vanillin and levoglucosan, which were obviously reduced in the heavy oil in this study. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to carry out an updated energy Life-Cycle Assessment of soybean biodiesel produced in the Pampean region of Argentina and to analyze the influence of different tillage systems on the Energy Return on Investment (EROI). It aims to identify the processes, materials and methodological aspects that significantly affect biofuel EROI. The procedure considers the main processes and operations of both the agriculture and industrial stages of biofuel production system, but the main novelty of this study is linking EROI with farming and conservation practices and not in the chemical processing of the oil. The results obtained represent the current average energetic performance of soy-based biodiesel produced in the considered region. The EROI values are very encouraging, demonstrating that this biodiesel provides a net energy gain. The results also show that conservation agriculture and the implementation of practices that improve crop yield do not always determine better energetic performance. Sensitivity analysis confirms that EROI values of soybean biodiesel are more responsive to methodological choices such as the system's boundary definition and the choice of the allocation method rather than to the physical aspects of the productive system such as tillage and water management practices. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Global concern over rising greenhouse gas emission levels and the availability of fossil fuels has led to the development of biofuels, and the use of gasoline formulations with oxygenated compounds has become common practice for improving fuel quality. This empirical study evaluated the effects of oxygenated gasoline fuel blends on air quality. Tests were conducted on a four-stroke, four-cylinder multi-point fuel injection (MPFI) spark ignition (SI) engine using an eddy current dynamometer to investigate the combustion and emissions behaviour of n-butanol blends. Blends comprising n-butanol (N10, N20, and N30) and unleaded gasoline were tested over a rotational speed range of 1400 rpm–2800 rpm under a constant load of 20 Nm. The results obtained indicate that use of n-butanol blends produced lower hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) levels than unleaded gasoline but nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions were found to be higher. When ignition timing was retarded, NOx emissions for all n-butanol blends decreased. The peak in-cylinder pressures and heat release rates for the blends were also found to be higher than for unleaded gasoline (UG). COVIMEP of gasoline was higher than that of n-butanol/gasoline blends. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Today, as a results of diminishing fuel resources and increasing environmental pollution, various biofuels such as biodiesel have been considered as alternatives to their respective fossil-oriented fuels. The present study was focused on assessing the impacts of different water inclusion rates, (i.e., 3, 5 and 7 wt%) into B5 at different injection timings. Emission characteristics of the emulsified fuel blends were analyzed using a single cylinder diesel engine at different engine loads. The findings obtained showed that the lowest level of water included in the emulsion fuels, i.e., 3% and advancing injection timing led to the most favorable HC emission reduction compared with neat B5 and neat diesel. The results of the present study also revealed that by increasing water inclusion rate into B5, NOx emission could be increasingly reduced. Moreover, retarding injection timing intensified NOx emission reductions. © Medwell Journals, 2017.

AB  - An exploration of biodiesel preparation from nontraditional oil is one of the efficacious practice to answer a finite amount of raw materials of higher expenses. The main aim of this study is to upgrade the reaction process parameters (lauric acid to methanol molar ratio, reaction temperature, reaction time and % (w/w) PE-Si catalyst loading) for the preparation of fuel grade esters (methyl laureate) derived from lauric acid. Therefore, in the present work, a silica anchored sulfonic acid mediated polyol (PE-Si) composite was prepared via chloro-sulfonation of pentaerythritol and employed as an environmentally benign catalyst for single step conversion of lauric acid to fuel grade esters via esterification reaction. The PE-Si composite was evaluated by FT-IR, XRD, TPD-NH3, SEM, TGA-DTA and BET surface area analysis. Whereas, the synthesized methyl laureate (ML) was clearly evaluated by FT-IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Besides, fuel properties of fuel grade esters were measured and compared with ASTM fuel standards. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Previous studies worldwide have suggested the potential role of bioaerosols as ice-nuclei and cloud-condensation nuclei. Furthermore, their participation in regulating the global carbon cycle urges systematic studies from different environmental conditions throughout the globe. Towards this through one-year study, conducted from June 2015–May 2016, we report on atmospheric abundance and variability of viable bioaerosols, organic carbon (OC) and particles number and deduced mass concentrations from Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP; at Kanpur). Among viable bioaerosols, the highest concentrations of Gram-positive bacteria (GPB), Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) and Fungi were recorded during December–January (Avg.: 189 CFU/m3), November (244 CFU/m3) and September months (188 CFU/m3), respectively. Annual average concentration of GPB, GNB and Fungi were 105 ± 58, 144 ± 82 and 116 ± 51 CFU/m3. Particle number concentration (PNC) associated with fine-fraction aerosols (FFA) predominates throughout the year. However, mineral dust (coarser particle) remains a perennial constituent of atmospheric aerosols over the IGP. Temporal variability records and significant positive linear relationship (p &lt; 0.05) of GPB and GNB with OC and biomass burning derived potassium (K+ BB) indicates their association with massive emissions from paddy-residue burning (PRB) and bio-fuel burning. Influence of meteorological parameters on viable bioaerosols abundance has been rigorously investigated herein. Accordingly, ambient temperature seems to be more affecting the bacteria (anti-correlation), whereas wet-precipitation (1–4 mm) relates to higher abundance of Fungi. High abundance of GNB during large-scale biomass burning emissions has implications to endotoxin exposure on human health. Field-based data-set of bioaerosols, OC, PNC and deduced mass concentrations reported herein could serve to better constraint their role in human health and climate relevance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A numerical simulation has been carried out in this work to evaluate the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of a compression ignition engine using different biodiesel-alcohol blends as fuels. A single cylinder, four stroke, naturally aspirated, direct injection diesel engine is chosen for the simulation work using the commercial software Diesel-RK. The effects of two alcohols, namely ethanol and methanol addition to palm stearin biodiesel have been separately investigated and compared. The predicted results show slightly higher brake specific fuel consumption as well as brake thermal efficiency with biodiesel-alcohol blends compared to neat biodiesel. An effective reduction of NOx emission is also observed with the biodiesel-alcohol blends. However, the instantaneous heat release rate, ignition delay, PM and smoke emission are found to be more with alcohol blended fuels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae are gaining popularity as a source of biodiesel. Recycling fertilizer nutrients is critical to sustain large-scale biodiesel production because the global supply of surplus fertilizer is limited. This study demonstrates that anaerobic digestion of residual algal biomass from biodiesel production can provide additional nutrients and energy. Anaerobic digestion of Chlorella sorokiniana 1412 whole cell algae (WCA), sonicated algae (SA), and SA subjected to lipid extraction (LEA) in bench-scale batch reactors operated at 30 ± 2 °C for 42 days released a considerable amount of the nitrogen and phosphorus in the algal cells. Digestion of WCA, SA, LEA released 48.1, 77.4, and 61.5% of the total algal nitrogen as NH4 +-N, and 87.7, 99.4, and 93.6% of the total algal P as soluble P, respectively. The energy recovery from algae biomass was quantified through the methane yield. The biochemical methane potential of WCA, SA and LEA was 0.298, 0.388 and 0.253 L methane per gram algal volatile solids, respectively. The conversion of LEA and WCA biomass to methane was very similar (38 and 41% on a COD basis, respectively), indicating that the energy yield was not significantly lowered by extraction of the lipid fraction (which accounted for 9% of algal dry weight). Sonication improved the access of hydrolytic enzymes to algal biopolymers (compensating in part for the energy lost due to lipid extraction). The results taken as a whole indicate that anaerobic digestion of LEA can provide considerable yields of methane and soluble nutrients. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Diisopropyl ketone (DIPK) is a promising biofuel candidate, which is produced using endophytic fungal conversion. In this work, a high temperature detailed combustion kinetic model for DIPK was developed using the reaction class approach. DIPK ignition and pyrolysis experiments were performed using the UCF shock tube. The shock tube oxidation experiments were conducted between 1093 K and 1630 K for different reactant compositions, equivalence ratios (φ = 0.5–2.0), and pressures (1–6 atm). In addition, methane concentration time-histories were measured during 2% DIPK pyrolysis in argon using cw laser absorption near 3400 nm at temperatures between 1300 and 1400 K near 1 atm. To the best of our knowledge, current ignition delay times (above 1050 K) and methane time histories are the first such experiments performed in DIPK at high temperatures. Present data were used as validation targets for the new kinetic model and simulation results showed fair agreement compared to the experiments. The reaction rates corresponding to the main consumption pathways of DIPK were found to have high sensitivity in controlling the reactivity, so these were adjusted to attain better agreement between the simulation and experimental data. A correlation was developed based on the experimental data to predict the ignition delay times using the temperature, pressure, fuel concentration and oxygen concentration. © 2016 The Combustion Institute

AB  - The synergistic atomic ratio, NiNi+Mo, of the NiMo/γ-Al2O3 reduced catalysts was investigated for the transformation of natural triglycerides into green diesel. A series of catalysts with different atomic ratios 0 ≤ NiNi+Mo ≤ 1 and constant atomic surface density (Mo + Ni) = 4 atoms/nm2 was prepared and characterized using adsorption–desorption isotherms, XRD, SEM-EDS, XPS and H2-TPR. The catalysts were evaluated in the selective deoxygenation of sunflower oil performed by hydrotreatment using a semi-batch reactor. For comparison, two additional NiMo/γ-Al2O3 sulphided catalysts were synthesized and tested. The most active reduced catalyst was also tested in the selective deoxygenation of waste cooking oil. MoO3/MoOx (Mo oxidation number between 5 and 4) and Ni0, NiO, NiAl2O4 phases very well dispersed on the support surface and uniformly distributed on the catalysts extrudates have been detected in all cases. The high dispersion of these phases does not practically disturb the texture of the support which exhibits a single peak pore volume distribution centered at about 8–9 nm. The Ni, Mo composition of the catalysts somehow affects the relative amounts of these phases of the same element. It was found that the aforementioned NiNi+Mo ratio is located at about 0.8. This is very different to that of the sulphided catalysts which is located at about 0.3 for both the hydrodesulphurization of petroleum fractions and the selective deoxygenation of sunflower oil. An impressive increase of the% yield to hydrocarbons in the diesel range by a factor of 4.77 was achieved by a simple change of the NiNi+Mo atomic ratio in the NiMo/γ-Al2O3 reduced catalysts from 0.3 to 0.8. A complete transformation of both sunflower oil and waste cooking oil into hydrocarbons in the diesel range was obtained over the most active catalyst at 310 °C, hydrogen pressure 40 bar, reactant volume to catalyst mass ratio equal to 10 ml/g and reaction time equal to 5 h. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The replacement of diet soybean meal protein with crambe cake protein (0%, 22%, 44% and 66%) was investigated to evaluate the effect on lamb performance and meat quality, as well as the extent to which erucic acid was incorporated into the meat. The inclusion of increasing levels of crambe cake resulted in poorer lamb performance, as demonstrated by a linear decrease in final liveweight and carcass weight. There was also an increase in plasma blood concentrations of aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase, indicating hepatic injury. Reduced ether extract concentration of meat was observed, leading to higher shear-force values and a linear decrease in meat luminosity. The fatty acid profile of meat was drastically modified, presenting a reduction in total saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations, particularly in the concentration of α-linoleic acid. Additionally, the total monounsaturated fatty acid concentration in meat decreased, while the concentration of erucic acid increased from 0.11% of total fatty acids in Longissimus lumborum samples from lambs fed diets with no inclusion of crambe cake, to 3.70%, 5.82% and 8.04% of total fatty acids in those from lambs fed diets where 22%, 44% and 66%, respectively, of the soybean meal protein was replaced with crambe cake protein. Therefore, the concentration of erucic acid in fatty acid profile of meat was higher than concentration deemed safe for human consumption. © CSIRO 2017.

AB  - In light of the availability of low-cost methane (CH4) derived from natural gas and biogas along with increasing concerns of the greenhouse gas emissions, the production of alternative liquid biofuels directly from CH4 is a promising approach to capturing wasted energy. A novel biorefinery concept integrating biological conversion of CH4 to microbial lipids together with lipid extraction and generation of hydrocarbon fuels is demonstrated in this study for the first time. An aerobic methanotrophic bacterium, Methylomicrobium buryatense capable of using CH4 as the sole carbon source was selected on the basis of genetic tractability, cultivation robustness, and ability to accumulate phospholipids in membranes. A maximum fatty acid content of 10% of dry cell weight was obtained in batch cultures grown in a continuous gas sparging fermentation system. Although phospholipids are not typically considered as a good feedstock for upgrading to hydrocarbon fuels, we set out to demonstrate that using a combination of novel lipid extraction methodology with advanced catalyst design, we could prove the feasibility of this approach. Up to 95% of the total fatty acids from membrane-bound phospholipids were recovered by a two-stage pretreatment method followed by hexane extraction of the aqueous hydrolysate. The upgrading of extracted lipids was then demonstrated in a hydrodeoxygeation process using palladium on silica as a catalyst. Lipid conversion in excess of 99% was achieved, with a full selectivity to hydrocarbons. The final hydrocarbon mixture is dominated by 88% pentadecane (C15H32) based on decarbonylation/decarboxylation and hydrogenation of C16 fatty acids, indicating that a biological gas-to-liquid fuel (Bio-GTL) process is technically feasible. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - This paper shows the environmental and economic efficiency of biogas. An analysis of the prospects for world energy development shows a marked shift of priority issues in a comprehensive assessment of the possible side effects of the impact of major sectors of energy on the environment, the life and health of the population. Energy conservation measures and environmental security are aimed at increasing the use of CHP and renewable energy sources. The main advantages of CHP are: low cost of energy, low return on investment, the ability to quickly build, and reducing environmental pollution. The main advantage of renewable energy sources is the use of the inexhaustible source of energy, such as solar, wind and biofuels. The paper discusses the various sources of energy capacity of 1 MW mini-thermal power station with diesel, gas piston and turbine engines, as well as renewable energy-generation plant with a gas-piston engines running on biogas, solar and wind power. It was found that all sources participate in the emission of greenhouse gases. Gas turbine engines emit more greenhouse gases than other motors. The most environmentally friendly way to produce electricity is solar panels. This paper shows the environmental and economic efficiency of biogas in the brewery. The article used the standard method for determination of greenhouse gas emissions through the levels. Calculations for natural gas and biogas were made. The results of the calculations showed that the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion of natural gas and biogas in the boilers reduced. The efficiency of co-combustion of these fuels was determined.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable substitute to conventional diesel and offers cleaner performance. This paper deals with performance characteristics of four stroke, water cooled Compression Ignition (CI) engine fuelled with four different oils: diesel, diesel-punnai oil biodiesel 10% (B10), diesel-punnai oil biodiesel 20% (B20) and diesel-punnai oil biodiesel 30% (B30). The present research, experiments were conducted to study the effect of viscosity, cetane number, flash point, calorific value and density on performance characteristics of diesel, Punnai oil biodiesel and its different blends (B10, B20, B30). The experimental results of this study showed that the diesel has 2.6% and 4.6% higher brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) as compared to B10 and B20, respectively at full load, whereas BSFC of diesel was same as B30 at higher load. Volumetric efficiency and mechanical efficiency of B10 was 1.2% and 7.5% higher as compared to diesel at full load condition. Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE) and indicated thermal efficiency of B20 was 8.12% and 7% higher as compared to diesel at full load. From this study, it is concluded that Punnai oil biodiesel could be used as a viable alternative fuel in a single cylinder, four stroke, water cooled direct injection diesel engine. © 2017, PCSIR-Scientific Information Centre.

AB  - Diethyl ether (DEE) is being considered as a promising biofuel. The combustion chemistry of DEE in a fuel-rich low-pressure laminar premixed flame was studied. The laminar flame speeds of DEE iwas measured n a constant-volume chamber at elevated pressure. A new detailed kinetic model was proposed to describe the combustion of DEE in particular with respect to intermediates and pollutant formation. DEE flames yielded low concentrations of aromatic species. However high acetaldehyde emission was observed originating from the dominant pathways of DEE consumption via H-abstractions from C-α positions followed by β-scissions.

AB  - Transportation biofuel production efficiencies and cruising ranges provided by one hectare of land are studied from a life cycle perspective in the boreal climate zone. Efficient biofuel production is essential in terms of sustainability – especially land use, biodiversity and GHG emissions. Grass methane produced by anaerobic digestion and synthetic natural gas (SNG) produced from willows by gasification provide the longest cruising ranges. However, electricity production by solar panels for electric vehicles is a significantly more efficient option than biofuels. Grass methane, straw ethanol and SNG require less primary energy per produced fuel energy than other options. Increasing biofuel production for passenger cars from cultivated biomass in the boreal climate zone should be very carefully considered because electricity for transportation is significantly more efficient. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effect of various biomass derived inhibitors (i.e. furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), vanillin, 4-hydroxy benzaldehyde (4-HB) and acetate) was investigated for fatty acid accumulation in Rhodococcus sp. YHY 01. Rhodococcus sp. YHY01 was able to utilize acetate, vanillin, and 4-HB for biomass production and fatty acid accumulation. The IC50value for furfural (3.1 mM), HMF (3.2 mM), vanillin (2.0 mM), 4-HB (2.7 mM) and acetate (3.7 mM) was calculated. HMF and vanillin affect fatty acid composition and increase saturated fatty acid content. Rhodococcus sp. YHY 01 cultured with empty fruit bunch hydrolysate (EFBH) as the main carbon source resulted in enhanced biomass (20%) and fatty acid productivity (37%), in compression to glucose as a carbon source. Overall, this study showed the beneficial effects of inhibitory molecules on growth and fatty acid production, and support the idea of biomass hydrolysate utilization for biodiesel production by avoiding complex efforts to remove inhibitory compounds. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The synthesis of biodiesel using Terminalia cattapa L. (local language: Ketapang) kernel oil and ethanol has been conducted. The effect of variable parameters of synthesis includes reaction time (3-7 h), temperature (35-60°), amount of enzyme (0.1-0.3 g) and substrate molar ratio (ketapang kernel oil to ethanol, 1:1-1:3) were studied. Response surface methodology based on a five-level and four-variable central composite rotatable design were used to evaluate the interactive effects of the sinthesis parameters on the percentage yield of biodiedsel. The analysis of variance shows that the optimum conditions of the synthesis reaction were at 4.03 h of reaction time, 0.25 g of weight of enzyme, 45.04°C of temperature and 1.50 of substrate molar ratio. The actual experimental yield was 83.9% under optimum condition, which compared well to the maximum predicted value of 83.71%. © 2017 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - An experimental investigation was carried out in an automotive diesel engine with 5.59 kW rated power in order to analyse the effect of soya soap stock based acid oil biodiesel on engine's performance, combustion, and emissions characteristics at maximum torque and power conditions. The measured physico-chemical properties show the acid oil biodiesel is mainly composed of 72.3% unsaturated fatty acids and it meets the desired fuel quality for automotive diesel engine. Carbon mono oxide, unburnt hydrocarbon and Smoke emissions with acid oil biodiesel decreased significantly however oxides of nitrogen emission increased in the range from 12% to 38%. In addition to this, power output also dropped marginally and thermal efficiency decreased. The peak in-line fuel pressure and in-cylinder temperature are higher with acid oil biodiesel than base diesel. The results emerged from this study indicate the acid oil biodiesel can be a potential fuel for automotive compression ignition engines. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is a found promising alternative biofuel to popular fossil fuel because of to its renewable and biodegradable nature and thus is considered as environmentally benign. This paper reports on the synthesis of a novel heterogeneous manganese-nickel doped on sulfated zirconia catalyst (MnO-NiO-SO4 −2/ZrO2) by using simple wet impregnation method for biodiesel production from palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD). The synthesized catalyst was characterized through ammonia temperature programmed desorption (TPD-NH3), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), pyridine adsorption via FTIR, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques. The synthesized catalyst was tested for PFAD through esterification reaction where more than 97% of biodiesel yield was observed under the optimized reaction conditions of 15:1 methanol to PFAD ratio, 70 °C reaction temperature, 3 wt% catalyst loading and 3 h reaction time. The reusability of the catalyst was tested and found that it could be reused for at least five times without significant reduction in activity. Hence, the catalyst was found suitable for biodiesel production from low grade feedstock. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The development of biofuel industry in Indonesia represents the emerging phase, because of the impetus of government commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emission regulations which are decanted in President Decree No. 61 the year 2011. Indonesia has committed to reducing greenhouse gasses by 26% below 2005 levels, equivalent to 767 million tons of greenhouse gasses on their own. National Energy Policy set to blending bioethanol in premium 10% and 20% in 2020 and 2050 respectively. Potency that owned by Sumba Island, especially in east eastern Indonesia, encourages the growth of bioethanol industry regarding the availability of raw material resources and tropical climate for biofuel crop cultivation. Therefore it is necessary to analyze the feasibility of bioethanol production from potential raw materials in Sumba Island. It combines a Bayes method with financial analysis and a Strengths, Weakness, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) framework to propose the development strategy of sustainable bioethanol industry in the Sumba Island. Recommended feedstock for the development of the bioethanol industry in Sumba Island is sweet sorghum and cassava. Financial feasibility assessment of bioethanol industry is based on the assumption that at least 70% of the feedstock is supplied by the company's land and the rest comes from the farming communities. The proposed integration pattern is by integrating the ethanol industry with bio-farming and bio-manure to utilize the waste completely. The development of bioethanol industry in Sumba Island is still faced with many obstacles, including the sustainability of feedstock both for cassava and sweet sorghum, infrastructure constraints, and regulation enforcement. Alternative strategies for the development of an integrated bioethanol industry are (1) conducting intensification and extensification of agricultural land to meet the needs of raw materials, (2) promoting technological innovation and institutional innovation to accelerate the delivery and adoption bioethanol, and (3) developing bioethanol industry cluster that is supported by the infrastructure cluster.

AB  - The present research work has embarked on to exploit the novel renewable and biodegradable source of energy from lemon fruit rinds. A systematic approach has been made in this study to find the suitability of lemon peel oil for internal combustion engines and gensets applications. Extracted lemon peel oil is found to exhibit comparatively very low viscosity, flash point and boiling point than that of conventional diesel. Various blends of lemon peel oil have been prepared with conventional diesel with volumetric concentration of 20%, 40%, 50% and 100% and their physical and chemical properties are evaluated for its suitability in direct injection diesel engine. Lower cetane index of lemon peel oil significantly influences the ignition delay period and peak heat release rate that lead to the penalty in NOx emissions. Interestingly, the diesel engine performance characteristics have been improved to a remarkable level with higher proportions of lemon peel oil in the blends. In addition, the reduction of BSCO, BSHC and smoke emission is proportional to the lemon oil concentration in the blends. Overall diesel engine characteristics indicated that lemon peel oil can partially or completely replace the petroleum diesel usage to a great extent in developing countries like India. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper presents a study undertaken on a naturally aspirated, direct injection diesel engine investigating the combustion and emission characteristics of CH4-CO2and CH4-CO2-H2mixtures. These aspirated gas mixtures were pilot-ignited by diesel fuel, while the engine load was varied between 0 and 7 bar IMEP by only adjusting the flow rate of the aspirated mixtures. The in-cylinder gas composition was also investigated when combusting CH4-CO2and CH4-CO2-H2mixtures at different engine loads, with in-cylinder samples collected using two different sampling arrangements. The results showed a longer ignition delay period and lower peak heat release rates when the proportion of CO2was increased in the aspirated mixture. Exhaust CO2emissions were observed to be higher for 60CH4:40CO2mixture, but lower for the 80CH4:20CO2mixture as compared to diesel fuel only combustion at all engine loads. Both exhaust and in-cylinder NOx levels were observed to decrease when the proportion of CO2was increased; NOx levels increased when the proportion of H2was increased in the aspirated mixture. In-cylinder NOx levels were observed to be higher in the region between the sprays as compared to within the spray core, attributable to higher gas temperatures reached, post ignition, in that region. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - This work investigates the performance of a mix of two emerging biofuels, butanol and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), in an Iveco Tector diesel engine with no aftertreatment. HVO, a possible drop-in fuel for diesel engines, features excellent combustion and emissions characteristics yet is relatively expensive, while two isomers of butanol, n-butanol and isobutanol, are less expensive oxygenated fuels with a drawback to their use in diesel engines in the form of their increased ignition delay and, on some engines, higher emissions of nitrogen oxides. Blends of 30% of either n-butanol or isobutanol into HVO had, compared to diesel fuel, resulted in a 70–80% decrease in the emissions of elemental carbon and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (cPAHs) and a moderate decrease in the emissions of nitrogen oxides, without showing an adverse effect on combustion timing, heat release rates, engine maximum torque, thermal efficiency, and other measured pollutants. Particulate matter from biodiesel, HVO, their blends with diesel fuel, and the above mentioned blends was also analysed for elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nitrated PAHs, n-alkanes and organic tracer compounds, including hopanes, steranes, and isoprenoids. n-Alkanes were the most abundant class among the analysed particulate organic compounds in emissions of all fuels. All biofuels exhibited, relative to diesel fuel, a decrease in the concentration of particulate PAHs and n-alkanes in emissions, while the concentrations of hopanes and steranes originated from lubricating oil were comparable across all fuels. Cold starts yielded about 15% higher concentrations of both particulate matter and particulate organic compounds in emissions than hot starts. The vast majority of EC and OC, studied organic compounds, and mass of PM2.5was included in the size fraction PM1. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Many studies have focused on biofuel development from non-food biomass. Second generation biofuels (2G) manufactured from waste/recycled greases and animal fats are one of the alternatives to the first generation (1G) plant oil-based biofuels. In this study, the 2G biofuel parameter dependence on waste fats’ fatty acids profile was examined. The methyl esters parameters included density, viscosity and cold filter plugging point (CFPP); and the biofuels used included waste cooking oil (WCO) and waste animal fat (WAF) obtained through low temperature one step trans-esterification process. Purified and dehydrated samples came from various batches around Poland. Each sample's animal fat content profile was obtained through gas chromatography and acid value method. The fats were transesterifcated at 60 °C with methanol 1:9 (mole/mole) and KOH 1% (m/m) catalyzer. The coefficients of reaction efficiency, viscosity as a function of temperature, density at 15 °C and cold filter plugging point were obtained. Their cause and effect dependence on fat acid's content was evaluated based on correlation coefficient (CC) values. The relative standard deviation (RSD) at 38% pointed to nonhomogeneous content of waste fats. The source of fats had no significant influence on the reaction efficiency, with 0.98 ± 0.015 kg biofuel per 1 kg of waste fat yield. The kinetic viscosity of the biofuels’ samples conformed to the EN14214 norm only with two in thirty cases. The dependence of viscosity, density and CFPP on fat acids’ profile were confirmed only for a few of studied biofuels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In cellulosic biofuel production, chemical pretreatment performed at laboratory or pilot scale, followed by mechanical refining, has been demonstrated to be effective to increase feedstock enzyme digestibility. To take the combined pretreatment process one step closer to commercialization, disk milling was performed with commercially pretreated corn stover. Dilute acid pretreated samples with combined severity factors (cSF) of 0.09 (DA09) and 0.43 (DA43) were obtained from a commercial plant. Effects of pretreatment conditions (DA09 and DA43), milling cycles (0, 3, 9, and 15) and enzyme dosages (7.8, 15.6 and 31.2 mg cellulase/g dry biomass) were evaluated. Milling improved glucose yields by 0.7 to 1.2-fold. Higher enzyme dosages enhanced sugar yields. Milling was more effective to improve glucose yields, while enzyme dosage was more effective to improve xylose yields. However, dilute acid pretreatment condition was the most important factor to increase final sugar yields compared to milling cycles and enzyme dosages. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Gas-liquid-solid packed bed reactors or trickle-bed reactors (TBRs) have been widely employed in various industrial applications such as hydrocracking, selective hydrogenation process of gas oil, wastewater treatment and so on. Since the multiphase flow in TBRs is complex, uniform liquid distribution can hardly be obtained. The liquid coverage on particles at various locations in the bed affects the overall reactor performance. In this work, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with a volume of fluid (VOF) model were employed to investigate liquid mal-distribution at the micro-level in a packed bed reactor. In this study, two different parameters (the local liquid coverage (HL) and local liquid holdup (hL)) were employed to describe liquid distribution on individual particles. The liquid distribution at different particle layers was investigated. The results revealed that the distributions for local liquid coverage and local liquid holdup were similar. The wetting efficiency and the liquid residence time decreased with increasing the voidage. In a packed bed with cylindrical particles, the capillary effect cannot be ignored in smaller channels formed between the particles, leading to higher flow resistance. It was also found that the wetting efficiency and liquid film thickness increased with an increase in the liquid velocity. Both wetting efficiency and the time required to reach steady state decreased when increasing the contact angle. The flow on particle surface could change from rivulet to film as the liquid density decreased. The newly unveiled information of local liquid holdup distribution could significantly advance the understanding of gas-liquid flow hysteresis inside packed beds, based on which the reactor performance can be further improved. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As the demand for biofuels for transportation is increasing, it is necessary to acquire technologies that will allow affordable production of biodiesel. Conventional biodiesel is mainly produced from vegetable oil by chemical transesterification, but this product has relatively low yield and is competing with agricultural land that can be used for food production. In the present study, 14 filamentous fungi were isolated from different types of soil from Al-Hassa, Saudi Arabia. Nile red staining revealed that lipid bodies were present in 6 of the 14 fungal isolates. Lipid extraction showed that 3 fungi were able to accumulate lipid >20% (wt/wt) of their dry cell mass (0.59–2.40 g/L). The profile of fatty acids revealed a high content of oleic (C18:1, n9), palmitic (C16:0) and linoleic (C18:2) acids similar to conventional vegetable oils used for biodiesel production. Isolate RY4, with the highest lipid yield was identified as Mucor circinelloides based on morphological characteristics confirmed with 18S rRNA gene sequencing. Sequence data of nucleotides were obtained from DNA sequencing submitted to GenBank [GenBank: AB916546.1]. Certain oil compounds were determined by FTIR spectroscopy. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

AB  - A series of nickel-alumina co-precipitated catalysts with varying nickel loading in the range (0–100 wt% nickel) was prepared under close control of the preparation parameters. The catalysts were characterized using nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, NH3-TPD, XRD, XPS, SEM and HRTEM. They were tested for the selective deoxygenation (SDO) of sunflower oil into hydrocarbons in the diesel range under solvent-free conditions at 310 °C and hydrogen pressure of 40 bar for various reaction times up to 9 h using a semi-batch reactor and a “volume of oil (ml)/mass of catalyst (g)” ratio equal to 100. The products were analyzed using GS and GC–MS. The preparative procedure resulted to high specific surface area mesoporous materials with nanocrystals of nickel phases in close contact with alumina nanograins, thus providing high nickel surface area. Normal-alkanes in the diesel range were produced whereas intermediate stearic acid and esters of fatty acids have been also detected. Considerable amounts of high molecular weight esters (intermediate products) are formed during SDO under solvent free conditions. Propane, ethane, methane, CO, and CO2have been also detected in the gas phase. The conversion of sunflower oil and the total yield to hydrocarbons increases with the nickel content up to the sample containing 60 wt% nickel (yield to hydrocarbons equal to 61 wt%) and then it decreases. The nickel active surface correlates very well with the total yield to hydrocarbons. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalytic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to high-value transportation petrol, jet and diesel fuels is of great importance to develop versatile renewable energy and boost the rural economy, thus it is receiving worldwide attention. However, the state-of-the-art processes still suffer from a low efficiency in yield and productivity, which hinders the progress of its commercialization. Thus, it is essential to explore the consolidated catalytic reaction and refinery process. Here we report an advanced approach/process that could continuously produce long-chain (C5-C15) ketones from lignocellulosic biomass in a cascade mode by integrating several bio- and chemical catalysis reactions/processes, which exhibits a high efficiency and stable conversion rate. This technology consolidated the acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation, palladium catalyzed alkylation and in situ product recovery, allowing the catalytic reaction to proceed consistently and smoothly. The remarkable conversion properties are mainly attributed to the excellent compatible linkage of chemical catalysis with biosynthesis and process design to stabilize the Pd catalytic reaction. This validated strategy for the rational process design and integration of chemical- and bio-catalysis offers great demonstration in producing high-value transportation biofuels derived from agricultural residues. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - The design of chemical products that satisfies customer requirements commences with the identification of desirable properties for a specific application. Molecular design techniques have been traditionally used to find the products that meet the identified properties. Conventionally, product design based on properties is done based on the assumption that property prediction models are available for the target properties. However, in many design problems encountered in industry, such prediction models may not be readily available. In this paper, we have developed a systematic framework for the design of chemical products by targeting the attributes defined by customer even if there are no property prediction models available for target properties. In addition, a methodology has been developed for the understanding of the global interactions between properties and their impact on environmental and technical performance. Different kinds of chemometric techniques have been used to define the needs of the customer in terms of physical properties. In the next step, computer aided molecular design techniques have been integrated with the data driven methodologies to design the optimum products. To illustrate the applicability of the developed framework, a case study has been discussed to design environmentally benign chemical products to satisfy property requirements of a biofuel additive. This has been achieved in conjunction with the developed property models that represent consumer defined attributes of biofuel additives. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2017.

AB  - The possible depletion of fossil fuels has created the need for alternate fuels worldwide and engine developers are prompted to investigate the viability of such fuels. Further, stringent emission norms have created the need for low emission engines. The objective of this work is to evaluate the effect of diethyl ether in biodiesel-diesel blends on the performance and emission characteristics in a Premixed Charge Compression Ignition-Direct Injection (PCCI-DI) engine. Biodiesel obtained from cotton seed oil is used for this study. PCCI-DI engine is operated with main injection and pilot injections with varying percentages of DEE along with 20% biodiesel blended with neat diesel. The emission characteristics show a discernible reduction in emissions (NOx, CO and HC) vis-a-vis biodiesel-diesel blends. Benefits like reduction in the quantum of smoke produced and improvement in Brake thermal efficiency are also noticed in specific cases. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, biodiesel production from waste cooking oil using FeCl3-modified resin as heterogeneous catalyst were investigated. Under optimised conditions of methanol/oil molar ratio of 10:1, catalyst content of 8%, reaction time of 90 °C and reaction time of 120 min, a high transesterification rate of about 92% was achieved. A comprehensive kinetic model was established for the transesterification reaction, the result illustrated that the transesterification of waste cooking oil and methanol catalysed by FeCl3-modified resin was confirmed for Rideal model, and the transesterification reaction was verified for the first order reaction controlled by the interfacial chemical reaction diffusion. The main physical–chemical properties of biodiesel met the ASTM D-6751 (American Society for Testing and Materials D-6751) standard. Compared with concentrated sulfuric acid catalyst, the eminent characteristics of reusability and operational stability made the resin catalyst more ascendant for biodiesel production. The results of present research showed that transesterification process catalysed by FeCl3-modified resin was an effective and low cost technology for biodiesel industry. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study attempts to estimate the economics of biogas plants in Faisalabad District and identify the factors affecting the adoption of biogas technology. The key stakeholders of the biogas plant are farmers. Primary data from 160 respondents having biogas plants of 4 m3, 6 m3, 8 m3, 10 m3, 15 m3, 20 m3and 25 m3from villages in Faisalabad was collected through stratified random sampling, using questionnaires. A benefit-cost ratio (BCR) is employed to estimate the financial benefits. A Logit model is used to analyze the factors affecting adoption of biogas plants. Results showed that BCR values are greater than 1 for biogas plants of all sizes. The most feasible size for a plant is 10 m3because it fulfills the cooking needs of an average family. However, small farmers with plant size of 4 m3benefit more than large farmers. Moreover, biogas adoption is not only financially feasible but environment-friendly as well. We conclude that biogas technology can be popularized by developing effective motivation strategies such as awareness through public service advertizing, through print and electronic media and by adoption of models of biogas plants best suited to the conditions of rural people in Pakistan. This further highlights the demand for the required policy framework to promote such renewable energy adoption technologies by local government and agricultural institutions, researchers, and policy makers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The etherification of glycerol with isoamylenes has been studied employing twelve catalytic ion-exchange resins in order to establish the basis for a novel green process coming from this renewable source. Two compositionally different experimental approaches to transform glycerol in biodiesel additives were considered i.e. using glycerol (G), tert-amyl alcohol (TAA) and/or isoamylenes (IA) in variable molar ratios. Reactions were carried out in a stainless steel batch minireactor at temperatures between 313 and 348 K, autogenous pressure to 1.5 MPa and 1–24 h reaction time. The influence of initial molar ratio of reactants, temperature, pressure, reaction time and the catalyst employed were evaluated to optimise the process and attain the maximum conversion of glycerol. Optimization of mixtures of glycerol with TAA resulted in maximum glycerol conversion attaining 51% whilst greater glycerol conversions close to 70% were achieved using mixtures of glycerol/isoamylenes/tert-amyl alcohol. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The optimal use of biomass from a global warming mitigation perspective depends upon numerous factors, including competition for land and other constraints. The goal of this study is identifying optimal uses of domestic biomass resources for the case of Denmark, with the objectives of minimizing global warming contribution and fossil energy resource consumption. For this purpose, consequential life cycle assessment of the different options for biomass was performed. Optimal solutions were identified, given specific national environmental targets, using linear programming. Results highlighted that utilizing the energy potential of manure and straw represents the primary opportunity for further global warming mitigation. For this purpose, co-digestion (for manure) and combustion with heat-and-power production (for straw) appear as the most promising technologies. The utilization of biomass (or biogas) for electricity/heat is generally preferred, as long as coal/oil is still used within the energy system. Yet, to fulfill environmental targets for renewable energy in the transport sector, the diversion of a significant share of biogas (and/or other biofuels) from these more beneficial uses is necessary. To completely phase out coal/oil, additional biomass (to current domestic resources) must be included, either through domestic energy crops cultivation or biomass/biofuel import; alternatively, natural gas could be used. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ternary blends of pentanol, butanol and soybean oil are investigated and compared to binary blends of pentanol/soybean oil and butanol/soybean oil. Ternary blends are examined in an effort to create more intense and longer lasting puffing events and microexplosions, with the overall goal of increasing reaction rates and improving combustion of heavy bio-oils. Several blend ratios were tested for the ternary mixture. All the blends tested exhibit significant puffing events. The size of puffing event is closely linked to the amount of secondary atomization that occurs and therefore the overall shortening of reaction time. An equivolume blend of pentanol, butanol and soybean oil exhibits the most violent microexplosions and leads to the shortest reaction time. A hypothesis is suggested for the difference in combustion behavior between binary and ternary fuel blends. © 2017

AB  - The ability to in situ upgrade pyrolysis biofuels, together with the production of a value-added byproduct from the solid biomass residue, would reduce the economic and environmental costs of the integrated biorefinery. In the present work, biomass samples (mango pits and pineapple plants) were immersed in Fuller's Earth (bentonite clay) suspensions. Pyrolysis at low temperatures (290–350 °C) showed that the incorporation of Fuller's Earth into both biomasses increases the amount of H2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6evolved as compared to raw biomass. The biomasses’ behavior diverges in terms of bio-oil and biochar quality. For mango pit, pretreatment with Fuller's Earth increased desirable compounds such as furans and hexanes, whereas for pineapple plant oxygenated and high molecular weight compounds increased with pretreatment. While surface areas of both biomasses increased with incorporation of bentonite clay, the mango pit saw a significant increase in adsorption capacity and rate of methylene blue removal from water, whereas the pineapple plant adsorption rate decreased with pretreatment; capacity increased at low pyrolysis temperature and decreased at high temperature. While incorporation of Fuller's Earth increased the thermal energy required to heat the impregnated mixtures to pyrolysis temperature, a distributed activation energy model analysis shows that activation energy of pyrolysis was virtually the same for impregnated and raw biomass samples, suggesting that this may be either a thermally catalytic or chemically catalytic effect. Thus, incorporation of bentonite into some biomasses may represent positive benefits in terms of in situ upgrading bio-fuels and hybrid biochars produced at lower pyrolysis temperatures. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Continuous hydrothermal liquefaction (CHTL) of lignocellulosic biomass with subsequent hydrotreating is carried out to study the effect of NH3versus NaOH as alkaline HTL catalyst. Product analysis include Py-GCxGC–MS, simulated distillation and fractional distillation. Ammonia enhances biocrude quality slightly in terms of H/C ratio, density and HHV, but a significant coke formation of 11 wt.% is observed. Furthermore, ammonia pollutes the biocrude with 2.7 wt.% nitrogen, which is observed to inhibit hydrotreating conversion. In comparison, CHTL with NaOH is associated with a 43 wt.% yield of a hydrotreatable biocrude, stable TOC levels during aqueous phase recirculation and mass, carbon and energy balance closure. Hydrotreating eliminates the TAN, reduces oxygen to 2–3 wt.% and produces a promising fuel bio-blendstock with ultra-low sulphur and a diesel fraction equal to 43%. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, Waste cooking oil (WCO) biodiesel with Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and n-butanol additive was used in a diesel engine and its effects on engine performance and exhaust emissions were studied. The biodiesel produced from waste cooking oil by transesterification process, Methanol, sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) catalyst were used in the reaction. Engine performance test were conducted with blends (B0, B20, B30, B40, and B100) and the results showed that, B30 is the superior blend among other biodiesel blends. Further to improve the performance characteristics of B30, antioxidants of BHT 2000 ppm and n-butanol 20% by volume was added in the B30 blend. The results of BSFC for the B30 + BHT is 7.3% higher whereas the BTE is 4.6% lower than diesel due to the lower heating value of biodiesel. The heat release rate of B20, B40 and B30 + BHT are almost synchronous to diesel fuel, alongside at higher loads B30+n-butanol shows 37.5% less CO emission and 9% higher NOxemission was observed when compared to diesel fuel. WCO bio diesel and its blends with BHT and n-butanol can be used as a fuel in diesel engine. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This research studies the influence of oxygenated fuels on transient and steady-state engine performance and emissions using a fully instrumented, 6-cylinder, common rail turbocharged compression ignition engine. Beside diesel, the other tested fuels were based on waste cooking biodiesel (primary fuel) with triacetin (highly oxygenated additive). A custom test was designed for this study to investigate the engine performance and emissions during steady-state, load acceptance and acceleration operation modes. Furthermore, to study the engine performance and emissions during a whole transient cycle, a legislative cycle (NRTC), which contains numerous discrete transient modes, was utilised. In this paper, the turbocharger lag, engine power, NOx, PM, PN and PN size distribution were investigated. During NRTC the brake power, PM and PN decreased with fuel oxygen content. During steady-state operation, compared to diesel, the oxygenated fuels showed lower indicated power, while they showed higher values during acceleration and turbocharger lag. During acceleration and load increase modes, NOx, PM and PN peaked over the steady-state counterpart, also, the accumulation mode count median diameter moved toward the larger particle sizes. Increasing the fuel oxygen content increased the indicated specific NOx and PN maximum overshoot, while engine power, PM, PN and PM maximum overshoot decreased. Also, the accumulation mode count median diameter moved toward the smaller particle sizes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant renewable resource and can be efficiently converted into bio-energy by a bio-refinery. From the various techniques available for biomass thermo-chemical conversion; microwave assisted pyrolysis (MAP) seems to be the very promising. The principles of microwave technology were reviewed and the parameters for the efficient production of bio-oil using microwave technology were summarized. Microwave technology by itself cannot efficiently produce high quality bio-oil products, catalysts are used to improve the reaction conditions and selectivity for valued products during MAP. The catalysts used to optimize MAP are revised in the development of this article. The origins for bio-oils that are phenol rich or hydrocarbon rich are reviewed and their experimental results were summarized. The kinetics of MAP is discussed briefly in the development of the article. Future prospects and scientific development of MAP are also considered in the development of this article. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

Characterizations suggest that PD-En-SO3H possess abundant mesoporosity, high BET surface area (369.00 m2/g) and high acidity (2.10 mmol/g). The catalytic activity was investigated for biodiesel (BD) production by esterification of various free fatty acids (FFAs) and synthesis of levulinate esters (BD additive) from fructose. The effects of reaction conditions such as reaction temperature, reaction time, molar ratio of methanol to oil and catalyst amount on conversion of oleic acid were also explored. Interestingly, PD-En-SO3H showed excellent catalytic performance, which was more active than commercial Amberlyst 15 and Nafion NR50. Moreover, it could be reused for four times and still maintained high catalytic activity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - High percentages of biodiesel blends or neat biodiesel cannot be used in diesel engines due to high density and viscosity, and poor atomization properties that lead to some engine operational problems. Biodiesel was produced from canola oil by transesterification process. Test fuels were prepared by blending 80% of the biodiesel with 20% of kerosene (B80&K20) and 80% of the biodiesel with 10% of kerosene and 10% diesel fuel (B80&K10&D10). Fuels were used in a 4 cylinders diesel engine that was loaded with a generator. Combustion, performance and emission characteristics of the blend fuels and D2 in the diesel engine for certain loads of 3.6, 7.2 and 10.8 kW output power and 1500 rpm constant engine speed were experimented and deeply analyzed. It was found that kerosene contained blends had quite similar combustion characteristics with those of D2. Mass fuel consumption and Bscf were slightly increased for blend fuels. HC emissions slightly increased while NOx emissions considerably reduced for blends. It was resulted that high percentages of biodiesel can be a potential substitute for diesel fuel provided that it is used as blending fuel with certain amounts of kerosene. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The performance of a biodiesel system can be affected by varied risk factors. The numbers of such risk factors are large and their interdependencies are vague and complex. The purpose of this study is to define relationships among such risk factors and integrate them with an objective risk analysis approach. In the present study, an interpretive structural modelling (ISM) approach was used to identify relationships among risk factors while a Bayesian Network (BN) approach was employed to define the strength of dependence and conduct a risk analysis. The results indicate that among 25 risk factors, operational safety is a key biodiesel performance factor. The analysis also highlights that the impacts of occupational health and natural resources depletion are strongly dependent on environmental parameters. Occupational health is also strongly dependent on plant safety. The results show that the interdependency between occupational health and natural resources depletion is weak. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As environmental policies drive to increase the renewables participation in the transportation sector, biomass-derived fuels are becoming an attractive alternative to replace, totally or partially, fossil ones. Taking into account the sustainability concerns about first generation biofuels, attention is paid to second generation ones. Their main drawbacks are the high CAPEX and OPEX required if high quality fuels are required as final product due to the current deployment of its technology. In this way, co-processing of biomass-derived feedstocks in oil refineries can be a good solution and can pave the way for the introduction of biofuels in the market, since it reduces environmental impacts from fossil fuels, decreases the oil dependency of countries and, the most important one, takes advantage of existing facilities avoiding the erection of new plants. In this work, the co-processing of hydrodeoxigenated pyrolysis oil (HDO-oil, from lignocellulosic biomass) with vacuum gas oil (VGO) in a FCC unit is modelled and implemented in a calculation block in MS Excel inside Aspen Plus®. 40 pseudocomponents and 10 real components are defined to represent both feedstocks and their possible cracking products. These components are used in a pseudoreaction mechanism of more than 12,000 single reactions, developed from a probabilistic reaction system. Such a large number of reactions is handled by considering key parameters for the estimation of each reaction rate constant and integrated along the riser which is modelled using a finite volume method. Tuning parameters are used to fit the model depending on the feedstock and the riser conditions, and have to be estimated using experimental data. Thereby, the kinetic reactor model allows to work with different feedstocks and conditions. Material, heat and hydrodynamic balances are performed in all volume elements of the modelled riser reactor, which results in a composition and temperature profiles along the riser. The model is validated with experimental data, showing a low relative error. Therefore, this model can be used to predict product yields, according to different feedstocks and experimental conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study focuses on investigating the optimized chemical composition of biochar used as porous material for biodiesel synthesis via pseudo-catalytic transesterification. To this end, six biochars from different sources were prepared and biodiesel yield obtained from pseudo-catalytic transesterification of waste cooking oil using six biochars were measured. Biodiesel yield and optimal reaction temperature for pseudo-catalytic transesterification were strongly dependent on the raw material of biochar. For example, biochar generated from maize residue exhibited the best performance, which yield was reached ∼90% at 300 °C; however, the maximum biodiesel yield with pine cone biochar was 43% at 380 °C. The maximum achievable yield of biodiesel was sensitive to the lignin content of biomass source of biochar but not sensitive to the cellulose and hemicellulose content. This study provides an insight for screening the most effective biochar as pseudo-catalytic porous material, thereby helping develop more sustainable and economically viable biodiesel synthesis process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The ability to carry out pyrolysis of entire wood chips and rods instead of small particles would be of great value for mobile pyrolysis units, because of the large possible savings in grinding costs (7–9% of total process costs). With this goal in mind, we designed and constructed a novel lab-scale ablative reactor for fast pyrolysis of entire wood chips and even wood rods, converting those directly into a high yield of bio-oil for the first time. The bio-oil yield from fast pyrolysis of wood chips (10 × 20 mm) was as high as 60 wt.%, similar to that from wood crumbles (2 × 2 mm). Additionally, the yield and composition of bio-oil from ablative pyrolysis were in the same range as those obtained from a fluidized bed reactor using <1 mm particles, with the small differences (slightly lower yield and HHV, and higher water content) attributed to the longer vapor residence times in the ablative reactor, which promote secondary reactions. We modeled the heat transfer characteristics of this semi-batch system, and comparison with experimental measurements confirmed that radiation from the hot components does not significantly decompose the wood prior to direct contact with the hot metallic surface in ablative pyrolysis. The findings of this work have the potential to lead to new developments for small-scale, mobile pyrolysis units for the disposal of forest residues. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The current study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant efficiency of different extracts of corn silk. In addition, the impact of corn silk extract on oxidative stability of neem biodiesel during storage was studied. The highest phenolics, DPPH radical scavenging and reducing power activities were recorded for methanolwater extract. The longest oxidation stability (10 h) was observed for biodiesel samples blended with 1000 ppm of corn silk extract (CSE). At the end of storage period the induction time of biodiesel samples mixed with 1000 ppm of CSE or butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) were about 6.72 and 5.63 times as high as in biodiesel samples without antioxidants. Biodiesel samples blended with 1000 ppm of CSE had the lowest acidity at the end of storage period. Peroxide value of biodiesel samples containing 1000 ppm of CSE was about 4.28 times as low as in control sample without antioxidants. © 2017 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - Ethanol demand depends on the crude oil price and domestic biofuel mandate, but the aggregate effect on consumer fuel choices and export demand is uncertain. The relationship between crude oil and ethanol price is complex, and the presence of policy driven domestic biofuel use (mandate) make the modeling of the world ethanol market challenging. A structural economic multi-market multi-region partial equilibrium model considering the complementary and substituting effects between gasoline and ethanol demand is developed. In this study, a kinked ethanol demand curve that reflects those relationships is used to depict ethanol demand. We further simulate two forward-looking alternative crude oil price scenarios to identify how the crude oil price interacts with ethanol use mandates and trace the consequences on the U.S. Renewable Identification Number (RIN) market. The study finds that, under high crude oil prices, the substitution effect might trigger a large increase in ethanol demand by the rest of the world and the U.S. and Brazil will be the key ethanol exporting countries. In the U.S., the overall biofuel mandate might become non-binding. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The oxidation of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF) has been experimentally studied in a rapid compression machine. The ignition delays of stoichiometric 2-MTHF/O2/inert mixtures were measured for a wide range of conditions: Top dead center pressure ranging from 0.3 to 2.1 MPa and core gas temperatures between 640 K and 900 K. Two-stage ignition is observed for temperatures between 685 K and 790 K, leading to a deviation from Arrhenius behavior of the evolution of ignition delays with temperature. Sampling of the reacting mixture was performed for different times between the top dead center and the ignition. Stable reaction intermediates were separated by gas chromatography, identified by mass spectrometry and quantified with a flame ionization detector. More than 20 species were identified and used to identify major reaction pathways. Among species of importance, 2-methyl-dihydrofurans, 2-methylfuran, methyldihydrofuranones, 1-cyclopropanylethanone, 3-penten-2-one and methylvinylketone were detected. Mole fraction profiles were obtained and used alongside first stage and total ignition delays to validate a detailed kinetic model for the oxidation of 2-MTHF. The resulting model takes in account 507 species involved in 2425 reactions. The validity of this model was extended to the high temperature range using existing ignition delays and low pressure laminar flame speciation data. © 2017 The Combustion Institute

AB  - Availability of abiotic resources has been a topic of concern in recent years, resulting in several approaches being published to determine their availability on country and product level. However, the availability of biotic materials has not been analyzed to this extent yet. Therefore, an approach to determine possible limitations to availability of terrestrial biotic materials over the entire supply chain is introduced. The approach considers 24 categories overall as well as associated category indicators for the five dimensions: physical, socio-economic, abiotic, social and environmental constraints. This ensures a comprehensive availability assessment of bio-based product systems. The approach is applied to a case study comparing biodiesel produced from rapeseed and soy beans. The study shows that the determination of indicator values is feasible for most categories and their interpretation leads to meaningful conclusions. Thus, the approach leads to a more comprehensive assessment of availability aspects and supports better informed decision making in industry and policy. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Taking forest biomass, defined here as roundwood pulpwood, as feedstock, this study focused on locating bioethanol facilities and designing the bioethanol feedstock supply chain to minimize the total system cost. For this purpose an integrated approach combining Geographic Information System based analysis with optimization modeling method was developed. Nine candidate bioethanol facilities were preselected based on the GIS method and served as input for the optimization modeling followed. The total system cost and the delivered feedstock cost were calculated under demand and supply uncertainties. Both cost values increase significantly as the annual bioethanol demand grows or the biomass availability decreases. This is because more feedstocks are required to be hauled from longer distances to support a larger scale bioethanol facility or several smaller ones. It is also found that Gaylord shows up as one of the optimized candidate no matter what the demand or supply is. The optimization model and identified locations provides decision makers an integrated decision support system to determine optimized cost, energy use, and GHG emissions for candidate locations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa L.) is an oilseed with potential for use as a raw material in second-generation biofuels. Camelina has a seed yield of up to 2380 kg·ha-1 and contains around 45% fatty acids. Selection of a suitable site is critical for production optimization. The objective of this study was to determine Chilean agro-climatic suitability for establishing camelina as a productive alternative. Climate and soil requirements and geographical restraints were evaluated for the species, considering the climatological characteristics of its regions of origin, as well as regions where camelina is successfully grown in the rest of the world. The variables considered included factors (maximum temperatures of the warmest month, water deficits, and degree days) and limitations (altitude, geomorphology, and current land use), which permitted the evaluation of the national territory for a certain level of suitability. It was determined that 1.3% of the national territory (960,664 ha) has some degree of suitability for camelina adoption. Between the Biobío and Los Lagos regions, 49.0% of the land (471,203 ha) is in the category of no thermic restrictions, with mild water restrictions, and mild soil restrictions or without information, which can be used for camelina production. The Los Ríos region has 21.4% surface area (321,176 ha) with some level of suitability for camelina, the most suitable region to establish this crop in Chile. This research has provided valuable information applicable to new species and geographic areas which facilitate the adaptation of agricultural and forestry production to global changes. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Hydrogen produced by renewable sources represents an interesting way to reduce the energetic dependence on fossil fuels in the transportation sector. This paper shows a feasibility study for the production, storage and distribution of hydrogen in the western Sicilian context, using three different renewable sources: wind, biomass and sea wave. The objective of this study is the evaluation of the hydrogen demand, needed to replace all diesel supplied buses with electrical buses equipped with fuel cells. An economic analysis is presented with the evaluation of the avoidable greenhouse gas emissions. Four different scenarios correlate the hydrogen demand for urban transport to the renewable energy resources present in the territories and to the modern technologies available for the production of hydrogen. The study focuses on the possibility of tapping into the potential of renewable energies (wind, biomass and sea wave) for the production of hydrogen by electrolysis. The use of hydrogen would reduce significantly the emissions of particulate and greenhouse gases in the urban districts under analysis. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - This paper presents a spatially explicit method for making regional estimates of the potential for biogas production from crop residues and manure, accounting for key technical, biochemical, environmental and economic constraints. Methods for making such estimates are important as biofuels from agricultural residues are receiving increasing policy support from the EU and major biogas producers, such as Germany and Italy, in response to concerns over unintended negative environmental and social impacts of conventional biofuels. This analysis comprises a spatially explicit estimate of crop residue and manure production for the EU at 250 m resolution, and a biogas production model accounting for local constraints such as the sustainable removal of residues, transportation of substrates, and the substrates' biochemical suitability for anaerobic digestion. In our base scenario, the EU biogas production potential from crop residues and manure is about 0.7 EJ/year, nearly double the current EU production of biogas from agricultural substrates, most of which does not come from residues or manure. An extensive sensitivity analysis of the model shows that the potential could easily be 50% higher or lower, depending on the stringency of economic, technical and biochemical constraints. We find that the potential is particularly sensitive to constraints on the substrate mixtures' carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and dry matter concentration. Hence, the potential to produce biogas from crop residues and manure in the EU depends to large extent on the possibility to overcome the challenges associated with these substrates, either by complementing them with suitable co-substrates (e.g. household waste and energy crops), or through further development of biogas technology (e.g. pretreatment of substrates and recirculation of effluent). © 2017 Einarsson, Persson.

AB  - This study focuses on analyzing nutrient distributions and environmental impacts of nutrient recycling, reusing, and discharging in algal biofuels production. The three biomass conversion pathways compared in this study were: hydrothermal liquefaction technology (HTL), hydrothermal hydrolysis pretreatment +HTL (HTP), and wet lipid extraction (WLE). Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous (C, N, P) flows were described in each pathway. A primary cost analysis was conducted to evaluate the economic performance. The LCA results show that the HTP reduced life cycle NOxemissions by 10% from HTL, but increased fossil fuel use, greenhouse gas emissions, and eutrophication potential by 14%, 5%, and 28% respectively. The cost of per gallon biodiesel produced in HTP was less than in HTL. To further reduce emissions, efforts should be focused on improving nutrient uptake rates in algae cultivation, increasing biomass carbon detention in hydrothermal hydrolysis, and/or enhancing biomass conversion rates in the biooil upgrading processes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this research, transesterification of waste cooking oil has been studied. The cucurbit[7]uril-protected Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40(CsPW-CB[7]) is prepared as a highly efficient catalyst for the direct biodiesel production via the transesterification of waste cooking oil. The CsPW-CB[7] is characterized by X-ray diffraction, FT-IR. Besides, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the operating parameters on the conversion rate of waste cooking oil. In addition, the maximum conversion rate could reach 95.1% under the optimum experimental conditions that are catalyst of 2 wt%, methanol/oil molar ratio of 11: 1, reaction time of 150 min and temperature of 70 °C. According to the assumption of pseudo-first order reaction, the activation energy of the reaction was calculated as 36.0 kJ mol−1, indicating the reaction is easy to react. The physicochemical properties of biodiesel product could reach the ASTM D6751 standard. The results indicated that the CsPW-CB[7] catalyst showed good catalytic performance and its excellent potential application in biodiesel production. Also, based on the coded parameters, the quadratic regression model with determined coefficients was presented. In addition, the model is significant according to the ANOVA analysis and residual plots. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The significance of this present investigation undertakes the feasibility study of a new combination of bio-fuels. For this rationale; the diesel engine operated with blends of Jatropha biodiesel and turpentine oil with a view to completely eliminate dependency on fossil fuel. Jatropha biodiesel (methyl ester) and turpentine oil is a high and low viscosity fuels combination with comparable heating values to that of diesel; this makes conducive for its use in a diesel engine. Extensive experimental work is carried out on a Kirloskar make the single cylinder, natural aspired diesel engine to examine combustion performance and emission characteristics using Jatropha methyl ester with turpentine oil blends (dual fuel blends) and conventional diesel. Dual fuel blends are found to be the best substitute to conventional diesel fuel in all aspects such as performance and emissions. Further, BT 50 resulted at full load condition, reduction of 2.9%, 4.72%, 4.56%, 42.5% and 29.16% in the brake thermal efficiency, NOx, HC, CO and smoke respectively while CO2emissions increase 10.7%. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel expansion can lead to unintended effects that offset the direct GHG benefits of biofuels. Two documented unintended effects are the indirect land use change (ILUC) and indirect energy use change (IEUC). ILUC has been included in many lifecycle GHG studies of biofuels, but IEUC has remained relatively elusive. This paper presents an updated assessment of the lifecycle GHG emissions of palm biodiesel from Malaysia and, for the first time, incorporating the two estimated indirect effects simultaneously. Future GHG emissions of palm biodiesel are projected by taking into account of Malaysia's Economic Transformation Programme (ETP) that aims to reform the oil palm industry in order to achieve a high-income nation. Uncertainties associated with lifecycle GHG models were dealt with using Monte Carlo simulation in order to identify the breadth and likelihood of GHG reductions relative to petroleum-based fuels in the context of the European directives. This study has shown that the ETP, if successfully implemented, can significantly improve the direct GHG emissions of palm biodiesel, but the benefits are offset by the rise in global emissions due to ILUC and IEUC. Biofuel policies should also include IEUC, in addition to ILUC, to avoid GHG emissions leakages. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study evaluated the impact on persistent organic pollutant (POP) emissions from a diesel engine when deploying a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) combined with an uncatalyzed diesel particulate filter (DPF), as well as fueling with conventional diesel (B2) and waste cooking oil-based (WCO-based) biodiesel blends (B10 and B20). When the engine was fueled with WCO-based biodiesel blends (B10 and B20) in combination with deploying DOC+A-DPF, their levels of the chlorine and potassium contents could not stimulate the formation of chlorinated POPs (PCDD/Fs and PCBs), although previous studies had warned that happened on diesel engines fueled with biodiesel and deployed with iron-catalyzed DPFs. In contrast, the WCO-based biodiesel with a lower aromatic content reduced the precursors for POP formation, and its higher oxygen content compared to diesel promoted more complete combustion, and thus using WCO-based biodiesel could reduce both PM2.5and POP emissions from diesel engines. This study also evaluated the impact of DPF conditions on the POP emissions from a diesel engine; that is, the difference in POP emissions before and just after the regeneration of the DPF. In comparison to the high soot-loaded DPF scenario, the regeneration of the DPF can drastically reduce the formation potential of POPs in the DPFs. An approach was developed to correct the effects of sampling artifacts on the partitioning of gas- and particle-phase POPs in the exhaust. The gas-phase POPs are highly dominant (89.7–100%) in the raw exhausts of diesel engines, indicating that the formation mechanism of POPs in diesel engines is mainly through homogeneous gas-phase formation, rather than de novo synthesis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study addresses wet in situ transesterification of microalgae for the production of biodiesel by introducing ethyl acetate as both reactant and co-solvent. Ethyl acetate and acid catalyst are mixed with wet microalgae in one pot and the mixture is heated for simultaneous lipid extraction and transesterification. As a single reactant and co-solvent, ethyl acetate can provide higher FAEE yield and more saccharification of carbohydrates than the case of binary ethanol and chloroform as a reactant and a co-solvent. The optimal yield was 97.8 wt% at 114 °C and 4.06 M catalyst with 6.67 ml EtOAC/g dried algae based on experimental results and response surface methodology (RSM). This wet in situ transesterification of microalgae using ethyl acetate doesn't require an additional co-solvent and it also promises more economic benefit as combining extraction and transesterification in a single process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Solvent-free NaOH catalyzed aldol condensation of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) and furfural with methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) was studied, producing branched C11and C12furan compounds in high yields of up to 96%. Through use of a Pd/C and Eu(OTf)3catalytic system, the condensation products of the bio-based starting materials were further hydrodeoxygenated (HDO) in one-step to biofuel compatible branched alkanes 2-methylundecane (3) and 2-methyldecane (4) in excellent yields of 90% and 98%, respectively. In the one-step HDO developed herein, the variation of solvent had a significant effect on the reaction route and degree of conversion of furans to alkanes in the HDO process. Very high overall yields of alkanes 3 (86%) and 4 (94%) were obtained starting from the biomass-based HMF and furfural. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A fully sustainable energy system for the Åland islands is possible by 2030 based on the assumptions in this study. Several scenarios were constructed for the future energy system based on various combinations of domestic production of wind and solar photovoltaic power, expanded domestic energy storage solutions, electrified transport, and strategic energy carrier trade. Hourly analysis of scenarios using the EnergyPLAN tool shows that annualised costs of operating a future sustainable energy system for the year 2030 range between 225 and 247 M€/a compared to 229 M€/a for the business as usual case. However, this result is highly dependent on how vehicle and battery costs are accounted. A scenario featuring a highly electrified transport sector, including a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic forms of mobility, was among the most cost competitive solutions due to high levels of flexibility and electric storage harnessed in the energy system. In this scenario cost reductions were achieved as high capacities of electric vehicle battery storage resulted in less need for seasonal storage and synthetic fuel production in the form of Power-to-Gas technologies and offshore wind power capacity. Results also indicate that 100% renewable energy-based domestic energy production can be achieved in Åland, with or without reliance on imported energy carriers, such as sustainable biofuels or electricity. A demonstration of a highly electrified transport sector may also offer Åland society several benefits outside of the boundaries of the energy system. New job creation related to renewable energy production on Åland could total between at least 3100 and 3900 job-years during manufacturing, construction and installation, and between 45 and 59 more permanent jobs related to operations and maintenance, depending on the scenario. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Colorless distributed combustion (CDC) is a novel method for efficient and environmentally benign cleaner energy conversion of fossil and biofuels. CDC has been investigated in different configurations and geometries, with support to seek near zero emissions, uniform thermal field, energy savings, low pressure drop, and reduced combustion noise. In this paper, distributed combustion is investigated with focus on the flame-flowfield interaction and the different quantities that affect distributed combustion. The velocity field was obtained using particle image velocimetry (PIV) with focus on mean and fluctuating quantities. The flowfield information helped differentiate between the impact of increasing Reynolds number (through air dilution) and the impact of lowering oxygen concentration (through modeled entrainment). The flowfield information was further processed to give the integral length scale at the flame boundaries. The integral length scale along with the fluctuating velocity is critical to determine turbulence Reynolds number and Damköhler number. Together these numbers identify the combustion regime at which the combustor is operating. This information clearly distinguishes between traditional swirl flames and distributed combustion and helps explain the significant benefits of distributed combustion as it operates in a well-stirred reactor regime. The results revealed that major controllers of the reaction regime are flame thickness and laminar flame speed; both are significantly impacted by lowering oxygen concentration through entrainment of hot reactive species from within the combustor, which is important in distributed combustion. Understanding the controlling factors of CDC is critical for the development and deployment of this novel method for near zero emissions from high intensity combustors and energy savings using fossil and of biofuels for sustainable energy conversion. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study we report on sulfonated graphene, obtained by chemical exfoliation of inexpensive graphite and functionalization of the resulting graphene sheets with benzene sulfonic acid, as a new active catalyst for the transesterification of palm oil with methanol into biodiesel. The experimental conditions for obtaining fatty acid methyl esters were carefully optimized through the evaluation of several parameters including the catalyst loading, temperature, reaction time and methanol-to-oil molar ratio. Of particular relevance, we noticed that an excess of methanol was required to allow high transesterification yield, but an excessive dilution proved to be deleterious for the reaction yield due to lower interactions between the reactants and the catalyst. The heterogeneous catalyst showed a high thermal robustness and was successfully recycled without significant erosion of the reaction yield. Our catalytic system yields biodiesel with a high purity (>98%) after a single filtration and do not produce aqueous waste. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel production using residual oil from palm oil mill effluent (POME) and crude lipase from oil palm fruit as the substrate and catalyst had a high biodiesel yield (92.07 ± 1.04%) under optimal conditions. POME is considered as an alternative source for oil because it contained high oil and grease content (5569.82 mg/L). Oil was extracted from POME by the soxhlet method using a mixture of hexane, methanol and acetone. Eighty percent of residual oil (4455 mg/L) was recovered from POME. Biodiesel production from crude lipase catalyst is an alternative method that is simple to perform and can be done at a low investment cost. In addition, biodiesel from residual oil using crude lipase catalyst was characterized according to ASTM standards. Most properties of biodiesel from crude lipase are acceptable, according to Thai biodiesel and ASTM standards. Low free fatty acid (0.07%) content was observed in enzymatic biodiesel. A high cloud point (10–13 °C) and cetane number (59.0–60.0) were also illustrated since a high cetane number is an important property used to qualify high quality biodiesel, POME biodiesel may possibly be used as a sole biofuel or blended with fossil fuels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study assessed the economic viability of using Miscanthus x giganteus as a feedstock for the production of bioethanol based on plant designs and models by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. In 2007 dollars, the total cost of installed equipment for a plant with an annual feedstock requirement of 701 million kg/year was $281 million, with the single largest component, cost of feedstock, contributing approximately 40% to the total. The total capital investment needed for the plant was $464 million, or $2.01 per annual liters of ethanol. The variable operating cost of the plant varied between $79 and $93 million per year, depending on the cost of feedstock. The minimum ethanol-selling price (MESP) was calculated from discount cash flow rate analysis. Changing the feedstock cost from $0.08/kg to $0.10/kg increased the MESP from $0.65/L to $0.71/L. The analysis estimated the sensitivity of the MESP to variations in the percentage of equity financing (from 0 to 100%), internal rate of return (from 10% to 20%) and federal corporate taxes (from 30% to 60%). The results of the study allow a direct comparison of the MESP for Miscanthus as opposed to corn-stover, grass straw and hybrid poplar, and provide a benchmark for future studies of economic feasibility of alternative lignocellulosic feedstocks against each other as well as against conventional gasoline and diesel fuels. © 2017

AB  - The present experimental work is focused on improving the performance and emission characteristics of biofuel blend (diesel (40 %)-biodiesel (40 %)-ethanol (20 %)) (denoted as BE). Comparative analysis was done for addition of Diethyl ether (DEE) and alumina nanoparticle (Al2O3) at various concentrations. The test fuels used are BE, BE with 25 ppm Al2O3 (denoted as BN-1), BE with 50 ppm Al2O3 (denoted as BN-2), BE with 5 % DEE (denoted as BE-1) and BE with 10 % DEE (denoted as BE-2). Experimental results indicate that, DEE addition in BE results in increased HC (Hydrocarbon), CO (Carbon monoxide), CO2 (Carbon dioxide) and BSFC (Brake specific fuel consumption) with lowered NOx (Oxides of nitrogen) and smoke emission. This is attributed to high latent heat evaporation of mixture and Low temperature combustion (LTC). Al2O3addition in BE resulted in increase in NOx and smoke with lowered HC, CO, CO2 and BSFC. This could be attributed to enhanced surface area to volume ratio of mixture during rapid combustion process, higher catalytic combustion and reduced evaporation. At higher engine loads, the peak pressure of BE-1 is highest and that of BE-2 is lowest. Peak heat release rate of BE is highest and BN-1 is lowest. BE blends with additives (Al2O3 and DEE) resulted in higher Particulate matter (PM) formation, however BN-1 blend showed lowered PM at engine loads of 75 % and 100 %. Overall, BE-1 and BN-1 reflects better engine performance, combustion and emission characteristics. © 2017, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Microalgal components were isolated gradually to get lipid-rich, protein-rich and carbohydrate-rich components. The aim of this work was to study pyrolysis mechanism of microalgae by real isolated real algae components. Thermogrametric analysis (DTG) curve of microalgae was fitted by single pyrolysis curves of protein, lipid and carbohydrate except special zones, which likely affected by cell disruption and hydrolysis mass loss. Experimental microalgae liquefaction without water index N was 0.6776, 0.3861 and 0.2856 for isolated lipid, protein and carbohydrate. Pyrolysis pathways of lipid are decarboxylation, decarbonylation, fragmentation of glycerin moieties and steroid to form hydrocarbons, carboxylic acids and esters. Pyrolysis pathways of protein are decarboxylation, deamination, hydrocarbon residue fragmentation, dimerization and fragmentation of peptide bonds to form amide/amines/nitriles, esters, hydrocarbons and N-heterocyclic compounds, especially diketopiperazines (DKPs). Pyrolysis pathways of carbohydrate are dehydrated reactions and further fragmentation to form ketones and aldehyde, decomposition of lignin to form phenols, and fragmentation of lipopolysaccharides. © 2017

AB  - Production of aviation biofuels has been strongly encouraged by the volatility of oil prices and environmental concerns. Brazilian society, companies, and government are taking a step forward in the production of renewable jet fuel from biomass feedstocks largely available in the territory. This study evaluated the use of different feedstocks (sugar crops, oil crops, and lignocellulosic biomass) for co-production of biojet fuel and higher value-added products in a biorefinery platform. The co-production of biofuels and biochemicals in a biorefinery context was demonstrated to be economically feasible. The main cost drivers of such a platform are feedstock biomass cost, selling price of the biochemicals, investment costs, and key process-inherent parameters such as conversion yields, obtained fermentable sugars, or oil content in the feedstock. Sugarcane was the most promising feedstock for a biorefinery in the region of Minas Gerais, while soybean was the most promising feedstock for a biorefinery in the region of Rio Grande do Sul, despite its higher uncertainty. Succinic acid was the most promising chemical intermediate for biopolymers industry due to its relatively high market value, unique market opportunity as a substitute of conventional petrochemicals, and forecast for future growth. Ethanol-to-jet (ETJ) and hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) were the most attractive biojet fuel production routes in the present study. Scenarios for co-production of biofuels and biochemicals in Brazil present large uncertainties and high financial risk, mainly due to the use of second-generation feedstocks, and the introduction of new technologies and products. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Castor (Ricinus communis L.) is an industrially important oilseed crop and is the only source of an unusual fatty acid, ricinoleic acid in plant species. The castor oil and its products have numerous industrial uses including biofuel; hence, the demand for castor oil is ever increasing globally. Current productivity levels in castor are inadequate to meet the requirement, which underscores the need for breeding high yielding cultivars with better adaptability by exploiting diverse genetic resources. This study reports development and characterization of a set of inbred lines derived from a core germplasm collection of castor. The panel of 144 inbreds exhibited an excellent phenotypic diversity for morpho-agronomic traits related to plant architecture and yield components. However, SSR allelic diversity appears to be only moderate. The average number of alleles per SSR locus in the genotype panel was 3.0 and mean gene diversity was 0.38. Nevertheless, a majority of the inbred pairs (77 %) had very less estimated kinship coefficients (<0.05) suggesting that they were not related by pedigree. A very low level of genetic relatedness among the genotypes and absence of population structure suggest that this genotype panel consists of ideal set of materials for association mapping studies aiming at molecular breeding of key traits in castor. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the development and characterization of a large inbred collection representing the bulk of genetic diversity in castor, which can be further exploited for genetic, physiological and molecular studies towards achieving higher productivity. © 2016, Society for Plant Biochemistry and Biotechnology.

AB  - Experimental investigations were carried out on a single cylinder diesel engine under dual fuel mode (biodiesel-simulated biogas). The pongamia pinaata biodiesel (B100) was used as pilot fuel whereas biogas composition was simulated by blending of CO2(30%, 40% and 50% by weight) in natural gas and was used as main fuel. Natural gas and CO2were injected into the engine's intake manifold using two gas injectors with individual control mechanism. The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of the engine decreases with increase in CO2content in natural gas. NOxand smoke emissions decreased significantly with the biogas-fueled engine whereas HC and CO emissions increased marginally. The combustion characteristics including heat release rate and cumulative heat release decreased with biogas. A notable point emerged from this study is the effect of CO2in natural gas on the performance, combustion and emissions characteristics of the engine are less as compared to the effect of its energy share and load. It is well established through this study that the raw biogas could be used in a biodiesel-fueled diesel engine under dual fuel mode. However, increase in CO and HC emissions needs to be reduced using suitable techniques. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Diminishing fuel resources and stringent emission mandates have demanded cleaner combustion and increased fuel efficiency. Three water addition rates, i.e., 2, 4, and 6 wt% in biodiesel-diesel blend (B5) was investigated herein. Combustion characteristics of the emulsified fuel blends were compared in a naturally-aspirated diesel engine at full load and different engine speeds. More specifically, biodiesel was produced from waste cooking oil (WCO) and to further increase waste utilization, recycled biodiesel wastewater was used as additive in B5. The result obtained showed that low-level water addition (i.e., 2 and 4 wt%) in B5 led to different results from those obtained using higher water addition rates (i.e., &gt;5 wt%) reported by the previous studies. In more details, the findings of the present study revealed that low level water addition in B5 could considerably reduce CO, HC, CO2, and NOxemissions. Among water-containing B5 fuel emulsions, the optimal water addition level in terms of engine performance parameters and emissions was found at 4 wt%. In particular, the emitted CO2, HC, and NOxwere decreased by over 8.5%, 28%, and 24%, respectively, at maximum speed of 2500 rpm. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this paper is to study a biorefinery integrated district heating (DH) and individual and central bioheating systems in an electricity intensive energy system to identify the prospects of bioenergy technologies over other conventional technologies in a long time horizon (2009–2030). The model maximises the societal welfare. Two gasification based biorefinery plants were selected: a Fischer-Tropsch (FT) biodiesel and a dimethyl ether (DME) biorefinery. A base case and three alternative scenarios with an annual 2.5% electricity and biomass price escalation rate were formulated. The results showed that a minimum of 6 €/GJ biofuel subsidy is required to initiate investments in a DME biorefinery, while a minimum of 12 €/GJ is required for FT-biodiesel biorefinery at higher energy prices. For biomass combined heat and power (CHP) competitiveness in DH, electricity price is found to be the most determining factor over biomass price. In individual and central heating, despite the high electricity tax, pellet boilers were found to be less competitive than heat pumps and electric heaters, primarily due to high pellet price. In conclusion, earmarking biomass in DH for CHP and biorefineries and heat pumps in individual, central heating and DH are found to be an optimal solution. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-butanol is typically produced by acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation, however, the recovery of bio-butanol from the ABE mixture involves high costs and energy consumption. Hence it is of interest to study the intermediate fermentation product, i.e. ABE, as a potentially alternative fuel. In this study, an experimental investigation of the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of a port fuel-injection SI engine fueled with ABE-gasoline blends was carried out. By testing different ABE-gasoline blends with varying ABE content (0 vol%, 10 vol%, 30 vol% and 60 vol% referred to as G100, ABE10, ABE30 and ABE60), ABE formulation (A:B:E of 1:8:1, 3:6:1 and 5:4:1 referred to as ABE(181), ABE(361) and ABE(541)), and water content (0.5 vol% and 1 vol% water referred to as W0.5 and W1), it was found that ABE(361)30 performed well in terms of engine performance and emissions, including brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), carbon monoxide (CO), unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. Then, ABE(361)30 was compared with conventional fuels, including E30, B30 (30 vol% ethanol or butanol blended with gasoline) and pure gasoline (G100) under various equivalence ratios and engine loads. Overall, a higher BTE (0.2–1.4%) and lower CO (1.4–4.4%), UHC (0.3–9.9%) and NOx(4.2–14.6%) emissions were observed for ABE(361)30 compared to those of G100 in some cases. Therefore, ABE could be a good alternative fuel to gasoline due to the environmentally benign manufacturing process (from non-edible biomass feedstock and without a recovery process), and the potential to improve energy efficiency and reduce pollutant emissions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A novel down-tube reactor demonstration plant has been designed and built with the biomass throughput capacity of over 300 kg·h− 1. The main components of the pyrolysis demonstration plant were described and their performance was tested and evaluated. Preliminary experiments were conducted at the selected range of 400–550 °C to investigate the effect of temperature on the products. The components of non-condensable gases and the chemical compositions of bio-oil were studied. The good features of the reactor (high heat transfer rate, short residence time, good liquidity of biomass and ceramic balls, etc.) were beneficial to increase the yield of bio-oil. The maximum bio-oil yield was obtained at 500 °C up to 52.5 wt.%, with the yield of gas and char being 27% and 20.5%, respectively. The major components of non-condensable gas were CO2 and CO which were accounted for 90.4 vol.% at 400 °C. The chemical compositions of bio-oil are also affected by temperature above all the proportion of ketones, acids, furans, phenols and sugars. Acids is the main product and the maximum yield is up to 32.3 wt.% at 550 °C.

AB  - In light of possible future restrictions on the use of fossil fuel, due to climate change obligations and continuous depletion of global fossil fuel reserves, the search for alternative renewable energy sources is expected to be an issue of great concern for policy stakeholders. This study assessed the feasibility of bioenergy production under relatively low-intensity conservative, eco-agricultural settings (as opposed to those produced under high-intensity, fossil fuel based industrialized agriculture). Estimates of the net energy gain (NEG) and the energy return on energy invested (EROEI) obtained from a life cycle inventory of the energy inputs and outputs involved reveal that the energy efficiency of bioenergy produced in low-intensity eco-agricultural systems could be as much as much as 448.5-488.3 GJ·ha-1 of NEG and an EROEI of 5.4-5.9 for maize ethanol production systems, and as much as 155.0-283.9 GJ·ha-1 of NEG and an EROEI of 14.7-22.4 for maize biogas production systems. This is substantially higher than for industrialized agriculture with a NEG of 2.8-52.5 GJ·ha-1 and an EROEI of 1.2-1.7 for maize ethanol production systems, as well as a NEG of 59.3-188.7 GJ·ha-1 and an EROEI of 2.2-10.2 for maize biogas production systems. Bioenergy produced in low-intensity eco-agricultural systems could therefore be an important source of energy with immense net benefits for local and regional end-users, provided a more efficient use of the co-products is ensured.

AB  - Hydrogen sulfate ionic liquid as co-solvent and as homogeneous catalyst in ethanol solvent allows efficient conversion of fructose into 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (5-EMF) directly at mild conditions. Ionic liquids [A][B] ([A]+ = 1-methylimidazolium, [C1im]+; 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium, [C2mim]+; or 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium, [C4mim]+, [B]− = hydrogen sulfate, [HSO4]−; acetate, [AC]−; diethylphosphate, [DEP]−); dimethylphosphate, [DMP]−) or chloride, [Cl]−were studied. In the [C4mim][HSO4]-ethanol system, 83% 5-EMF yields were obtained from fructose at 130 °C in 20 min reaction time that can be attributed to the anion acidity and to a stabilizing hydrogen bond that forms between the ionic liquid and 5-HMF. The ionic liquid was demonstrated to be reusable for five times with minimal loss in catalytic activity (ca. 3% loss in 5-EMF yield). Hydrogen sulfate ionic liquids as co-solvent and catalyst in ethanol allow efficient conversion of biomass-related mixtures that contain fructose or a 5-HMF intermediate into biofuels. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) was chosen as the woody biomass for the production of charcoal for use in a liquid fuel slurry. Charcoal produced from this biomass resulted in a highly porous structure similar to the parent material. Micronized particles were produced from this charcoal using a multi-step milling process and verified using a scanning electron microscope and laser diffraction system. Charcoal particles greater than 50 μm exhibited long needle shapes much like the parent biomass while particles less than 50 μm were produced with aspect ratios closer to unity. Laser diffraction measurements indicated D10, D50, and D90 values of 4.446 μm, 15.83 μm, and 39.69 μm, respectively. Moisture content, ash content, absolute density, and energy content values were also measured for the charcoal particles produced. Calculated volumetric energy density values for the charcoal particles exceeded the No. 2 diesel fuel that would be displaced in a liquid fuel slurry.

AB  - Biofuel from fatty acids with chain lengths of 8–15 (C8–C15) have properties similar to those of conventional diesel and jet fuels, thus, can save time and reduce costs for the refurbishment of engines and maintenance of oiling facilities. Most oil-producing algae yield C16–C18 fatty acids; however, the manipulation of algae using genetic engineering is a promising approach to obtain C8–C15 fatty acids. The introduction of a medium-chain-specific thioesterase (TE) is expected to effectively alter algae to produce medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs). TE is the main determinant of fatty acid chain length as it releases fatty acids from the acyl carrier protein (ACP) in the fatty acid elongation cycle. In a previous study, the introduction of heterologous C8–C12-specific TEs into Chlamydomonas reinhardtii did not increase the yield of MCFAs. This effect was attributed to a low affinity of the heterologous TEs to C. reinhardtii ACP. Therefore, we introduced both the C10–C14-specific TE gene and the ACP gene from the land plant Cuphea lanceolata into C. reinhardtii. We measured free fatty acids (FFAs) and triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the transformants using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. The production of C12:0 and C14:0, chain length 12 and 14 without unsaturation, FFAs was not significantly increased in any of the tested strains. However, we found a slight but significant increase in TAG-containing MCFAs in both TE only and TE–ACP transformants. The increased production rate of C14:0-containing TAGs ranged from 1.25- to 1.58-fold, indicating the ability of medium-chain-specific TE to increase MCFAs. These results suggest that the selection of specific TEs is important when modifying eukaryotic algae to produce MCFAs. © 2017 Japanese Society of Phycology

AB  - This work investigates the applicability of n-butanol as a next generation biofuel to replace diesel in compression ignition engines for efficient operation, pollutant mitigation, and CO2 reduction. A high compression ratio (18.2:1) diesel research engine is configured to run on neat n-butanol. Due to the fuel property departure from diesel, n-butanol combustion exhibits striking combustion characteristics. Alternative combustion strategies, including via partially premixed compression ignition and homogeneous charge compression ignition, are enabled efficiently owing to distinctive fuel properties of n-butanol. The compression ignition of the (partially) premixed n-butanol and air mixture is capable of producing diesel-like engine efficiency and significant nitrogen oxide and smoke reductions. As the engine load increases, however, such neat n-butanol combustion exhibits rapid burning and suffers abrupt pressure rise. Thereby the engine load is generally limited below 50% of the baseline capability. A split-combustion strategy, which employs multiple event fuel injections, is found to be effective to modulate the noise of n-butanol clean combustion, thereby enabling neat n-butanol application across the full engine load range. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the reactive separation system has been designed and operated for fuel bioadditive ethyl levulinate synthesis from ethanol and levulinic acid by using a catalytic composite membrane. The catalytic composite membrane was prepared by coating hydroxyethyl cellulose membrane with a thin layer of sulfated zirconia. The membranes were characterized and the stability of the catalytic composite membrane was confirmed by consecutive experiments. Batch reactor experiments were carried out by using powder sulfated zirconia catalyst. While the levulinic acid conversion was 34.92% in 7 h by using the powder sulfated zirconia catalyst in the batch reactor, the conversion reached to a level of 95% in 7 h by using sulfated zirconia coated hydroxyethyl cellulose catalytic membrane under the same conditions (reaction temperature 70 °C, catalyst concentration 8 g/L and initial molar ratio 3:1) in the pervaporation catalytic membrane reactor (PVCMR). Results showed that the conversion in the PVCMR was much higher than those in the batch reactors. The effects of temperature, catalyst concentration and initial molar ratio of ethanol to levulinic acid on the conversion value of levulinic acid were investigated for both batch reactor and the pervaporation catalytic membrane reactor. © 2016 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Sulfonated mesostructured silica-carbon nanocomposites with varying carbon content, acidic site density and porosity, obtained via the one-pot evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) synthesis, were used here to convert sugars into useful chemicals and biofuel components in alcoholic solvent. The nanocomposites show a remarkable catalytic performance in ethanol, yielding up to 80%, predominantly ethyl levulinate, 5-ethoxymethylfurfural and 2-(diethoxymethyl)-5-(ethoxymethyl)furan. Fructose is the sugar substrate of choice, but the sulfonated composites are also able to convert di- and polymeric forms of fructose. Due to a lack of a glucose-to-fructose isomerization ability, the composites are unable to form the above products from the glucose resources (glucose and cellulose), ethyl glucoside being the dominant product from these feedstocks. The composite has a peculiar hierarchical pore architecture, which is stable on shelf in ambient for at least six years. While the mesoporosity facilitates entrance and fast transport (even of soluble poly-carbohydrates like inulin and cellulose polymers), the presence of microporosity is beneficial to attain fast sugar catalysis. Since the microporosity is associated with voids in the carbon phase (preferably pyrolyzed at 400 °C), composites with high carbon contents are preferred. Due to the fast transport, reactions with fructose in ethanol run in the chemical regime in the applied thermal conditions. Kinetic inspection of the reaction further clarifies the complex network of consequent and parallel reactions, demonstrating that HMF is the main precursor of humins, while the formation of EL directly from HMF should also be considered. While this observation corroborates the protective role of alcohols like ethanol, this work also concludes based on a series of reactions in different alcohols and water, that the presence of water plays a crucial role in the HMF-to-humins formation. While alcohols are known to stabilize HMF, the unprotected HMF is fairly stable in non-aqueous reaction circumstances like in tert-butanol solvent. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A novel solid base catalyst derived from gasified straw slag for producing biodiesel was prepared by simple pulverization and sieving. This catalyst exhibited high stability, low leaching of the catalytic species, and good catalytic activity, caused by high-temperature melting in the biomass gasifier. SiO2, CaO, K2O, MgO, FeO, and Al2O3were the common constituents (calculated as oxides) as per XRF analysis and EA. XRD and TEM-EDS analysis indicated that the catalyst comprises three crystallites: quartz, leucite, and åkermanite. The catalyst was strongly basic with a basic site concentration of 0.3974 mmol⋅g−1, including strongly basic low-coordination oxygen anions, moderately basic OH groups, and metal–oxygen pairs, as identified by CO2-TPD and IR. TGA results indicated that the catalyst is thermally stable up to 400 °C, which is greater than the typical reaction temperature. BET analysis results indicated that the slag exhibits a broad pore distribution with pore diameters of 5–15 and 45–75 nm. The catalyst exhibited high catalytic activity and stability, exhibiting a fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) conversion of 95% for transesterification conducted at 200 °C for 8 h with a catalyst dose of 20% and a methanol–oil molar ratio of 12:1. The FAME conversion remained greater than 85% even after reusing the catalyst for 33 reactions without any appreciable loss of catalytic activity. Small amounts of K and Mg (&lt;10 ppm) leached into the product from the catalyst. These results indicated that the gasified straw slag catalyst demonstrates promise for producing biodiesel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to limited biomass availability, the establishment of optimal route biofuel value chains (one conversion route for each feedstock) is a key prerequisite for a feasible bioenergy sector. This way, biorefineries can take advantage of the economies of scale and increase their economic potential. Therefore, techno-economic comparison between similar conversion processes for the utilisation of individual feedstocks is essential. To this effect, the present study focuses on the feasibility of two biomass to liquids (BtL) thermochemical conversion routes for the production of hydrocarbon fuels. Aspen plus software was employed to investigate a gasification followed by Fischer–Tropsch synthesis route (G-FT) and fast pyrolysis followed by hydroprocessing (FP-H) by developing process flowsheets and solving the associated mass, and energy balances. Based on the simulations, thermodynamic (energy/exergy analysis) and economic (financial and risk analysis) evaluations were carried out. Sensitivity analyses have been performed in order to define the key parameters of each conversion route. Sugar cane bagasse, the waste solid residue of the sugar cane milling process, was considered as feedstock at a flowrate of 100 t/h. Based on the outcomes of the evaluations, the two alternatives were compared and it was concluded that, both energetically and financially, G-FT synthesis is the more efficient option. © 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Alternative diesel fuels derived from biomass can vary significantly in volatility compared to their petroleum-derived counterparts, and their appropriate utilization is contingent on their compatibility with existing engine infrastructure. To investigate this compatibility, experiments were carried out to study the effect of fuel volatility on conventional diesel combustion (CDC) performance under a wide range of in-cylinder thermodynamic conditions at start of injection (SOI). Fuels of matched reactivity (i.e., cetane number (CN)) and varying volatility were produced by blending binary mixtures of 2,6,10-trimethyldodecane (farnesane) and 2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane, octane number primary reference fuels (PRF), and cetane number secondary reference fuels (SRF). Nine fuel blends were tested in total, consisting of 3 volatility characteristics at 3 reactivity levels. Five engine operating conditions were utilized, ranging from 14.7–29 kg/m3and 980–1120 K in-cylinder density and temperature at SOI. Testing was performed in a single-cylinder GM 1.9 L diesel engine. Only small differences in ignition delay (ID), in-cylinder pressure, and heat release rate (HRR) were observed between fuels of matched CN, regardless of their volatility. An analysis of the spray breakup and mixture formation process indicated that there were only small variations in ambient air entrainment and jet temperature between fuel blends, in agreement with the observed combustion behavior. © 2016

AB  - The present study investigates the suitability of marine microalga Chlorella vulgaris BDUG 91771 biodiesel to curb the fuel crisis, based on engine performance and emission profile. Initially, biodiesel was produced from outdoor grown Chlorella vulgaris BDUG 91771 and its fuel properties accorded with ASTM D6571 and EN 14214 standards. To evaluate performance and emission characteristics, various Chlorella vulgaris BDUG 91771 biodiesel-diesel blends were prepared and tested in single-cylinder Kirloskar engine under four different load operations (0%, 50%, 75%, 100%). Compression ignition engine fuelled with B40 or B50 biodiesel-diesel blend showed specific fuel consumption (SFC), and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of 0.306 kg/kWh and 26% respectively at 100% load, which is on par with diesel fuel. Further, engine operated with B50 biodiesel blend evidently reduced the carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions by 0.1% and 102 ppm respectively compared to baseline diesel. Notably, diesel emitted 7.5% carbon dioxide (CO2) and 380 ppm nitrogen oxides (NOx) at 100% load, while the optimal blends B40 or B50 reduced CO2and NOxemissions by 6.1% and 376 ppm respectively. Based on results, present work suggests either B40 or B50 Chlorella vulgaris BDUG 91771 biodiesel – diesel blend could serve as eco-friendly, alternative fuel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This experimental work presents a parametric investigation of Calophyllum inophyllum methyl ester (CIME)-diesel engine operations and artificial neural network (ANN) applied forecast of the engine out responses. The engine tests were performed for five test fuels from idle to full load conditions with the stipulated increment of 25% of the load for every run at three selected injection timings (21°, 23° and 25° CA bTDC) for 220 bar, 260 bar and 300 bar injection pressures. The experimental outcomes indicated that twenty percentage blend of the biodiesel in neat diesel (CIME20) showed the highest brake thermal efficiency (BTE) among the CIME-diesel operations for 300 bar injection pressure at 23° CA bTDC injection timing whereas BTE for the test fuels reduced at advanced and retarded injection timings at full load. CO, UBHC, dry soot and engine out O2emissions were reduced at the advanced injection timing whereas NO and CO2emissions increased. Using steady state experimental data, separate ANN models were proposed to forecast performance (BTE, BSEC, EGT) and emission (CO, CO2, UBHC, NO, dry soot and engine out O2) parameters with percentage load, blend percentage, injection pressure and injection timing as selected input control variables. The proposed ANN models indicated an impressive agreement as correlation coefficient (R) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values perceived in the range of 0.99879–0.99993 and 0.87–4.62% respectively with remarkably lower root mean squared errors. Besides, lower values of mean squared relative error (MSRE) and noteworthy Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of Efficiency (NSE) indices reasonably demonstrated robustness of the proposed models. Moreover, observed values of forecasting uncertainty Theil U2 indicated more effective outcomes for a credible model forecasting ability. © 2016

AB  - Heterogeneous solid acid catalyzed conversion of microalgal lipids to biodiesel is a scarcely studied area. In this study chromium-aluminum mixed oxide catalyst was investigated for catalytic conversion of microalgal lipids to biodiesel. Lipids from Scenedesmus obliquus grown in an open raceway pond (3000L) was used as feedstock. Reaction variables such as temperature, methanol to oil molar ratio and catalyst amount were optimized using response surface methodology. FAME conversion of 98.28% was achieved using chromium-aluminum catalyst at 80 °C, with methanol to oil molar ratio of 20:1 and catalyst amount of 15%. Catalytic efficiency of this heterogeneous solid acid catalyst was compared to a homogeneous acid catalyst (sulfuric acid). Chromium-aluminum mixed oxide catalyst can be effectively used for 4 batches of conversion reactions without significant loss in its activity. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The techno-economics for producing liquid fuels from Maine forest residues were determined from a combination of: (1) laboratory experiments at USDA-ARS's Eastern Regional Research Center using hog fuel (a secondary woody residue produced from mill byproducts such as sawdust, bark and shavings) as a feedstock for pyrolysis to establish product yields and composition, and (2) Aspen Plus® process simulation for a feed rate of 2000 dry metric tons per day to estimate energy requirements and equipment sizes. The simulated plant includes feedstock sizing and drying, pyrolysis, hydrogen production and hydrotreatment of pyrolysis oils. The biomass is converted into bio-oil (61% yield), char (24%) and gases (15%) in the pyrolysis reactor, with an energy demand of 17%. The bio-oil is then hydrotreated to remove oxygen, thereby producing hydrocarbon fuels. The final mass yield of gasoline/diesel hydrocarbons is 16% with a 40% energy yield based on the dry biomass fed, this yield represents a fuel production of 51.9 gallons per dry metric ton of feedstock. A unique aspect of the process simulated herein is that pyrolysis char and gases are used as sources for both thermal energy and hydrogen, greatly decreasing the need to input fossil energy. The total capital investment for a grass-roots plant was estimated to be US$427 million with an annual operational cost of US$154 million. With a 30 year project life, a minimum fuel selling price was determined to be US$6.25 per gallon. The economic concerns are related to high capital costs, high feedstock costs and short hydrotreating catalyst lifetimes. © 2016

AB  - Cement is traditionally regarded as an energy and emission intensive construction material. The reduction of environmental impacts in the cement industry has gained increasing concern worldwide for environmental sustainability. As a resource-scarce city, cement production in Hong Kong is associated with high CO2emissions, thus contributing significantly to the high environmental impacts in the construction industry. This study herein has been conducted to comprehensively assess the energy consumption and global warming potential impacts of different types of cement manufactured in Hong Kong using life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques. Two sustainable strategies for the reduction of energy consumption and greenhouse gases emission in the cement industry were then proposed. The LCA results showed that ordinary Portland cement production has high environmental impacts mainly due to the import of associated raw materials and burning of fossil fuel. The use of alternative material, such as fly ash would help to reduce the environmental impacts. Significant impacts reductions associated with cement production can be further achieved by strategies such as the use of glass powder from locally generated waste glass bottles as part of the raw materials, and the use of a bio-fuel produced from locally generated wood wastes as a co-fuel with coal. The assessment results indicated that about 12% of the total greenhouse gases emission and 15% of energy consumption can be reduced from the cement industry in Hong Kong by using waste materials to replace virgin materials (clinker/coal). © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, an integrated biomass conversion concept of producing liquid biofuels from brown marine macroalga Padina tetrastromatica was investigated. The algal biomass was collected from the Mandapam coastal region and processed under laboratory. Various parameters were studied to extract crude lipids from the biomass. A kinetic study was conducted for extracting the lipids from the biomass, which follows the first order kinetics and the lipid yield was 8.15 wt.%. The activation energy; Ea = 34.314 kJ mol−1and their thermodynamic parameters were determined. Since the crude algal lipids contain high amount of free fatty acids, a sequential transesterification technique was examined and 7.8% of biodiesel (78 mg/g algal biomass) yield was obtained. The biodiesel was analyzed by1H and13C–NMR spectroscopy and the conversion yield was estimated. Further, the biodiesel fuel properties were investigated and found that all the features fit the required ASTM D6751 specification limits. The residual biomass after lipid extraction was further explored for bioethanol production through the anaerobic fermentation process. The ethanol yield obtained after saccharification and fermentation were estimated and 161 mg/g residue biomass was reported. The theoretical yield of conversion of hydrolysate to bioethanol was estimated and found to be 83.4%. Therefore, this study demonstrates that macroalga P. tetrastromatica biomass has great potential to produce liquid biofuels such as biodiesel and bioethanol. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The fate of oil-seed biomass protein has been tracked through all steps of a multi-phase extraction process using an ionic liquid based co-solvent system previously demonstrated to extract bio-oil and phorbol esters and to recover fermentable sugars from Jatropha oil seed. These analyses, however, did not address the fate of biomass protein. This work demonstrated that the majority of protein (∼86%) tracked with the biomass with the balance lost to co-solvent (∼12%) and methanol (∼2%) washes. A significant portion of the ionic liquid remained with the treated biomass and required aggressive methanol washes to recover. A system analysis showed a net-positive energy balance and thus the potential of this system to produce both bio-oil and protein-rich toxin-free biomass. While these results further support Jatropha as an oil seed crop, the additional costs of solvent recovery will need to be addressed if commercialization is to be realized. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 2-Butanone (methyl ethyl ketone) is a high-octane next-generation biofuel candidate synthesized through microbiological pathways from biomass. The flame structure and species formed in 2-butanone combustion are of interest when further considering this compound for use as a fuel. Thus species profiles within a fuel-rich laminar premixed flat flame of 2-butanone were measured. Two experiments which used different facilities and measurement techniques were combined i.e. the first using electron ionization molecular-beam mass spectrometry (MBMS) and the second relied on synchrotron-generated vacuum UV photoionization MBMS. Very good agreement between both measurements was obtained. The experiments identified the formation of a number of toxic oxygenated intermediates such as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) acetaldehyde and formaldehyde. 2- Butanone showed the lowest overall concentrations for species that could contribute to potentially hazardous volatile emissions underlining its attraction as a fuel also from this perspective.

AB  - A series of binary mixture additives made of a pour point depressant (PPD) and a vegetable oil based crystallization modifier (VOCM) have been used to substantially improve the cold flow performance of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) of soybean oil (Soy1500). An apparatus improving on the ASTM methods was designed to measure the cloud point (CP) and pour point (PP). The mixtures dramatically altered Soy1500 crystallization from nucleation to aggregation, and delivered PP depressions reaching 30 °C. The effect was confirmed to be due to synergistic effects wherein the VOCM delays the nucleation by first combining with the saturated FAME of the biodiesel then growing structure specific crystal surfaces that effectively adsorb the PPD which provides barriers to agglomeration. The VOCM-PPD mixture constrains the biodiesel microstructure to very small crystals that are prevented from aggregating over an extended temperature range, leading to a significant depression in the PP. The most dramatic effects were achieved when the PPD is combined in optimal concentration with a VOCM having a structural element which initiates packing and another that prevents further crystallization. Importantly, the results and understanding gathered from the study can be used for the design of highly functional cold flow improver cocktail additives. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Vegetable oils became a very popular bioliquid for renewable power and transport applications. At local level, the short chain production of vegetable oils is currently important in terms of sustainability and use of rural area. This present work investigates the development of vegetable oils production chain in the Tuscany territory, focusing also to valorisation of the co-products (i.e., oil cake). The work is based on the study of the cultivation of rapeseed and sunflower, and the creation of an extraction plant based on cold-screw pressing technology, in order to obtain a raw vegetable oil suitable as biofuel. The German DIN 51623 standard was adopted to investigate the quality of vegetable oils obtained from different oil crops. Vegetable oils quality was evaluated by comparing the oil produced by a bench press at lab scale, comparing the results in terms of process yields and lipid fraction recovered. Due to the high phosphorous content of rapeseed oil, out of the DIN limits, an experimental procedure to remove P content and restore the oxidation stability of the oils was performed. The results showed a substantial P reduction by adding 2 wt% of P-removing additive. The oil cake properties were evaluated in view of its potential use for bioenergy production, in particular in terms of metals content. Copyright © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - This paper evaluates the financial viability of renewable jet fuel production, from two oilseed crops Camelina sativa (camelina) and Brassica carinata (carinata) and used cooking oil (UCO), by the hydrodeoxygenation pathway. A Monte Carlo analysis is performed to examine the robustness of the financial performance by taking into consideration key uncertain parameters, including capital cost, oil content of seeds, and prices of feedstocks, gas, electricity, water, meal co-product, and crude oil (indicator of fuel product prices). The Monte Carlo analysis revealed that under the conditions analyzed, the probabilities that the net present value would be positive are 29% for camelina, 18% for carinata and 8% for UCO, indicating that the three projects are risky for investors. Sensitivity analysis determined that the projects’ financial performance is highly sensitive to prices of fuel products and feedstocks. The impacts of two different hypothetical biofuel economic incentives were assessed: Carbon trading and tradable credits similar to the Renewable Identification Number (RIN). Income earned in the form of a RIN would have a large positive impact on the projects’ viabilities. By assuming an incentive of $0.20/L of renewable fuel, the probabilities that the NPV would be positive are 85% for camelina, 75% for carinata and 58% for UCO. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Right after the enforcement of the Directive (EU) 2015/1513, amending the Renewable Energy Directive of the European Union, the situation of the biodiesel sector in Spain is particularly uncertain. Although domestic biodiesel production has significantly increased since 2013, many plants are still idle, leading to an excess of capacity. This paper aims to provide an operational framework that combines Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with economic optimization to determine the feedstock combination for domestic biodiesel production in Spain in compliance with this Directive, and quantify the associated impacts. A multi-sector, mathematical programming model is proposed in a Partial Equilibrium setting, implementing an LCA module. The optimal oil mix for the sector is highly dependent on assumptions regarding land use change in crude vegetable oil exporting countries. Increasing greenhouse gas savings thresholds enhance the use of waste oils and domestic oilseeds, while preventing deforestation of carbon-rich ecosystems; the only exception is the Brazilian Cerrado savanna. A double-counting scheme for waste oil biodiesel is necessary to make plants with second-generation technology work at full capacity, delivering further environmental benefits. Although there is room for further improvement, the model can provide very good insights for biodiesel policy analysis in the context of Spain. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Castor oil has an especial hydroxyl fatty acid (cis-12-hydroxyoctadeca-9-enoic acid) which provides unique properties and unusual versatility as a raw material for biodiesel production. Heating and pumping are the major energy demanding in biodiesel production processes. Biodiesel production may not be competitive among the liquid renewable fuels unless the elevated energy consumption is reduced. Actually, this problem is more pronounced in Castor oil biodiesel industry. In this work, the problematic of the elevated power consumption in the pumping system was solved by preheating the Castor oil. The additional heat reduces the viscosity, as well as, the activation energy in the reactor leading to a smaller residence time. The preheater device has been designed based on exergy effectiveness transfer and dimensionless entropy generation approaches which are highly related with energy efficiency. The performed study compared parallel, crossflow, Shell-and-Tube, and countercurrent flow arrangements. A 6-3 Shell-and-Tube heat exchanger obtained the highest performance in terms of exergy effectiveness transfer and dimensionless entropy generation. The thermodynamic property calculations were performed by using a thermodynamical model based on molecular theory (SAFT−γ). These calculation are required for the rigorous heat exchanger design. Eight of the most common Free Fatty Acids presented in Castor oil were integrated in the oil mixture. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although numerous studies have shown the adverse effects of oxidized biodiesel and/or higher total acid number (TAN) and water content in biodiesel fuel on the degradation of fuel delivery materials, limited work has been reported to date to ascertain the presence of these factors under actual engine operation. Therefore, the aim here is to determine if these factors exist under common rail diesel engine (CRDE) operation. For this, an engine test-bed comprising a Toyota 1KD-FTV engine coupled to an eddy current dynamometer was operated under two different speed-load test cycles using palm biodiesel with 10.5 h of oxidation stability according to the Rancimat test. The results indicated that the biodiesel fuel samples were not oxidized while both TAN value and water content were unaffected at the end of the CRDE operations under both the test cycles. As such, emphasis should not only be placed solely on the acceleration of fuel delivery materials degradation due to biodiesel oxidation and/or greater TAN value and water content under engine operation. This study also demonstrated that biodiesel conductivity value is a more appropriate indicator of fuel deterioration level under CRDE operation which ultimately determines the compatibility between biodiesel and fuel delivery materials. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper describes catalytic consequence of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Dunaliella tertiolecta (D. tertiolecta) over carbon nanotubes (CNTs) supported metals catalysts to produce bio-oil. When Co/CNTs is used as catalysts, the conversion and bio-oil yield increase to 95.78 and 40.25 wt.%, respectively. Chemical analysis results showed that the introduction of catalyst significantly affected the chemical composition of bio-oil with a higher percentage of hydrocarbons and a lower content of fatty acid. The introduction of metal into CNTs had no change in the basic CNT skeleton and the loaded metal nanoparticles encapsulated within the CNT enhances the disorder and defects in CNTs. Based on our results and the literature, the plausible general reaction and catalytic HTL pathways of D. tertiolecta are proposed. © 2016

AB  - This paper presents a novel kinetic reaction model for biomass pyrolysis processes. The model is based on the three main building blocks of lignocellulosic biomass, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin and can be readily implemented in Aspen Plus and easily adapted to other process simulation software packages. It uses a set of 149 individual reactions that represent the volatilization, decomposition and recomposition processes of biomass pyrolysis. A linear regression algorithm accounts for the secondary pyrolysis reactions, thus allowing the calculation of slow and intermediate pyrolysis reactions. The bio-oil is modelled with a high level of detail, using up to 33 model compounds, which allows for a comprehensive estimation of the properties of the bio-oil and the prediction of further upgrading reactions. After showing good agreement with existing literature data, our own pyrolysis experiments are reported for validating the reaction model. A beech wood feedstock is subjected to pyrolysis under well-defined conditions at different temperatures and the product yields and compositions are determined. Reproducing the experimental pyrolysis runs with the simulation model, a high coincidence is found for the obtained fraction yields (bio-oil, char and gas), for the water content and for the elemental composition of the pyrolysis products. The kinetic reaction model is found to be suited for predicting pyrolysis yields and product composition for any lignocellulosic biomass feedstock under typical pyrolysis conditions without the need for experimental data. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study quantifies and compares the costs of production for six alternative jet fuel pathways using consistent financial and technical assumptions. Uncertainty was propagated through the analysis using Monte Carlo simulations. The six processes assessed were HEFA, advanced fermentation, Fischer-Tropsch, aqueous phase processing, hydrothermal liquefaction, and fast pyrolysis. The results indicate that none of the six processes would be profitable in the absence of government incentives, with HEFA using yellow grease, HEFA using tallow, and FT revealing the lowest mean jet fuel prices at $0.91/liter ($0.66/liter–$1.24/liter), $1.06/liter ($0.79/liter–$1.42/liter), and $1.15/liter ($0.95/liter–$1.39/liter), respectively. This study also quantifies plant performance in the United States with a Renewable Fuel Standard policy analysis. Results indicate that some pathways could achieve positive NPV with relatively high likelihood under existing policy supports, with HEFA and FPH revealing the highest probability of positive NPV at 94.9% and 99.7%, respectively, in the best-case scenario. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Decline in global resources of petroleum based fuels such as diesel and gasoline have attracted attention of researchers towards alternative fuels which are capable of providing both, energy security and protection against environmental degradation due to emission of hazardous pollutants. As an oxygenated fuel, biodiesel has emerged as a potential alternative fuel, which can be used in diesel engines on large-scale to reduce CO, HC and PM emissions. In this experimental study, Jatropha curcas derived biodiesel (JB100) and its 20% (v/v) blend with mineral diesel (JB20) was tested in a production-grade single cylinder diesel engine for evaluating its combustion characteristics. Since soot and NOxemissions are major concerns in CI engine combustion, it is very important to investigate their in-situ spatial distribution, so that effective control measures can be devised. For this, endoscopic visualization technique was implemented on a modified prototype engine to evaluate the effect of biodiesel blending percentage and engine load on in-situ spatial distribution of in-cylinder soot and flame temperature distributions. Inherent oxygen content of biodiesel helped in achieving superior combustion; as a result, in-cylinder soot formation was lower than baseline mineral diesel. Spatial flame temperature distribution was also relatively lower in biodiesel. Endoscopic visualization technique was found to be effective in evaluating different combustion characteristics in a modified prototype engine. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, biodiesel was produced from safflower seeds by converting the raw oil obtained through dampening them via the rolling process, roasting at 90 °C and pressing into Safflower Oil Methyl Esther (Safflower Biodiesel) using the trans-esterification method. Experimental fuels were obtained in the forms of D100, B2.5M2.5D95, B5M5D90, B5M2.5D92.5and B2.5M5D92.5by mixing the biodiesel fuel obtained from safflower with diesel fuel, adding bio-ethanol at the rates of 2.5% and 5%, and volumetrically in inverse ratio. Tests were conducted to determine the fuel properties of the mixed fuels obtained and the diesel fuel, their kinematic viscosity, density, water content, pH level, caloric value, flash point, clouding, pour and freezing points, copper bar corrosion test, iodine number, CFPP (Cold Filter Plugging Point) test and cetane number. Moreover, the mixtures obtained and the diesel fuel were tried and examined in a water-cooled, four-stroke, single cylinder diesel engine that had a direct injection fuel system. As a result of the experiments, performance characteristics of the test engine were obtained. Exhaust emission values (CO, CO2, HC, O2, SO2, NOx) were obtained from the exhaust stack of the test engine using the probe of the gas analysis device. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of blending ratio of Karanja oil methyl ester (KOME) on spray characteristics and to analyze the engine performance and exhaust emissions of Karanja biodiesel blend vis-a-vis baseline diesel. Spray characteristics were analyzed using injection rate and spray visualization experiments for the following injection pressures: 50, 100 and 150 MPa. Engine performance, emission and combustion characteristics were also investigated at various engine operation conditions. From a comparison of the spray evolution of Karanja biodiesel 40% (v/v) blend (KB40) vis-a-vis baseline diesel, the spray shape revealed a narrower and deeper penetrating spray development process for KB40. However, at an ambient pressure of 4 MPa, which is considered to be similar to the cylinder pressure of a test engine, KB40 exhibited a spray evolution behavior (spray penetration and shape) closely resembling that of diesel. In the engine experiment, lower max torque, brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and exhaust gas temperature, in addition to higher brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) were observed for biodiesel blend compared to diesel due to lower heating value of Karanja biodiesel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, pure petroleum diesel fuel, blends of canola-safflower biodiesel and oxygenated fuel additives such as solketal and ethanol were tested in a common rail diesel engine under three engine speeds (1500 rpm, 2000 rpm and 2500 rpm) and the medium engine load (100 Nm) test conditions. Detailed and comparative injection, combustion and emission analysis of the test fuels were performed. The results showed that brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of biodiesel and its blends (15% ethanol-85% biodiesel and 15% solketal-85% biodiesel) with oxygenated fuels were higher than those of petroleum diesel fuel. Solketal and ethanol additions to biodiesel increased BSFC. Maximum cylinder pressures were close to each other for all test fuels. Main and pilot injection characteristics of the test engine changed significantly when diesel fuel and biodiesel were used. According to the emission results, biodiesel emitted higher NOxand CO2emissions while lower CO and THC emissions compared with diesel fuel. In addition, solketal and ethanol fuel blends caused an increase in NOxemissions and provided lower CO2, CO and THC emissions on average compared to biodiesel. Ethanol-biodiesel and solketal-biodiesel blends gave similar results to each other. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Switching cultivation (mixotrophic-heterotrophic, 12 h:12 h) of Heynigia riparia SX01 was studied, the maximum biomass concentration of 3.55 g L−1and lipid yield of 1.45 g L−1were achieved after 8 days cultivation. The extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) was developed as co-product. Addition of MgSO4could enhance the production of EPS. The highest amount of 0.60 g L−1EPS was obtained with the addition of 2 g L−1MgSO4, the self-flocculation efficiency was as high as 83% at this condition. The total lipid and lipid fractions did not show differences with extra MgSO4. Based on the above results, a new biodiesel production model was proposed: culturing Heynigia riparia SX01 with extra 2 g L−1MgSO4by switching cultivation and using self flocculation to collect microalgae for biodiesel production, while EPS was collected as valuable co-products. © 2016

AB  - The use of biodiesel as a transportation fuel and its growing mandatory blending percentage in diesel increase the likelihood of contaminating groundwater with diesel/biodiesel blends. A 100L-field experiment with B20 (20% biodiesel and 80% diesel, v/v) was conducted to assess the potential for the combined biostimulation of iron and sulfate reducing bacteria to enhance BTEX and PAH biodegradation in a diesel/biodiesel blend-contaminated groundwater. A B20 field experiment under monitored natural attenuation (MNA) was used as a baseline control. Ammonium acetate and a low-cost and sustainable product recovered from acid mine drainage treatment were used to stimulate iron and sulfate-reducing conditions. As a result, benzene and naphthalene concentrations (maximum concentrations were 28.1 μg L−1and 10.0 μg L−1, respectively) remained lower than the MNA experiment (maximum concentrations were 974.7 μg L−1and 121.3 μg L−1, respectively) over the whole experiment. Geochemical changes were chronologically consistent with the temporal change of the predominance of Geobacter and GOUTA19 which might be the key players responsible for the rapid attenuation of benzene and naphthalene. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first field experiment to demonstrate the potential for the combined iron and sulfate biostimulation to enhance B20 source-zone biodegradation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study modelled the Passenger (PC) fleet and other categories of road transport in Ireland from 2015 to 2035 to assess the impact of current and potential greenhouse gas mitigation policies on CO2emissions. Scenarios included the shift of purchasing towards diesel PCs over gasoline PCs. Scrappage rates were also calculated and applied to the fleet to predict future sales of PCs. Seven future policy scenarios were examined using different penetrations of PC sales for different vehicle technologies under current and alternative bio-fuel obligations. Tank to Wheel (T2W) tailpipe and Well to Wheel (W2W) CO2emissions, and energy demand were modelled using COPERT 4v11.3 and a recently published W2W CO2emissions model. A percentage reduction of conventional diesel and petrol vehicles, in different scenarios compared to a baseline scenario in the W2W model was applied to estimate the likely changes in T2W emissions at the tailpipe up to 2035. The results revealed that the biofuel policy scenario was insufficient in achieving a significant reduction of CO2emissions. However, without a fixed reduction target for CO2from the road transport sector, the success of policy scenarios in the long run is difficult to compare. The current Electric vehicle (EV) policy in Ireland is required to be implemented to reduce CO2emissions by a significant level. Results also show that a similar achievement of CO2emission reduction could be possible by using alternative vehicle technologies with higher abatement cost. However, as EV based policies have not been successful so far, Ireland may need to search for alternative pathways. © 2016

AB  - Growth of biodiesel industries resulted in increased coproduction of crude glycerol which is therefore becoming a waste product instead of a valuable ‘coproduct’. Glycerol can be used for the production of valuable chemicals, e.g. biofuels, to reduce glycerol waste disposal. In this study, a novel bacterial strain is described which converts glycerol mainly to ethanol and hydrogen with very little amounts of acetate, formate and 1,2-propanediol as coproducts. The bacterium offers certain advantages over previously studied glycerol-fermenting microorganisms. Anaerobium acetethylicum during growth with glycerol produces very little side products and grows in the presence of maximum glycerol concentrations up to 1500 mM and in the complete absence of complex organic supplements such as yeast extract or tryptone. The highest observed growth rate of 0.116 h−1 is similar to that of other glycerol degraders, and the maximum concentration of ethanol that can be tolerated was found to be about 60 mM (2.8 g l−1) and further growth was likely inhibited due to ethanol toxicity. Proteome analysis as well as enzyme assays performed in cell-free extracts demonstrated that glycerol is degraded via glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which is further metabolized through the lower part of glycolysis leading to formation of mainly ethanol and hydrogen. In conclusion, fermentation of glycerol to ethanol and hydrogen by this bacterium represents a remarkable option to add value to the biodiesel industries by utilization of surplus glycerol. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Applying bio-oil generated through thermochemical conversion in power plants is a crucial problem in current energy studies. In this study, varying proportions of cedar sawdust bio-oil produced through fast pyrolysis were mixed in the kerosene samples to analyze their spray combustion characteristics with various oxidizer velocities. These results indicated that the spray angle increased with increased oxidizer velocity, reducing the droplet distribution. Moreover, the turbulence effect enhanced the effect of mixing the vaporized droplets and the oxidizer, thereby hastening and intensifying the combustion and shortening the flame length and lift off. The bio-oil produced through fast pyrolysis contained various types of volatile substances. Therefore, increasing the bio-oil proportion in kerosene reduced the spray combustion regime. Additionally, when the volume percentage of bio-oil in kerosene reached 15%, the low heating value of the bio-oil lowered the flame temperature in combustion. Furthermore, the emission of various substances during combustion was closely correlated with the oxidizer velocity and bio-oil proportion. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper presents a technical-economic assessment of biomethane production from vinasse in the Brazilian bioethanol industry, considering five technological routes of biogas upgrading. The technologies assessed were pressure water scrubbing, organic-physical scrubbing, amine scrubbing, membrane separation and pressure swing adsorption. The biomethane costs of the five technological routes overlapped in the range between R$30/GJHHV(US$13/GJHHV) and R$34/GJHHV(US$14/GJHHV), which indicates a certain equivalence of the options. Those costs were comparable to the prices of potential alternative fuels at 2014 prices, such as the Bolivian natural gas, priced at R$20/GJ (US$8/GJ); imported LNG, at R$31/GJ (US$13/GJ); and diesel, at R$42/GJ (US$18/GJ). The effects of scale on biomethane cost were also assessed and pointed out that the likely minimum scale for vinasse-to-biomethane projects aiming at diesel substitution would be at sugarcane mills with a minimum capacity of producing 87 million liters of ethanol per season, whereas if the aim were to target natural gas markets, 174 million liters of ethanol per season would likely be the minimum capacity for competitive prices. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the current study, palm kernel oil was used as a renewable feedstock for production of jet fuel-like hydrocarbons via the deoxygenation over the Ni-MoS2/γ-Al2O3catalyst. The dominant C12 fatty acid content in palm kernel oil makes it promising for jet fuel application. Synthesized by a liquid processing method with thiourea organosulfur agent, the catalyst revealed MoS2structure with low stacking, while Ni substitution in the MoS2structure and interaction with the Al2O3support were determined based on the Ni K-edge XANES and EXAFS results. A high hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) activity, which as the major pathway in the deoxygenation, was observed upon application of a H2pressure of 30–50 bar over Ni-MoS2/γ-Al2O3. The optimum product yield of approximately 92% was obtained mainly from the HDO pathway (∼60%) with 58% selectivity to C10–C12 jet fuel hydrocarbons. The flow property of the jet fuel-like hydrocarbons was more desirable than those obtained from palm olein oil-derived fuel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae harvesting is a difficult and costly unit operation, hampering commercial microalgae based processes. Various innovative approaches have been under research investigations. Algae harvesting using microalgae/fungi co-pelletization where microalgae cells are attracted to filamentous fungus and form co-pellets during their co-culture has been proved to be an innovative approach that might be both cost effective and sustainable. Yet, the mechanism behind the co-pelletization based algae harvesting is still not known. Understanding its mechanism will significantly facilitate future developments to decrease the processing cost for generating biofuel and other microalgae based bio-products. Considering that the ionic conditions greatly affect the flocculation performance of microalgae cells, studies were conducted to compare the co-pelletization performance at different pH values and ionic strengths in order to evaluate the surface charge changes at the different conditions tested. Zeta-potential measurements indicated that (1) both microalgae and fungi have low negative zeta-potentials regardless of the pH of the bulk solution (&lt;−10 mV) (2) fungi can have a positive electric charge at low pH (pH=3). The results suggest that it might be possible that the degree of repulsion and dispersion between these organisms is low at certain conditions, for instance, at higher concentrations of Ca2+ (&gt;0.1 g/L) the surface charge of fungal and microalgae cells were less negative (&gt;−5 mV for fungal hyphae and &gt;−12 mV for microalgae) at higher concentrations of magnesium (0.5 g/L), which might have facilitated the attraction between them. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Numerical simulations of non-reacting and reacting diesel and biodiesel sprays in a constant-volume chamber are presented in this paper and some of the results compared to measured data. The conditions of the study include the effects of chamber air dilution with inert gases and varying chamber temperature. n-Heptane is used as the surrogate fuel for diesel fuel and a tri-component fuel mixture consisting of n-heptane, methyl decanoate, and methyl 9-decenoate is used as the surrogate fuel for biodiesel. The computed and measured liquid-phase penetrations in the non-reacting sprays agree within 30% for the range of conditions considered. The vapour penetrations agree within 10%. For the reacting simulations, the turbulence/chemistry interaction is modelled using an unsteady flamelet generated manifold (UFGM) sub-model. As reported in prior work, the UFGM model predicts the flame lift-off height well. The soot model employed is a semi-empirical two-equation model that accounts for nucleation of soot precursors, surface growth via acetylene addition and PAH condensation, coagulation, and oxidation. NO is modelled using the kinetics from a sub-mechanism of GRI-Mech 3.0. The measured trends in soot distribution in the sprays are predicted well although there are significant differences in actual soot volume fractions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel, as a substitute for diesel has been getting the attention of researchers/scientists of all over the world. The R & D has indicated that up to B20, there is no need of modification and little work is available related to suitability and sustainability of biodiesel production from Jatropha and algae as non-edible oil sources. The objective of the present study was to optimize the process parameters for transesterification of low free fatty acid (FFA) Jatropha and algae oil blend. A low temperature transesterification process was selected to make the transesterification process more energy efficient. A model was developed to correlate the biodiesel yield with process parameters viz methanol/oil volumetric ratio, Catalyst concentration and reaction time. A biodiesel yield of 81.98% was achieved with methanol/oil volumetric ratio (3:5) using KOH as catalyst (0.9% w/w) in 180 min time at 50 °C temperature. It was observed that catalyst concentration, reaction time and methanol/oil volumetric ratio had a significant effect on blend yield. It is found out that this model can be used in the industry to improve the efficiency of biodiesel production from blend of Jatropha and algae oil thereby, saving time and cost of the process in optimizing the process parameters. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Diethyl carbonate (DEC CAS 105-58-8) is a bio-derived fuel and can be easily mixed with commercial diesel fuel. Burning velocities of DEC/air mixtures were determined at 1-3 atm and equivalence ratios (0.7:1-1.4:1) keeping the temperature of the fresh gas at 393 K. A detailed chemical kinetic reaction model consisting of 354 species and 1958 reactions was tested. For flame modeling a shorter kinetic scheme where low-temperature chemistry was removed gave a good representation of laminar DEC/air burning velocities. Under jet-stirred reactor conditions the molecular decomposition of the fuel is the main DEC consumption pathway whereas under premixed flames conditions metathesis reactions between the fuel and mostly H but also OH radicals dominated in the early region of the flame front where reactions with O-atoms played a less important role.

AB  - Tetrahydrofuran and its alkylated derivatives of the cyclic ether family are promising future biofuels because of their advantages over other biofuels e.g. ethanol. The reaction of tetrahydrofuran with OH radicals was studied at 800-1340 K and near 1.5 bar. The reaction can proceed via either direct or indirect abstraction pathways in an overall exothermic process. The indirect channel proceeded via an addition-elimination mechanism in which all the stationary points along the reaction pathway were below the energy of the reactants. The THF + OH (R1) reaction proceeded via either direct or indirect H-abstraction from various sites leading to the formation of tetrahydrofuran-2-yl (THF-R2) or tetrahydrofuran-3-yl (THF-R3) radicals and water. Theoretical kinetic analysis revealed that both channels are important under conditions relevant to combustion.

AB  - The aim of the present work was to study the applicability of rotating packed bed (RPB) for biodiesel through the biocatalytic method. In this research, the RPB facilitated a more homogeneous mixture of substrates due to its higher mass transfer efficiency and better micromixing environment. This was superior to the traditional continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system. Candida sp. 99-125 lipase was used without any organic solvent or additive, and demonstrated a significant catalyst efficiency. The key factors, such as the high gravity factor (β), pattern of the catalyst and methanol-FFA molar ratio etc. were investigated. Under the optimal conditions, the hydrolysis yield of fatty acids was 97.0% after 24 h and the esterification yield of biodiesel was 96.0% 6 h later. The esterifying yield didn't have an obvious decline in the fifth batch. Consequently, the RPB is an attractive and effective reactor for enzymatic synthesis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The combustion of a naphthenic cut fitting typical chemical composition of biomass or coal liquefaction products and a naphthenic cut/GtL was studied under the same conditions. In the experiments the temperature was varied stepwise between 550 and 1150 K. For simulating the kinetics of oxidation of these fuels model-fuels were designed to fit fuels chemical composition and properties. They consisted of mixtures of n-decane 2-methylheptane 3-methylheptane n-propylcyclohexane decahydronaphtalene and tetrahydronaphtalene. Modeling showed that the fuel components were mostly consumed via reactions with OH radicals (84% for propylcy- clohexane 87% for decane 80% for decahydron- aphtalene 85% for tetrahydronaphtalene 80% for 2-methylheptane and 80% for 3-methylheptane). The second most important consumption pathways involved the HO2 radical (3.4% for propylcyclohexane 6% for decane 11% for decahydronaphtalene 5.5% for tetrahydronaph- talene 9.3% for 2-methylheptane and 9.3% for 3-methylheptane).

AB  - This research paper aims at investigating the performance, emission and combustion characters of diesel engine with 20% volume concentrations of animal fat based biodiesel (AFO20), waste cooking oil biodiesel (WCO20), camphor oil (CMO20) and also including pure diesel fuel (D100). The peak cylinder pressure and heat release rate of biodiesel was about 4.82% higher and 13.49% lower than those of diesel fuel on average respectively. Start of combustion of alternate blends happened at earlier crank angles compared to base fuel. Combustion duration of all alternate fuel blends is higher than those of diesel at all load conditions. While fuelling CMO20, AFO20 and WCO20, the NOx concentration in the emission shows 7.52%, 10.352% and 16.405% increment respectively with the biodiesel addition to diesel. However, significant reduction in NOx of about 43.8% was observed for camphor oil - diesel blend when compared to other biodiesel blends. The correlation between NOx emission level and in-cylinder temperature was premeditated by a novel procedure using thermal imager. The result shows that the increase in in-cylinder temperature contributed to the augmentation in NOx concentration. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper focused on the removal of free fatty acids from the ester phase. Transesterification was stopped by neutralization of the catalyst (KOH) by phosphoric acid addition to the reaction mixture. The advantages of this method are a very fast separation, an ester phase that does not contain potassium ions and free glycerol, and a relatively high purity of the glycerol phase. The disadvantage is the formation of free fatty acids, which were removed by the addition of calcium hydroxide, a reaction that formed solid calcium soaps that were removed by centrifugation. The conditions of removal (independent variables), such as the acid number of the input ester phase, molar ratio of calcium to FFAs and addition of water, were studied. The relations between independent and dependent variables (acid number, amount of calcium ions and water in the ester phase) are described. The model allowed for the calculation of conditions, so that the biodiesel fulfilled EN14214: a molar ratio of calcium to FFAs of 3.33:1, the addition of 1.45 μl water to 1 g of the ester phase and a reaction time of 3 h. This preparation of methyl ester is nearly without waste and does not use water for purification. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This report presents a method for producing large quantities of biodiesel from waste cooking oil (WCO). Preliminary studies on optimization of the WCO transesterification process in a continuous-flow microwave reactor are carried out using commercial SrO as a catalyst. The SrO catalyst can be separated and reused for five reaction cycles without loss in activity. Challenges like mass flow and pressure drop constraints need to be surmounted. SrO nanoparticles deposited on millimeter-sized (3–6 mm) silica beads (41 wt% SrO/SiO2) are prepared and evaluated as a substitute for the SrO catalyst. A WCO conversion value to biodiesel as high as 99.2 wt% was achieved with the reactor packed with 15 g of 41 wt% SrO/SiO2 catalyst in 8.2 min with 820 mL of feed. Excellent performance of the fixed-bed catalyst without loss in activity for a lifetime of 24.6 min converting a feed of 2.46 L to FAME was observed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In situ catalytic fast pyrolysis can be used to produce partially upgraded bio-oils. This process, however, suffers from rapid catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation, which necessitates the use of continuous catalyst regeneration. This can be achieved by using a circulating fluidized-bed reactor. In such a reactor, one key operational variable is the catalyst-to-biomass (C/B) ratio, which influences the extent of the catalytic reactions that take place. In this study, woody biomass is pyrolyzed in a pilot-scale circulating fluidized-bed reactor system using a HZSM-5 zeolite with varying C/B ratios. The C/B ratio influences the overall product distribution, the elemental distribution, and the characteristics of the liquid products. An increase of the C/B ratio enhances the conversion of pyrolysis vapors but this does not result in a continuous improvement in bio-oil quality. The C/B ratio is, nevertheless, a factor that can be used to optimize the catalytic fast pyrolysis process. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of bio-oil derived from white oak wood using non-sulfided catalysts was studied in a two zone continuous flow trickle bed reactor system. The major organic components of the pyrolysis oil were pyrolytic lignin (large phenolic polymers), xylose, levoglucosan, organic acids (primarily acetic acid), and hydroxyacetaldehyde. The first zone was a low temperature zone (130 °C) that contained a Ru/C catalyst. In this zone, carbonyl groups were hydrogenated, producing propylene glycol (from hydroxyacetone), ethylene glycol (from hydroxyacetaldehyde), and sorbitol (from levoglucosan). A more severe hydrotreatment was performed in a second zone containing a bifunctional Pt/ZrP catalyst at a temperature between 300 and 400 °C. In the two-stage HDO, an organic phase was produced that consisted of a distribution of hydrocarbons that were primarily cyclic alkanes (naphthenes) ranging from C7 to C24. The organic phase carbon yield decreased with increasing reaction temperature in the second zone. Catalyst deactivation and reactor plugging by coking occurred under all reaction conditions after 55–72 h time on stream (TOS). After ≈55 h TOS, more than 25 % of the carbon in the original bio-oil was accumulated as coke, with increasing amounts for higher temperatures in the second zone. Hydrotreatment gave rise to &gt;C5 hydrocarbon (gasoline and distillate-range fuel) overall yields between ≈30 and 47 carbon % for all experiments compared to the 79.5 % theoretical yield calculated for the bio-oil feedstock. Coke formation and undesired cracking to C1–C4 hydrocarbon gases were the main causes of lower fuel carbon yields. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - In situ transesterification of oleaginous yeast wet biomass for fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) production using acid catalyst, methanol with or without N-Lauroyl sarcosine (N-LS) treatment was performed. The maximum FAMEs yield obtained with or without N-LS treatment in 24 h reaction time was 96.1 ± 1.9 and 71 ± 1.4% w/w, respectively. The N-LS treatment of biomass followed by with or without ultrasonication revealed maximum FAMEs yield of 94.3 ± 1.9% and 82.9 ± 1.8% w/w using methanol to lipid molar ratio 360:1 and catalyst concentration 360 mM (64 μL H2SO4/g lipid) within 5 and 25 min reaction time, respectively. The FAMEs composition obtained in in situ transesterification was similar to that obtained with conventional two step lipid extraction and transesterification process. Biodiesel fuel properties (density, kinematic viscosity, cetane number and total glycerol) were in accordance with international standard (ASTM D6751), which suggests the suitability of biodiesel as a fuel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of biodiesel has rapid development in the recent years due to the benefits associated with its ability to minimize environmental pollution. Heterogeneous catalyst for production of biodiesel is a preferred route for its easier recovery and no demand for aqueous treatment. Transesterification of fatty acids into biodiesel using transition metal oxide gives higher conversion into their corresponding methyl esters in a short time. In the present work, manganese doped zinc oxide is used as a heterogeneous catalyst for the production of biodiesel from Mahua oil. The synthesized manganese doped zinc oxide nanocatalyst was characterized by XRD and SEM. The SEM and XRD results confirmed the hexagonal structure of the catalyst with the particle size of 24.18 nm. The 8% (w/v) catalyst concentration, 1:7% (v/v) of oil to methanol ratio, 50 min of reaction time and 50 °C of reaction temperature were found to be the optimum process condition for the maximum biodiesel yield of 97%. The presence of methyl esters in biodiesel was confirmed by FT-IR and GC-MS analysis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recently, there is increasing interest in using butanol as a renewable component not only for gasoline but also for diesel fuels. This work investigates the effect of its concentration on diesel and biodiesel blends on the autoignition time, comparatively to equivalent blends with ethanol, in a constant-volume combustion chamber. The increase of alcohol content in diesel or biodiesel, led to an increase in autoignition times. Such increase was not linear but sharper for high alcohol contents, and was higher with ethanol than with butanol. For butanol blends, the increase in delay time was very similar when diesel or biodiesel were used. The maximum pressure during combustion decreases as the alcohol content was increased, especially in the case of ethanol, as a consequence of energy, chemical and dilution effects. However, for low ethanol or butanol concentrations, some increases in the pressure peaks were observed by a combination of compensating effects: increase in the amount of premixed combustion and increase in the flame speed. For 10% v/v alcohol blends in diesel or biodiesel, the delay times decreased as both the initial pressure and the initial temperature were increased, the latter effect being slightly higher with biodiesel compared to diesel. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - This paper assesses the potential changes in the demand for forest-based biomass for various energy purposes in Sweden in 2030 and 2050, respectively. The assessment is based on a review of scenarios and predictions of how the Swedish energy system may develop, taking into account techno-economical conditions. It includes potential changes in district heating, electricity production in combined heat and power plants, industrial process energy, and production of biofuel for road transportation. In addition, the potential demand for forest-based feedstock in the chemical and petrochemical sector, replacing current use of fossil feedstock, is analysed. The assessment suggests that Sweden may see an additional demand for forest fuels at about 30 TW h in 2030 and 35–40 TW h in 2050. This can be compared with the current use of biomass for energy in Sweden at 130 TW h per year, and the estimated potential increase of sustainable harvest of logging residues (slash and stumps) at some additional 20 TW h per year, based on current conditions. If also potential demand for forest-based feedstock in the chemical and petrochemical industry is included, another 10–15 and 25–30 TW h of biomass per year may be needed in 2030 and 2050, respectively. The future demand is sensitive to the pace and magnitude of energy efficiency improvements and electrification in the various sectors. If far-reaching energy efficiency improvements and electrification are realised, the total additional demand for biomass as energy and industry feedstock may be about 20 and 30 TW h per year in 2030 and 2050, respectively, thus roughly corresponding to the sustainable harvests of logging residues. If, however, efficiency improvements and electrification are only marginal, then the additional demand for biomass as industry and energy feedstock may reach 70 TW h and 100 TW h per year in 2030 and 2050, respectively. In these cases, the use of logging residues will not suffice and additional biomass would be needed. A combination of regulations and incentives is recommended to accelerate the fuel and feedstock switch, especially in the transportation and industrial sectors, and incentives promoting a substantial improvement in energy efficiency and electrification in all sectors. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, the catalytic performance of bimetallic NiW modified ZSM-5 catalysts for hydrocracking conversion of crude palm oil is presented. Crystalline ZSM-5 zeolites with precisely controlled SiO2/Al2O3 ratios (SARs) of 30, 50, 70 and 100 were successfully synthesized from kaolin via the hydrothermal method. To enhance their catalytic activity, as-prepared zeolites were modified with Ni, W and NiW by the impregnation technique. The catalysts were characterized by various techniques. The total amount of Ni and W in the catalysts was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy technique and found to be in the range of 3.08–3.16 and 5.88–6.39 wt%, respectively. These NiW-ZSM-5 catalysts showed good activity for the production of biofuels, and their catalytic activity decreased in the order NiW-ZSM-5 &gt; Ni-ZSM-5 &gt; W-ZSM-5 &gt; ZSM-5. The incorporation of NiW improved the production of both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation hydrocarbon compounds. Moreover, the different SARs in ZSM-5 zeolite also affected the catalytic activity and NiW-ZSM-5 with SAR of 50 gave an excellent conversion (96.20%). Additionally, the types of the obtained hydrocarbon products were identified as gasoline (C5–C10), kerosene (C9–C11) and diesel (C10–C20) by simulated distillation gas chromatography-flame ionization detector and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. © 2016 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This article explores whether old, incumbent industries can prevent new, green industries from emerging by studying the rise and fall of the Norwegian advanced biofuel sector. It investigates three competing explanations that have been proposed to account for why Norway failed to develop a vibrant industry within this field: (i) the petroleum industry acquired all available risk capital, (ii) the petroleum industry captured all relevant technological expertise and (iii) the government failed to provide adequate incentives and support measures. The article applies a qualitative event-history analysis to chart the development of the most important Norwegian advanced biofuel companies – Borregaard (bioethanol), Cambi (biogas), Weyland (bioethanol) and Xynergo (biodiesel) – and uses their success and eventual failure as a key indicator of the condition of the emerging technological innovation system within this field. The article finds that the advanced biofuel companies were hampered mostly by inconsistent and unpredictable government incentives, and concludes that the third explanation best accounts for Norway's limited success in advanced biofuels. © 2016 The Author(s)

AB  - The advent of biodiesel, as a viable alternative to replace crude-based diesel as transport fuel, has prompted growing interest worldwide due to the need for low-emission fuels. In this work, two reactive distillation processes using soybean oil as main feedstock along with the corresponding downstream separation units are simulated: the first process involves a homogeneous alkali catalyst; whereas the second involves a heterogeneous catalyst. Both processes yield a high purity biodiesel product. In the present work, ASPEN Plus v8.4 is used as the process simulation tool. The energy requirements of both processes were evaluated based on the optimization of the distillation column duties and performing heat integration on the process streams. The optimization of the column duties was performed by analyzing the Column Grand Composite Curves (CGCC). The process streams were heat integrated, and a Heat Exchanger Network (HEN) was designed to minimize utility consumption. Both processes were compared using profitability indicators such as Return-On-Investment (ROI), payback period and unit production cost. The results show that the heterogeneous-catalyzed process is more profitable than the alkali-catalyzed process for biodiesel production. The ROI, payback period and unit production cost were 486%, 0.2 years and $0.712 per kg of biodiesel respectively. For the analysis, an annual production capacity of 35.4 kilotonnes/year of biodiesel production was assumed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa L.) is gaining interest as a productive alternative oilseed crop for biofuels, bioproducts, and healthy food-use applications. Developing sound agronomic practices for its production is key to optimizing its seed oil yield potential. Plant stand establishment of camelina has been problematic in some environments, which may be related to its small seed size and current recommendation for shallow sowing. Shallow sowing can diminish seed to soil contact and expose seeds to large soil temperature and moisture fluctuations, which greatly affect germination and seedling emergence. A study was conducted in 2011 and 2012 on a Barnes loam soil in western Minnesota to examine the effects of sowing spring camelina at soil depths of 1, 2, and 4 cm at sowing rates of 2, 3, and 6 kg ha−1. Seedling emergence increased with sowing rate, but averaged across depths it had no effect on seed yield. Seedling emergence between the 1 and 2 cm sowing depths did not differ in 2012, while stands were reduced by an average of 29% at the 2 cm depth in 2011, but seed yields did not differ between the two sowing depths in either year. However, averaged across sowing rates, sowing at 4 cm led to a 64% stand reduction and a significant 22% loss of yield compared with the 1 and 2 cm depths. Neither sowing depth nor rate affected seed oil content or harvest index. Results show that camelina has exceptional yield compensation capacity at low plant densities and can be sown deeper than commonly recommended (i.e., ≤1.0 cm) without compromising yield in the northern Corn Belt. Sowing to a depth of 2 cm may be beneficial for certain soils prone to large temperature and moisture fluctuations. © 2016

AB  - The spray combustion characteristics of rapeseed biodiesel/methyl esters (RME) and 50% RME/diesel blend were investigated and compared with conventional diesel fuel, using a model swirl flame burner. The detailed database with well-characterised boundary conditions can be used as validation targets for flame modelling. An airblast, swirl-atomized liquid fuel spray was surrounded by air preheated to 350 °C at atmospheric pressure. The reacting droplet distribution within the flame was determined using phase Doppler particle anemometry. For both diesel and RME, peak droplet concentrations are found on the outside of the flame region, with large droplets migrating to the outside via swirl, and smaller droplets located around the centreline region. However, droplet concentrations and sizes are larger for RME, indicating a longer droplet evaporation timescale. This delayed droplet vaporisation leads to a different reaction zone relative to diesel, with an extended core reaction. In spite of the longer reaction zone, RME flames displayed no sign of visible soot radiation, unlike the case of diesel spray flame. Blending 50% RME with diesel results in significant reduction in soot radiation. Finally, RME emits 22% on average lower NOx emissions compared to diesel under lean burning conditions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper presents the production, characterization and possible utilization of a bio-oil obtained from Mahua oilseed, which is potentially available in India. Pyrolysis was carried out between 450 °C and 600 °C under semi-batch type reactor for the production of Mahua pyrolysis oil (MPO). The yield of the MPO was found to be about 50% at an optimum temperature of 525 °C. The MPO was also characterized for its suitability of using it as an alternative fuel for internal combustion engines. The combustion, performance, and emission behavior of the diesel engine operated with the different MPO-diesel blends were assessed and compared with those of diesel operation at different loads. The results indicated that the engine thermal efficiency was dropped by about 2% for MPO-diesel operation from no load to full load operation in comparison to diesel. As the MPO-diesel blend ratio increases, the NO emission decreases from 4.5 to 2.8%, and the smoke emission increased from 10 to 75% from no load to full load respectively. From the obtained results, it is suggested that the 30% MPO blend can be considered as a potential candidate to be used as a fuel in compression ignition engines. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Characterizing abnormal combustion behavior of different fuels is of significant importance to explore the highest fuel economy and to improve the power density of modern spark ignited (SI) engines. Many experimental and numerical investigations have been reported in the literature for conventional pump fuels, whereas scientific findings for biofuels and gasoline-biofuel blends are less available. In the present study, special focus is set on the correlation of experimental investigations and corresponding auto-ignition theories. Therefore, the auto-ignition characteristics of biofuels and gasoline–biofuel mixtures for two different abnormal combustion phenomena (hot spot surface-ignition and gas phase auto-ignition under typical engine knock conditions) are studied using a direct injection spark ignition (DI–SI) single cylinder research engine featuring variable charge motion and a compression ratio of 11. The obtained results for all tested fuels are benchmarked against investigations using conventional E0RON95 fuel and isooctane as reference fuels. Additionally, kinetic investigations are performed to confirm the experimental results combined with auto-ignition theories. It could be shown via engine experiments with a controlled hot surface that the hot spot surface-ignition tendency is influenced by the chemical heat release rate of the fuel and the charge cooling effect due to the stoichiometric air requirement related heat of vaporization. Due to the increased enthalpy of vaporization with the applied (engine) configuration all gasoline–biofuel mixtures improve the hot spot surface-ignition propensity compared to the reference fuel EORON95 by 20–50 K. The gas phase auto-ignition propensity decreases substantially with increasing ethanol content, revealing a boost pressure increase of at least 40–60 % under conditions typically relevant for knocking combustion in the end gas. For the applied configuration and with direct fuel injection, the location of auto-ignition has the highest frequency near the spark plug for all investigated fuels. Often, the most critical point for auto-ignition is the center electrode or the gas space in its immediate proximity between the ceramic insulator and thread. © 2016

AB  - Algae are organisms that grow in marine environments and use carbon dioxide and light to create bio-mass. There are two groupings of algae: microalgae and macroalgae. Macroalgae are the large, multi-cellular algae often seen growing in ponds. Microalgae, on the other hand, are tiny, unicellular algae that normally grow in suspension within a body of water. Algae oil from microalgae has the possible to become a sustainable fuel source as biodiesel. Microalgae are produced through photosynthesis by utilizing sunlight, water, carbon dioxide and other nutrients. The Botryococcus braunii algal oil was extracted by mechanical extraction method. The transesterification reaction of Botryococcus braunii algal oil with methanol and base catalyst was used for the production of biodiesel. The samples B20 were prepared for each methyl ester obtained from Botryococcus braunii algal oil separately and then the doping of TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles were added to the each B20 blend samples at a dosage of 50 ppm and 100 ppm with an aid of ultrasonicator. Moreover, in the absence of any engine modifications, the performance and emission characteristics of those blend samples have been investigated from the experimentally measured values such as density, viscosity, calorific value, etc. while the engine performance was also analyzed through the parameters like BSFC, BTH, exhaust emission of CO, HC, NOx and CO2. The experimental results reveal that the use of biodiesel blend with nano additives in diesel engine has exhibited good improvement in performance characteristic and reduction in exhaust emissions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study uses life cycle assessment to quantify and compare the greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel depletion impacts of a theoretical mallee jet fuel value chain, operating in the Great Southern region of Western Australia, with those of fossil-based jet fuel. Relative to fossil-based jet fuel, the mallee jet fuel was found to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% and result in a net fossil fuel depletion benefit. Further greenhouse gas reductions could be achieved by optimizing the supply chain through measures such as capturing methane emissions for hydrogen production and utilizing co-produced biodiesel. The magnitudes of the environmental benefits are sensitive to a number of methodology assumptions, including the approach to potential food displacement and co-production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The policies concerning waste cooking oil-to-energy supply chains are urgently needed in China. This is because, in practice, there is a real risk of raw material supply being interrupted. Given that the various participating entities are often unable to accurately estimate either their own revenue stream or costs, or the actions of other stakeholders, this paper builds an evolutionary game to model three parties including the government, biofuel enterprises and restaurants under the assumptions of incomplete information and bounded entity rationality, and investigates supply chain policy options. Results indicate that the strategy choices of the various parties (dominance, treatment and participation) are merely in equilibrium for the time being. In the long run, however, there will be one of two equilibrium states: either all three players withdraw from supply chain operation or biofuel enterprises and restaurants eventually take an active part in reverse supply chain management without government intervention. To attain this long-term goal, governments should eliminate the garbage disposal fees levied on restaurants, while, at the same time, increase quantity-based subsidies to biofuel enterprises. Cracking down on restaurants that privately sell waste cooking oil to illegal peddlers should be regarded as a long-term task. Therefore, in either equilibrium state, restaurants should always be the focus of attention. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Promoting the adoption of low-carbon technologies in the transportation fuel portfolio is an effective strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector worldwide. However, as one of the most promising low-carbon fuels, cellulosic biofuel has not fully entered commercial production. Governments could provide guidance in developing cellulosic biofuel technologies, but no systematic approach has been proposed yet. We establish a dynamic programming framework for investigating time-dependent and adaptive decision-making processes to develop advanced fuel technologies. The learning-by-doing effect inherited in the technology development process is included in the framework. The proposed framework is applied in a case study to explore the most economical pathway for California to develop a solid cellulosic biofuel industry under its Low Carbon Fuel Standard. Our results show that cellulosic biofuel technology is playing a critical role in guaranteeing California's 10% greenhouse gas emission reduction by 2020. Three to four billion gallons of cumulative production are needed to ensure that cellulosic biofuel is cost-competitive with petroleum-based fuels or conventional biofuels. Zero emission vehicle promoting policies will discourage the development of cellulosic biofuel. The proposed framework, with small adjustments, can also be applied to study new technology development in other energy sectors. © 2016

AB  - Emissions from sugarcane burning are known to impact on the respiratory health of sugar estate workers and local populations. Despite this, there have been few studies on occupational and ambient exposures and risks from airborne particulate matter (PM) associated with field burning and ash re-suspension. From workplace monitoring on sugarcane estates in two different South American countries in 2010 and 2011, median concentrations of airborne PM10 (particulate matter nominally &lt;10 μm in diameter) were found to be statistically much higher during pre-harvest sugarcane burning (1807 μg m−3) than during either sugarcane cutting after burning (∼123 μg m−3) or in the sugarcane processing factory (∼175 μg m−3). Median PM10 measurements in ambient scenarios, for example in the sugarcane fields before the burning or during 24 h measurements in neighboring villages (bordering the sugarcane plantation), were much lower, between 18 and 37 μg m−3. From the analysis of size-selective samples of airborne PM10, collected during sugarcane field burning, cutting and ambient periods, almost all (∼96 wt %) fell within the ‘respirable’ fraction (&lt;4 μm aerodynamic diameter), with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of 1.1 μm. Residual ash from field and bagasse burning, characterised using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with X-ray elemental analysis, was found to contain carbonaceous and silicate-dominated particles in the PM0.5 and PM0.5-2.5 size ranges and fibres from &lt;10 to over 50 μm in length. Only a small proportion of the field burning ash (average 0.6 vol %) and bagasse ash (average 1.3 vol %) was in the respirable fraction. However, from grinding experiments, which simulate disaggregation as a result of disturbance during harvest or bagasse ash removal, the ash was fragile and easily broken down into thoracic particulate (&lt;10 μm aerodynamic diameter) and, in some instances, created respirable-sized PM. From exposure calculations, the 8 h time weighted average (TWA) concentrations of PM10, during the different measurement scenarios, were found to be below occupational exposure limits (OELs; 5000 μg m−3 for respirable PM). Ambient PM10 exposure of residents surrounding the sugarcane plantations was found to be below the WHO air quality guideline (50 μg m−3 as a 24 h mean). The relative risk calculated for ‘all cause’ mortality from exposure of nearby residents to PM10 generated by sugarcane burning was found to be 3%. The concentrations of PM10 produced during the processing of sugarcane were high (up to 21.5 mg m−3), which is concerning given that re-suspended particles of ash in the fields and processing plant have been previously shown to contain potentially toxic cristobalite. PM produced during sugarcane burning, and during extended periods of local exposure to the smoke and re-suspended ash, therefore, should be considered as both a potential acute and chronic respiratory health hazard. This issue will become increasingly important with the forecasted rise in sugarcane production for biofuels. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - A number of studies have demonstrated that biodiesel is a more environmentally sustainable fuel than petroleum-derived fuels since it is a renewable source of energy and it allows to reduce undesired exhaust emissions (e.g. unburned HC, CO and particulate matter). However, specialized literature highlights there is still the need to further investigate performance, emissions and NVH characteristics of engines equipped with up-to-date technologies fueled with biodiesel blend. The aim of the present paper is to investigate the vibro-acoustic behavior of a small displacement engine, mainly employed in micro-cars, fueled with blends of distilled biodiesel (obtained from used cooking oil) and ultra low sulfur diesel fuel up to 40% by volume. Demands for reducing chemical and noise pollutions, traffic congestion and parking difficulties in urban areas make the micro-cars one of the possible solutions for the future urban environment, especially if the engine is fueled with biodiesel blends for their potential of reducing the pollutant emissions. An original methodology developed by the authors for in-cylinder pressure characterization via non-intrusive measurements is here applied to evaluate the impact of biodiesel content on the combustion process and therefore on engine vibration and noise emissions. The data processing in frequency domain allowed to extract the components mainly related to the combustion events. Concerning vibration signals: for all blends, the vibration amplitudes increases with the increase of engine speed values; B40 is characterized by highest values of RMS of accelerometer signal almost in the complete engine operative field. RMS values obtained for B10 are the lowest ones in most of the investigated engine operative conditions. Concerning noise radiation: the Noise Index was used to evaluate the components of the emission where the combustion energy demonstrated to be concentrated. The results show an increase of Noise Index for all blends with the increase of engine speed. B10 is characterized by the highest values in most of the testes conditions. B40 values demonstrated the opposite behavior. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Irradiating a flame by microwave radiation is one of several plasma-assisted combustion (PAC) technologies that can be used to modify the combustion chemical kinetics in order to improve flame-stability and to delay lean blow-out. One practical implication is that engines may be able to operate with leaner fuel mixtures and have an improved fuel flexibility capability including biofuels. In addition, this technology may assist in reducing thermoacoustic instabilities that may severely damage the engine and increase emission production. To examine microwave-assisted combustion a combined experimental and computational study of microwave-assisted combustion is performed for a lean, turbulent, swirl-stabilized, stratified flame at atmospheric conditions. The objectives are to demonstrate that the technology increases both the laminar and turbulent flame speeds, and modifies the chemical kinetics, enhancing the flame-stability at lean mixtures. The study combines experimental investigations using hydroxyl (OH) and formaldehyde (CH2O) Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) and numerical simulations using finite rate chemistry Large Eddy Simulations (LES). The reaction mechanism is based on a methane (CH4)-air skeletal mechanism expanded with sub-mechanisms for ozone, singlet oxygen, chemionization, electron impact dissociation, ionization and attachment. The experimental and computational results show similar trends, and are used to demonstrate and explain some significant aspects of microwave-enhanced combustion. Both simulation and experimental studies are performed close to lean blow off conditions. In the simulations, the flame is gradually subjected to increasing reduced electric field strengths, resulting in a wider flame that stabilizes nearer to the burner nozzle. Experiments are performed at two equivalence ratios, where the leaner case absorbs up to more than 5% of the total flame power. Data from experiments reveal trends similar to simulated results with increased microwave absorption. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pentanol is considered as one of the most promising alternative biofuels due to its excellent physicochemical properties. The objective of this work was to compare the ignition and combustion characteristics of different n-pentanol/diesel blends in an optical constant volume combustion chamber. The tested fuels included 20% (D80P20) and 40% (D60P40) of n-pentanol blended with diesel in volume, and pure diesel (D100). Broadband chemiluminescence technique was used to measure the timing and location of spray ignition. A high-speed CCD camera with two ND8 dimmer lenses was used to capture the incandescence radiated from the soot particles during combustion. A wide range of experimental conditions was investigated. The ambient temperature ranged from 800 K to 1200 K and the oxygen concentration ranging from 10% to 21%, covering both the conventional and low temperature combustion regimes. The results show that pure diesel has shorter ignition delay and distance comparing to pentanol blends. A larger blending proportion of pentanol D60P40 advances the ignition phase more than the D80P20 in low oxygen concentration conditions. Due to the fuel-borne oxygen and the dilution effect, the natural flame luminosity is reduced significantly with the increase of pentanol ratio in most conditions except under the intermediate temperature region of 1000 K. In that condition, the shorter ignition delay and flame lift-off length of pentanol blends cause a slightly increase in the natural flame luminosity. The natural flame luminosity images showed that the oxygen-contained structure of pentanol could accelerate soot oxidation under all conditions. This indicates that pentanol blends could decrease final soot emissions in internal combustion engines. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - By 2020, the EU aims to have 10% of the transport fuel of every EU countries come from renewable sources such as biofuels. Fuel suppliers are also required to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the EU fuel mix by 6% in comparison to 2010. The thermophysical properties of biofuels are, therefore, required for the efficient design of every step in their production, distribution, and utilization. Despite of these needs, high pressure thermodynamical characterization of biofuels is not still exhaustive. Next generation injection systems work with pressure up to 300 MPa, but available measurements are limited to 200 MPa. Measurements extrapolation generally are not recommended at these pressure because it can hide freezing phenomena here documented at temperature of (20 and 30) °C. In this work, density and viscosity of pure and blended FAME (SME and RME) biofuels have been measured up to 300 MPa. Since the scope of the work is both to investigate cold start conditions found in engines and the thermal behaviour of fuels in tanks of cars, petrol station and dispenser, the temperature interval is limited to (0–60) °C. In particular, it has been observed a partial freezing even for temperature up to 30 °C. Density and viscosity values were obtained by direct experimental measurements, while heat capacities have been calculated using density and speed of sound results previously obtained. At ambient pressure conditions, the uncertainty in density measurements was between 0.005% and 0.01% (k=2) and for viscosity measurements the uncertainty was between 0.2% and 1.3% (k=2). At elevated pressures the uncertainty in density measurements was 0.08% (k=2), while for viscosity and heat capacity it was 2% (k=2). © 2016

AB  - Spo0A is a master regulator that governs the metabolic shift of solventogenic Clostridium species such as Clostridium beijerinckii. Its disruption can thus potentially cause a significant alteration of cellular physiology as well as metabolic patterns. To investigate the specific effect of spo0A disruption in C. beijerinckii, a spo0A mutant of C. beijerinckii was characterized in this study. In a batch fermentation with pH control at 6.5, the spo0A mutant accumulated butyrate and butanol up to 8.96 g/L and 3.32 g/L, respectively from 60 g/L glucose. Noticing the unique phenotype of the spo0A mutant accumulating both butyrate and butanol at significant concentrations, we decided to use the spo0A mutant for the production of butyl butyrate that can be formed by the condensation of butyrate and butanol during the ABE fermentation in the presence of the enzyme lipase. Butyl butyrate is a value-added chemical that has numerous uses in the food and fragrance industry. Moreover, butyl butyrate as a biofuel is compatible with Jet A-1 aviation kerosene and used for biodiesel enrichment. In an initial trial of small-scale extractive batch fermentation using hexadecane as the extractant with supplementation of lipase CalB, the spo0A mutant was subjected to acid crash due to the butyrate accumulation, and thus produced only 98 mg/L butyl butyrate. To alleviate the butyrate toxicity, the biphasic medium was supplemented with 10 g/L CaCO3 and 5 g/L butanol. The butyl butyrate production was then increased up to 2.73 g/L in the hexadecane layer. When continuous agitation was performed to enhance the esterification and extraction of butyl butyrate, 3.32 g/L butyl butyrate was obtained in the hexadecane layer. In this study, we successfully demonstrated the use of the C. beijerinckii spo0A mutant for the butyl butyrate production through the simultaneous ABE fermentation, condensation, and extraction.

AB  - Diethyl ether (DEE) and its isomer n-butanol are both considered as promising fuel additives or neat biofuels. While some effects of their addition to hydrocarbon fuels under engine conditions have been reported, fundamental studies that aim at understanding the joint reaction pathways of such fuel mixtures remain quite scarce. Here, we have chosen n-butane as a well-studied hydrocarbon base fuel, and we have added these oxygenated isomers individually under identical conditions in premixed low-pressure flames. Different combustion behavior of the respective alkane-biofuel mixtures must then be related to the fuel structure. Analyses were performed in five fuel-rich flames including flames of n-butane, DEE, and n-butanol as well as two flames of n-butane doped with 50% DEE or 50% n-butanol. In this series, the carbon-to-oxygen ratio, argon dilution, pressure, and gas velocity were kept constant. More than 40 species in the range of C0–C8 were identified and quantified in each flame by electron ionization (EI) molecular-beam mass spectrometry (MBMS) coupled with gas chromatography (GC). The experiments were partially complemented by tunable synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet (SVUV) photoionization (PI)-MBMS. To assist in the interpretation of the data, a kinetic model was established by combining different sub-mechanisms for these fuels available in the literature. As expected, the formation of toxic carbonyls, such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, increased significantly upon addition of both oxygenated fuels to n-butane. Blending n-butane with DEE noticeably reduces the formation of soot precursors, because primary reactions of DEE mainly release C1–C2 hydrocarbon species to the system. n-Butanol addition, however, shows no significant reduction effects or even higher formation of soot precursors. These trends were observed both in the experiments and model predictions, and the higher ability of n-butanol to form soot precursors compared to DEE indeed results mainly from the differences in the fuel structure. © 2016 The Combustion Institute

AB  - We studied erucic acid accumulation in the biodiesel feedstock Pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) as a first step towards the development of a sustainable strategy for biofuel production in the EU territory. To that end, two inbred Pennycress lines of European origin, “NASC” and “French,” were cultivated in a controlled chamber and in experimental field plots, and their growth, seed production and seed oil characteristics analyzed. Differences in some agronomical traits like vernalization (winter-French versus spring-NASC), flowering time (delayed in the French line) and seed production (higher in the French line) were detected. Both lines showed a high amount (35–39%) of erucic acid (22:1Δ13) in their seed oil. Biochemical characterization of the Pennycress seed oil indicated that TAG was the major reservoir of 22:1Δ13. Incorporation of 22:1Δ13 to TAG occurred very early during seed maturation, concomitant with a decrease of desaturase activity. This change in the acyl fluxes towards elongation was controlled by different genes at different levels. TaFAE1 gene, encoding the fatty acid elongase, seemed to be controlled at the transcriptional level with high expression at the early stages of seed development. On the contrary, the TaFAD2 gene that encodes the Δ12 fatty acid desaturase or TaDGAT1 that catalyzes TAG biosynthesis were controlled post-transcriptionally. TaWRI1, the master regulator of seed-oil biosynthesis, showed also high expression at the early stages of seed development. Our data identified genes and processes that might improve the biotechnological manipulation of Pennycress seeds for high-quality biodiesel production. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - With growing global energy demands, recovering energy from waste plastic presents an attractive avenue to explore as it promotes recycling. Oil synthesized from waste plastic can be excellent fuel for diesel engines but yields higher carcinogenic smoke emissions and poor performance than fossil diesel (D). This study demonstrates the extraction and characterization of waste plastic oil (WPO) obtained by pyrolysis in a laboratory scale batch reactor and later sets out to investigate the effects of adding a renewable oxygenated component in the form of n-butanol (B), a naturally occurring biofuel. Three ternary blends, D50-WPO40-B10, D50-WPO30-B20 and D50-WCO20-B30 were strategically prepared to utilize both a recycled component (WPO by up to 40%) and a renewable component (n-butanol by up to 30%). The performance and emissions of DI diesel engine when fueled with these blends was then analyzed in comparison with both neat WPO and diesel operation. Results indicated that n-butanol addition presented lower smoke emissions and higher HC emissions when compared to diesel. Addition of 10% n-butanol by vol. to WPO/ULSD blend reduced NOx emissions favorably when compared to both WPO and diesel. However NOx emissions were higher than the corresponding WPO case for higher volume n-butanol blends. Brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of the engine increased with increasing n-butanol fraction in the blends when compared to WPO. Fuel consumption of ternary blends was found to be better than WPO. D50-WPO40-B10 blend presented less NOx and smoke emissions with improvement in engine performance when compared to diesel. Study revealed that n-butanol could be a viable additive for diesel engines operating with WPO extracted from mixed waste plastic. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The biodiesel production from non-edible oils has high potential as renewable and ecological fuel. Few researches have been conducted to date on the production of biodiesel from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) seed oil. The aim of this study was to optimize the biodiesel production from this crude oil by non-catalytic supercritical methanolysis using response surface methodology (RSM). Triglyceride conversion, total and individual FAME yield, monoglyceride and diglyceride yield, and thermal decomposition degree of biodiesel were determined in the temperature and reaction time ranges of 250–350 °C (12–43 MPa) and 15–90 min, respectively, at a fixed methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 43:1. According to the RSM, the optimal conditions were 303.4 °C and 90 min, reaching a predicted maximum FAME yield of 91.1 ± 3.2 mol%. This maximum was very close to that obtained experimentally (92.8 ± 2.1 mol%) at 300 °C and 90 min. Decomposition of biodiesel became evident at 325 °C and 60 min of reaction due to the thermal instability of unsaturated methyl esters (methyl linoleate and oleate). The biodiesel obtained in the best experimental reaction conditions (300 °C and 90 min), where no thermal decomposition of FAMEs was observed, contained most of the byproduct glycerol generated, which was degraded and incorporated to the product. This biodiesel basically failed to meet the content of FAMEs as required by the standard EN 14214, the content of monoglycerides and total glycerol, and the acid value, being a little above the required upper limits. However, this biodiesel can be blended with other biodiesels of complementary features to produce a biofuel meeting the requirements of the standard EN 14214. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Algal biofuels have caught worldwide attention, due to the success of first and second generation biofuels on combing environmental concerns in spite of many challenges. Microalgae are the potential and sustainable fuel source with carbon neutrality, where selection of promising strain is crucial for effective biofuel generation. Euglena sanguinea one such robust freshwater species with high lipid productivity was explored on laboratory scale as well as in mass scale in raceway pond. The extracted oil's fatty acid value was only 3.8 mg KOH g−1 and had 93% triglycerides. Acid value was reduced to ∼0.3 mg KOH g−1 by esterification and the optimized parameters obtained were: methanol/oil ratio: 0.36, H2SO4: 10 vol.%, time: 42 min. In the subsequent transesterification process natural, recoverable and eco-friendly white mussel shell was used. Maximum yield of ∼98% was obtained at 6 wt.% of calcinated CaO for the reaction time of 80 min at 0.35 methanol/oil ratio. The GC-MS analysis of the algal biodiesel showed the presence of saturated fatty acids: C16:0, C18:0, C22:0, C24:0 and monounsaturated fatty acids C18:1 at appropriate level to provide better oxidation stability and combustion properties to use it for automotive application without any major engine modifications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the USA, approximately 6 million tons of nitrogen and 1 million tons of phosphorus are being produced as a waste stream from the dairy operations. The main aim of this research was to estimate the potential of algal biofuel production, using waste nutrients present in the dairy waste, as well as performing a life cycle assessment to estimate the energy requirement of produced algal biofuel. Four different scenarios for algal biofuel production were simulated using different combinations of the following processes (i) algal-biodiesel-production, (ii) anaerobic-digestion (AD), (iii) pyrolysis and (iv) enzymatic-hydrolysis. Scenario 1 consists of AD and algal biodiesel production. Introduction of pyrolysis in the second scenario decreased biofuel production by ∼6% in the initial cycle and gradually increased to 25% in the later cycles. In the third scenario, biomass liquefaction through enzymatic hydrolysis was introduced to recover nutrients and sugars from the sludge generated from the AD process. Recovered nutrients and sugars were used for additional algal biodiesel production. Remaining sludge after the biomass liquefaction was applied on the agricultural land. As compared to the 1st scenario, further processing of the sludge through liquefaction increased the overall bioenergy production marginally. In the fourth scenario, biomass left after liquefaction was further processed through pyrolysis. In the fourth scenario, a 38% increase in the energy production was observed versus the 1st scenario. Additional energy production (compared to 1st scenario) through pyrolysis (Scenario 2) required additional 1.5 GJ of energy per GJ of energy produced and showed little variability. Additional energy production through the 3rd and the 4th scenario is not energetically favorable as compared to the 1st scenario. With respect to the 3rd scenario, energetically favorable additional energy can only be produced by the 4th scenario. Life-cycle energy-demand of the produced biofuel was varied from 0.35 to 0.68 GJ/GJ of energy produced. This study estimated that using dairy waste at a maximum of 3.14 billion GJ bioenergy could be produced. © 2016 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - An economic biomass supply chain model for Maine was developed to estimate the delivered cost of biomass chips using the stumpage price paid to the landowner, the cost of harvesting and chipping the logging residues, and the cost of transporting the biomass chips to a biorefinery for biofuel production. Harvesting costs were estimated using Maine-specific productivity equations, harvesting assumptions, and hourly costs, but the resulting model is applicable to any region with woody biomass. Transportation costs were estimated using round trip distance to the potential biorefinery. The delivered cost of biomass was estimated for multiple scenarios, including different machine cost rates, variables impacting machine productivity, transport distance, and stand characteristics. When biomass was treated as a waste product (only chipping costs included), the estimated delivered biomass cost was $11/green tonne (GT) (with a sensitivity analysis range of $4 to $24/GT), less than half the current biomass chip price in Maine ($28/GT). When a portion of the harvesting cost was included in the delivered biomass cost, the estimated delivered biomass cost increased three-fold to $30/GT (with a range of $8-$82/GT). The results of this analysis will serve as a portion of an integrated sustainability assessment for a new biofuel pathway. This model can be easily adapted to other geographical regions with different site-specific inputs. © 2016

AB  - This study investigates the consumer responses toward fuel from second-generation, nature-inspired lignocellulose processing systems. Data was collected via in-person consumer surveys across in three major U.S. cities with two different information treatments. A dichotomous-choice contingent valuation methodology is utilized to estimate consumers' willingness to pay for this product and analyze factors that affect consumer choice. The results suggest that the average respondent was willing to pay an 11% premium for second-generation nature-inspired bioethanol compared to conventional fuel. The willingness to pay was the highest in Portland, Oregon (17%), followed by Minneapolis (9%) and then Boston (8%). Driving distance was found to have a negative effect on consumer willingness to pay. Consumers who purchase more organic foods were more willing to pay a premium for the product. Risk attitude had heterogeneous effects in different locations. The effect of information regarding the second-generation, nature-inspired lignocellulose process was found to be significantly positive. © 2016

AB  - Fuels made from lignocellulosic biomass categorized as second-generation biofuels have attracted considerable attention because lignocellu lose is likely not a human food. Reaction rate coefficients for the thermal unimolecular decomposition of ethyl levulinate were measured at 1015-1325 K and 750-1650 torr. Ab initio calculations revealed that C2H4 elimination from ethyl levulinate occured via a concerted six-center retroene reaction. Data exhibited no discernible pressure dependence under the current experimental conditions.

AB  - Biodiesel is a promising alternative fuel for compression ignition (CI) engine, but the nitrogen oxide (NOx) liability associated with it is a major challenge. NOx emissions are affected by both engine technology and fuel properties. Experimental studies were conducted on an unmodified heavy-duty direct injection diesel engine to analyze the effect of fuel properties such as cetane number (CN), oxygen content, fuel density, and engine operating variables (speed and load) on NOx emissions. Test results revealed that NOx concentration is directly proportional to engine load and to biodiesel percentage in blends, and is inversely related to engine speed. Fuel-bound oxygen in the blended fuels are mainly responsible for the higher NOx. An empirical correlation was developed to predict NOx concentration as a function of CN, oxygen content, fuel density, speed, and load. Experimental and predicted values of NOx emission concentrations for two blends, BA25 and BA50 (25% and 50% microalgae biodiesel blended with diesel), at 2205 rpm and 100% load are 723.19 and 722.94 ppm, and 749.89 and 791.12 ppm, respectively. The developed correlation will be useful in estimating the NOx emissions of a CI engine fueled with various other oxygenated biofuels at different speeds and loads. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 36: 214–221, 2017. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog

AB  - The oxidation behavior of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF) a novel second-generation biofuel was investigated. Specifically ignition delay time measurements in two different combustion reactors e.g. rapid compression machine and high-pressure shock tube were performed. Measurements for 2-MTHF/oxidizer/diluent mixtures were performed at 639 K - 1413 K at 10 20 and 40 bar and at three different equivalence ratios of 0.5 1.0 and 2.0. A detailed chemical kinetic model describing both low-and high-temperature chemistry of 2-MTHF was developed and validated against new ignition delay measurements and already existing flame species profiles and ignition delay measurements. The mechanism provides satisfactory agreement with the experimental data. Reaction path and sensitivity analyses were carried out to identify key reactions at various combustion conditions and to attain a better understanding of the combustion behavior.

AB  - Exploring new renewable energy sources as a substitute of petroleum reserves is necessary due to fulfilling the oncoming energy needs for industry and transportation systems. In this quest, a lot of research is going on to expose different kinds of new biodiesel sources. The non-edible oil from candlenut possesses the potential as a feedstock for biodiesel production. The present study aims to produce biodiesel from crude candlenut oil by using two-step transesterification process, and 10%, 20%, and 30% of biodiesel were mixed with diesel fuel as test blends for engine testing. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and gas chromatography (GC) were performed and analyzed to characterize the biodiesel. Also, the fuel properties of biodiesel and its blends were measured and compared with the specified standards. The thermal stability of the fuel blends was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scan calorimetry (DSC) analysis. Engine characteristics were measured in a Yanmar TF120M single cylinder direct injection (DI) diesel engine. Biodiesel produced from candlenut oil contained 15% free fatty acid (FFA), and two-step esterification and transesterification were used. FTIR and GC remarked the biodiesels’ existing functional groups and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) composition. The thermal analysis of the biodiesel blends certified about the blends’ stability regarding thermal degradation, melting and crystallization temperature, oxidative temperature, and storage stability. The brake power (BP), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of the biodiesel blends decreased slightly with an increasing pattern of nitric oxide (NO) emission. However, the hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxides (CO) of biodiesel blends were found decreased. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Two new formulations of non-noble metal based diesel oxidation catalysts based on Co[sbnd]Ce based mixed oxide (DOC2) and perovskite catalysts (DOC3) were prepared and retrofitted in a 4-cylinder diesel engine fueled by diesel and Karanja biodiesel blend (KB20). In this study, their effectiveness in reducing raw exhaust particulate emissions vis-à-vis a commercial diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC1) was evaluated. Emission characteristics such as particle number-size distribution, mass-size distribution, and surface area-size distribution, total particle number concentration and count mean diameter as a function of engine load at constant engine speed were evaluated. Variations in total particle number concentration as a function of engine speed were also determined. The prepared DOCs and the commercial DOC showed varying degrees of performance as a function of engine operating conditions. Overall, effectiveness of the prepared DOC's appeared to be more fuel specific. For diesel exhaust, overall performance of DOC1 was more effective compared to both prepared DOCs, with DOC2 being superior to DOC3. In case of KB20 exhaust, the overall performance of DOC2 was either more effective or nearly comparable to DOC1, while DOC3 being not so effective. This showed that the DOCs based on Co[sbnd]Ce based mixed oxide catalysts have potential to replace commercial noble metal based DOC's, especially in engines fueled by biodiesel. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A successful pilot-scale process for biodiesel production from microbial oil (Biooil) produced by Rhodosporidium toruloides DEBB 5533 is presented. Using fed-batch strategy (1000 L working volume), a lipid productivity of 0.44 g/L.h was obtained using a low-cost medium composed by sugarcane juice and urea. The microbial oil was used for biodiesel production and its performance was evaluated in diesel engine tests, showing very good performance, especially for the blend B20 SCO, when operating at 2500 rpm with lower pollutant emissions (CO2 – 220% less; CO – 7-fold less; NOX 50% less and no detectable HC emissions (&lt;0.11 ppm)) when compared with the blends of standard biofuel from soybean oil. A preliminary analysis showed that microbial biodiesel is economically competitive (US$ 0.76/L) when compared to the vegetable biodiesel (US$ 0.81/L). Besides, the yield of biodiesel from microbial oil is higher (4172 L/ha of cultivated sugarcane) that represents 6.3-fold the yield of standard biodiesel (661 L/ha of cultivated soybean). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Partially sulfonated polystyrene (PSS), synthesized from expanded polystyrene waste (EPS), was used as a catalyst for free fatty acid (FFA) conversion in non-edible oils. Acidic and water absorbing properties of the PSS facilitated the catalytic action for the FFA conversion by esterification reaction. The reaction was done on simulated acid oil (WCO) containing oleic acid and sunflower oil, and rubber seed oil (RSO). Effects of temperature, catalyst amount and alcohol to acid molar ratio were studied. FFA conversion increased with each of these factors. The advantage of this heterogeneous catalyst is that it is efficient as commercial ion exchange resin and easily removable from the reaction mixture. PSS is found to substantially reduce the acid value of WCO and RSO from 17 to 3.2 mg KOH/g and from 28.8 to 4.8 mg KOH/g respectively at 75°C. The WCO and RSO with reduced acid value may be used as a feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrocarbons are the main components of diesel oil and are toxic for the majority of plants. A few plant species, known as phytoremediators, are tolerant of hydrocarbons and can survive the stressful conditions of soils contaminated with diesel oil. Canavalia ensiformis, a plant species that is well distributed throughout the tropics, possesses advantageous features for a potential resistance to soil contamination, such as fast growth and a deep root system. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the tolerance of C. ensiformis when it was exposed to soil contaminated with diesel oil. Seedlings were subjected to two treatments: contaminated soil (CS) (95 ml/kg of diesel oil) and non-contaminated soil (NCS) for a period of 30 days; its growth, morphology, anatomy, and physiology were analyzed. Despite the high level of toxicity, some individuals were able to survive in CS. These plants had root apical meristems with high levels of mitosis and were able to issue new roots with more developed aerenchyma tissue. Because the surviving plants presented no marks of cellular damage on the organs formed (root and leaves) during the experiment, the species capacity of growth on CS was confirmed. Although, long-term field experiments, applying different contaminant concentrations, should be considered to infer about the species resistance and use as phytoremediator. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In this work, correlations between the physicochemical parameters (density and kinematic viscosity) and the composition of various samples, obtained during the biodiesel production process of methylic and ethylic soybean biodiesel, were investigated. The results point out that the composition of the medium in terms of remaining catalyst and its residues, alcohol and water content, among others variables, has no significant influence on the physicochemical properties studied. These findings are mainly influenced by the composition of the medium in terms of FAAE, TAG, DAG and MAG. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work reports the use of eucalyptus pulp as an adsorbent for metal removal from biodiesel. Fatty acid methyl esters produced from sunflower oil (SfMB) and recycled used cooking oil (RMB), which contained Fe, Mn, and Cu, were treated through filtration on a column filled with the cellulosic adsorbent, and washed with deionized water for comparison. The treatment with cellulose material resulted in the removal of 13–81%, 35–84%, and 40–74% of Fe, Mn, and Cu in biodiesels, while the water washing removed 4–40%, 10–47%, and 4–19%, respectively. In addition to the higher efficiency, the use of cellulose is a more environmentally friendly process than the purification with water, once the latter results in a considerable volume of effluent requiring treatment prior to disposal, besides the high consumption of water. Moreover, the regeneration of the cellulosic adsorbent is demonstrated. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The world demand for fuel as energy sources have arisen the need for generating alternatives such as biofuel. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel used particularly in diesel engines. Currently, biodiesel is mainly produced through transesterification reactions catalyzed by chemical catalysts, which produces higher fatty acid alkyl esters in shorter reaction time. Although extensive investigations on enzymatic transesterification by downstream processing were carried out, enzymatic transesterification has yet to be used in scale-up since commercial lipases are chiefly limited to the cost as well as long reaction time. While numerous lipases were studied and proven to have the high catalytic capacity, still enzymatic reaction requires more investigation. To fill this gap, finding optimal conditions for the reaction such as alcohol and oil choice, water content, reaction time and temperature through proper reaction modelling and simulations as well as the appropriate design and use of reactors for large scale production are crucial issues that need to be accurately addressed. Furthermore, lipase concentration, alternative lipase resources through whole cell technology and genetic engineering, recent immobilizing materials including nanoparticles, and the capacity of enzyme to be reused are important criteria to be neatly investigated. The present work reviews the current biodiesel feedstock, catalysis, general and novel immobilizing materials, bioreactors for enzymatic transesterification, potential lipase resources, intensification technics, and process modelling for enzymatic transesterification. © 2016

AB  - In this research work, liquid bio-fuels and activated carbons were produced from one non-edible feedstock, fish waste. First, the fish oil was extracted from fish waste and transesterified with methanol and ethanol to produce methylic and ethylic biodiesels, respectively using potassium hydroxide as base catalyst. The fuel properties of the obtained biodiesels met the specifications stipulated by ASTM D 6751. Therefore, waste fish oil can be utilized as a potential non-edible feedstock for biodiesel production. The de-oiled fish was pyrolyzed in a laboratory scale fixed bed reactor to produce bio-oil and bio-char. The influence of the pyrolysis temperature, pyrolysis time and particle size of the precursor on the bio-oil yield was investigated. The maximum bio-oil yield of 57.13% w/w was produced at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C, 60 min pyrolysis time and particle size of 0.25 mm. The chemical composition of the bio-oil was studied using the elemental analysis, column chromatography, FTIR spectroscopy and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The physical and chemical properties of the bio-fuel obtained were determined and found close to those of bio-oils published in literature. It was concluded that de-oiled fish waste bio-oil can be potentially utilized as a fuel and chemical feedstock. The bio-char obtained as a result of the pyrolysis of de-oiled fish waste at 500 °C was used in the preparation of the activated carbon via steam activation method. The influence of the activation temperature, activation time and particles size on the yield, iodine adsorption number and surface area of the produced activated carbons were investigated. The optimal conditions which gave the best activated carbon sample were 500 °C activation temperature, 60 min activation time and 60 mesh particle size. The produced activated carbon was also analyzed for its morphology using scanning electron microscope, which indicated that the produced activated carbon has various pore size distribution. © 2016

AB  - The combustion kinetics of three bio jet fuel compounds farnesane, p-menthane and p-cymene, derived from natural terpenoids, have been investigated experimentally by an atmospheric high temperature flow reactor coupled with molecular beam mass spectrometric detection (MBMS). Quantitative speciation data for their oxidation chemistry in combustion is presented to provide an insight into the combustion behavior and provide detailed validation data for kinetic modeling. The experimental results are compared and discussed to analyze distinct combustion phenomena such as fuel consumption pathways and soot precursor chemistry. The fuel selection focuses on biotechnologically producible terpenoid components, namely the isoalkane 2,6,10-trimethyl dodecane (farnesane), the cycloalkane 1-isopropyl-4-methylcyclohexane (p-menthane) and the branched aromatic compound 1-isopropyl-4-methylbenzene (p-cymene). Literature data on farnesane (recently approved with up to 10% blending in Jet A-1) is limited and even scarcer for the two potential synthetic fuel additive species, p-menthane and p-cymene. The comprehensive, systematic experimental speciation data set including the single fuel components for lean to rich stoichiometries (0.5–1.5) is available in the supplemental material to this contribution. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We propose a multi-period mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for the design and operational planning of cellulosic biofuel supply chains. Specifically, the proposed MILP model accounts for biomass selection and allocation, technology selection and capacity planning at regional depots and biorefineries. Importantly, it considers the location of regional depots and biorefineries as continuous optimization decisions. We introduce approximation and reformulation methods for the calculation of the shipments and transportation distance in order to obtain a linear model. We illustrate the applicability of the proposed methods using two medium-scale examples with realistic data. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd
